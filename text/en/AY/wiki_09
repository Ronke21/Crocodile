<text>[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 7810 &quot;Identification cards — Physical characteristics&quot; is an international standard that defines the physical characteristics for identification cards.

The characteristics specified include:
* Physical dimensions
* Resistance to bending, chemicals, temperature, and humidity
* Toxicity

The standard includes test methods for resistance to heat.

==Card sizes==

The standard defines four card sizes: ID-1, ID-2, ID-3 and ID-000.

All card sizes have a thickness of , i.e. minimum and maximum .

The standard defines both metric and imperial measurements, noting that:

===ID-1===

The ID-1 format specifies a size of and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88–3.48 mm (about  in). This format is also referred to as &quot;CR-80&quot; and, for travel documents, &quot;TD1&quot;. It is commonly used for payment cards (ATM cards, credit cards, debit cards, etc.). Today it is also used for driving licences and personal identity cards in many countries, automated fare collection system cards for public transport, in retail loyalty cards, and even crew member certificates (particularly for aircrew).

===ID-2===

The ID-2 format is , and travel documents in this format are also referred to as &quot;TD2&quot;. This length and width are those of A7 paper. The ID-2 format is used, for example, for visas. It was previously used for the Romanian, Icelandic, German, French and many other identity cards. As of 2024, all European standard identity cards are issued in the ID-1 format. ID-2 was previously also used for driving licences (including Finnish, Swedish and Icelandic) before those changed to the ID-1 format.

===ID-3===

The ID-3 format is , and travel documents in this format are also referred to as &quot;TD3&quot;. This length and width are those of B7 paper. This format is commonly used for passport booklets.

===ID-000===

ID-000 specifies a size of , with one corner slightly () bevelled. The ID-000 size was first defined by ENV 1375–1, &quot;Identification card systems — Intersector integrated circuit(s) card additional formats — Part 1: ID-000 card size and physical characteristics.&quot;

This size is used for the &quot;mini-SIM&quot; format, the second-generation format of Subscriber Identity Modules.

===ID-000 size card as part of ID-1 size card===
An &quot;informative&quot; (i.e. non-mandatory) annex describes how an ID-000 sized card may be included in an ID-1 size card for processing (e.g. in an ID-1 reader), but with &quot;relief areas around the perimeter of the ID-000 size card to allow it to be removed from the ID-1 size card without punching tools&quot;. An ID-1 size card containing an ID-000 size card is denoted as &quot;ID-1/000&quot;. This was the common design of SIMs when mini-SIMs were common, usually being issued as standard SIMs, i.e. in ID-1 format, with a removable ID-000 section that, when removed, was a mini-SIM.

==Card characteristics==
The standard specifies requirements for such physical characteristics as:
* Bending stiffness
* Toxicity
* Resistance to chemicals
* Card dimensional stability and warpage with temperature and humidity
* Resistance to deterioration from exposure to light and heat
* Durability

==See also==
* ISO/IEC 7811 defines traditional techniques for recording data on ID-1 identification cards, namely embossed characters and several different magnetic recording formats.
* ISO/IEC 7816 defines ID-1 identification cards with an embedded chip (smartcard) and contact surfaces for power, clock, reset and serial-data signals.
* Machine-readable passport (ICAO 9303) defines machine-readable text on ID-1, ID-2, and ID-3 travel documents.
* Magnetic stripe card
* MM Code

<text>ISO/IEC 14443 &quot;Identification cards – Contactless integrated circuit cards – Proximity cards&quot; is an international standard that defines proximity cards used for identification, and the transmission protocols for communicating with it.

==Standard==
The standard is developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1 (Joint Technical Committee 1) / SC 17 (Subcommittee 17) / WG 8 (Working Group 8).

=== Parts ===

* ISO/IEC 14443-1:2018 Part 1: Physical characteristic
* ISO/IEC 14443-2:2020 Part 2: Radio frequency power and signal interface
* ISO/IEC 14443-3:2018 Part 3: Initialization and anticollision
* ISO/IEC 14443-4:2018 Part 4: Transmission protocol

=== Types ===

Cards may be Type A and Type B, both of which communicate via radio at 13.56 MHz (RFID HF). The main differences between these types concern modulation methods, coding schemes (Part 2) and protocol initialization procedures (Part 3). Both Type A and Type B cards use the same transmission protocol (described in Part 4). The transmission protocol specifies data block exchange and related mechanisms:
#data block chaining 
#waiting time extension
#multi-activation

ISO/IEC 14443 uses the following terms for components:
* PCD: proximity coupling device (the card reader)
* PICC: proximity integrated circuit card

=== Modulation methods ===

Type A cards use amplitude-shift keying (ASK) with Modified Miller coding for reader-to-tag communication. For tag-to-reader communication, they use on-off keying (OOK) with Manchester code.

Type B cards use ASK with NRZ coding for reader-to-tag communication and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) with NRZ-L encoding for tag-to-reader communication.

Both Type A and Type B cards only allow half duplex communication with a 106 kbit per second data rate in each direction. Data transmitted by the card is load modulated with a 847.5 kHz subcarrier. (847.5 kHz is one-sixteenth of the 13.56 carrier frequency provided by the reader.

== Physical size ==
Part 1 of the standard specifies that the card shall be compliant with ISO/IEC 7810 or ISO/IEC 15457-1, or &quot;an object of any other dimension&quot;.

==Notable implementations==
*Ventra cards used in bus and trains
*MIFARE cards (partial or full implementation, depending on product)
*Biometric passports
*EMV payment cards (PayPass, Visa payWave, ExpressPay)
*National identity cards in the European Economic Area
*Near Field Communication is based on in part, and is compatible with, ISO/IEC 14443
**Contactless FIDO authenticators use ISO 14443
*Calypso, open security standard for transit fare collection systems
*CIPURSE, open security standard for transit fare collection systems
*Nabaztag:tag uses z:tamp and nano:ztag ISO/IEC 14443 Type B.

<doc id="187884" wikidata="Q340600" url="?curid=187884" title="Achromatic lens">
<text>An achromatic lens or achromat is a lens that is designed to limit the effects of chromatic and spherical aberration. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus on the same plane. Wavelengths in between these two then have better focus error than could be obtained with a simple lens.

The most common type of achromat is the achromatic [[Doublet (lens)|doublet]], which is composed of two individual lenses made from glasses with different amounts of dispersion. Typically, one element is a negative (concave) element made out of flint glass such as F2, which has relatively high dispersion, and the other is a positive (convex) element made of crown glass such as BK7, which has lower dispersion. The lens elements are mounted next to each other, often cemented together, and shaped so that the chromatic aberration of one is counterbalanced by that of the other.

In the most common type (shown), the positive power of the crown lens element is not quite equalled by the negative power of the flint lens element. Together they form a weak positive lens that will bring two different wavelengths of light to a common focus. Negative doublets, in which the negative-power element predominates, are also made.

==History==
Theoretical considerations of the feasibility of correcting chromatic aberration were debated in the 18th century following Newton&#x27;s statement that such a correction was impossible (see History of the telescope). Credit for the invention of the first achromatic doublet is often given to an English barrister and amateur optician named Chester Moore Hall. Hall wished to keep his work on the achromatic lenses a secret and contracted the manufacture of the crown and flint lenses to two different opticians, Edward Scarlett and James Mann. They in turn sub-contracted the work to the same person, George Bass. He realized the two components were for the same client and, after fitting the two parts together, noted the achromatic properties. Hall used the achromatic lens to build the first achromatic telescope, but his invention did not become widely known at the time.

In the late 1750s, Bass mentioned Hall&#x27;s lenses to John Dollond, who understood their potential and was able to reproduce their design. Dollond applied for and was granted a patent on the technology in 1758, which led to bitter fights with other opticians over the right to make and sell achromatic doublets.

Dollond&#x27;s son Peter invented the apochromat, an improvement on the achromat, in 1763.

==Types==
Several different types of achromat have been devised. They differ in the shape of the included lens elements as well as in the optical properties of their glass (most notably in their optical dispersion or Abbe number).

In the following, denotes the radius of the spheres that define the optically relevant refracting lens surfaces. By convention, denotes the first lens surface counted from the object. A doublet lens has four surfaces with radii through . Surfaces with positive radii curve away from the object ( positive is a convex first surface); negative radii curve toward the object ( negative is a concave first surface).

The descriptions of the achromat lens designs mention advantages of designs that do not produce &quot;ghost&quot; images. Historically, this was indeed a driving concern for lens makers up to the 19th century and a primary criterion for early optical designs. However, in the mid 20th century, the development of advanced optical coatings for the most part has eliminated the issue of ghost images, and modern optical designs are preferred for other merits.

===Littrow doublet===
Uses an equiconvex crown glass lens (i.e. with and a complementary-curved second flint glass lens (with The back of the flint glass lens is flat A Littrow doublet can produce a ghost image between and because the lens surfaces of the two lenses have the same radii.

===Fraunhofer doublet (Fraunhofer objective)===
The first lens has positive refractive power, the second negative. is set greater than , and is set close to, but not quite equal to, . is usually greater than . In a Fraunhofer doublet, the dissimilar curvatures of and are mounted close, but not quite in contact. This design yields more degrees of freedom (one more free radius, length of the air space) to correct for optical aberrations.

===Clark doublet===
Early Clark lenses follow the Fraunhofer design. After the late 1860s, they changed to the Littrow design, approximately equiconvex crown, and a flint with and By about 1880, Clark lenses had set slightly shorter than to create a focus mismatch between and , thereby avoiding ghosting caused by reflections within the airspace.

===Oil-spaced doublet===
The use of oil between the crown and flint eliminates the effect of ghosting, particularly where It can also increase light transmission slightly and reduce the impact of errors in and .

===Steinheil doublet===
The Steinheil doublet, devised by Carl August von Steinheil, is a flint-first doublet. In contrast to the Fraunhofer doublet, it has a negative lens first followed by a positive lens. It needs stronger curvature than the Fraunhofer doublet.

===Dialyte===
Dialyte lenses have a wide air space between the two elements. They were originally devised in the 19th century to allow much smaller flint glass elements down stream since flint glass was hard to produce and expensive. They are also lenses where the elements can not be cemented because and have different absolute values.

==Design==
The first-order design of an achromat involves choosing the overall power formula_1 of the doublet and the two glasses to use. The choice of glass gives the mean refractive index, often written as formula_2 (for the refractive index at the Fraunhofer &quot;d&quot; spectral line wavelength), and the Abbe number formula_3 (for the reciprocal of the glass dispersion). To make the linear dispersion of the system zero, the system must satisfy the equations

:formula_4

where the lens power is formula_5 for a lens with focal length formula_6. Solving these two equations for formula_7 and formula_8 gives

:formula_9 and formula_10

Since formula_11 and the Abbe numbers are positive-valued, the power of the second element in the doublet is negative when the first element is positive, and vice versa.

=== Removing other aberrations ===
Optical aberrations other than just color are present in all lenses. For example, &quot;coma&quot; remains after spherical and chromatic aberrations are corrected. In order to correct other aberrations, the front and back curvatures of each of the two lenses remain free parameters, since the color correction design only prescribes the net focal length of each lens, formula_7 and separately formula_13 This leaves a continuum of different combinations of front and back lens curvatures for design tweaks (formula_14 and formula_15 for lens 1; and formula_16 and formula_17 for lens 2) that will all produce the same formula_7 and formula_8 required by the achromat design. Other adjustable lens parameters include the thickness of each lens and the space between the two, all constrained only by the two required focal lengths. Normally, the free parameters are adjusted to minimize non-color-related optical aberrations.

==Further color correction==

Lens designs more complex than achromatic can improve the precision of color images by bringing more wavelengths into exact focus, but require more expensive types of glass, and more careful shaping and spacing of the combination of simple lenses:
; apochromatic lenses: bring &quot;three&quot; wavelengths into a common focus and requires costly materials
; superachromatic lenses: bring &quot;four&quot; wavelengths into focus and must be manufactured with even more expensive fluoride glass and to considerably tighter tolerances
In theory, the process can continue indefinitely: Compound lenses used in cameras typically have six or more simple lenses (e.g. double-Gauss lens); several of those lenses can be made with different types of glass, with slightly altered curvatures, in order to bring more colors into focus. The constraint is extra manufacturing cost, and diminishing returns of improved image for the effort.

<doc id="187886" wikidata="Q44602" url="?curid=187886" title="Fasting">
<text>Fasting is the act of refraining from eating, and sometimes drinking. However, from a purely physiological context, &quot;fasting&quot; may refer to the metabolic status of a person who has not eaten overnight (before &quot;breakfast&quot;), or to the metabolic state achieved after complete digestion and absorption of a meal. Metabolic changes in the fasting state begin after absorption of a meal (typically 3–5 hours after eating).

A &quot;diagnostic fast&quot; refers to prolonged fasting from 1–100 hours (depending on age), conducted under observation, to facilitate the investigation of a health complication (usually hypoglycemia). Many people may also fast as part of a medical procedure or a check-up, such as preceding a colonoscopy or surgery, or before certain medical tests. &quot;Intermittent fasting&quot; is a technique sometimes used for weight loss or other health benefits that incorporates regular fasting into a person&#x27;s dietary schedule. Fasting may also be part of a religious ritual, often associated with specific scheduled fast days, as determined by the religion, or be applied as a public demonstration for a given cause, in a practice known as a &quot;hunger strike&quot;.

== Health effects ==
Alternate-day fasting (alternating between a 24-hour &quot;fast day&quot; when the person eats less than 25% of usual energy needs, followed by a 24-hour non-fasting &quot;feast day&quot; period) has been shown to improve cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers similarly to a calorie restriction diet in people who are overweight, obese or have metabolic syndrome.

A 2021 review found that moderate alternate-day fasting for two to six months was associated with reductions of body weight, body mass index, and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight or obese adults.

=== Medical application ===

Fasting is almost always practiced prior to surgery or other procedures that require general anesthesia because of the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents after induction of anesthesia (i.e., vomiting and inhaling the vomit, causing life-threatening aspiration pneumonia). Additionally, certain medical tests, such as cholesterol testing (lipid panel) or certain blood glucose measurements require fasting for several hours so that a baseline can be established.

=== Mental health ===
In one review, fasting improved alertness, mood, and subjective feelings of well-being, possibly improving overall symptoms of depression, and boosting cognitive performance.

=== Weight loss ===

==== Intermittent fasting ====

There is little evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting for periods shorter than 24 hours is effective for sustained weight loss in obese adults.

==== Prolonged fasting ====

Prolonged fasting (also called extended fasting or water fasting) involves periods of fasting above 24 hours, typically in the range of 5–20 days. In early fasting, the body operates under a relatively high level of gluconeogenesis, though this eventually decreases as the body&#x27;s metabolism switches into ketosis, causing ketones to replace glucose as the primary energy source in the central nervous system. As prolonged fasting continues, drastic decreases in sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other minerals are noted, which can lead to hyponatremia. In some diet systems, these losses are offset with non-caloric electrolyte supplements, such as electrolyte beverages. Typical observed weight loss under prolonged fasting averages at 0.9 kg per day during the first week and 0.3 kg per day by the third week. In early fasting, during periods of high gluconeogenesis, roughly two-thirds of weight lost is lean muscle mass as opposed to fat. After the gluconeogenic phase, however, the ratio of body fat lost to lean tissue lost becomes roughly 7:6.

===Longevity===

There is no sound clinical evidence that fasting can promote longevity in humans.

==Adverse effects==
===Refeeding syndrome===
Refeeding syndrome is a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of reinstitution of nutrition in people and animals who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness. When too much food or liquid nutrition supplement is eaten during the initial four to seven days following a malnutrition event, the production of glycogen, fat and protein in cells may cause low serum concentrations of potassium, magnesium and phosphate. The electrolyte imbalance may cause neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic symptoms—many of which, if severe enough, may result in death.

Refeeding syndrome can occur when someone does not eat for several days at a time usually beginning after 4–5 days with no food.

===Gallstones===
Fasting can increase the risk of developing gallstones for some people. This is thought to occur due to decreased gallbladder movement with no food to be digested, which can cause the bile to become over-concentrated with cholesterol, combined with the liver secreting extra cholesterol into bile as the body metabolizes fat during rapid weight loss, further exacerbating the situation.

== Political application ==
Fasting is often used to make a political statement, to protest, or to bring awareness to a cause. A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke feelings of guilt, or to achieve a goal such as a policy change. A &quot;spiritual fast&quot; incorporates personal spiritual beliefs with the desire to express personal principles, sometimes in the context of social injustice.

The political leader Gandhi undertook several long fasts as political and social protests. Gandhi&#x27;s fasts had a significant impact on the British Raj and the Indian population generally.

In Northern Ireland in 1981, a prisoner, Bobby Sands, was part of the 1981 Irish hunger strike, protesting for better rights in prison. Sands had just been elected to the British Parliament and died after 66 days of not eating. 100,000 people attended his funeral, and the strike ended only after nine other men died. In all, ten men survived without food for 46 to 73 days.

The American civil rights activist César Chávez undertook several spiritual fasts, including a 25-day fast in 1968 promoting the principle of nonviolence and a fast of &#x27;thanksgiving and hope&#x27; to prepare for pre-arranged civil disobedience by farm workers. Chávez regarded a spiritual fast as &quot;a personal spiritual transformation&quot;. Other progressive campaigns have adopted the tactic.

== Religious views ==

Fasting is practiced in various religions, and details of fasting practices differ.

Yom Kippur, Tisha B&#x27;av, Fast of Esther, Tzom Gedalia, the Seventeenth of Tamuz, the Tenth of Tevet, and Fast of the Firstborn are examples of fasting in Judaism. Yom Kippur and Tisha B&#x27;Av are 25-hour fasts in which observers abstain from consuming any food or liquid from sunset until nightfall the next day and include other restrictions. The fasts of Esther, Gedalia, Tamuz, and Tevet all last from dawn until nightfall and therefore length varies depending on the time of the year. The Fast of the Firstborn is not biblically mandated and can therefore be ended early in the case of a seudat mitzvah.

Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan each year. The fast includes refraining from consuming any food or liquid from dawn until sunset. It is a religious obligation for all Muslims unless they are children or are physically unable to fast.

Lent is a common period of fasting in Christianity. Eastern Orthodox Christians fast during specified fasting seasons of the year, which include not only the better-known Great Lent, but also fasts on every Wednesday and Friday (except on special holidays), together with extended fasting periods before Christmas (the Nativity Fast), after Easter (the Apostles&#x27; Fast) and in early August (the Dormition Fast).

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) generally abstain from food and drink for two consecutive meals in a 24-hour period on the first Sunday of each month and use the money they save for charity.

Fasting is a feature of ascetic traditions in religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.

Mahayana traditions that follow the Brahma&#x27;s Net Sutra may recommend that the laity fast &quot;during the six days of fasting each month and the three months of fasting each year&quot;.

Members of the Baháʼí Faith observe a Nineteen Day Fast from sunrise to sunset during March each year.

== In alternative medicine ==

Although practitioners of alternative medicine promote &quot;cleansing the body&quot; through fasting, (as though it were a diagnostic fast) the concept of &quot;detoxification“ is a marketing myth with little scientific basis for its rationale or efficacy.

During the early 20th century, fasting was promoted by alternative health writers such as Hereward Carrington, Edward H. Dewey, Bernarr Macfadden, Frank McCoy, Edward Earle Purinton, Upton Sinclair and Wallace Wattles. All of these writers were either involved in the natural hygiene or new thought movement. Arnold Ehret&#x27;s pseudoscientific Mucusless Diet Healing System espoused fasting.

Linda Hazzard, a notable quack doctor, put her patients on such strict fasts that some of them died of starvation. She was responsible for the death of more than 40 patients under her care.

In 1911, Upton Sinclair authored &quot;The Fasting Cure&quot;, which made sensational claims of fasting curing practically all diseases, including cancer and syphilis. Sinclair states he recommended fasting for all diseases except tuberculosis. Sinclair has been described as &quot;the most credulous of faddists,&quot; and his book is considered an example of quackery. In 1932, physician Morris Fishbein listed fasting as a fad diet and commented that &quot;prolonged fasting is never necessary and invariably does harm&quot;.

<text>The Oberbergischer Kreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Ennepe-Ruhr, Märkischer Kreis, Olpe, Altenkirchen, Rhein-Sieg, Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis, and the urban districts Remscheid and Wuppertal.

==Name==
The district was named after the region known as &quot;Bergisches Land&quot;, which belonged to the County of Berg for most of the medieval era. What is called &quot;Oberbergisch&quot; (&#x27;upper Bergian&#x27;) lies in the southeast of that earldom. By 1740, descriptions of the area distinguished between &quot;Niederbergisch&quot;, which was north of the river Wupper, and &quot;Oberbergisch&quot; to its south.

In 1816, after the entire Rhineland was annexed to Prussia, the districts of Waldbröl, Homburg, Gimborn, Wipperfürth, and Lennep were created within the area now covered by the district. In 1825 the districts Gimborn and Homburg were merged into the district Gummersbach. In 1932 it was merged with the district of Waldbröl, and the region became known as &quot;Oberbergischer Kreis&quot;. The restructuring of 1969/75 created the current boundaries of the district.

==Geography==
The Oberbergischer Kreis covers the hills west of the Sauerland and north of the Westerwald. It constitutes the eastern part of the Bergisches Land nature reserve. Situated at an altitude of 100–520 meters above sea level, it is rich in wood and water (numbering ten artificial lakes) and thus a recreational area for citizens from Cologne, the Ruhr area and the Netherlands.

The prevailing rock is greywacke, which was and in places still is mined in large stone quarries.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is a combination of the heraldic signs of the territories the district belonged to. The red-white bar in the top symbolizes the County of Mark and the lion that of Berg. Homburg Castle (near Nümbrecht) was the seat of the Princes of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.

==Politics==
===Nazi Era===
Robert Ley, a Nazi politician who helped organize the recruitment of slave labor during World War II, and published an anti-Semitic newspaper, the Westdeutscher Beobachter, was born in Niederbreidenbach, a town in Oberbergischer Kreis.

<text>Y Wladfa (, &#x27;The Colony&#x27;), also occasionally Y Wladychfa Gymreig (, &#x27;The Welsh Settlement&#x27;), refers to the establishment of settlements by Welsh colonists and immigrants in the Argentine Patagonia, beginning in 1865, mainly along the coast of the lower Chubut Valley. In 1881, the area became part of the Chubut National Territory of Argentina which, in 1955, became Chubut Province.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Argentine government encouraged emigration from Europe to populate Argentina and south Patagonia particularly, which until the Conquest of the Desert had sparsely rural and coastal settlements.

Between 1856 and 1875, 34 settlements of immigrants of various nationalities were established in Santa Fe and Entre Ríos. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe by 44 Welsh people who left Chubut, and another group settled at Coronel Suárez in southern Buenos Aires Province.

The Welsh-Argentine community is centred on Gaiman, Dolavon, Trelew, and Trevelin. There are 70,000 Welsh-Patagonians. However,
Chubut estimates the number of Patagonian Welsh speakers to be about 1,500, while other estimates put the number at 5,000.

== History ==

===First settlers 1865===


The idea of a Welsh colony in Patagonia was put forward by Michael D. Jones, a Welsh nationalist nonconformist preacher based in Bala, Gwynedd, who had called for a new &quot;little Wales beyond Wales&quot;. He spent some years in the United States, where he observed that Welsh immigrants assimilated very quickly compared with other peoples and often lost much of their Welsh identity. Thus, the original proposal was to establish a new Wales overseas where Welsh settlers and their culture would be generally free from foreign domination. He proposed setting up a Welsh-speaking colony away from the influence of the English language. He recruited settlers and provided financing; Australia, New Zealand and even Palestine were considered, but Patagonia was chosen for its isolation and the Argentines&#x27; offer of of land along the Chubut River in exchange for settling the still-unconquered land of Patagonia for Argentina. Patagonia, including the Chubut Valley, was claimed by Buenos Aires but it had little control over the area (which was also claimed by Chile). Jones had been corresponding with the Argentine government about settling an area known as Bahía Blanca where Welsh immigrants could preserve their language and culture. The Argentine government granted the request as it put them in control of a large tract of land. A Welsh immigration committee met in Liverpool and published a handbook, , to publicize the scheme to form a Welsh colony in Patagonia which was distributed throughout Wales.

Towards the end of 1862, Captain Love Jones-Parry and Lewis Jones (after whom Trelew was named) left for Patagonia to decide whether it was a suitable area for Welsh emigrants. They first visited Buenos Aires where they held discussions with the Interior Minister Guillermo Rawson then, having come to an agreement, headed south. They reached Patagonia in a small ship named the &quot;Candelaria&quot;, and were driven by a storm into a bay which they named &quot;Porth Madryn&quot;, after Jones-Parry&#x27;s estate in Wales. The town that grew near the spot where they landed is now named Puerto Madryn. On their return to Wales they declared the area to be very suitable for colonization.

On 28 July 1865, 153 Welsh settlers arrived aboard tea clipper &quot;Mimosa&quot;. The &quot;Mimosa&quot; settlers, including tailors, cobblers, carpenters, brickmakers, and miners, comprised 56 married adults, 33 single or widowed men, 12 single women (usually sisters or servants of married immigrants), and 52 children; the majority (92) were from the South Wales Coalfield and English urban centres. There were few farmers. This was rather unfortunate, particularly when they discovered that the attractions of the area had been oversold and they had landed in an arid semi-desert with little food; they had been told that the area was like lowland Wales. At the coast there was little drinking water, and the group embarked on a walk across the parched plain with a single wheelbarrow to carry their belongings. Some died and a baby, Mary Humphries, was born on the march. John Williams was the only colonist with any form of rudimentary medical skill. So disheartened were some settlers, they requested that the British Government settle them on the Falkland Islands. However, this request was ignored.

Once they reached the valley of the Chubut River, their first settlement was a small fortress on the site which later became the town of Rawson, now the capital of Chubut Province. This was referred to as (&#x27;The Old Fortress&#x27;). The first houses, constructed from earth, were washed away by a flash flood in 1865, and new houses of superior quality were built to replace them. The floods also washed away crops of potatoes and maize. The rainfall in the area was much less than the colonists had been led to expect, leading to crop failures.

=== Consolidation 1866–1888 ===

The settlers first made contact with the local Tehuelche people almost a year after their arrival. After some difficult early years of suspicion and some violence, the Tehuelche people established cordial relationships with the Welsh and helped the settlement survive the early food shortages. The settlers, led by Aaron Jenkins (whose wife Rachel was the first to bring up the idea of systematic use of irrigation canals), soon established Argentina&#x27;s first irrigation system based on the Chubut River (in Welsh, , &#x27;winding river&#x27;), irrigating an area three or four miles (five or six km) to each side of the long stretch of river and creating Argentina&#x27;s most fertile wheatlands. By 1885, wheat production had reached 6,000 tons, with wheat produced by the colony winning the gold medal at international expositions at Paris and Chicago.

The mouth of the Chubut River was difficult to navigate, being shallow and with shifting sandbanks, and it was decided that a railway was required to connect the Lower Chubut valley to Puerto Madryn (originally Porth Madryn) on the Golfo Nuevo on the southern side of the Valdes Peninsula. Lewis Jones was the driving force, and in 1884 the Argentine Congress authorized the construction of the Central Chubut Railway by Lewis Jones y Cía. Raising funds for the project locally proved difficult, so Lewis Jones went to the United Kingdom to seek funds, where he enlisted the assistance of Asahel P. Bell, an engineer. Work on the railway began in 1886, helped by the arrival of another 465 Welsh settlers on the steamer &quot;Vesta&quot;. The town that grew at the railhead was named &quot;Trelew&quot; (Town of Llew) in honour of Lewis Jones. The town grew rapidly and in 1888 became the headquarters of the (Chubut Trading Company). Initially the settlers were largely self-governing, with all men and women of 18 years of age or over having the right to vote.

In January 1868, the first newspaper of the colony, (&quot;The Chronicle&quot;), appeared; (&quot;Our Privilege&quot;) followed in 1878. Both were short-lived, only six issues of each title being circulated. Lewis Jones established (&quot;The Discussion&quot;) in 1891, and this had greater longevity: a weekly issue was produced until 1961.

=== Expansion towards the Andes 1885–1902 ===

By the mid-1880s most of the good agricultural land in the Lower Chubut valley had been claimed, and the colonists mounted a number of expeditions to explore other parts of Patagonia to seek more cultivable land. In 1885, the Welsh asked the governor of Chubut Province, Luis Jorge Fontana, for permission to arrange an expedition to explore the Andean part of Chubut. Fontana decided to accompany the expedition in person. By the end of November 1885 they had reached a fertile area which the Welsh named (Pleasant Valley). By 1888, this site at the foot of the Andes had become another Welsh settlement, named in Spanish . As the population grew here, the towns of Esquel and Trevelin were founded.

In 1893, a Welsh-language newspaper called &quot;Y Drafod&quot; (The Conversation) was founded by Lewis Jones to promote Welshness in Y Wladfa.

This area became the subject of the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 between Argentina and Chile. Initially the border was defined by a line connecting the highest peaks in the area, but it later became clear that this line was not the same as the line separating the watersheds, with some of the rivers in the area flowing westwards. Argentina and Chile agreed that the United Kingdom should act as arbitrator, and the views of the Welsh settlers were canvassed. In 1902, despite an offer of a league of land per family from Chile, they voted to remain in Argentina.

=== Setbacks in the Lower Chubut Valley 1899–1915 ===

Serious damage was caused by floods in the 1890s and 1900s, which devastated Rawson and to a lesser extent Gaiman, though Trelew was not affected. There was also disagreement between the settlers and the government of Argentina, which introduced conscription and insisted on males of military age drilling on Sundays. This ran counter to the Sabbatarian principles of the settlers and caused much ill-feeling, though the matter was eventually resolved by the intervention of the president of Argentina, Julio Argentino Roca. These factors, and a lack of unclaimed farmable land, caused 234 people to leave for Liverpool aboard the &quot;Orissa&quot; on 14 May 1902, with 208 of them subsequently travelling to Canada, arriving at Saltcoats, Saskatchewan, in late June, although some of these families later returned to Chubut and later migrated to Australia. Some other settlers moved to Río Negro Province in Argentina. Many of those who left Chubut were late arrivals who had failed to obtain land of their own, and they were replaced by more immigrants from Wales. By the end of the 19th century there were some 4,000 people of Welsh descent living in Chubut. The last substantial migration from Wales took place shortly before World War I, which put a halt to further immigration. Approximately 1,000 Welsh immigrants arrived in Patagonia between 1886 and 1911; on the basis of this and other statistics, Glyn Williams estimated that perhaps no more than 2,300 Welsh people ever migrated directly to Patagonia.

===Later development===
Immigration to the area after 1914 was mainly from Italy and other southern European countries. Welsh became a minority language. The creation of a cooperative, the &quot;&quot; (), was important. The Society traded on the settlers&#x27; behalf in Buenos Aires and acted as a bank with 14 branches. The cooperative society collapsed in the Great Depression of the 1930s. The construction of a dam on the Rio Chubut west of Trelew, inaugurated on 19 April 1963, removed the risk of flooding in the Lower Chubut Valley.

The Welsh have left their mark on the landscape, with windmills and chapels across the province, including the distinctive wood and corrugated zinc Capel Salem and Trelew&#x27;s Salon San David. Many settlements along the valley bear Welsh names.

During the British Government&#x27;s repatriation of the 11,313 Argentine POWs taken during the 1982 Falklands War, Welsh-speaking British merchant seamen and British soldiers from the Welsh Guards were shocked to find themselves addressed in Patagonian Welsh by an Argentine POW who was on the way home to Puerto Madryn. Over the years since, close ties between Wales and Y Wladfa have been reestablished.

A 2001 BBC article described in detail the recent visit to Chubut Province by Archdruid and 30 members of the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot; in order to revive the &quot;Gorsedd Y Wladfa&quot; in a ceremony held in a specially constructed stone circle near Gaiman.

Every year, the Eisteddfod festival takes place in the town of Trevelin. BBC reporters attended the 2001 &quot;Eisteddfod del Chubut&quot; at Trelew and watched as the Bardic Chair was awarded for the first time in &quot;Y Wladfa&quot; to a female poet: Gaiman hotel owner Monica Jones de Jones, for an &quot;Awdl&quot; on the subject of &quot;Rhyddid&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;). The article&#x27;s author continued, &quot;The Patagonia Eisteddfod itself, while sharing those elements common to Eisteddfodau in Wales itself, nonetheless is, in other respects, quite a different affair. As well as haunting Welsh folk tunes, and recitations in the unique Spanish-accented Welsh of the Patagonians, there are also rousing displays of Argentine folk dancing which owe everything to the culture of the gauchos and nothing to the somewhat tamer dance routines of the Welsh homeland.&quot;

Current Eisteddfod competitions are bilingual, in both Patagonian Welsh and Argentine Spanish, and include poetry, prose, literary translations (Welsh, Spanish, English, Italian, and French), musical performances, arts, folk dances, photography, and filmmaking among others. The &quot;Eisteddfod de la Juventud&quot; is held every September at Gaiman. The main &quot;Eisteddfod del Chubut&quot; is held every October at Trelew. Other annual eisteddfodau are held at Trevelin, in the Andes and at Puerto Madryn along the South Atlantic coast.

In 2006, the first of a two-Test tour to Argentina by the Wales national rugby union team was played in Puerto Madryn, which was a 27–25 win for Argentina.

In 2019, 1,411 people undertook Welsh courses in the region, which was the highest number on record for the project. During 2023-24, there were over 970 registered learners (schools and adult learners) – a rise from 623 in 2020. 

In 2014, Professor E. Wyn James of Cardiff University estimated that there were perhaps as many as 5,000 people in Patagonia who could speak Welsh.

On 28 July 2015, celebrations took place to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Welsh migrations. The First Minister of Wales,
Carwyn Jones, attended the celebration.

In October 2018, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales undertook an historic visit to Y Wladfa to give two concerts in a newly refurbished concert hall, that had previously been a wool factory on the outskirts of Trelew. These performances attracted thousands of local visitors and helped celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Welsh migration. Welsh harpist Catrin Finch and conductor Grant Llewelyn were part of the concerts.

==Welsh relationship with Indigenous people==
The Welsh settlers to Patagonia settled on indigenous Tehuelche land. The Welsh were able to survive and thrive by bartering Welsh bread for meat, by learning from Tehuelche people how to hunt, and by learning from the Tehuelche how to irrigate their fields with water from the Chubut River.

== Anthem ==

Y Wladfa&#x27;s anthem is a re-working of the Welsh anthem, &quot;, called &quot; (&#x27;&quot;The New Country of the Welsh&quot;&#x27;). The new anthem was penned by Lewis Evans and is sung to the same tune as &quot;&quot;.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Patagonia&quot; is a 2011 film about the Welsh settlement in Argentina.

In the BBC&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Patagonia with Huw Edwards&quot;, Huw Edwards travelled to Patagonia and met with descendants of the original settlers, to discuss what had survived of the uniquely Welsh culture their ancestors aimed to protect.

<doc id="187895" wikidata="Q105237" url="?curid=187895" title="Giacomo Meyerbeer">
<text>Giacomo Meyerbeer (born Jakob Liebmann Meyer Beer; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864) was a German opera composer, &quot;the most frequently performed opera composer during the nineteenth century, linking Mozart and Wagner&quot;. With his 1831 opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot; and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera &#x27;decisive character&#x27;. Meyerbeer&#x27;s grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris Opéra. They set a standard that helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century.

Born to a wealthy Jewish family, Meyerbeer began his musical career as a pianist but soon decided to devote himself to opera, spending several years in Italy studying and composing. His 1824 opera &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; was the first to bring him a Europe-wide reputation, but it was &quot;Robert le diable&quot; (1831) which raised his status to great celebrity. His public career, lasting from then until his death, during which he remained a dominating figure in the world of opera, was summarized by his contemporary Hector Berlioz, who claimed that he &#x27;has not only the luck to be talented, but the talent to be lucky.&#x27; He was at his peak with his operas &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (1836) and &quot;Le prophète&quot; (1849); his last opera (&quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;) was performed posthumously. His operas made him the most frequently performed composer at the world&#x27;s leading opera houses in the nineteenth century.

At the same time as his successes in Paris, Meyerbeer, as a Prussian Court Kapellmeister (Director of Music) from 1832, and from 1843 as Prussian General Music Director, was also influential in opera in Berlin and throughout Germany. He was an early supporter of Richard Wagner, enabling the first production of the latter&#x27;s opera &quot;Rienzi&quot;. He was commissioned to write the patriotic opera &quot;Ein Feldlager in Schlesien&quot; to celebrate the reopening of the Berlin Royal Opera House in 1844, and he wrote music for certain Prussian state occasions.

Apart from around 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little except for the stage. The critical assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after Meyerbeer&#x27;s death, led to a decline in the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer&#x27;s major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.

==Early years==
Meyerbeer&#x27;s birthname was Jacob Liebmann Beer; he was born in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin, then the capital of Prussia, to a Jewish family. His father was the wealthy financier Judah Herz Beer and his mother, Amalia (Malka) Wulff, to whom he was particularly devoted, also came from the moneyed elite. Their other children included the astronomer Wilhelm Beer and the poet Michael Beer. He was to adopt the surname Meyerbeer on the death of his grandfather (1812) and Italianize his first name to Giacomo during his period of study in Italy, around 1817.

Judah Beer was a leader of the Berlin Jewish community and maintained a private synagogue in his house which leaned towards reformist views. Jacob Beer wrote an early cantata for performance at this synagogue. Both Judah Herz Beer and his wife were close to the Prussian court; when Amalia was awarded in 1816 the Order of Louise, she was given, by Royal dispensation, not the traditional Cross but a portrait bust of the Queen. The Beer children were provided with a fine education; their tutors included two of the leaders of the enlightened Jewish intelligentsia, the author Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn and Edmund Kley, (later a reform movement rabbi in Hamburg) to whom they remained attached into their maturity. The brothers Alexander von Humboldt, the renowned naturalist, geographer and explorer, and the philosopher, linguist and diplomat Wilhelm von Humboldt were close friends of the family circle.

Beer&#x27;s first keyboard instructor was Franz Lauska, a pupil of Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and a favoured teacher at the Berlin court. Beer also became one of Muzio Clementi&#x27;s pupils while Clementi was in Berlin. The boy made his public debut in 1801 playing Mozart&#x27;s D minor Piano Concerto in Berlin. The &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; reported: &#x27;The amazing keyboard playing of young Bär (a Jewish lad of 9), who carried off the difficult passages and other solo parts with aplomb, and has fine powers of rendition even more rarely found in one of his age, made the concert even more interesting&#x27;.

Beer, as he still named himself, studied with Antonio Salieri and the German master and friend of Goethe, Carl Friedrich Zelter. Louis Spohr organised a concert for Beer at Berlin in 1804 and continued his acquaintance with the lad later in Vienna and Rome. A portrait of Jacob commissioned by the family at this time shows him &#x27;confidently facing the viewer, his hair romantically dishevelled... his left hand rests on the keyboard, and his right hand grasps a musical manuscript... plac[ing] its subject in the tradition of the young Mozart&#x27;. Beer&#x27;s first stage work, the ballet &quot;Der Fischer und das Milchmädchen (The Fisherman and the Milkmaid)&quot; was produced in March 1810 at the Court Opera in Berlin. His formal training with the Abbé Vogler at Darmstadt between 1810 and 1812 was, however, of crucial importance, and at around this time he begins to sign himself &#x27;Meyer Beer&#x27;. Here, with his fellow students (among whom was Carl Maria von Weber), he learned not only the craft of composition but also the business of music (organising concerts and dealing with publishers). Forming a close friendship with Weber and other pupils, Meyerbeer established the &quot;Harmonischer Verein (Musical Union)&quot;, whose members undertook to support each other with favourable press criticism and networking. On 12 February 1813 Beer received the first of the string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his life when he was appointed &#x27;Court Composer&#x27; by Grand Duke Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was also in close contact with Ludwig van Beethoven as he played timpani at the premiere of his Seventh Symphony in December 1813. Beethoven complained that Meyerbeer was “always behind the beat”. But nonetheless, Beethoven saw musical potential on the young Beer.

Throughout his early career, although determined to become a musician, Beer found it difficult to decide between playing and composition. Certainly, other professionals in the decade 1810–1820, including Moscheles, considered him amongst the greatest virtuosi of his period. He wrote during this period numerous piano pieces, including a concerto and set of variations for piano and orchestra, but these have been lost. To this period also belongs a Clarinet Quintet written for the virtuoso Heinrich Baermann (1784–1847) who remained a close friend of the composer.

==Career==
===In Italy===
Despite performances of his oratorio &quot;Gott und die Natur (God and Nature)&quot; (Berlin, 1811) and his early operas &quot;Jephtas Gelübde (Jephtha&#x27;s Vow)&quot; (Munich, 1812) and &quot;Wirth und Gast (Landlord and Guest)&quot; (Stuttgart, 1813) in Germany, Meyerbeer had set his sights by 1814 on basing an operatic career in Paris. In the same year, his opera &quot;Die beiden Kalifen (The Two Caliphs)&quot;, a version of &quot;Wirth und Gast&quot;, was a disastrous failure in Vienna. Realizing that a full understanding of Italian opera was essential for his musical development, he went to study in Italy, enabled by the financial support of his family. He arrived in Italy at the beginning of 1816, after visits to Paris and London, where he heard Cramer play. In Paris, he wrote to a friend, &#x27;I go from museum to museum, library to library, theatre to theatre, with the restlessness of the Wandering Jew&#x27;.

During his years in Italy Meyerbeer became acquainted with, and impressed by, the works of his contemporary Gioachino Rossini, who by 1816, at the age of 24, was already director of both major opera houses in Naples and in the same year premiered his operas &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;. Meyerbeer wrote a series of Italian operas on Rossinian models, including &quot;Romilda e Costanza&quot; (Padua, 1817), &quot;Semiramide riconosciuta&quot; (Turin, 1819), &quot;Emma di Resburgo&quot; (Venice, 1819), &quot;Margherita d&#x27;Anjou&quot; (Milan, 1820) and &quot;L&#x27;esule di Granata&quot; (Milan, 1821). All but the last two of these had libretti by Gaetano Rossi, whom Meyerbeer continued to support until the latter&#x27;s death in 1855, although not commissioning any further libretti from him after &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; (1824). During a visit to Sicily in 1816, Meyerbeer noted down a number of folksongs, and these in fact constitute the earliest collection of folk music of the region. In a birthday greeting from Rossi&#x27;s wife in 1817 occurs the earliest use discovered of Meyerbeer&#x27;s adopted forename &#x27;Giacomo&#x27;.

===Recognition===
The name Giacomo Meyerbeer first became known internationally with his opera &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot;—premiered in Venice in 1824 and produced in London and Paris in 1825; incidentally, it was the last opera ever written to feature a castrato, and the last to require keyboard accompaniment for recitatives. This &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; in Paris was exactly what Meyerbeer had been aiming for over the past ten years; he had been carefully preparing for it, developing contacts, and fully reaped his reward.

In 1826, shortly after the death of his father, Meyerbeer married his cousin, Minna Mosson (1804–1886). The marriage which may have been &#x27;dynastic&#x27; in its origins turned out to be stable and devoted; the couple were to have five children, of whom the three youngest (all daughters) survived to adulthood. In the same year, following the death of Carl Maria von Weber, Weber&#x27;s widow asked Meyerbeer to complete her husband&#x27;s unfinished comic opera &quot;Die drei Pintos&quot;. This was to cause him much trouble over future years, as he found the material insufficient to work on. Eventually, in 1852 he settled the matter with Weber&#x27;s heirs by handing them Weber&#x27;s drafts and cash compensation. (The opera was later completed by Gustav Mahler).

With his next opera Meyerbeer became virtually a superstar. &quot;Robert le diable&quot; (with libretto by Eugène Scribe and Germain Delavigne), produced in Paris in 1831, was one of the earliest grand operas. The libretto, originally planned in 1827 as a three-act &quot;opéra comique&quot; for the Opéra-Comique theatre, was refashioned after 1829 in a five-act form to meet the requirements of the Paris Opéra. Its revised characterisation as a &#x27;grand opera&#x27; placed it in succession to Auber&#x27;s &quot;La muette de Portici&quot; (1828) and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; (1829) in this new genre. The composer undertook further work on the opera in early 1831 adding ballet episodes, including the &quot;Ballet of Nuns&quot;, which was to prove one of the opera&#x27;s great sensations, becoming an early example of the ballet blanc genre. He also rewrote the two major male roles of Bertrand and Robert to suit the talents of Nicolas Levasseur and Adolphe Nourrit, respectively. At the invitation of Nourrit, Cornélie Falcon made her debut at the age of 18 at the Opéra in the role of Alice on 20 July 1832, and she made a vivid impression on the public, which included on that night Auber, Berlioz, Halévy, Maria Malibran, Giulia Grisi, Honoré Daumier, Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo. On hearing her in the role, Meyerbeer himself declared his opera at last &#x27;complete&#x27;.

The success of the opera led to Meyerbeer himself becoming a celebrity. In January 1832 he was awarded membership of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. This success – coupled with Meyerbeer&#x27;s known family wealth – inevitably also precipitated envy amongst his peers. Berlioz – who had commented that &#x27;Meyerbeer not only had the luck to be talented, he had the talent to be lucky&#x27; – wrote &#x27;I can&#x27;t forget that Meyerbeer was only able to persuade [the Opéra] to put on &quot;Robert le diable&quot; ... by paying the administration sixty thousand francs of his own money&#x27;; and Frédéric Chopin lamented &#x27;Meyerbeer had to work for three years and pay his own expenses for his stay in Paris before &quot;Robert le diable&quot; could be staged...Three years, that&#x27;s a lot – it&#x27;s too much.&#x27; King Frederick William III of Prussia who attended the second performance of &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, swiftly invited him to compose a German opera, and Meyerbeer was invited to stage &quot;Robert&quot; in Berlin. Within a few years the opera had been staged with success all over Europe, and also in the USA.

The fusion of dramatic music, melodramatic plot, and sumptuous staging in &quot;Robert le diable&quot; proved a sure-fire formula, as did the partnership with Scribe, which Meyerbeer would go on to repeat in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, &quot;Le prophète&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;. All of these operas held the international stage throughout the 19th century, as did the more pastoral &quot;Dinorah&quot; (1859), making Meyerbeer the most frequently performed composer at leading opera houses in the nineteenth century.

===Between Paris and Berlin===

====1832–1839====
Letellier describes Meyerbeer&#x27;s mature life as &quot;a tale of two cities...His artistic triumph and legendary status were achieved in Paris...but he never abandoned Prussia, especially his home city of Berlin&quot;. His wife Minna was based in Berlin (she did not enjoy Paris) as was his beloved mother; and he had a series of Royal duties from the Prussian court, stemming from his appointment as Court &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in 1832. For these reasons his life from 1830 onwards is characterised by travel between these two centres.

In Paris Meyerbeer had been asked by Louis Véron, the director of the Opéra, for a new work. At first, he attempted to persuade Véron to accept the opéra-comique &quot;Le portefaix&quot; to a libretto by Scribe, which he had been contracted to compose in early 1831; but Véron insisted on a full five-act piece. Together with Scribe, Meyerbeer reviewed many subjects before deciding, in 1832, on &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. The contract which Meyerbeer signed with Véron contained a penalty clause if the work was not delivered by the end of 1833. When the time came and the opera was not ready, Véron claimed his 30,000 francs under this clause; Meyerbeer was perhaps unique amongst composers in being able to pay this. In fact, Véron refunded the money under a further agreement, when the opera was delivered in late 1834; but Veron himself was replaced as director of the Opera by Henri Duponchel before &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was premiered on 29 February 1836. It was an immediate and immense success, its splendid staging and effects exceeding even those of Fromental Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;, which had premiered the previous year. Berlioz called the score &quot;a musical encyclopaedia&quot;, and the singing, especially of Nourrit and Falcon, was universally praised. &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was the first opera to be performed at the Opéra more than 1,000 times (the 1,000th performance being on 16 May 1906) and continued to be produced up to 1936, more than a century after its premiere. Its many performances in all other of the world&#x27;s major opera houses give it a claim to being the most successful opera of the 19th century.

However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, including the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; and director of the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of &quot;Robert le diable&quot; (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer&#x27;s music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented the production of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; in Berlin (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) &#x27;years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics&#x27;, refused to be drawn on any of these matters.

Meanwhile, in Paris Meyerbeer began to seek new libretti, initially considering &quot;Le prophète&quot; by Scribe, and &quot;Le cinq mars&quot; by Henri Saint-Georges and eventually settling on Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; (later to become &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;), which he contracted to complete by 1840. However, Meyerbeer had envisaged that the main role in &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; would be written for Falcon; after the catastrophic failure of her voice in 1837, he turned instead to &quot;Le prophète&quot;.

On 20 August 1839, Meyerbeer, whilst relaxing at Boulogne in the company of Moscheles, met for the first time with Richard Wagner, who was en route to Paris. Their ensuing relationship (see below) was to have major repercussions for the careers and reputations of both. At this meeting Wagner read to Meyerbeer from the libretto of &quot;Rienzi&quot;, and Meyerbeer agreed to look through the score, which indeed he subsequently recommended for performance at Dresden.

====The 1840s====
By the end of 1841, Meyerbeer had completed the first draft of &quot;Le prophète&quot;, but refused to stage it because the then director of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to cast his mistress, Rosine Stoltz, in the part of Fidès, the hero&#x27;s mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as &#x27;la Directrice du Directeur&#x27;). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. Only in 1849 was the Opéra willing to agree to his conditions. Meyerbeer was unique in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.

In the meantime, the situation in Prussia was changing. Following the death of Frederick William III, the new regime of Frederick William IV was far more liberal. Spontini was dismissed, and the Berlin premiere of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was arranged (20 May 1842). On the instigation of Alexander von Humboldt, Meyerbeer was installed later in the year as Prussian &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; and director of music for the Royal Court. Meyerbeer wrote a number of works for court occasions, and also provided music, at the King&#x27;s request, for the first staging in Berlin in 1856 of his brother Michael&#x27;s play &quot;Struensee&quot; (based on the life of Johann Friedrich Struensee), which had also been proscribed under the previous regime.

In 1843 the Berlin Opera house burned down. The creation of the new building gave a new opportunity to commission a German opera from Meyerbeer. The subject of the opera, &quot;Ein Feldlager in Schlesien&quot; &quot;(A Silesian Encampment)&quot;, was an episode in the life of Frederick the Great. As this patriotic opera &#x27;needed&#x27; Prussian creators, Meyerbeer arranged that whilst the trusted Scribe would write the libretto, Rellstab would translate it and take the credit (and the royalties). This had the added advantage of winning over the formerly hostile Rellstab. Meyerbeer had hoped to have Jenny Lind (for whom he had written the part) sing the lead role of Vielka, but the opera premiered on 7 December 1844 without her (although she did appear in subsequent performances). The libretto was revised by Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer to a Bohemian background as &quot;Vielka&quot; for a production in Vienna (1847). (In a further incarnation, the music was later used by Meyerbeer for a revamped libretto by Scribe featuring Peter the Great, and produced as an &quot;opéra comique&quot; in Paris (&quot;L&#x27;étoile du nord&quot;, 1854)).

With the continuing delays in the production of &quot;Le prophète&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, Meyerbeer was now becoming subject to increasing sniping in Paris. In 1846 Meyerbeer began work on a new project with Scribe and Saint-Georges, &quot;Noëma&quot;, but in the following year Pillet was sacked from the opera and the direction was resumed by Duponchel. As a consequence, Meyerbeer was at last able to stage &quot;Le prophète&quot; with a cast to his liking, (including Viardot as Fidès), and it premiered on 16 April 1849. Again Meyerbeer&#x27;s new opera was an outstanding success – despite the unusual feature of the lead female role being the hero&#x27;s mother, rather than his lover. Amongst those at the 47th performance in February 1850 was Richard Wagner, now an impoverished political exile; the success of a work so fundamentally against his own operatic principles was one of the spurs to his spiteful anti-Jewish denunciation of Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn, &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (1850).

====Last years====
Increasing ill health (or possibly hypochondria) now began to restrict Meyerbeer&#x27;s output and activities. The death of his beloved mother in 1854 was also a blow. However, the success of &quot;L&#x27;étoile du nord&quot; in 1854 demonstrated that he could still pack the theatres. Following this he began on two new projects, an opera by Scribe based on the biblical story of Judith, and an &quot;opéra comique&quot;, &quot;Le pardon de Ploërmel&quot;, (also known as &quot;Dinorah&quot;, the title given to the Italian version performed at London) to a libretto by Jules Barbier. The latter premiered on 4 April 1859 at the Opéra Comique in Paris; the former, like many previous projects, remained only as sketches. The death of Scribe in 1861 was a further disincentive to Meyerbeer to proceed with his operatic work in progress. In 1862, in accordance with his original contract with Scribe, he paid Scribe&#x27;s widow compensation for not completing &quot;Judith&quot;.

Nevertheless, Meyerbeer&#x27;s last years saw the composition of a good deal of non-operatic music, including a Coronation March for William I of Prussia, (1861), an overture for the 1862 International Exhibition in London, and incidental music (now lost) to Henry Blaze de Bury&#x27;s play &quot;La jeunesse de Goethe&quot; (1860). He composed a few settings of liturgical material, including one of the 91st Psalm (1853); and also choral works for the synagogue at Paris.

Meyerbeer died in Paris on 2 May 1864. Rossini, who, not having heard the news, came to his apartment the next day intending to meet him, was shocked and fainted. He was moved to write on the spot a choral tribute (&quot;Pleure, pleure, muse sublime!&quot;). A special train bore Meyerbeer&#x27;s body from the Gare du Nord to Berlin on 6 May, where he was buried in the family vault at the Jewish cemetery in Schönhauser Allee.

&quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; was eventually premiered after Meyerbeer&#x27;s death at the Salle Le Peletier on 28 April 1865 in a performing edition undertaken by François-Joseph Fétis.

==Personality and beliefs==
Meyerbeer&#x27;s immense wealth (increased by the success of his operas) and his continuing adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) accused him of being interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer&#x27;s time.

Meyerbeer&#x27;s personal attachment to Judaism was a mature personal decision – after the death of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother: &#x27;Please accept from me a promise that I will &quot;always&quot; live in the religion in which he died&#x27;. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he was regularly subject to antisemitic hostility throughout his life (see below), warning his brothers frequently in his letters against &quot;richess&quot; (Yiddish for &#x27;Jew-hatred&#x27;). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered a sobering view:

I believe that &quot;richess&quot; is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded...[Nothing] can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.

It was perhaps this attitude that led Meyerbeer never to enter public controversy with those who antagonized him, either professionally or personally, although he occasionally displayed his grudges in his &quot;Diaries&quot;; for example, on hearing Robert Schumann conduct in 1850: &#x27;I saw for the first time the man who, as a critic, has persecuted me for twelve years with a deadly enmity.&#x27;

In his mature operas, Meyerbeer selected stories which almost invariably featured as a major element of storyline a hero living within a hostile environment. Robert, Raoul the Huguenot, Jean the prophet, and the defiant Vasco da Gama in &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; are all &#x27;outsiders&#x27;. It has been suggested that &#x27;Meyerbeer&#x27;s choice of these topics is not accidental; they reflect his own sense of living in a potentially inimical society.&#x27;

Meyerbeer&#x27;s relationship with Heine displays the awkwardness and prickliness of the social personae of both parties. Meyerbeer, apart from any of his personal feelings, needed Heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music. He genuinely admired Heine&#x27;s verse, and made a number of settings from it. Heine, living in Paris from 1830, was always equivocal about his loyalties between Judaism and Christianity, and always short of money, asked Meyerbeer to intervene with Heine&#x27;s own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from Meyerbeer himself. He was not above threatening Meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him (and indeed Meyerbeer paid Heine&#x27;s widow to suppress such writings). And yet, at Heine&#x27;s death in 1856, Meyerbeer wrote in his diary: &#x27;Peace be to his ashes. I forgive him from my heart for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me.&#x27;

==Music and theatre==

===Music===
Meyerbeer did not operate on the basis of any theory or philosophy of music and was not an innovator in harmony or musical form. In the words of John H. Roberts: &quot;He had a rich fund of appealing if somewhat short-breathed melody, commanded an increasingly rich harmonic vocabulary, and was a master of brilliant and novel orchestral effect. But he had very limited skill in thematic development and even less in contrapuntal combination.&quot;

All of his significant music is for the voice (opera and songs) and this reflects his detailed grounding in Italian opera. Throughout his career he wrote his operas with specific singers in mind and took great care to temper his writing to their strengths; but at the same time he seemed little interested in expressing the emotions of his characters, preferring to use his music to underline the larger-scale machinations of the plot. In this way he was close to the ideas of his teacher Vogler, himself renowned for his dramatic depictions of nature and incidents in keyboard music, who wrote in 1779 that: &quot;writing beautifully is easy; expression is not too difficult; but only the genius of a great painter...can choose for each picture agreeable and natural colours that are particular to it.&quot; Indeed, Meyerbeer&#x27;s devotion to the voice often led him to ignore the dramatic cohesion of his operas; typically, he would write far too much music and the scores of his operas would have to be drastically cut during rehearsals. (The lengthy overture to &quot;Le prophète&quot; had to be cut in its entirety, surviving only in a piano arrangement by Charles-Valentin Alkan.)

The first signs of Meyerbeer breaking with the Italian traditions in which he had trained are in &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot;. Amongst other notable features of the opera were its lavish orchestral forces (extending to two onstage military bands in the final act). The grandiosity of the work reflected the need to make an impact on the sophisticated and technologically advanced stages of London and Paris, for which it was extensively rewritten. Meyerbeer&#x27;s contribution was revealed at this stage to be the combination of Italian vocal lines, German orchestration and harmony, and the use of contemporary theatrical techniques, ideas which he carried forward in &quot;Robert&quot; and his later works. However Meyerbeer&#x27;s background in the Italian operatic traditions can be clearly seen as late as 1859 in the &#x27;mad scene&#x27; in &quot;Dinorah&quot; (the virtuoso aria &quot;Ombre légère&quot;).

Typical of Meyerbeer&#x27;s innovative orchestration is the use in &quot;Robert le diable&quot; of dark-toned instruments – bassoons, timpani and low brass, including ophicleide – to characterise the diabolical nature of Bertram and his associates. At one point the arrival of a character is announced by a combination of three solo timpani and pizzicato double-basses. Similar adventurousness is shown in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; where the composer uses a solo bass clarinet and solo viola d&#x27;amore to accompany arias. For &quot;Le prophète&quot;, Meyerbeer considered using the newly invented saxophone. Becker suggests that Meyerbeer in all his grand operas often: &#x27;created a deliberately &#x27;unbeautiful&#x27; sound...with unusual orchestration designed to express ...content rather than produce a sensuous sound&#x27; and opines that this explains much of the criticism he received from German writers on music.
===Theatre===
Meyerbeer&#x27;s concern to integrate musical power with all the resources of contemporary theatre anticipated in some ways the ideas of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;. Becker writes:

Wagner&#x27;s idea of music drama...was originally developed by way of grand opera...his ideas could never have been realised in their particular form without the pioneering development[s]...that Meyerbeer&#x27;s operas were the first to demand. 

Meyerbeer was always concerned to intensify the theatricality of his operas, even when new ideas emerged at a relatively late stage in the music&#x27;s composition. An example of his receptiveness was the addition of the provocative &quot;Ballet of the Nuns&quot; in the third act of &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, at the suggestion of Duponchel. The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including &#x27;English traps&#x27; for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led in fact to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). In &quot;Le prophète&quot;, the skating ballet, which created a great sensation, was composed after rehearsals had begun, in order to capitalise on the new craze for roller skates. The theatre was also able to use new electrical lighting effects to create a powerful sunrise, and to depict the conflagration which ends the opera.

Meyerbeer&#x27;s large choral &#x27;tableaux&#x27; also made a major contribution to the overall dramatic effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities. Crosten writes: &#x27;These massive developed sections are the chief glory of the Meyerbeerian opera, for they are not only big in volume but big in their structural design&#x27;.

Mention should also be made of Meyerbeer&#x27;s intense concern with the business of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers but extended to wooing the press and &#x27;marketing&#x27; in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the &#x27;press conference&#x27; at which journalists were fed refreshments and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer&#x27;s Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of &quot;Robert&quot;, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (&quot;Gambara&quot;) to promote &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. Schlesinger&#x27;s publication of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Reminiscences de Robert le diable&quot; sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.

==Reception==

===Musical influence===
Meyerbeer had no pupils and no direct &#x27;school&#x27;. Yet as his works spanned the golden age of grand opera, clear traces of his influence can be found in the grand operas of Fromental Halévy, Gaetano Donizetti, Giuseppe Verdi and others. After 1850, Huebner notes a continuing tradition of operas at Paris where &#x27;principals appear with chorus at the end of an act and where private intrigue conjoins a well-articulated public dimension in the plot&#x27; and cites amongst others Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;La nonne sanglante&quot; (1854), Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and operas by Jules Massenet, amongst them &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; (1877) and &quot;Le Cid&quot; (1885). The line of succession was however virtually washed away in the tide of Wagner in Paris after 1890 (see below). The influence of Meyerbeer has also been detected in the operas of Antonín Dvořák and other Czech composers, and in the operas of Russian composers including Rimsky-Korsakov and the young Tchaikovsky, who thought &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; &#x27;one of the greatest works in the repertoire&#x27;.

Themes from Meyerbeer&#x27;s works were used by many contemporary composers, often in the form of keyboard paraphrases or fantasies. Perhaps the most elaborate and substantial of these is Franz Liszt&#x27;s monumental Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale &quot;Ad nos, ad salutarem undam&quot;, S. 259 (1852), for organ or pédalier, based on the chorale of the Anabaptist priests in &quot;Le prophète&quot; and dedicated to Meyerbeer. The work was also published in a version for piano duet (S. 624) which was much later arranged for solo piano by Ferruccio Busoni.

Liszt also wrote piano works based on &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, notably the &quot;Réminiscences de Robert le diable&quot; subtitled &quot;Valse infernale&quot;. He also transcribed two pieces from &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, as &quot;Illustrations de l&#x27;opéra &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;&quot;. Frédéric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a &quot;Grand duo concertant&quot; on themes from the opera, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106. Other pieces based on the opera included works by Adolf von Henselt and Jean-Amédée Méreaux. Similar works, of varying musical quality, were churned out by composers for each of the further operas in attempts to cash in on their success.

===Critical reception===
Meyerbeer&#x27;s operas consistently enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime, and the verdict of (the then pro-Meyerbeer) Wagner in 1841, when the Paris Opéra was vainly awaiting &quot;Le prophète&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, was not atypical:

The Paris Opéra lies dying. It looks for its salvation to the German Messiah, Meyerbeer; if he keeps it waiting much longer, its death agonies will begin...It is for that reason...that one only sees &quot;Robert le Diable&quot; and &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; turning up again when the mediocrities are forced to withdraw.

However, dissenting voices were heard from critics. Not all of these however were on musical grounds. Berlioz for example raised the issue of the inhibiting effects of Meyerbeer&#x27;s success (which he felt particularly as one who struggled to get his works performed): &quot;The pressure [Meyerbeer] exerts on managers, artists and critics, and consequently on the Paris public, at least as much by his immense wealth as by his eclectic talent, makes all serious success at the Opéra virtually impossible. This baneful influence may still be felt ten years after his death: Heinrich Heine maintains he has &#x27;paid in advance&#x27;.&quot;

Mendelssohn disapproved of Meyerbeer&#x27;s works on moral grounds, believing &quot;Robert le diable&quot; to be &#x27;ignoble&#x27;.

Schumann&#x27;s attack on &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was clearly a personal diatribe against Meyerbeer&#x27;s Judaism: &#x27;Time and time again we had to turn away in disgust...One may search in vain for a sustained pure thought, a truly Christian sentiment...It is all contrived, all make believe and hypocrisy!...The shrewdest of composers rubs his hands with glee.&#x27;

Wagner&#x27;s disciple Theodor Uhlig followed Schumann&#x27;s Judaeophobic line in his 1850 review of &quot;Le prophète&quot;:
&#x27;To a good Christian [it] is at best contrived, exaggerated, unnatural and slick, and it is not possible that the practised propaganda of the Hebrew art-taste can succeed using such means.&#x27; Uhlig&#x27;s phrase &#x27;the Hebrew art-taste&#x27; was to be used by Richard Wagner to spark off his attack on Meyerbeer, &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (Jewishness in Music) (see below).

In 1911, the composer Charles Villiers Stanford cited Meyerbeer&#x27;s music as an example of the dangers he believed lay in improvising at the piano without a clear plan, (although there is in fact no evidence to suggest Meyerbeer worked in this way), writing: &#x27;Man of genius though he was, as any man who wrote the fourth act of the &quot;Huguenots&quot; must have been, Meyerbeer is a sign-post of this danger of trusting to the pianoforte as a medium of inspiration.&#x27;

===Wagner&#x27;s campaign against Meyerbeer===
The vitriolic campaign of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer was to a great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer&#x27;s popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign was as much a matter of personal spite as of racism – Wagner had learnt a great deal from Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner&#x27;s early opera &quot;Rienzi&quot; (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow &#x27;Meyerbeer&#x27;s best opera&#x27;. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both &quot;Rienzi&quot; and &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; at Dresden.

Wagner&#x27;s early correspondence with Meyerbeer, up to 1846, is described by historian David Conway as &quot;cringingly obsequious&quot;. However, from the early 1840s, as Wagner developed &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, his ideas on opera increasingly diverged from Meyerbeerean standards; even in 1843 Wagner had written to Schumann condemning Meyerbeer&#x27;s work as &#x27;a striving after superficial popularity&#x27;. During 1846 Meyerbeer turned down Wagner&#x27;s application for a loan of 1,200 thalers, and this may have marked a turning point.

In particular, after 1849, Wagner resented Meyerbeer&#x27;s continuing success at a time when his own vision of German opera had little chance of prospering. After the May Uprising in Dresden of 1849, Wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to Saxony. During his period of living in exile, he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of &quot;Le prophète&quot; sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer&#x27;s wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of German music by alleged Jewish venality and willingness to cater to the lowest tastes, and attributed the supposed poor quality of such &#x27;Jewish music&#x27; to Jewish speech and song patterns, which &#x27;though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him&#x27;.

In his major theoretical statement, &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; (1852), Wagner objected to the music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner&#x27;s well-known put-down of Meyerbeer&#x27;s operas as &#x27;effects without causes&#x27;. It also contains the sardonic crack that &#x27;[Rossini] never could have dreamt that it would someday occur to the Bankers, for whom he had always made their music, to make it for themselves&#x27;. &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot; was reissued in 1869, after Meyerbeer&#x27;s death, in an extended form and with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner&#x27;s own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti-Semitism.

As Wagner prospered, it became second nature for him, his wife Cosima and the Wagner circle to deprecate Meyerbeer and his works, and Cosima&#x27;s &quot;Diaries&quot; contain numerous instances of this – (as well as recording a dream of Wagner&#x27;s in which he and Meyerbeer were reconciled). Wagner&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Mein Leben&quot;, circulated amongst his friends (and published openly in 1911), contains constant sniping at Meyerbeer and concludes with Wagner receiving the news of Meyerbeer&#x27;s death, and his companions&#x27; gratification at the news. The downgrading of Meyerbeer became a commonplace amongst Wagnerites: in 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot;, commented that: &quot;Nowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken Meyerbeer&#x27;s influence seriously.&quot;

Thus as Wagner&#x27;s stock rose, Meyerbeer&#x27;s fell. In 1890, the year before the Paris premiere of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, there were no Wagner performances at the Paris Opéra, and 32 performances of Meyerbeer&#x27;s four grand operas. In 1909, there were 60 Wagner performances, and only three of Meyerbeer&#x27;s (&quot;Les Huguenots&quot; being the sole work performed).

===Reevaluation===
Meyerbeer&#x27;s costly operas, requiring grand casts of leading singers, were gradually dropped from the repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, and this was a major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory.

One of the first serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten&#x27;s 1948 book &quot;Grand Opera: An Art and a Business&quot; which laid out the themes and standards for much subsequent research. A major contribution to the revival of interest in Meyerbeer was the work of the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer&#x27;s complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. The establishment of a &#x27;Meyerbeer Fan Club&#x27; in America also stimulated interest.

Most importantly the operas themselves have been revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator&#x27;s lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from &quot;Il crociato&quot; onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for &quot;Struensee&quot;.

Amongst the reasons often adduced for the dearth of productions in the 20th century were the scale of Meyerbeer&#x27;s more ambitious works and the cost of mounting them, as well as the alleged lack of virtuoso singers capable of doing justice to Meyerbeer&#x27;s demanding music. However, successful productions of some of the major operas at relatively small centres such as Strasbourg (&quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, 2004) and Metz (&quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, 2004) showed that this conventional wisdom can be challenged. Since then, there have been highly successful new productions of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; at major opera houses in France, Belgium and Germany. The Paris Opera opened a new production of &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; in September 2018, the first time since 1936 for the opera to be performed there. In December 2012, the Royal Opera House in London premiered its first performance of &quot;Robert le diable&quot; in 120 years. In 2013, Meyerbeer&#x27;s original version of &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; in a new critical edition by Jürgen Schläder was performed by Chemnitz Opera under the original title &quot;Vasco de Gama&quot;. The production was a success with audiences and critics and won the poll of German critics award presented by &quot;Opernwelt&quot; magazine annually as &quot;Rediscovery of the year&quot; in 2013. The critical edition was also used for a high-profile new production at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in October 2015. From 2015 onwards, new productions of &quot;Le prophète&quot; began to appear at some European opera houses.

On 9 September 2013 a plaque to mark Meyerbeer&#x27;s last residence was put up at Pariser Platz 6a, Berlin.

<text>A mastodon ( &#x27;breast&#x27; + &#x27;tooth&#x27;) is a member of the genus Mammut (German for &#x27;mammoth&#x27;), which was endemic to North America and lived from the late Miocene to the early Holocene. Mastodons belong to the order Proboscidea, the same order as elephants and mammoths (which belong to the family Elephantidae). &quot;Mammut&quot; is the type genus of the extinct family Mammutidae, which diverged from the ancestors of modern elephants at least 27–25 million years ago, during the Oligocene.

Like other members of Mammutidae, the molar teeth of mastodons have zygodont morphology (where parallel pairs of cusps are merged into sharp ridges), which strongly differ from those of elephantids. In comparison to its likely ancestor &quot;Zygolophodon&quot;, &quot;Mammut&quot; is characterized by particularly long and upward curving upper tusks, reduced or absent tusks on the lower jaw, as well as the shortening of the mandibular symphysis (the frontmost part of the lower jaw), the latter two traits also having evolved in parallel separately in elephantids. Mastodons had an overall stockier skeletal build, a lower-domed skull, and a longer tail compared to elephantids. Fully grown male &quot;M. americanum&quot; are thought to have been have been to at shoulder height and from to in body mass on average. The size estimates suggest that American mastodon males were on average heavier than any living elephant species; they were typically larger than Asian elephants and African forest elephants of both sexes but shorter than male African bush elephants.

&quot;M. americanum&quot;, known as an &quot;American mastodon&quot; or simply &quot;mastodon,&quot; had a long and complex paleontological history spanning all the way back to 1705 when the first fossils were uncovered from Claverack, New York in the American colonies. Because of the uniquely shaped molars with no modern analogues in terms of large animals, the species caught wide attention of European researchers and influential Americans before and after the American Revolution to the point of, according to American historians Paul Semonin and Keith Stewart Thomson, bolstering American nationalism and contributing to a greater understanding of extinctions. Taxonomically, it was first recognized as a distinct species by Robert Kerr in 1792 then classified to its own genus &quot;Mammut&quot; by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1799, thus making it amongst the first fossil mammal genera to be erected with undisputed taxonomic authority. The genus served as a wastebasket taxon for proboscidean species with superficially similar molar teeth morphologies but today includes 7 definite species, 1 of questionable affinities, and 4 other species from Eurasia that are pending reassessments to other genera.

Mastodons are considered to have had a predominantly browsing-based diet on leaves, fruits, and woody parts of plants. This allowed mastodons to niche partition with other members of Proboscidea in North America, like gomphotheres and the Columbian mammoth, who had shifted to mixed feeding or grazing by the late Neogene-Quaternary. It is thought that mastodon behaviors were not much different from elephants and mammoths, with females and juveniles living in herds and adult males living largely solitary lives plus entering phases of aggression similar to the musth exhibited by modern elephants. &quot;Mammut&quot; achieved maximum species diversity in the Pliocene, though the genus is known from abundant fossil evidence in the Late Pleistocene.

Mastodons for at least a few thousand years prior to their extinction coexisted with Paleoindians, who were the first humans to have inhabited North America. Evidence has been found that Paleoindians (including those of the Clovis culture) hunted mastodons based on the finding of mastodon remains with cut marks and/or with lithic artifacts.

Mastodons disappeared along with many other North American animals, including most of its largest animals (megafauna), as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event around the end of the Late Pleistocene-early Holocene, the causes typically being attributed to human hunting, severe climatic phases like the Younger Dryas, or some combination of the two. The American mastodon had its last recorded occurrence in the earliest Holocene around 11,000 years ago, which is considerably later than other North American megafauna species. Today, the American mastodon is one of the most well-known fossil species in both academic research and public perception, the result of its inclusion in American popular culture.

=== Research history ===
==== Earliest finds ====

In a letter dating to 1713, Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon (known also as Lord Cornbury) from New York reported to the Royal Society learned society of Great Britain that in 1705, a large-sized tooth was found near the side of the Hudson River by a Dutch country-fellow and was sold to New York General Assembly member Van Bruggen for a gill of rum, and Bruggen eventually gave it to Cornbury. He then stated that he sent Johannis Abeel, a recorder of Albany, New York to dig near the original site of the tooth to find more bones.

Abeel reported later that he went to the town of Claverack, New York where the original bones were found. American historian Paul Semonin said that the accounts written by Cornbury and Abeel match up with that written by in the July 30, 1705 entry in &quot;The Boston News-Letter&quot;. The account reported skeletal evidence of an antediluvian (or biblical) &quot;giant&quot; uncovered from Claverack. The femur and one of the teeth both dissolved before they could be further observed, however.

==== Big Bone Lick ====

In 1739, a French military expedition under the command of Charles III Le Moyne (known also as &quot;Longueil&quot;) explored the locality of &quot;Big Bone Lick&quot; (located in what is now the US state of Kentucky) and gathered fossil bones and teeth there. The French naturalist Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton examined the fossil collection brought by Longueuil and compared it with specimens of extant elephants and Siberian mammoths in 1762. Daubenton said that the bones were discovered by Native Americans (probably Abenaki hunter-warriors). He came to the conclusion that the femur and tusk belonged to an elephant while the molars (or cheek teeth) came from a separate giant hippopotamus.

In Shawnee tradition, the proboscideans roamed in herds and were hunted by giants, who both eventually died out. The accounts told by the Shawnee individuals in 1762 are the oldest known documented interpretations of the &quot;Ohio&quot; fossils, although the traditions may have had been told for generations.

In 1767, Peter Collinson credited Irish trader George Croghan for having sent him and Benjamin Franklin fossil evidence of the mysterious proboscideans, using them for his studies. He concluded that the peculiar grinders (the molars) were built for herbivorous diets of branches of trees and shrubs as well as other vegetation, a view later followed by Franklin.

In 1768, Scottish anatomist William Hunter recorded that he and his brother John Hunter observed that the teeth were not like those of modern elephants. He determined that the &quot;grinders&quot; from Ohio were of a carnivorous animal but believed that the tusks belonged to the same animal. After examining fossils from Franklin and Lord Shelburne, Hunter was convinced that the &quot;&quot;pseudo-elephant&quot;, or &quot;animal incognitum&quot; (shortened as &quot;incognitum&quot;&quot;), was an animal species separate from elephants that might have also been the same as the proboscideans found in Siberia. He concluded his article with the opinion that although regrettable to philosophers, humanity should be thankful to heaven that the animal, if truly carnivorous, was extinct.

==== Early American observations ====
In 1785, Reverend Robert Annan wrote an account recalling an event in which workers discovered bones in his farm near the Hudson River in New York in fall of 1780. The workers found four molars in addition to another that was broken and thrown away. They also uncovered bones, including vertebrae that broke shortly thereafter. Annan expressed his confusion at what the animal could be but speculated based on its &quot;grinders&quot; that it was carnivorous in diet. He speculated also that it was probably extinct due to some catastrophe within the globe.

American statesman Thomas Jefferson stated his thoughts on &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (published by 1785) that the fossil proboscideans may have been carnivorous, still exist in the northern parts of North America, and are related to mammoths whose remains were found in Siberia. Jefferson referenced the theory of American social degeneracy by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, countering it by using extant and extinct animal measurements, including those of &quot;mammoths,&quot; as proof that North America faunas were not &quot;degenerative&quot; in size. Semonin pointed out that social degeneracy was an offensive concept to Anglo-American naturalists and that the American proboscidean fossils were used as political tools to inspire American nationalism and counter against the theory of American degeneracy.
In 1799, laborers recovered a thighbone while digging a marl pit at John Masten&#x27;s farm in Newburgh, New York, and subsequent excavations were observed by a crowd of over a hundred people. American painter and exhibitionist Charles Willson Peale visited the locality in 1801, where he first sketched the fossils then purchased excavation privileges and full ownership of the fossils from Masten and borrowed a loan from the American Philosophical Society (APS) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In addition to the first skeleton, the second was excavated using a mill-like device to drain a deep marl pit. Peale assembled a complete skeleton in his Philadelphia Museum in 1804, and its exhibit was open first to invited members of the American Philosophical Society on December 24 then to the general public on December 25 for an exhibit admission fee in addition to the general admission fee.

The special exhibition attracted thousands of visitors, and the skeleton became a US national symbol. Charles Peale&#x27;s son Rembrandt Peale took the skeleton to Europe used to promote the fossil proboscidean and have it used as support for Jefferson&#x27;s final rebuttals against Buffon&#x27;s arguments for supposed inferiority of American faunas. Author Keith Stewart Thomson argued that the promotion of the &quot;mastodon&quot; skeleton made it a symbol of the strength of American nationalism and that &quot;mammoth&quot; as a term became associated with gigantism. Decades later, the museum bankrupted, and the first skeleton&#x27;s specimens were sold to some German spectators in around 1848, who eventually sold it to Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt in Germany where it is now displayed. The second skeleton&#x27;s specimens landed eventually at the American Museum of Natural History.
Other skeletons of &quot;Mammut americanum&quot; were excavated within the United States in the first half of the 19th century. One of them was collected by American showman Albert C. Koch in what is today the Mastodon State Historic Site at Missouri in 1839. He hypothesized in 1840 that the proboscidean, which he classified as &quot;Missourium&quot;, was much larger than an elephant, had horizontal tusks plus trunks, and occupied aquatic habitats. He acquired additional fossils from a spring on the Pomme de Terre River to assemble a mounted skeleton of the &quot;Missouri Leviathan&quot; and briefly exhibited it at After exhibiting the skeleton throughout Europe, he sold the skeleton to the British Museum of Natural History. Richard Owen then properly reassembled the skeleton, and it today is on display there.

In 1845, another skeleton was excavated from Newburgh by laborers hired by Nathaniel Brewster initially to remove lacustrine deposits to fertilize the neighboring fields. They were observed by a large number of spectators and uncovered relatively complete fossil evidence of &quot;M. americanum&quot;. The skeleton was exhibited in New York City and other New England towns then was acquired by John Collins Warren for study. After Warren&#x27;s death in 1856, the skeleton was sent to Warren&#x27;s family but was traded to Harvard Medical School for John Warren&#x27;s skeleton. The &quot;Warren mastodon&quot;, under the request of American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, was purchased by the American financier J. P. Morgan for $30,000 in 1906 and donated to the American Museum of Natural History where it is exhibited today.

==== Early taxonomic history ====

In the 1790s, the &quot;American incognitum&quot; was subject to research by multiple taxonomists. Scottish writer Robert Kerr erected the species name &quot;Elephas americanus&quot; in 1792 based on fossil tusks and &quot;grinders&quot; from the Big Bone Lick locality. He stated that the tusks were similar to elephants while the molars were completely different because they were covered with enamel and had a double row of high conical cusp processes. Kerr was unsure about the taxonomic affinities of the molars and referenced that Thomas Pennant supposed that they belong to an unknown species within the genus &quot;Elephas&quot;, giving the common name &quot;American elephant&quot;.

German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach also followed up with more taxonomic descriptions of fossil proboscideans in 1799. The first fossil species, recovered from Germany, was described as belonging to the newly erected species &quot;Elephas primigenius&quot;? (now known as &quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot;). The second was what he considered to be an unknown &quot;colossal land monster of the prehistoric world,&quot; considering it to be the &quot;mammoth.&quot; He created the genus &quot;Mammut&quot; and erected the species &quot;Mammut ohioticum&quot; based on fossil bones dug up from Ohio in North America. He said that the species was distinguished from other animals of the prehistoric world based on the unusual shapes of the large molars. The genus name &quot;Mammut&quot; refers to the German translation for &quot;mammoth.&quot; The naming of the genus &quot;Mammut&quot; in 1799 makes it the second or third genus to be recognized with taxonomic authority given that &quot;Megalonyx&quot; had been named the same year.

French naturalist Georges Cuvier also described known fossil proboscidean species back in 1796, although his account was later published in 1799. He considered that the remains uncovered from Siberia were true &quot;mammoths&quot; that had similar dentitions to extant elephants but had some morphological differences. He mentioned the fossil remains that were brought back by Longueil from Ohio back in 1739 and several researchers from previous decades who noted the unusual molars and thought that they belonged to different animals like hippopotamuses. He followed recognition in the previously established species &quot;Elephas americanus&quot; and argued that the species was different from elephants and mammoths and cannot be found amongst living animals due to extinction from catastrophism.

The proboscidean species was subject to several other species names given by other taxonomists within the earliest 18th century as well as the genus name &quot;Harpagmotherium&quot; by the Russian naturalist Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim in 1808.

==== Cuvier&#x27;s taxonomy ====

In 1806, Cuvier wrote multiple extended research articles on fossil proboscideans of Eurasia and the Americas. He stated that the bones that Buffon previously described from North America were not of elephants but another animal that he referred to as the &quot;&quot;mastodonte&quot;,&quot; or the &quot;&quot;animal of Ohio&quot;.&quot; He reinforced the idea that the extinct &quot;mastodon&quot; was an animal close in relationship to elephants that differed by jaws with large tubercles. He suggested that &quot;mammoth&quot; and &quot;carnivorous elephant&quot; be discontinued as names for the species and that it receive a new genus name instead. Cuvier said that for &quot;&quot;mastodonte&quot;,&quot; he derived the name&#x27;s etymology (compound (, &quot;breast&quot;) + (, &quot;tooth&quot;)) from Ancient Greek to mean &quot;nipple tooth,&quot; since he thought that it expressed the characteristic form of the teeth.

In 1817, the French naturalist officially established the genus name &quot;Mastodon&quot;, reaffirming that it is extinct and has left no living descendants. He established that it had an overall body form similar to elephants but had molars more similar to hippopotamuses and pigs that did not serve to grind meat. The first species he erected within &quot;Mastodon&quot; was &quot;Mastodon giganteum&quot;, giving it the informal name &quot;great mastodon&quot; and writing that that it is designated to the Ohio proboscidean with abundant fossil evidence, equal size but greater proportions to modern elephants, and diamond-shaped points of the molars. The naturalist also created the second species name &quot;Mastodon angustidens&quot; and gave it the informal name &quot;narrow-toothed mastodon,&quot; diagnosing it as having narrower molars, smaller sizes compared to &quot;M. giganteum&quot;, and range distributions in Europe and South America. Cuvier also erected several other species of &quot;Mastodon&quot; originating from other continents in 1824. Despite Cuvier&#x27;s genus name being younger than multiple other genus names, &quot;Mastodon&quot; became the most commonly used genus name for the 19th century.

==== Taxonomic problems ====

&quot;Mastodon&quot; was riddled with major taxonomic problems since species now determined as belonging to other proboscidean genera were classified to &quot;Mastodon&quot; on the basis of similar dentitions to that of &quot;Mastodon giganteum&quot;&quot; (= &quot;Mammut americanum&quot;), effectively making it a wastebasket taxon. Various fossil proboscidean species were classified into &quot;Mastodon&quot; in the 19th century before eventually being reclassified into distinct genera. In addition to still-valid species names, several synonymous or dubious species names ultimately belonging to different genera were erected within the Americas as well throughout the 19th century. Also, many species names erected based on &quot;M. americanum&quot; remains were erected. As a result, &quot;M. americanum&quot; has many synonymous names. The issue of synonymous species names were especially apparent in the first half of the 19th century.

Today, the genera that include species formerly classified into &quot;Mastodon&quot; include &quot;Gomphotherium&quot; (&quot;G. angustidens&quot;, &quot;G. pyrenaicum&quot;, &quot;G. productum&quot;, &quot;G. libycum&quot;, &quot;G. subtapiroideum&quot;, &quot;G. steinheimense&quot;), &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; (&quot;Z. turicensis&quot;, &quot;Z. proavus&quot;), &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; (&quot;C. hyodon&quot;), &quot;Stegodon&quot; (&quot;S. elephantoides&quot;), &quot;Stegolophodon&quot; (&quot;S. latidens&quot;, &quot;S. cautleyi&quot;), &quot;Anancus&quot; (&quot;A. avernensis&quot;, &quot;A. sivalensis&quot;, &quot;A. perimensis&quot;), &quot;Tetralophodon&quot; (&quot;T. longirostris&quot;), &quot;Choerolophodon&quot; (&quot;C. pentelici&quot;), &quot;Stegomastodon&quot; (&quot;S. mirificus&quot;), &quot;Rhynchotherium&quot; (&quot;R.&quot; &quot;euhypodon&quot;), &quot;Stenobelodon&quot; (&quot;S. floridanus&quot;), and &quot;Notiomastodon&quot; (&quot;N. platensis&quot;).

In 1830, American naturalist John Davidson Godman created the genus &quot;Tetracaulodon&quot; plus its species &quot;T. Mastodontoideum&quot; based on what he determined to be differences between it and &quot;Mastodon&quot; based on the skull and dentition. Both Richard Harlan and William Cooper pointed out that except for the tusks, all other characteristics of the specimens were consistent with &quot;M. giganteum&quot;. They therefore argued that there was no reason to assume that the tusks were not just individual variations, a view followed also by George William Featherstonhaugh. Isaac Hays comparatively defended Godman&#x27;s taxon, which led to a bitter debate regarding the validity of the genus amongst American naturalists.

The validities of both &quot;Tetracaulodon&quot; and &quot;Missourium&quot; were rejected by Owen in 1842, although he retained the former name informally. By 1869, American paleontologist Joseph Leidy determined that &quot;Mastodon americanus&quot; is the senior species synonym and listed &quot;M. giganteum&quot; as a junior synonym. He also listed &quot;Mammut&quot;, &quot;Harpagmotherium&quot;, &quot;Mastotherium&quot;, &quot;Missourium&quot;, and &quot;Leviathan&quot; as synonyms of &quot;Mastodon&quot;. He also noted that &quot;M. americanum&quot; as a species was highly variable in morphology.

In 1902, American paleontologist Oliver Perry Hay listed &quot;Mammut&quot; as the prioritized genus name given its status as the oldest genus name, making &quot;Mastodon&quot;, &quot;Tetracaulodon&quot;, and &quot;Missourium&quot; classified as junior synonyms. He also established &quot;M. americanum&quot; as the type species. The genus name &quot;Mastodon&quot; was subsequently abandoned by many American paleontologists in favor of &quot;Mammut&quot; within the early 20th century. In 1942, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson said that for his study, he prioritized the historic plus taxonomically correct name &quot;Mammut&quot; over &quot;Mastodon&quot;. He continued prioritizing &quot;Mammut&quot; in 1945, stating that people were generally aware of its taxonomic priorities over &quot;Mastodon&quot; and that people had refused to use it. He stated that he did not want to either but reluctantly set aside his personal preferences to follow taxonomic rules.

==== Additional species ====

In 1921, Osborn created the species name &quot;Mastodon matthewi&quot; based on distinct molars from the Snake Creek Formation of western Nebraska, naming it in honor of William Diller Matthew. He also erected another species &quot;M. merriami&quot; from the Thousand Creek Formation in Nevada, which was eventually synonymized with &quot;Zygolophodon proavus&quot;. Osborn in 1926 followed up for &quot;Mastodon matthewi&quot; by establishing the genus &quot;Pliomastodon&quot; for the species based on cranial differences from &quot;Miomastodon&quot; (= &quot;Zygolophodon&quot;).

In 1930, Matthew erected a second species for &quot;Pliomastodon&quot; named &quot;P. vexillarius&quot; based on fossil material from the locality of Elephant Hill in California, determining that it differs from &quot;Mammut&quot; by differences in the skull and that the etymology of the species name was made in honor of paleontological contributions by the Standard Oil Company of California.

In 1933, Childs Frick named the species &quot;Mastodon raki&quot; from the locality of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico based on differences on the heel and M3 tooth from &quot;M. americanus&quot;, otherwise having proportions similar to it. In 1936, Chester Stock published the species name &quot;Pliomastodon nevadanus&quot; based on fossils from the Thousand Creek Beds of northwestern Nevada. In 1937, John R. Schultz created the species name &quot;Pliomastodon? cosoensis&quot;, naming it after the Coso Mountains in Inyo County, California where skull fossils were recovered.

In 1963, J. Arnold Shotwell and Donald E. Russell designated another species &quot;Mammut (Pliomastodon) furlongi&quot;, assigning it to fossils collected from the Juntura Formation of Oregon. The species name was created in honor of Eustace L. Furlong, who made early fossil collections from the western side of the Juntura Basin.

The genus &quot;Pliomastodon&quot; was synonymized with &quot;Mammut&quot; while &quot;Miomastodon&quot; was synonymized with &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; by Jeheskel Shoshani and Pascal Tassy in a 1996 appendix, a view that was followed by other authors in later years.

In 2019, Alton C. Dooley Jr. et al. established &quot;Mammut pacificus&quot; based on fossils collected from the Diamond Valley Lake in Hemet, California. They also stated that &quot;M. oregonense&quot; is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; and that further analysis needs to be done to confirm whether or not &quot;M. furlongi&quot; belongs to &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; instead.

In 2023, Wighart von Koenigswald et al. reviewed the North American species of &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; and &quot;Mammut&quot;. They synonymized &quot;P. adamsi&quot; and &quot;P. sellardsi&quot; with &quot;Mammut matthewi&quot; and emended &quot;M. nevadanus&quot; and &quot;M. pacificus&quot; to &quot;M. nevadanum&quot; and &quot;M. pacificum&quot;, respectively. They also said that they were uncertain of the taxonomic status of &quot;M. furlongi&quot;, specifically whether or not it was a variant of sexual dimorphism of &quot;Z. proavus&quot;. Some authors have considered &quot;M. nevadanum&quot; to be synonymous with &quot;M. matthewi&quot; while others had retained validity of the species name.

Several mammutid species outside of North America are classified to &quot;Mammut&quot; (or &quot;Pliomastodon&quot;), namely &quot;M. borsoni&quot;, &quot;M. obliquelophus&quot;, &quot;M. zhupengensis&quot;, and &quot;M. lufugense&quot; (possibly synonymous with &quot;M. obliquelophus&quot;). Recent research such as that of von Koenigswald et al. in 2023 warned that the genus &quot;Mammut&quot; should be carefully used for non-North American species.

=== Classification and evolution ===

&quot;Mammut&quot; is the type genus of the Mammutidae, the sole family of the elephantimorph clade Mammutida (the other elephantimorph clade is Elephantida). The Mammutidae is characterized by molars with zygodont-form crests, which have remained morphologically conservative throughout the evolutionary history of the family. &quot;Mammut&quot; is considered to be a derived genus of the family because of strong zygodont development. As a family of the Elephantimorpha clade, it is only distantly related to the Deinotheriidae due to major differences in dentition and emergence of adult teeth. The Mammutidae is identified as a monophyletic clade, meaning that it did not leave any derived descendant groups in its evolutionary history. The monophyly of the Mammutidae makes it differ from the Elephantida, where the Gomphotheriidae is paraphyletic (or ancestral to more derived descendant groups in the cladistic sense) in relation to the derived elephantoid families Stegodontidae and Elephantidae (elephants, mammoths, and relatives).

Although the separation of the Mammutida and Elephantida is strongly supported based on morphological differences, their origins within the late Paleogene remain uncertain. One hypothesis asserts that the Elephantimorpha is monophyletic if the primitive Elephantiformes genus &quot;Phiomia&quot; was truly ancestral to both the Elephantida and Mammutida. An alternate hypothesis suggests that the Elephantimorpha is diphyletic because &quot;Phiomia&quot; is ancestral to gomphotheres while &quot;Palaeomastodon&quot; is ancestral to mammutids. The earliest undisputed mammutid genus &quot;Losodokodon&quot; is recorded in Kenya, Africa and firmly establishes the earliest presence of mammutids in the late Oligocene (~27-24 Ma). The Mammutidae, like other Paleogene proboscideans, was therefore an endemic radiation within the continent akin to other endemic mammals like arsinoitheres, hyracoids, and catarrhine primates plus non-endemics such as anthracotheres and hyaenodonts.

In the early Neogene phase of evolution, &quot;Eozygodon&quot; made an appearance in the earliest Miocene (~23-20 Ma) of Africa after &quot;Losodokodon&quot;. &quot;Eozygodon&quot; was subsequently succeeded by &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; by the early Miocene, and the latter dispersed into Eurasia by around 19-18 million years ago, and into North America by the middle Miocene. The dispersal of mammutids between Africa and Eurasia may have occurred multiple times. The Mammutidae eventually went extinct in Africa prior to the late Miocene.

&quot;Mammut&quot; as currently defined &quot;sensu lato&quot; (in a broad sense) is most likely polyphyletic (comprising several unrelated groups). This is because the inclusion of Eurasian mammutid species into &quot;Mammut&quot; implies that they share a common origin with North American &quot;Mammut&quot;, but this relationship has been doubted. As a result, these Eurasian species may belong to either other existing mammutid genera or entirely new genera. &quot;&quot;Mammut&quot; borsoni,&quot; the last Eurasian mammutid, became extinct during the earliest Pleistocene, around 2.5-2 million years ago.
The oldest evidence of mammutids in North America is of a fragmentary molar of &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; sp. from Massacre Lake, Nevada, dating to 16.5-16.4 Ma (during the Hemingfordian stage of the North American land mammal ages (NALMA)). The only definitively defined species of &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; from North America is &quot;Z. proavus&quot;, which occurs in the Barstovian and Clarendonian stages. &quot;M? furlongi&quot; from the Black Butte in Oregon also dates back to the Clarendonian stage, but the affinities of the species remains unclear. If it truly is a species of &quot;Mammut&quot;, then its earliest temporal range is recorded at about 10 Ma. The earliest undisputed appearance of &quot;Mammut&quot; is of &quot;M. nevadanum&quot; from Thousand Creek Beds, dating back to the early Hemphillian, or 8.0-7.1 Ma. Historically, North American paleontologists considered that North American &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; evolved into &quot;Mammut&quot; in an endemic fashion while European workers generally thought that &quot;Mammut&quot; was a Eurasian immigrant that replaced North American &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; during the Miocene or Pliocene. Current evidence supports an endemic origin of North American &quot;Mammut&quot; from &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; without later migration because of the gradual appearance of &quot;Mammut&quot; morphologies and a lack of solid evidence that &quot;Mammut&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (in a strict sense) ever dispersed outside of North America.

&quot;M. matthewi&quot; is recorded from the late Hemphillian to early Blancan stages. Mammutid specimens of the Hemphillian and Blancan had typically previously been assigned to &quot;M. matthewi&quot;, but this is seemingly the result of overreliance on stratigraphic positions to define taxa. &quot;M. vexillarius&quot;, &quot;M. raki&quot;, and &quot;M. cosoensis&quot; are definitively recorded from the Blancan, and &quot;M. raki&quot; specifically is thought to not be synonymous with &quot;M. pacificum&quot;. &quot;M. americanum&quot; (known popularly as an &quot;American mastodon&quot; or simply &quot;mastodon&quot;) is also stratigraphically recorded first from the early Blancan of the Ringold Formation, Washington. The age of the formation where the mammutid specimen was found dates to about 3.75 Ma. It is also known from multiple other Blancan sites such as Fish Springs Flat in Nevada. From the Irvingtonian to the Rancholabrean (from around 1.6 million to 11,000 years ago), only &quot;M. americanum&quot; and the newly appearing &quot;M. pacificum&quot; are recorded, the former having an exceptional level of diversity based on abundant skeletal evidences from the late Pleistocene that is unusual for the typical mammutid fossil record.

The following cladogram defines the phylogeny of certain proboscideans, a majority known from endocasts, including &quot;M. americanum&quot;:

== Description ==
=== Skull ===

&quot;Mammut&quot; is diagnosed and differentiated in terms of the skull from &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; as having a shortened bottom skull base (basicranium) and a high-domed cranium. It is also diagnosed as having an &quot;elephantoid&quot; mandible with a shortened mandibular symphysis (or &quot;brevirostrine&quot;) and a protruding angular process in the mandible. The diagnosis accounts for both true &quot;Mammut&quot; species and &quot;Mammut&quot; species pending reassessments. The shortening of the symphysis is one of the major evolutionary trends observed in Neogene mammutids, making it critical in understanding the evolutionary transition from &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; to &quot;Mammut&quot;. However, mandibular remains with characteristics of &quot;Mammut&quot; are not known from any anywhere within the Hemphillian, thus making the transition poorly understood. It differs from &quot;Sinomammut&quot; by the shortened mandibular symphysis, although &quot;Mammut&quot; sometimes retained lower tusks unlike the other genus. The shortened mandibular symphysis in &quot;Mammut&quot; and the similarity of its skull with modern elephants would have allowed for an elephant-like prehensile trunk perhaps long enough to reach the ground.

&quot;M. americanum&quot; is diagnosed as having a long plus low skull and a shortened mandible. The frontal bone (or forehead) gives off a flattened appearance compared to extant elephants. The skull of &quot;M. americanum&quot; has many plesiomorphies (or ancestral traits) that can be observed, namely the low and flat brain case, a slightly vertical basicranium, a narrow nasal aperture inlet of the nose with no step-like perinasal fossa, and a backside infraorbital foramen. At least some of these features are thought to have been acquired from &quot;Phiomia&quot;. The nasal aperture of &quot;M. americanum&quot; is oval, whereas that of the skull of &quot;&quot;M.&quot; cf. &quot;obliquelophus&quot; is more trapezoidal. &quot;M. americanum&quot; is also more derived based on the lack of a strong proximal constriction of the incisive fossa of the incisive foramen. &quot;M. americanum&quot; also has a high and narrow orbit with a somewhat rectangular outline, but it is less rectangular than that of &quot;Eozygodon&quot;. The North American mammutid retains a primitive trait in the form of the orbit containing a lacrimal bone with a hole known as the lacrimal foramen. Unlike elephantidans, it has another primitive trait of a short and high-positioned temporal fossa, a trait shared with &quot;Eozygodon&quot;.

=== Endocast anatomy ===

&quot;M. americanum&quot; is known by several brain endocasts stored in American museums, although they are seldom subjected to studies. In 1973, neuroscientist Harry J. Jerison studied an endocast of &quot;Mammut&quot;, recording that it was elephantlike in both size and shape. According to Shoshani et al. in 2006, the endocast of &quot;M. americanum&quot; features the olfactory bulbs protruding in front of the frontal lobe. They also drew several proboscidean brains to scale, in which the brain of &quot;M. americanum&quot; was much larger than that of &quot;Moeritherium lyonsi&quot; but smaller than that of the Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;).

Julien Benoit et al. in 2022 explained that while the front tips of the olfactory bulbs of &quot;M.&quot; &quot;borsoni&quot; are partially visible in the brain&#x27;s back (or dorsal) area, its visibility in &quot;M. americanum&quot; is debated. Some authors had argued that the olfactory bulbs are visible in the brain&#x27;s back area while some other authors did not portray them as being visible. The researchers confirmed based on one specimen that the olfactory bulbs are only partially visible in the brain&#x27;s back area. They also observed that &quot;M.&quot;&quot; &quot;borsoni&quot;, despite weighing twice as much as &quot;M. americanum&quot;, had a 30% lower encephalization quotient (EQ) compared to the other mammutid species, supporting the idea that the evolution of proboscidean encephalization is tied with phylogeny. The Mammutida, as the most basal clade of the Elephantimorpha, has an EQ twice that of &quot;Moeritherium&quot; and &quot;Palaeomastodon&quot;. The endocast volume and brain size of the brain &quot;M. americanum&quot; are larger than those of &quot;Stegodon&quot; but smaller than those of derived elephantids. It has an EQ that is higher than those of Paleogene proboscideans and &quot;M.&quot; &quot;borsoni&quot; but lower than those of elephantids (extant and extinct) and stegodonts.

The type species is also known from endocasts of ear petrosals. According to Eric G. Ekdale, the ear petrosals of &quot;Mammut&quot; cannot automatically be distinguished from &quot;Mammuthus&quot; alone. The subarcuate fossa is absent from the cerebellar surface of the inner ear. The ear petrosals of &quot;Mammut&quot; are relatively incomplete, leaving several traits to be unable to be observed.

=== Dentition ===
The family Mammutidae is defined by zygolophodont molars with compressed and sharp transverse ridges plus lack of accessory conules (smaller cusps). The intermediate molars, or the first two molars, are consistently trilophodont, or three-cusped. The dental morphologies of the clade Mammutida contrast strongly with most members of both the Elephantida (bunodont molars that evolutionarily convert to being thin and platelike) and the Deinotheriidae (tapir-like lophodont to bilophodont molars). The zygodont morphologies of the molars of mammutids were conservative, meaning that they hardly changed in the evolutionary history of the family. Mammutids also exhibited evidences of horizontal tooth displacement where milk teeth were gradually replaced by permanent molars, mirroring elephantidans in an instance of parallel evolution. The Mammutidae was not the only proboscidean family to have acquired zygodont crested molars, as Neogene species of the gomphothere &quot;Sinomastodon&quot; display moderate to weak zygodont crests. Pleistocene species of &quot;Sinomastodon&quot; do not display zygodont crests, however.

The dentition of &quot;Mammut&quot; is diagnosed as being strongly zygodont and having no conules. The lophs extend to the long axis of the molars. The first two molars in the dental row have no more than three lophs while the third molars have four lophs plus a cingulum. The upper tusks (or upper incisors) of &quot;Mammut&quot; differ from those of &quot;Zygolophodon&quot; by the generally larger sizes, tendency to either straighten or curve up, and the typical lack of any enamel band, although &quot;M. vexillarius&quot; retains a very narrow strip of enamel in the upper tusks. The lower (or mandibular) tusks tend to be reduced in comparison. &quot;M. nevadanum&quot; represents the earliest case of a North American mammutid species without any enamel band, although the possibility of it being worn off by wear cannot automatically be eliminated. It differs from &quot;M. americanum&quot; and &quot;M. pacificum&quot; by the nearly straight but downward-facing upper tusk, whereas males of the latter two species have large and upward-facing upper tusks while females had upward or straight but frontward-directed upper tusks. The reduction to loss of the lower tusks plus reduction of the mandibular symphysis of the derived Mammutidae and Elephantida is an instance of convergent evolution, correlating potentially with the need to reduce heat loss due to the decrease of global temperature and humidity during the late Miocene and Pliocene. Despite the reductions of the lower tusks, they were still present in Neogene species of &quot;Mammut&quot;. Pleistocene &quot;M. americanum&quot; comparatively often lacks mandibular tusks, and &quot;M. pacificum&quot; is always devoid of them. The presence of lower tusks in &quot;M. raki&quot; separates it as a species from &quot;M. pacificum&quot;. &quot;M. pacificum&quot; differs from &quot;M. americanum&quot; in part by the narrower molars. Both species have broader molars compared to the &quot;narrow-toothed&quot; &quot;M. nevadanum&quot;, &quot;M. raki&quot;, and &quot;M. cosoensis&quot;.

Like its relative &quot;M.&quot; &quot;borsoni&quot;, &quot;M. americanum&quot; had very large tusks, with some records suggesting lengths of and diameters exceeding were not unusual. In the skull of the earlier-appearing &quot;M. matthewi&quot;, its dental alveolus of the right tusk from the locality of Hermiston, Oregon suggests a tusk diameter of approximately . Similar to modern elephants, &quot;M. americanum&quot; also has degrees of sexual dimorphism indicated by the sizes of the upper tusks. Adult males have tusks 1.15–1.25 times as large as those of adult females, also reflecting general body size differences between the two sexes. The sizes of the tusk also depend on the ages of the individuals, as older individuals have larger tusk circumferences than younger ones. Adult individuals of comparable ages have similar tusk sizes, but older individuals do not necessarily have larger tusk sizes. Tusk sizes may have depended on external factors like nutritional stress, geographic location, and reproductive status. The tusks of &quot;M. pacificum&quot; are thought to have been smaller in length and circumstance than that of &quot;M. americanum&quot; and may have similarly exhibited degrees of sexual dimorphism.

=== Postcranial skeleton ===

As a result of proboscidean diagnoses focusing mostly on dentition, the postcranial anatomies of fossil proboscideans like &quot;Mammut&quot; are underrepresented in academic literature. Jennifer A. Hodgson &quot;et al&quot;. compared the anatomies of &quot;Mammut&quot; and &quot;Mammuthus&quot;, mentioning that their postcranial anatomies were studied previously by Stanley John Olsen in 1972 and recognizing that the two genera were only distantly related to each other. &quot;M. americanum&quot; is typically depicted as stocky based on postcranial evidence.

The vertebral column (also known as the backbone or spine) of &quot;Mammut&quot; is documented as having a highest point located in the shoulder&#x27;s front like &quot;Mammuthus&quot;, but the spines gradually decrease in length then increase slightly in the rear area. The number of ribs and vertebrae of &quot;Mammut&quot; is not well-documented in paleontological literature and may vary by individual. &quot;Mammut&quot; usually has 20 thoracic vertebrae whereas &quot;Mammuthus&quot; usually has 19, but both have documented individuals with 18 of them. The reduction of thoracic vertebrae in &quot;Mammuthus&quot; is considered a derived trait also present in modern elephants. The &quot;Watkins Glen mastodon,&quot; for example, has 7 cervical vertebrae, 20 thoracic vertebrae, 3 lumbar vertebrae, and 5 sacral vertebrae. They believed that &quot;Mammut&quot; could have had as many as 20 ribs and that the back ribs were shorter and broader than that of &quot;Mammuthus&quot;. The tail of &quot;Mammut&quot; may have been made up of as many as up to 27 caudal vertebrae, suggesting that it had a long tail compared to gomphotheres and elephantids.
The scapula (or shoulder blade) of &quot;Mammut&quot; has a straight vertebral border, contrasting with a more concave vertebral border of &quot;Mammuthus&quot;. Hodgson &quot;et al&quot;. disagreed with the claim by Olsen in 1972 that the neck of the scapula is more constricted in &quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot; than &quot;Mammut americanum&quot;, since neither of the two &quot;M. americanum&quot; scapulae observed by the researchers have any high constriction there. The pelvis allows for identification of the sex of the species, as male &quot;Mammut&quot; individuals have a smaller pelvic outlet and wider ilium than female individuals.

&quot;Mammut&quot; has shorter and more robust limb bones compared to those of derived elephantids, probably the result of it retaining primitive anatomical traits. Both the humerus and radius of the mammutid genus are robust for instance. The ulna has a slightly more developed olecranon process and a deeper trochlear notch. The femur is somewhat thick, short, and appears to have more expanded condyles. Possibly, sexual dimorphism could be a factor behind the size of the femur itself. The tibia does not appear much different in both &quot;Mammut&quot; and &quot;Mammuthus&quot;, whereas the fibula may have only had subtle and complex differences within the two genera. The bones within both the front feet and back feet have their own subtle and complex differences by genus, but both have smaller and more narrow hind feet than fore feet so that the latter bears more weight of the proboscideans. In terms of postcranial anatomy, &quot;M. pacificum&quot; differs from &quot;M. americanum&quot; by the presence of six as opposed to five sacral vertebrae and the femur having a larger diameter of the middle shaft (or main cylindrical area).

=== External features ===

The American mastodon (&quot;M. americanum&quot;) has typically been depicted as having shaggy and brown-colored fur in reconstructions, especially in over a century of paleoart. Despite this, there is little direct evidence supporting the idea that &quot;Mammut&quot; was actually covered in hair. Supposedly, only one find of fur belonging to the mastodon is of a skull with two small hairy patches of skin from the state of Wisconsin near the city of Milwaukee. These have only been described briefly in the original literature and have never been figured beyond one hair from a scanning electron microscope (SEM). K.F. Hallin and D. Gabriel in 1981 speculated that mastodons were indeed hairy but were more suited for semiaquatic lifestyles than tolerance of colder climates. Matt Davis &quot;et al&quot;. in 2022 were tentative in accepting the source as evidence for hairiness, as they questioned whether &quot;Mammut&quot; needed thick coats for body warmth for their upper ranges at the Arctic and Subarctic and mentioned that it would not have needed them in subtropical climates like in Florida.

Davis &quot;et al&quot;. referenced that because Columbian mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot;) were not thought to be hairy, it is unclear why mastodons would need thick coats in comparison. The former was typically depicted as hairless and the latter as hairy in paleoart, but the mastodon&#x27;s preferences for closed or mixed habitats puts the speculations into question. They felt the need to portray the latter as hairy so that the average person could differentiate between the two species.

The concept of &quot;M. americanum&quot; having thick coats of fur was also subjected to study by Asier Larramendi in 2015. He acknowledged that hair is important for thermoregulation in extant elephants but that there is a negative correlation between body size and hair density in mammals. Some mammals have broken this trend before, however, as woolly mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot;) evolved to have thick coats of hair and a very short tail in response to cold climates. The idea that the American mastodon had hair is possible because of the seasonal climates, but there are few preserved soft tissues to support this idea, referencing the hairs found in Wisconsin. The supposed evidence of hair reported in the 19th century were actually just green algae filaments. He concluded that the long tail and large body mass both contradict the hypothesis that &quot;M. americanum&quot; was covered with thick coats of fur, considering it to be probably exaggerated.

=== Size and weight ===

According to Larramendi, the mammutids of the genus &quot;Mammut&quot; were among the largest known proboscideans. This was especially the case with &quot;&quot;M.&quot; &quot;borsoni&quot;, males of which are suggested to have had an average body mass of making it the largest known proboscidean alongside the extinct Indian elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus,&quot; and one of the largest land mammals to have ever lived. &quot;M. americanum&quot; in comparison to &quot;M.&quot;&quot; &quot;borsoni&quot; was much smaller, but it was still large in its own right compared to extant elephants. The American mastodon did not grow taller than living elephants but it was much more robust in body build than them, in part due to its very broad pelvis. The Warren mastodon produces a body mass of nearby and had a shoulder height measuring . This robustness is so pronounced that &quot;M. americanum&quot; individuals could have been up to 80% heavier than an elephant with the same shoulder height. Larger than average individuals may have possibly had a shoulder height of and weighed up to . 90% of fully grown male &quot;M. americanum&quot; individuals are suggested to have had shoulder heights ranging from to and body masses ranging from to in body mass, with an average fully grown &quot;M. americanum&quot; male estimated at in shoulder height and in body mass. These estimates place males as larger on average in weight and shoulder height than those of both the living Asian elephant and African forest elephant, and heavier but somewhat shorter than average males of African bush elephants.

The size of the &quot;Overmyer Mastodon,&quot; an individual skeleton recovered from the farm of Robert Overmyer northwest of Rochester, Indiana in 1976, was estimated by Neal Woodman and Jon W. Branstrator in 2008. They estimated based on the length of the humerus () that the shoulder height of the individual was , which they said was close to the average shoulder height of the species and comparable to a large female or small male. Similar to extant elephants, male American mastodon individuals tended to be larger than female individuals and tend to have larger and more strongly curved tusks, although the degree to which the body size is a factor in molar size is unclear.

A relatively complete skeleton of &quot;Mammut&quot; sp. from the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee, which was first uncovered in 2015, dates to the latest Hemphillian, and has an elongated mandibular symphysis and large mandibular tusks, is thought to have been several tonnes larger than &quot;M. americanum&quot; and even several species of &quot;Mammuthus&quot;. The specimens are still being prepared for further studies.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Diet ===

The zygodont molar morphologies of mammutids suggest that they consistently occupied adaptations to folivorous diets throughout their evolutionary history. This means that mammutids such as &quot;Mammut&quot;, because they retained zygodont molars, were built to browse on higher vegetation and did not shift towards grazing specializations or consistent mixed feeding. The stomach contents of &quot;M. americanum&quot; indicate that the species consumed spruce needles, pine cones, grass, and occasionally gourds plus vine leaves. Of note is that whereas mammutids of Eurasia went extinct by the early Pleistocene in association with more seasonal climates, &quot;Mammut&quot; survived in North America and became abundant, although the reason for the latter faunal trend does not have any offered explanation. The browsing specialization of &quot;Mammut&quot; is supported further by the coprolites (or fossil dung) of &quot;M. americanum&quot;, which are large-sized similar to extant elephants and predominantly consist of consumed woody contents but no grass. Of the Pleistocene New World proboscideans, the American mastodon appears to have been the most consistent in browsing rather than grazing, consuming C3 as opposed to C4 plants, and occupying closed forests versus more open habitats. This dietary inflexibility may have prevented them from invading South America during the Great American Interchange, due to the need to cross areas of grassland to do so.

The mastodon commonly browsed on woody plants (i.e. twigs) and fruits, occupying dense coniferous forests made up of spruces (&quot;Picea&quot;) and pines (&quot;Pinus&quot;) within most of eastern North America. In Florida, it consumed twigs of the genus &quot;Taxodium&quot; as well as other woody plants and fruits. Based on carbon isotopic analyses of mastodons in Florida, they had low δ13C values which indicate C3 browsing specialization. The dietary preferences of North American &quot;Mammut&quot; are thought to have mirrored those of the older &quot;Zygolophodon&quot;, which may have preferred living in closed forests and consuming conifers to avoid active competition with the bunodont gomphotheres and lophodont deinotheres in the Miocene of Europe. Most accounts of gut contents have identified coniferous twigs as the dominant element in their diet. In addition to twigs and leaves, as indicated by the &quot;Heisler mastodon&quot; of Michigan and the &quot;Burning Tree mastodon&quot; of Ohio, mastodons may have also consumed swamp grasses (&quot;Glyceria&quot; and &quot;Zizania&quot;) as well as semiaquatic and aquatic plants such as sedge marshes (&quot;Carex&quot;) that surrounded lakes. They may have additionally ingested other aquatic plants and aquatic invertebrates while consuming more than of water from lakes a day. The temporal shifts in molar and limb bone sizes in mastodon populations from Missouri and Florida as well as apparent differences in body size between western and eastern populations suggest that &quot;M. americanum&quot; was an adaptable species for local environmental shifts. Regardless, it depended heavily on forested environments similar to tapirs, so significant closed vegetation losses of any sort could have impacted them.

As a result of the consistent browsing specializations of the genus, &quot;Mammut&quot; occupied an ecological niche that allowed it to actively niche partition (or occupy similar but niche ecological spaces) with other proboscideans of North America in the Neogene-Quaternary. In the Blancan, &quot;M. raki&quot; showed few morphological changes. In stark contrast, the contemporary gomphothere &quot;Stegomastodon&quot; showed progressive developments in response to increasingly arid and extensive grasslands from the Blancan up to the early Irvingtonian, with molar complexities resembling those of &quot;Mammuthus&quot;. The morphology of &quot;Stegomastodon&quot; suggests thus that it was grazing-specialized. A more well-known example of niche partitioning occurred between mastodons and mammoths within the later Pleistocene (Irvingtonian-Rancholabrean). Mammoths had a broader range of diets that allow them to occupy mixed feeding to specialized grazing habits whereas mastodons were specialized browsers that nonetheless still could have consumed a variety of plants. Mammoth diets varied by region whereas those of mastodons remain unclear still. Both at times overlapped in C3 resource usages, although whether this represents browsing or grazing in the case of mammoths remains unclear.

=== Social behaviors ===

American mastodons may have lived in herds, and it is possible that they were smaller than mammoth herds on average. Based on the characteristics of mastodon bone sites and strontium and oxygen isotopes from tusks, it can be inferred that, as in modern proboscideans, the mastodon social group consisted of adult females and young, living in bonded groups called mixed herds. The males abandoned the mixed herds once reaching sexual maturity and lived either alone or in male bond groupings. As in modern elephants, there probably was no seasonal synchrony of mating activity, with both males and females seeking out each other for mating when sexually active. Mastodons and other Pleistocene proboscideans may have used landscapes seasonally then migrated to suitable areas to mate or give birth. It is estimated that it may have taken 9 to 12 years for American mastodon females to become mature enough for reproduction, and they may have slowly reproduced single calves at a time.

The social behaviors of male mastodon were inferred from one individual skeleton known as the &quot;Buesching mastodon&quot; (known informally as &quot;Fred&quot;), which was recovered from a peat farm near Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1998. The mastodon individual lived during the later part of the Bølling–Allerød warming period when human populations were present. The Buesching mastodon&#x27;s tusks grew for about 30 years, and he lived for 34 years total, an approximate lifespan comparable to other males. He may have had engaged in aggressive behavior from musth, although it may have been season-specific compared to living elephants given climatic conditions in North America. He likely engaged in intraspecific competition late in his life with other males during the spring or early summer, and he had tusk fractures and may have been severely wounded from a to puncture to the right-sided temporal fossa. Multiple other males are recorded to have had severe wounds resulting from male-male musth fighting. The Buesching mastodon likely considered central Indiana his main home but went on seasonal migrations in his lifetime. He could have traveled hundreds of kilometers in the process and engaged with mates outside of the herd he was born from. Around his last moments, he probably wandered around in vagabondlike behaviors and spent little time in the area where his skeleton was found. His inferred behavior is quite similar to extant elephants.

== Paleoecology ==
=== Distribution ===

The range of most species of &quot;Mammut&quot; is unknown as their occurrences are restricted to few localities, the exception being the American mastodon (&quot;M. americanum&quot;), which is one of the most widely distributed Pleistocene proboscideans in North America. &quot;M. americanum&quot; fossil sites range in time from the Blancan to Rancholabrean faunal stages and in locations from as far north as Alaska, as far east as Florida, and as far south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico. &quot;M. americanum&quot; was most common in the eastern United States but rarer in the western US in comparison. &quot;M. pacificum&quot; is known across California and present as far north as southern Idaho, but it was apparently absent from both the Sonoran Desert and Mojave Desert regions. The elevated-controlled distributions of coniferous forests within the Rocky Mountain region may have limited populations of &quot;Mammut&quot; compared to the other Plio-Pleistocene proboscideans. The easternmost range of the species was in what is now Montana in the Irvingtonian but may have been extirpated from the area as a result of Illinoian glaciation. An isolated record of &quot;M. americanum&quot; is known from Honduras, where the genus is not recorded to have extended beyond.

&quot;M. matthewi&quot; is known by a wide distribution range, its westernmost range being in California from the Horned Toad Formation in the late Hemphillian. It has also apparently been identified from the latest Hemphillian based on skull material from the Pascagoula Formation in Tunica Hills, Louisiana. This suggests that &quot;Mammut&quot; already had an eastern range in the United States by the latest Miocene or earliest Pliocene. Similarly, the same species is recorded from the Palmetto Fauna locality (Bone Valley Formation) in Brewster, Florida in the latest Hemphillian while &quot;Mammut&quot; sp. is recorded from the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee.

The American mastodon was only present in the far north of North America during interglacial periods, with mitochondrial genome analysis suggesting that separate populations repeatedly colonised the region before becoming extirpated during glacial periods. A 2022 study of ancient environmental DNA from the Kap Kobenhavn Formation of northern Greenland, dating the Early Pleistocene, 2 million years ago, identified preserved DNA fragments of mastodons. This suggests that the mammutids ranged as far north as Greenland during optimal conditions. Around this time, northern Greenland was 11–19 °C warmer than the Holocene, with a boreal forest hosting a species assemblage with no modern analogue. These are among the oldest DNA fragments ever sequenced.

=== Late Neogene-Quaternary North America ===

The overall paleontological record of the Neogene of North America is relatively incomplete compared to other areas of the world. This is the result of a greater fossil record bias of western North America compared to eastern North America, meaning that the western half is better understood in terms of evolutionary and climatic trends while the eastern half is poorly understood. During the late Neogene (8-5 Ma), C4 grasslands spread throughout the North American continent and replaced woodland habitats. In eastern North America were relict woodlands in an increasingly drier climate followed by a large faunal turnover. There was a long-term decline of genus-level faunal diversity, with many large-sized herbivores going extinct. Many of the surviving herbivorous faunas were thus adapted for drier and more open habitats resulting from cooling and increase in seasonality.
The earliest undisputed record of &quot;Mammut&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; was of &quot;M. nevadanum&quot; in the Thousand Creek Formation in Nevada. Coexistent with the mammutid species were a large variety of other mammals, namely those of the Artiodactyla (antilocaprids, camelids, tayassuids), Carnivora (canids, felids, mustelids, ursids), Eulipotyphla (talpids), Lagomorpha (leporids), Perissodactyla (equids, rhinocerotids), and Rodentia (aplodontiids, castorids, geomyids, heteromyids, cricetids, mylagaulids, and sciurids). The latest Hemphillian of Florida based on the Palmetto Fauna of the Bone Valley Formation records the coexistence of &quot;M. matthewi&quot; with similar types of faunas, namely Pilosa (megalonychids), Eulipotyphla (talpids), Lagomorpha (leporids), Carnivora (borophagine canids, canine canids, ursids, procyonids, mustelids including lutrines, feline felids, machairodontine felids), Proboscidea (gomphotheres), Perissodactyla (tapirs, rhinocerotids, hipparionine equids), and Artiodactyla (tayassuids, protoceratids, camelids, &quot;pseudoceratines,&quot; cervids, antilocaprids). North America in the late Neogene is understood to have undergone a long-term decline in large mammal diversity (i.e. the Dromomerycidae, &quot;Blastomerycinae,&quot; Rhinocerotidae) as a result of C4 grassland expansion, cooler climates, and increased seasonality.

The Blancan fossil record suggests a maximum known diversity of four species of &quot;Mammut&quot; (&quot;M. americanum&quot;, &quot;M. vexillarius&quot;, &quot;M. raki&quot;, and &quot;M. cosoensis&quot;). However, the Blancan record of &quot;Mammut&quot; is relatively rare. &quot;M. raki&quot; from the Palomas Formation of Truth or Consequences in New Mexico is recorded with a few other mammalian faunas, namely the megalonychid ground sloth &quot;Megalonyx&quot;, the pocket gopher &quot;Geomys&quot;, the cricetid &quot;Sigmodon&quot;, the equin &quot;Equus&quot;, the hipparionine &quot;Nannippus&quot;, and the camelid &quot;Camelops&quot;. A late Blancan locality known as the Fish Springs Flat Fauna in Nevada reveals that fossils of &quot;M. americanum&quot; were found with those of the leporid &quot;Hypolagus&quot;, lutrine &quot;Satherium&quot;, equid &quot;Equus&quot;, camelid &quot;Gigantocamelus&quot;, gopher &quot;Thomomys&quot;, and the ground squirrel &quot;Spermophilus&quot;.

In the Irvingtonian, only &quot;M. americanum&quot; is recorded to have crossed past the Blancan while &quot;M. pacificum&quot; replaced the other Blancan species. By this time, &quot;Mammut&quot; would have coexisted with the elephantid &quot;Mammuthus&quot; and the gomphotheres &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; and &quot;Stegomastodon&quot;, although the latter failed to survive past the early Irvingtonian. The Middle Pleistocene sites are scarce in North America compared to the Late Pleistocene sites, but from the Irvingtonian to the Rancholabrean, repeated glacial events occurred that led to repeated formations of major ice sheets in northern North America. The Port Kennedy Bone Cave of Pennsylvania is of Irvingtonian age (Middle Pleistocene) and reveals that during this time, &quot;M. americanum&quot; was present with the megalonychid &quot;Megalonyx wheatleyi&quot;, the tremarctine bear &quot;Arctodus pristinus&quot;, the jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), the felid &quot;Miracinonyx inexpectatus&quot;, and the machairodontine &quot;Smilodon gracilis&quot;. The Big Bone Lick locality in Kentucky, which dates to the latest Pleistocene (Rancholabrean), indicates the coexistence of the American mastodon with the extant reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;) along with various other extinct megafauna like ancient bison (&quot;Bison antiquus&quot;), the caprine bovid &quot;Bootherium bombifrons&quot;, mylodontid ground sloth &quot;Paramylodon harlani&quot;, megalonychid &quot;Megalonyx jeffersoni&quot;, true deer &quot;Cervalces scotti&quot;, equid &quot;Equus complicatus&quot;, and the Columbian mammoth.

== Relationship with humans ==

The exact timing of human (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) arrival to temperate North America is unclear, but they likely arrived in North America ∼19,000–14,000 calibrated years Before Present. They are known within the archeological record as Paleoindians and eventually gave rise to modern-day Native Americans. Of interest is that in the Clovis culture phase, there is evidence that Clovis hunters targeted contemporary proboscideans based on archeological &quot;kill sites.&quot; Clovis projectile points and other artifacts have been found in association with both mammoths and mastodons. The former has more frequent evidence of having been hunted by Clovis hunters while mastodons have much fewer in comparison. Todd A. Surovell and Nicole M. Waguespack in 2008 hypothesized that Clovis hunters in North America hunted proboscideans more often than those in any other continent. They addressed that preservation biases of larger mammals in archeological sites may have caused higher representations of proboscidean kill sites but suggested that regardless, Clovis hunters were likely specialized in hunting large game.

As of present, 2 definite &quot;Mammut&quot; kill sites compatible with Clovis lithic technology have been recorded compared to 15 of &quot;Mammuthus&quot; and 1 of &quot;Cuvieronius&quot;. These two kill sites are thought to be from Kimmswick, Missouri and Pleasant Lake in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Whether various other sites can be confirmed as proboscidean butchery sites appear subjective, largely depending on the views of different authors. It is uncertain if Clovis people had hunting strategies of proboscideans similar to tribal Africans, but the Clovis points likely indicate usage as spears for thrusting or throwing at proboscideans (there are disagreements to whether they indicate multiple other usages, however).

According to the American paleontologist Daniel C. Fisher, the &quot;Heisler mastodon&quot; site in Calhoun County, Michigan, which recovered about 50% of the skeleton, was proof of meat caching in a pond by Paleoindians in the late Pleistocene. This hypothesis opposes the notion that proboscideans ended up unable to disentangle themselves in marsh wetlands, which he said there is no evidence of. His hypothesis was based on his experiment with partial carcasses of a horse that was preserved in a shallow lake then extracted as well as a Moravian missionary&#x27;s testimony of Inuit retrieving caribou carcasses from lakes that they probably placed as storage in the cases of excess meat or future limited hunting successes. Fisher said that if his theory is true, then Paleoindian interactions with megafauna (hunting and scavenging) are far more complex than initially thought.
In 2023, Michael R. Waters et al. suggested that the Manis Mastodon site in Washington state supported evidence of a mastodon hunt ~13,900 cal. years BP, some 900 years before Clovis culture. Their study was a continuation of a 2011 anatomical study that proposed that osseous (bone) pieces found in a right rib of a mastodon represented fragmented tips of a projectile point, but it had been repeatedly challenged by other authors. Based on anatomical reevaluations, they determined that the bone fragments were embedded in the Manis mastodon rib while it was alive, as evident by the visible healing around the wounded area. Waters and his colleagues stated that the bone pieces were from an external source, explainable by human-made projectile points. They rejected alternate explanations for why bone fragments ended up in the Manis mastodon rib. Based on this, they envisioned that the mastodon individual was wounded by pre-Clovis hunters and got away, giving it time to heal. Afterwards, it died either by natural causes and was scavenged by humans, or it was killed by them on another attack then butchered. This site proves the existence of pre-Clovis hunting technology that the earliest people brought with them when dispersing to North America and made localized adaptations of.

In 2017, Steven R. Holen et al. published an article arguing that the Cerutti Mastodon site, located in San Diego County in California, is an archeological site involving &quot;M. americanum&quot; that dates to approximately 130,000 years ago. If true, they stated, the site would imply evidence of now-extinct species of &quot;Homo&quot; in North America during the Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5e) temporal range of the early late Pleistocene. The proposal was highly controversial, as many archeologists were skeptical about the claim that the bones of &quot;M. americanum&quot; were broken by hominins, and alternate explanations have been offered. For instance, in the same year the article was published, Gary Haynes expressed concern of it being published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; due to how highly prolific it is. Reporters from print presses and digital media published reactions of the article from various North American archeologists, with Donald K. Grayson stating that it was astonishingly bad, Jon M. Erlandson arguing that the site was non-credible, and various other archeologists arguing that the claim is insufficiently supported. Haynes pointed out that the article&#x27;s claim was &quot;extraordinary&quot; and must therefore be met with rigorous skepticism. He wrote that there were no traces of archeological structures typically built by archaic species of &quot;Homo&quot; (i.e. &quot;H. erectus&quot;, Neanderthals, or Denisovans) in the Cerutti site. Additionally, he brought up the possibilities of the fossil bones being affected by sediment pressures or damage done by earth-moving construction equipments despite the original authors denying the latter possibility.

Multiple petroglyphs suggested to have depicted prehistoric proboscideans in North America like mastodons are known within the United States, but they are either fraudulent or depict entities other than mastodons. As a result, suggested rock art of mammoths and mastodons within North America are not sufficiently credible.

== Extinction ==

&quot;Mammut&quot;, or more specifically the American mastodon, experienced an initial decline in geographical range when it was extirpated from the northernmost ranges of North America ~75,000 years ago. &quot;Mammut&quot; initially occupied the region during the Last Interglacial (~125,000-75,000 years ago) back when suitable forested habitats were present there but was subsequently extirpated in correlation with environmental changes from the Wisconsin glaciation (MIS 4). The local extirpation, occurring long before human arrival, caused the mastodon range to be limited to areas south of North American ice sheets. The steppe-tundra faunas thrived there during the event whereas boreal forest-adapted faunas underwent declines. The trend of recolonization and extirpation appears to have had been a recurring trend in the Pleistocene correlated with repeated returns of forests and wetlands, but what is unclear is why faunas that were able to repeatedly recolonize northern North America during previous interglacial periods were unable to do so again after the Last Glacial Maximum.

The latest Pleistocene of North America records a large extinction phase that resulted in the disappearances of over 30 genera of mammals, the majority of which are considered &quot;megafauna&quot; (~ or larger). &quot;Mammut&quot; was one of the many genera recorded within North America whose extinction causes are currently unresolved. During the latest Pleistocene of North America, two major events occurred: the development of Clovis culture from 13,200 to 12,800 years ago and the onset of the Younger Dryas cold phase from 12,900 to 11,700 years ago. The extinctions of mammalian megafauna in North America are particularly high akin to those of South America and Australia rather than Eurasia and Africa. As a result, the extinctions that occurred in the latest Pleistocene of North America have been mainly attributed to human hunting, climate change, or some combination of the two (there are alternate but lesser-supported hypotheses). Many researchers have struggled to explained the North American extinctions, with both human hunting and climate change explanations alone being challenged. In recent years, research has shifted towards studying the extinctions of North American faunas by individual taxon and/or region rather as a homogenous group. The results vary in regions such as the northeast, with some authors suggesting that there was minimal evidence for Clovis hunting being the major factor behind proboscidean population drops and some others arguing that environmental shifts prior to human arrival were not detrimental enough to the proboscideans.

Paul L. Koch and Anthony D. Barnosky in 2006 suggested that &quot;Mammuthus&quot; was well-associated with archeological sites of North America. In comparison, &quot;Mammut&quot; and the peccary &quot;Platygonus&quot; were far less frequently associated with human sites, potentially suggesting that Paleoindians hunted them less than mammoths. They stated that the current understanding of &quot;Mammut&quot; associations with humans could shift if the supposed butchery sites were better understood while that of &quot;Platygonus&quot; is stable and therefore unlikely to change. In 2018, Jack M. Broughton and Elic M. Weitzel calculated populated dynamics of some of the North American late Pleistocene megafauna based on summed probability distributions (SPDs) using calibrated radiocarbon dates. They determined based on the data that the declines of &quot;Mammuthus&quot;, &quot;Equus&quot;, and &quot;Smilodon&quot; were correlated with Clovis culture hunting while &quot;Mammut&quot; and the nothrotheriid ground sloth &quot;Nothrotheriops&quot; did not exhibit any significant population bust until after Clovis culture and during the Younger Dryas at ~12,650 years ago. They concluded that the declines of megafauna are of mixed causes and that the extinction processes and causes therefore vary by individual taxon and region.

Of note is that there is a recorded latest survival of the American mastodon in the early Holocene. The Overmyer Mastodon individual, recovered from northern Indiana with 41-48% complete remains recovered, exhibits no evidence of weathering or gnawing by other animals. The individual dates from 11,795 to 11,345 years Before Present for a median of 11,576 calibrated years BP, therefore having a secure calibrated radiocarbon date dating to the early Holocene unlike most other extinct North American genera of the terminal Pleistocene. Neal Woodman and Nancy Beavan Athfield stressed that although the early Holocene survival of the species does not eliminate the possibilities that Clovis hunters and/or Younger Dryas impacted their populations in the long term, its survival meant that the genus was not immediately brought to extinction by either factor.

== Cultural significance ==

Late Pleistocene proboscideans of the Americas such as the American mastodon could have been recognized in Native American oral histories, but they are unlikely to have referenced any specific species. Typically, they may have been depicted in Native American oral history as aggressive and antagonistic beasts. Mastodons may have played ancient roles in Native American cultures of the Pacific Northwest. In 1987, Carl E. Gustafson recovered fossil evidence of a late Pleistocene mastodon far away from where the species would typically roam, the radiocarbon dating confirming a date of about 13,800 years ago. The local tribal members identified the remains as being of game pieces for slahal, a gambling game for dispute settlements and entertainment. The bone sticks, carved from mastodon bones, are not easily interpretable archeologically, but tribal members saw the recovery of the items as evidence of the endurance of ancient cultural practices like slahal.

The American mastodon had long been a stand-in within the United States for American nationalism since early American history, and Thomas Jefferson was famously known for having hoped that the Lewis and Clark Expedition would eventually yield evidence of living mastodons in the western frontier of the United States. It was a defining symbol of museums according to Brett Barney as evident by a mention of it by Walt Whitman in a passage of the 1855 poem &quot;Song of Myself.&quot;
The mastodon became the subject of a Michigan political campaign in 2000 when Washtenaw Community College geology instructor David P. Thomas Sr. aimed to make it the state fossil of Michigan. He, assisted by the Slauson Middle School science teacher Jeffrey Bradley, was sponsored by the state senator Thaddeus McCotter, arranged petition drives that collected thousands of signatures, and attended state hearings. Bradley&#x27;s students participated in the &quot;Mastodon for Michigan&quot; campaign, which built a life-sized replica out of paper and raised $1,000 for the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History to build a mastodon exhibit. In 2002, the mastodon became the state fossil, making it the fourteenth state symbol. Similarly, the mastodon became the state fossil of Indiana as recently as 2022 due to House Bill 1013, authored by the representative Randy Frye, passing unanimously.

In January 2024, Indiana senator Mike Braun and Michigan senator Gary Peters introduced a bipartisan bill to make the mastodon the US national fossil is what is called the &quot;National Fossil Act.&quot; Section 1 aims to define the bill&#x27;s name, Section 2 would investigate the roles of the mastodon in American public life, and Section 3 would designate it as the national fossil under Title 36 of the United States Code. Peters justified that the mastodon represents a unique aspect of Michigan&#x27;s history and American history, stating that he hoped that its establishment as the national fossil would preserve the histories and encourage new generations of scientists and other researchers to pursue their goals.

Located in the Mastodon Ridge park in the Canadian town of Stewiacke, Nova Scotia is a large-sized replica of a mastodon based on a skeleton recovered from Nova Scotia. It was sculpted as a clay model, has a weight of ~, is in shoulder height, and measures long. The sculpture took about 8 weeks to be constructed and was sent to the Mastodon Ridge in January 1995.

The name &quot;mastodon&quot; was adopted in different contexts within the United States. For instance, 4-8-0 locomotives of the late 19th century were originally named &quot;Mastodons&quot; before the name was eventually replaced with &quot;12-wheeler.&quot; The name was a reference to the American mastodon. The 4-10-0 locomotive later became known also as &quot;&quot;Mastodon&quot;.&quot; In the 1993-1995 show &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, the Black Ranger Zack Taylor had the mastodon ability and controlled the Mastodon Dinozord machine. The name &quot;Mastodon&quot; was also adopted by a heavy metal band when guitarist Bill Kelliher was asked by the guitarist-singer Brent Hinds asked him about the name of the &quot;fossil elephant&quot; after seeing his tattoo of a Bantha skull from the Star Wars franchise, in which the members then agreed to it being the band&#x27;s name. &quot;Mastodon&quot; is also the name of a blogging social network site that also acquired its name from the extinct proboscidean species.

<text>The Symphony No. 5 by Gustav Mahler was composed in 1901 and 1902, mostly during the summer months at Mahler&#x27;s holiday cottage at Maiernigg. Among its most distinctive features are the trumpet solo that opens the work with a rhythmic motif similar to the opening of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, the horn solos in the third movement and the frequently performed Adagietto.

The musical canvas and emotional scope of the work, which lasts nearly 70 minutes, are huge. The symphony is sometimes described as being in the key of C minor since the first movement is in this key (the finale, however, is in D major). Mahler objected to the label: &quot;From the order of the movements (where the usual first movement now comes second) it is difficult to speak of a key for the &#x27;whole Symphony&#x27;, and to avoid misunderstandings the key should best be omitted.&quot;

==Composition history==

Mahler wrote his fifth symphony during the summers of 1901 and 1902. In February 1901 Mahler had suffered a sudden major hemorrhage and his doctor later told him that he had come within an hour of bleeding to death. The composer spent quite a while recuperating. He moved into his own lakeside villa in the southern Austrian province of Carinthia in June 1901. Mahler was delighted with his newfound status as the owner of a grand villa. According to friends, he could hardly believe how far he had come from his humble beginnings. He was director of the Vienna Court Opera and the principal conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic. His own music was also starting to be successful. Later in 1901 he met Alma Schindler and by the time he returned to his summer villa in summer 1902, they were married and she was expecting their first child.

Symphonies Nos. 5, 6 and 7, which all belong to this period, have much in common and are markedly different from the first four, which all have strong links to vocal music. The middle symphonies, by contrast, are pure orchestral works and are, by Mahler&#x27;s standards, taut and lean.

Counterpoint also becomes a more important element in Mahler&#x27;s music from Symphony No. 5 onwards. The ability to write good counterpoint was highly cherished by Baroque composers, and Johann Sebastian Bach is generally regarded as the greatest composer of contrapuntal music. Bach played an important part in Mahler&#x27;s musical life at this time. He subscribed to the edition of Bach&#x27;s collected works that was being published at the turn of the century, and later conducted and arranged works by Bach for performance. Mahler&#x27;s renewed interest in counterpoint can best be heard in the second, third and fifth movements of this symphony.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for large orchestra, consisting of the following:

;Woodwinds
: 4 flutes (all doubling piccolos)
: 3 oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais)
: 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon)
;Brass
: 6 horns (solo horn in movement 3)
: 4 trumpets
: 3 trombones
: 1 tuba

;Percussion
: 4 timpani
: bass drum
: snare drum (used only in movement 1)
: cymbals
: triangle
: whip (used only in movement 3)
: tam-tam
: glockenspiel

;Strings
: harp

:violin I
:violin II
:viola 
:cello
:double basses
==Revisions of the score==
The score appeared first in print in 1904 at Peters, Leipzig. A second &quot;New Edition&quot;, incorporating revisions that Mahler made in 1904, appeared in 1905. Final revisions made by Mahler in 1911 (by which time he had completed his 9th Symphony) did not appear until 1964 (ed. Ratz), when the score was republished in the &quot;Complete Edition&quot; of Mahler&#x27;s works. In 2001, Edition Peters published a further revised edition (ed. Reinhold Kubik) as part of the &quot;New Complete Critical Edition&quot;. This edition is the most accurate edition available so far. Previous editions have now gone out of print.

==Structure==
The symphony is generally regarded as the most conventional symphony that he had yet written, but from such an unconventional composer it still had many peculiarities. It almost has a four-movement structure, as the first two can easily be viewed as essentially a whole. The symphony also ends with a rondo, in the classical style. Some peculiarities are the funeral march that opens the piece and the Adagietto for harp and strings that contrasts with the complex orchestration of the other movements.

A performance of the symphony lasts around 70 minutes.

The work is in five movements, though Mahler grouped the movements into bigger parts:

:Part I
::1. &quot;Trauermarsch&quot; (Funeral march). &quot;In gemessenem Schritt. Streng. Wie ein Kondukt&quot; (At a measured pace. Strict. Like a funeral procession.) C minor
::2. &quot;Stürmisch bewegt, mit größter Vehemenz&quot; (Moving stormily, with the greatest vehemence) A minor
:Part II
::3. &quot;Scherzo&quot;. &quot;Kräftig, nicht zu schnell&quot; (Strong and not too fast) D major
:Part III
::4. &quot;Adagietto&quot;. &quot;Sehr langsam&quot; (Very slow) F major
::5. &quot;Rondo-Finale&quot;. &quot;Allegro – Allegro giocoso&quot;. &quot;Frisch&quot; (Fresh) D major

===Part I===

==== 1. Trauermarsch ====

The trumpet solo at the opening of the first movement which quotes the &quot;Generalmarsch&quot; of the Austro-Hungarian Army

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;trumpet&quot; \clef treble \key cis \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \tempo 2 = 74 \partial 4*1 \times 2/3 { cis8\p-.\&lt; cis-. cis-. } | cis2\!\sf-&gt; r4 \times 2/3 { cis8\&lt; cis cis } | cis2\!\sf-&gt; r4 \times 2/3 { cis8\&lt; cis cis } | e1\!\sf-&gt;~ | e4 } &lt;/score&gt;
is followed by a somber, funeral march (the primary theme).

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; \clef treble \key cis \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \partial 2*1 cis4.\pp dis8 | e2( gis~) | gis fis4. e8 | dis2( bis~) | bis dis4. e8 | fis2-&gt; fis-&gt; | fis-&gt;( \grace { gis32[ fis] } e4.) dis8 | dis4( e8) r e2~ | e } &lt;/score&gt;
The march is twice interrupted by a calmer secondary theme.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot; \clef treble \key aes \major \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \partial 2*1 &lt;c ees,&gt;4.\pp\&lt;( &lt;des fes,&gt;8\!) | &lt;des fes,&gt;2-&gt;(\&gt; &lt;c ees,&gt;4. &lt;aes c,&gt;8\! | &lt;c ees,&gt;2) &lt;bes des,&gt;4.\&lt;( &lt;c ees,&gt;8\! | &lt;bes des,&gt;4-&gt;\&gt; &lt;aes c,&gt;8) r &lt;aes c,&gt;4.( &lt;ees aes,&gt;8\! | &lt;c aes&gt;2) } &lt;/score&gt;

====2. Stürmisch bewegt, mit größter Vehemenz====

There are many shared elements between the first and second movement. A sighing motif heard in the first movement

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key des \major \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \partial 2*1 aes2(\p\&lt; | ges&#x27;4.\!-&gt;) ges8-.\&gt; f2\! } &lt;/score&gt;
becomes more prominent in the second movement

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot; \clef treble \key a \minor \time 2/2 \partial 4*1 dis\ff( | e&#x27;\sf dis8) } &lt;/score&gt;
and leads into the first theme.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; \clef treble \key a \minor \tempo &quot;Stürmisch bewegt, mit größter Vehemenz&quot; 2 = 110\time 2/2 \partial 4*1 dis\fff(\glissando | f&#x27;!2\sf)~ f8( e) c-. b-. | a2 r8 c\sf-. b-. a-. | gis b a gis b a gis fis | e2 } &lt;/score&gt;
Rehearsal mark 5, marked &quot;im Tempo des ersten Satzes &quot;Trauermarsch&quot;&quot;, introduces a theme accompanied by the sighing motif and a repeated quaver motif from the beginning of the movement.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot; \clef bass \key f \minor \time 2/2 \partial 2*1 c4.\p( f8) | aes1~ | aes2( g4. f8) | aes1~ | aes4 } &lt;/score&gt;
Later, another return to the &quot;Tempo des ersten Satzes: Trauermarsch&quot;, brings a return to the Secondary Theme of the first movement.

A triumphant chorale breaks forth but dissolves into a return of the tragic material of the opening of the movement. Mahler emphasized this point in the score by adding two arrows.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key d \major \time 2/2 \partial 2*1 a2\p(\&lt; | &lt;a&#x27; fis d&gt;1\!\f | &lt;g e b&gt;\sf)~ | &lt;g e b&gt;\&gt; | &lt;a fis d&gt;\!\sf | &lt;fis d a&gt;2-&gt; r4 &lt;e cis a&gt;8-&gt; r | &lt;d b fis&gt;1-&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

===Part II===
====3. Scherzo====

The central scherzo develops several waltz and ländler themes. The mood abruptly shifts from the pessimism and storminess of the first two movements to a lighter, affirmative disposition, aided by the dance rhythms. This sudden change in the musical temperament exposes the &quot;schizophrenic character&quot; of the symphony, since the tragic nature of the first two movements is not reconciled with the more joyful mood of the scherzo. An obbligato solo horn is featured prominently throughout the movement.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key d \major \time 3/4 d8-.\sf fis-. a,2-&gt; | r4 b8-.\&lt; cis-. d-. fis-.\! | b2.~\p\&lt; | b8\ff-. r a4. fis8 | e-. r d4. fis8 | a2.\fp } &lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key bes \major \time 3/4 \autoBeamOff g4\p( r8 d) f-. r | g4--( r8 c,-.) f4(~ | f\glissando bes8) r } &lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key f \minor \time 3/4 g2(\p aes4) | g2( f4) | ees(\&lt; g, g&#x27;)\! | f2 } &lt;/score&gt;

===Part III===
====4. Adagietto====

The Adagietto is scored for only the string section and a solo harp. The themes are:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key f \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*3 c8(\pp\&lt;-- d-- e--)\! | e4\pp( f4.)\breathe f8( bes a) | a4( g4.) } &lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key f \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*1 c8\f(\&lt; | d\! f) f2( ees8) d | \slashedGrace { aes8( } d4)( f2 \grace {g16[ f] } ees8 d) | \slashedGrace { g8( } f4)\&gt;( ees)\! } &lt;/score&gt;
The fourth movement may be Mahler&#x27;s most famous composition and is the most frequently performed of his works. The British premiere of the entire Symphony No. 5 came in 1945, 36 years after that of the Adagietto, which was conducted by Henry Wood at a Proms concert in 1909.

It is said to represent Mahler&#x27;s love song to his wife Alma. According to a letter she wrote to Willem Mengelberg, the composer left a small poem:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Wie ich Dich liebe, Du meine Sonne,&quot;
&quot;ich kann mit Worten Dir&#x27;s nicht sagen.&quot;
&quot;Nur meine Sehnsucht kann ich Dir klagen&quot;
&quot;und meine Liebe, meine Wonne!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;In which way I love you, my sunbeam,
I cannot tell you with words.
Only my longing, my love and my bliss
can I with anguish declare. &lt;/poem&gt;

This German text can easily be sung to the first theme of the Adagietto, beginning with the anacrusis to bar 3, reinforcing the suggestion that it is indeed intended as Mahler&#x27;s love note to Alma and returning to the more vocal quality of the earlier symphonies.

Mahler&#x27;s instruction is &quot;Sehr langsam&quot; (very slowly). Mahler and Mengelberg played it in about 7 minutes. Some conductors have taken tempos that extend it to nearly 12 minutes (viz. recordings by Eliahu Inbal, Herbert von Karajan, and Claudio Abbado), while Simon Rattle with the Berlin Philharmonic performed it in minutes. The shortest recorded performance is from Mengelberg (Concertgebouw, 1926) at 7′04″. The longest commercial recording is Bernard Haitink (Berliner Philharmoniker, 1988) at 13′55″. A recording of a live performance with Hermann Scherchen conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1964 lasts 15′15″.

Leonard Bernstein conducted it during the funeral Mass for Robert F. Kennedy at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Manhattan, on 8 June 1968, and he also briefly discusses this section along with the opening bars of the second movement in his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures from 1973.

Although the Adagietto had regularly been performed on its own, it came to popular (i.e. non-classical) prominence in the 1971 Luchino Visconti film &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. In that film, the lead character was modified from the novel&#x27;s original conception of writer to that of composer, with elements in common with Mahler. Since then, the music has been used across many fields, from advertising and figure skating to television and further film uses, easily making it the most familiar piece of Mahler&#x27;s musical output.

Music professor Jeremy Barham writes that the Adagietto has become the most &quot;commercially prominent&quot; of Mahler&#x27;s symphonic movements, and that it has &quot;accrued elegiac meaning&quot; in the popular consciousness over the years, becoming particularly used in commemorative events following the September 11 attacks in the United States.

====5. Rondo finale====

The final rondo is a contrapuntal tour de force. Several of the themes evolve out of the fragments heard in the opening measures. The last movement also utilizes themes from the Adagietto as well as the chorale from the second movement.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key d \major \time 2/2 a2\f-&gt; e-&gt; | a1\fp } &lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key d \major \time 2/2 \partial 4*1 a8\f-. r | d-. e-. fis-. g-. a-. r a-. r | d-. r cis-. b-. a2 } &lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key d \major \time 2/2 fis\p( e d a&#x27;) | b1( | a) } &lt;/score&gt;
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key d \major \time 2/2 e2\f-&gt; a-&gt; | b4-. b-. e-. e-. | cis-. cis-. | a&#x27;2 } &lt;/score&gt;

==Reaction==
* Herbert von Karajan once said that when you hear the symphony, &quot;you forget that time has passed. A great performance of the Fifth is a transforming experience.&quot;

<doc id="187903" wikidata="Q5199423" url="?curid=187903" title="Cymbals (Japanese band)">
<text>was a Japanese rock band active from 1997–2003. The trio was composed of vocalist , bassist/guitarist , and drummer . Like other Japanese bands which emerged in the late 1990s (including Clammbon and Hermann H. &amp; the Pacemakers), Cymbals were strongly influenced by the British pop-rock sounds of the 1960s. Due to their eclectic blend of styles, the band is often linked to Shibuya-kei. Despite solid songwriting and album production, they never scored a true &quot;hit&quot;, which eventually resulted in the band&#x27;s breakup in September 2003. They played a final 90-minute farewell concert at Shibuya O-East on January 20, 2004. The group&#x27;s members remain musically active – Toki as a solo artist, Okii as a producer (for Toki and others), and Yano as a session drummer and producer.

<doc id="187904" wikidata="Q152779" url="?curid=187904" title="Louise Brooks">
<text>Mary Louise Brooks (November 14, 1906 – August 8, 1985) was an American film actress during the 1920s and 1930s. She is regarded today as an icon of the flapper culture, in part due to the bob hairstyle that she helped popularize during the prime of her career.

At the age of 15, Brooks began her career as a dancer and toured with the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts where she performed opposite Ted Shawn. After being fired, she found employment as a chorus girl in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; and as a semi-nude dancer in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; in New York City. While dancing in the &quot;Follies&quot;, Brooks came to the attention of Walter Wanger, a producer at Paramount Pictures, and signed a five-year contract with the studio. She appeared in supporting roles in various Paramount films before taking the heroine&#x27;s role in &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; (1928). During this time, she became an intimate friend of actress Marion Davies and joined the elite social circle of press baron William Randolph Hearst at Hearst Castle in San Simeon.

Dissatisfied with her mediocre roles in Hollywood films, Brooks went to Germany in 1929 and starred in three feature films that launched her to international stardom: &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929), &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot; (1929), and &quot;Miss Europe (Prix de Beauté)&quot; (1930); the first two were directed by G. W. Pabst. By 1938, she had starred in 17 silent films and eight sound films. After retiring from acting, she fell upon financial hardship and became what she termed &quot;a kept woman&quot; by three wealthy men. For the next two decades, she struggled with alcoholism and suicidal tendencies. Following the rediscovery of her films by cinephiles in the 1950s, a reclusive Brooks began writing articles about her film career; her insightful essays drew considerable acclaim. She published her memoir, &quot;Lulu in Hollywood&quot;, in 1982. Three years later, she died of a heart attack at age 78.

== Early life ==

Brooks was born in Cherryvale, Kansas, the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a lawyer, who was usually preoccupied with his legal practice, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who said that any &quot;squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves&quot;. Rude was a talented pianist who played the latest Debussy and Ravel for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music.

Brooks described the hometown of her childhood as a typical Midwestern community where the inhabitants &quot;prayed in the parlor and practiced incest in the barn.&quot; When Louise was nine years old, a neighborhood man sexually abused her. Beyond the physical trauma at the time, the event continued to have damaging psychological effects on her personal life as an adult and on her career. That early abuse caused her later to acknowledge that she was incapable of real love, explaining that this man: &quot;must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure ... For me, nice, soft, easy men were never enough — there had to be an element of domination.&quot; When Brooks at last told her mother of the incident, many years later, her mother suggested that it must have been Louise&#x27;s fault for &quot;leading him on&quot;. In 1919, Brooks and her family moved to Independence, Kansas, before relocating to Wichita in 1920.

Brooks began her entertainment career as a dancer, joining the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts modern dance company in Los Angeles at the age of 15 in 1922. The company included founders Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, as well as a young Martha Graham. As a member of the globe-trotting troupe, Brooks spent a season abroad in London and in Paris. In her second season with the Denishawn company, she advanced to a starring role in one work opposite Shawn. But one day, a long-simmering personal conflict between Brooks and St. Denis boiled over, and St. Denis abruptly fired Brooks from the troupe in the spring of 1924, telling her in front of the other members: &quot;I am dismissing you from the company because you want life handed to you on a silver salver.&quot; These words made a strong impression on Brooks; when she drew up an outline for a planned autobiographical novel in 1949, &quot;The Silver Salver&quot; was the title she gave the tenth and final chapter. Brooks was 17 years old at the time of her dismissal. Thanks to her friend Barbara Bennett, the sister of Constance and Joan Bennett, Brooks almost immediately found employment as a chorus girl in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;, followed by an appearance as a semi-nude dancer in the 1925 edition of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; at the Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street.

As a result of her work in the &quot;Follies&quot;, Brooks came to the attention of Walter Wanger, a producer at Paramount Pictures. An infatuated Wanger signed her to a five-year contract with the studio in 1925. Soon after, Brooks met movie star Charlie Chaplin at a cocktail party given by Wanger. Chaplin was in town for the premiere of his film &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; (1925) at the Strand Theatre on Broadway. Chaplin and Brooks had a two-month affair that summer while Chaplin was married to Lita Grey. When their affair ended, Chaplin sent her a check; she declined to write him a thank-you note.

== Career ==
=== Paramount films ===
Brooks made her screen debut in the silent &quot;The Street of Forgotten Men&quot;, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others.

After her small roles in 1925, both Paramount and MGM offered her contracts. At the time, Brooks had an on-and-off affair with Walter Wanger, head of Paramount Pictures and husband of actress Justine Johnstone. Wanger tried to persuade her to take the MGM contract to avoid rumors that she only obtained the Paramount contract because of her intimate relationship with him. Despite his advice, she accepted Paramount&#x27;s offer. During this time, Brooks gained a cult following in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the 1928 Howard Hawks silent buddy film &quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot;. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend, and many women styled their hair in imitation of both her and fellow film star Colleen Moore.

In the early sound film drama &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; (1928), Brooks plays an abused country girl who kills her foster father when he &quot;attempts, one sunny morning, to rape her.&quot; A hobo (Richard Arlen) happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by &quot;riding the rails&quot; with him. In a hobo encampment, or &quot;jungle,&quot; they meet another hobo (Wallace Beery). Brooks&#x27;s disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location in the Jacumba Mountains near the Mexican border, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies.

The filming of &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; proved to be an ordeal for Brooks. During the production, she had a one-night stand with a stuntman who — the next day — spread a malicious false rumor on the set that Brooks had contracted a venereal disease during a previous weekend stay with a producer, ostensibly Jack Pickford. Concurrently, Brooks&#x27;s interactions with her co-star Richard Arlen deteriorated, as Arlen was a close friend of Brooks&#x27;s then-husband Eddie Sutherland and, according to Brooks, Arlen took a dim view of her casual liaisons with crew members. Amid these tensions, Brooks repeatedly clashed with Wellman, whose risk-taking directing style nearly killed her in a scene where she recklessly climbs aboard a moving train.

Soon after the production of &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; was completed, Brooks began filming the pre-Code crime-mystery film &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; (1929). By this time she was socializing with wealthy and famous persons. She was a frequent house guest of media magnate William Randolph Hearst and his mistress Marion Davies at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, being intimate friends with Davies&#x27;s lesbian niece, Pepi Lederer. While partying with Lederer, Brooks had a brief sexual liaison with her. At some point in their friendship, Hearst and Davies were made aware of Lederer&#x27;s lesbianism. Hearst arranged for Lederer to be committed to a mental institution for drug addiction. Several days after her arrival at the institution, Lederer — Brooks&#x27;s closest friend and companion — committed suicide by jumping to her death from a hospital window. This event traumatized Brooks and likely led to her further dissatisfaction with Hollywood and the West Coast.

Brooks, who now loathed the Hollywood &quot;scene&quot;, refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise. Learning of her refusal, her friend and lover George Preston Marshall counseled her to sail with him to Europe in order to make films with director G. W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian director. On the last day of filming &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; Brooks departed Paramount Pictures to leave Hollywood for Berlin to work for Pabst. It was not until thirty years later that this rebellious decision would come to be seen as arguably the most beneficial to her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit.

While her snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her altogether in Hollywood, her subsequent refusal, after returning from Germany, to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Angered by her refusal, the studio allegedly claimed that Brooks&#x27;s voice was unsuitable for sound pictures and another actress, Margaret Livingston, was hired to dub Brooks&#x27;s voice for the film.

=== European films ===
Brooks traveled to Europe accompanied by Marshall and his English valet. The German film industry was Hollywood&#x27;s only major rival at the time, and the film industry based in Berlin was known as the &quot;Filmwelt&quot; (&quot;film world&quot;), reflecting its self-image as a highly glamorous &quot;exclusive club&quot;. After their arrival in Weimar Germany, she starred in the 1929 silent film &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, directed by Pabst in his New Objectivity period. Pabst was one of the leading directors of the &quot;filmwelt&quot;, known for his refined, elegant films that represented the &quot;filmwelt&quot; &quot;at the height of its creative powers&quot;. The film &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; is based on two plays by Frank Wedekind (&quot;Erdgeist&quot; and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot;), and Brooks plays the central figure, Lulu. This film is notable for its frank treatment of modern sexual mores, including one of the first overt on-screen portrayals of a lesbian.

Brooks&#x27;s performance in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; made her a star. In looking for the right actress to play Lulu, Pabst had rejected Marlene Dietrich as &quot;too old and too obvious&quot;. In choosing Brooks, a relative unknown who had only appeared — not to very great effect — in secondary roles, Pabst was going against the advice of those around him. Brooks recalled that &quot;when we made &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, Mr. Pabst was a man of 43 who astonished me with his knowledge on practically any subject. I, who astonished him because I knew practically nothing on every subject, celebrated my twenty-second birthday with a beer party on a London street.&quot; Brooks claimed her experience shooting &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; in Germany was a pleasant one:

After the filming of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; concluded, Brooks had a one-night stand with Pabst, and the director cast Brooks again in his controversial social drama &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot; (1929), based on the book by Margarete Böhme. In performing &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot;, Brooks drew upon her memories of being molested as a 9-year-old and then being blamed by her mother for her own molestation, later recalling on that day she became one of the &quot;lost&quot;. On the final day of shooting &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot;, Pabst counseled Brooks not to return to Hollywood and instead to stay in Germany and to continue her career as a serious actress. Pabst expressed concern that Brooks&#x27;s carefree approach towards her career would end in dire poverty &quot;exactly like Lulu&#x27;s&quot;. He further cautioned Brooks that Marshall and her &quot;rich American friends&quot; would likely shun her when her career stalled.

When audiences and critics first viewed Brooks&#x27;s German films, they were bewildered by her naturalistic acting style. Viewers purportedly exited the theatre vocally complaining, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t act! She does nothing!&quot; In the late 1920s, cinemagoers were habituated to stage-style acting with exaggerated body language and facial expressions. Brooks&#x27;s acting style was subtle because she understood that the close-up images of the actors&#x27; bodies and faces made such exaggerations unnecessary. Explaining her method, Brooks said that acting &quot;does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation.&quot; This innovative style continues to be used by contemporary film actors but, at the time, it was surprising to viewers who assumed she wasn&#x27;t acting at all. Film critic Roger Ebert later wrote that, by employing this method, &quot;Brooks became one of the most modern and effective of actors, projecting a presence that could be startling.&quot;

Her appearances in Pabst&#x27;s two films made Brooks an international star. According to film critic and historian Molly Haskell, the films &quot;expos[ed] her animal sensuality and turn[ed] her into one of the most erotic figures on the screen — the bold, black-helmeted young girl who, with only a shy grin to acknowledge her &#x27;fall,&#x27; became a prostitute in &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot; and who, with no more sense of sin than a baby, drives men out of their minds in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;.&quot;

Near the end of 1929, English film critic and journalist Cedric Belfrage interviewed Pabst for an article about Brooks&#x27;s film work in Europe that was published in the February 1930 issue of the American monthly &quot;Motion Picture&quot;. According to Belfrage, Pabst attributed Brooks&#x27;s acting success outside the U.S. to her seemingly inherent or instinctive &quot;European&quot; sensibilities:

Belfarge elaborated on Brooks&#x27;s opinion of Hollywood, and referred to Pabst&#x27;s firsthand knowledge of that opinion. &quot;The very mention of the place,&quot; he stated, &quot;gives her a sensation of nausea.&quot; He continued, &quot;The pettiness of it, the dullness, the monotony, the stupidity — no, no, that is no place for Louise Brooks.&quot;

After the success of her German films, Brooks appeared in one more European film, &quot;Miss Europe&quot; (1930), a French film by Italian director Augusto Genina.

=== Return to America ===
Dissatisfied with Europe, Brooks returned to New York in December 1929. When she returned to Hollywood in 1931, she was cast in two mainstream films, &quot;God&#x27;s Gift to Women&quot; (1931) and &quot;It Pays to Advertise&quot; (1931), but her performances were largely ignored by critics, and few other job offers were forthcoming due to her informal &quot;blacklisting&quot;. As the sole member of the cast who had refused to return to make the talkie version of &quot;The Canary Murder Case,&quot; Brooks became convinced that &quot;no major studio would hire [her] to make a film.&quot;

Purportedly, Wellman — despite their previous acrimonious relationship on &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; — offered Brooks the female lead in his new picture &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, starring James Cagney. Brooks turned down Wellman&#x27;s offer in order to visit Marshall in New York City, and the coveted role instead went to Jean Harlow, who then began her own rise to stardom. Brooks later claimed she declined the role because she &quot;hated Hollywood,&quot; but film historian James Card, who came to know Brooks intimately later in her life, said that Brooks &quot;just wasn&#x27;t interested ... She was more interested in Marshall&quot;. In the opinion of biographer Barry Paris, &quot;turning down &quot;Public Enemy&quot; marked the real end of Louise Brooks&#x27;s film career&quot;.

She returned to Hollywood after being offered of a $500 weekly salary from Columbia Pictures but, after refusing to do a screen test for a Buck Jones Western film, the contract offer was withdrawn. She made one more film at that time, a two-reel comedy short, &quot;Windy Riley Goes Hollywood&quot; (1931), directed by disgraced Hollywood outcast Fatty Arbuckle, who worked under the pseudonym &quot;William Goodrich&quot;.

Brooks declared bankruptcy in 1932, and began dancing in nightclubs to earn a living. She attempted a film comeback in 1936 and did a bit part in &quot;Empty Saddles&quot;, a Western that led Columbia to offer her a screen test, contingent on appearing in the 1937 musical &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot;, uncredited, as a specialty ballerina in the chorus. In 1937, Brooks obtained a bit part in the film &quot;King of Gamblers&quot; after a private interview on a Paramount set with director Robert Florey, who &quot;specialised in giving jobs to destitute and sufficiently grateful actresses.&quot; Unfortunately, after filming, Brooks&#x27;s scenes were deleted.

Brooks made two more films after that, including the 1938 Western &quot;Overland Stage Raiders&quot; in which she played the romantic lead opposite John Wayne, with a long hairstyle that rendered her all but unrecognizable from her Lulu days. In contemporary reviews of the film in newspapers and trade publications, Brooks received little attention from critics. The review by &quot;The Film Daily&quot; in September 1938 provides one example, barely mentioning her, saying only, &quot;Louise Brooks makes an appearance as a female attraction.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;, the nation&#x27;s leading entertainment publication, also devoted very little ink to her in its review. &quot;Louise Brooks is the femme appeal with nothing much to do&quot;, it reports, &quot;except look glamorous in a shoulder-length straight-bang coiffure.&quot;

== Life after film ==
=== Economic hardship ===
Brooks&#x27;s career prospects as a film actress had significantly declined by 1940. According to the federal census in May that year, she was living in a $55-a-month apartment at 1317 North Fairfax Avenue in West Hollywood and was working as a copywriter for a magazine. Soon, however, Brooks found herself unemployed and increasingly desperate for a steady income. She also realized during this time that &quot;the only people who wanted to see me were men who wanted to sleep with me.&quot; That realization was underscored by Brooks&#x27;s longtime friend, Paramount executive Walter Wanger, who warned her that she would likely &quot;become a call girl&quot; if she remained in Hollywood. Upon hearing Wanger&#x27;s warning, Brooks purportedly also remembered Pabst&#x27;s earlier predictions about the dire circumstances to which she would be driven if her career stalled in Hollywood: &quot;I heard his [Pabst&#x27;s] words again — hissing back to me. And listening this time, I packed my trunks and went home to Kansas.&quot;

Brooks briefly returned to Wichita, where she was raised, but this undesired return &quot;turned out to be another kind of hell&quot;. &quot;I retired first to my father&#x27;s home in Wichita,&quot; she later recalled, &quot;but there I found that the citizens could not decide whether they despised me for having once been a success away from home or for now being a failure in their midst&quot;. For her part, Brooks admitted that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t exactly enchanted with them,&quot; and &quot;I must confess to a lifelong curse: My own failure as a social creature.&quot;

After an unsuccessful attempt at operating a dance studio, she returned to New York City. Following brief stints there as a radio actor in soap operas and a gossip columnist, she worked as a salesgirl in a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. Between 1948 and 1953, Brooks embarked upon a career as a courtesan with a few select wealthy men as clients. As her finances eroded, an impoverished Brooks began working regularly for an escort agency in New York. Recalling this difficult period in her memoirs, Brooks wrote that she frequently pondered suicide:

Brooks spent subsequent years &quot;drinking and escorting&quot; while subsisting in obscurity and poverty in a small New York apartment. By this time, &quot;all of her rich and famous friends had forgotten her.&quot; Angered by this ostracism, she attempted to write a tell-all memoir titled &quot;Naked on My Goat&quot;, a title drawn from Goethe&#x27;s epic play, &quot;Faust&quot;. After working on that autobiography for years, Brooks destroyed the entire manuscript by throwing it into an incinerator. As time passed, she increasingly drank more and continued to suffer from suicidal tendencies.

=== Rediscovery ===
In 1955, French film historians such as Henri Langlois rediscovered Brooks&#x27;s films, proclaiming her an unparalleled actress who surpassed even Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo as a film icon, much to her purported amusement. This rediscovery led to a Louise Brooks film festival in 1957 and rehabilitated her reputation in her home country.

During this time, James Card, the film curator for the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, discovered Brooks &quot;living as a recluse&quot; in New York City. He persuaded her in 1956 to move to be near the George Eastman House film collection where she could study cinema and write about her past career. With Card&#x27;s assistance, she became a noted film writer. Although Brooks had been a heavy drinker since the age of 14, she remained relatively sober to begin writing perceptive essays on cinema in film magazines, which became her second career. A collection of her writings, titled &quot;Lulu in Hollywood&quot;, published in 1982 and still in print, was heralded by film critic Roger Ebert as &quot;one of the few film books that can be called indispensable.&quot;

In her later years, Brooks rarely granted interviews, yet had special relationships with film historians John Kobal and Kevin Brownlow. In the 1970s, she was interviewed extensively on film for the documentaries &quot;Memories of Berlin: The Twilight of Weimar Culture&quot; (1976), produced and directed by Gary Conklin, and &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), by Brownlow and David Gill. &quot;Lulu in Berlin&quot; (1984) is another rare filmed interview, produced by Richard Leacock and Susan Woll, released a year before her death but filmed a decade earlier. In 1979, she was profiled by the film writer Kenneth Tynan in his essay &quot;The Girl in the Black Helmet&quot;, the title an allusion to her bobbed hair, worn since childhood. In 1982, writer Tom Graves was allowed into Brooks&#x27;s small apartment for an interview, and later wrote about the often awkward and tense conversation in his article &quot;My Afternoon with Louise Brooks&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and relationships ===
In the summer of 1926, Brooks married Eddie Sutherland, the director of the film she made with W. C. Fields, but by 1927 had become infatuated with George Preston Marshall, owner of a chain of laundries and future owner of the Washington Redskins football team, following a chance meeting with him that she later referred to as &quot;the most fateful encounter of my life&quot;. She divorced Sutherland, mainly due to her budding relationship with Marshall, in June 1928. Sutherland was purportedly extremely distraught when Brooks divorced him and, on the first night after their separation, he attempted to take his life with an overdose of sleeping pills.

Throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, Brooks continued her on-again, off-again relationship with George Preston Marshall, which she later described as abusive. Marshall was purportedly &quot;her frequent bedfellow and constant adviser between 1927 and 1933.&quot; Marshall repeatedly asked her to marry him but, after learning that she had had many affairs while they were together and believing her to be incapable of fidelity, he married film actress Corinne Griffith instead.

In 1925, Brooks sued the New York glamour photographer John de Mirjian to prevent publication of his risqué studio portraits of her; the lawsuit made him notorious.

In 1933, she married Chicago millionaire Deering Davis, a son of Nathan Smith Davis Jr., but abruptly left him in March 1934 after only five months of marriage, &quot;without a good-bye ... and leaving only a note of her intentions&quot; behind her. According to Card, Davis was just &quot;another elegant, well-heeled admirer&quot;, nothing more. The couple officially divorced in 1938.

In her later years, Brooks insisted that both her previous marriages were loveless and that she had never loved anyone in her lifetime: &quot;As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve never been in love. And if I had loved a man, could I have been faithful to him? Could he have trusted me beyond a closed door? I doubt it.&quot; Despite her two marriages, she never had children, referring to herself as &quot;Barren Brooks.&quot; Her many paramours from years before had included a young William S. Paley, the founder of CBS. Paley provided a small monthly stipend to Brooks for the remainder of her life, and this stipend kept her from committing suicide at one point.

Sometime in September 1953, Brooks converted to Roman Catholicism, but she left the church in 1964.

=== Sexuality ===
By her own admission, Brooks was a sexually liberated woman, unafraid to experiment, even posing nude for art photography.

Brooks enjoyed fostering speculation about her sexuality, cultivating friendships with lesbian and bisexual women including Pepi Lederer and Peggy Fears, but eschewing relationships. She admitted to some lesbian dalliances, including a one-night stand with Greta Garbo. She later described Garbo as masculine but a &quot;charming and tender lover&quot;. Despite all this, she considered herself neither lesbian nor bisexual:

According to biographer Barry Paris, Brooks had a &quot;clear preference for men&quot;, but she did not discourage the rumors that she was a lesbian, both because she relished their shock value, which enhanced her aura, and because she personally valued feminine beauty. Paris claims that Brooks &quot;loved women as a homosexual man, rather than as a lesbian, would love them. ... The operative rule with Louise was neither heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. It was just sexuality ...&quot;

== Death ==
On August 8, 1985, after suffering from degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip and emphysema for many years, Brooks died of a heart attack in her apartment in Rochester, New York.
== Legacy ==
Since her death in 1985, significant allusions to Brooks have appeared in novels, comics, music, and film.

=== Film ===

Brooks has inspired cinematic characters such as Sally Bowles in Bob Fosse&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Cabaret&quot;. For her portrayal of Bowles, Liza Minnelli reinvented the character with &quot;Lulu makeup and helmet-like coiffure&quot; based on Brooks&#x27;s 1920s persona. Similarly, films such as Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Something Wild&quot; features a reckless femme fatale (Melanie Griffith) who calls herself &quot;Lulu&quot; and wears a bob, and in the 1992 film &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;, Isabella Rossellini plays Lisle von Rhoman, a character inspired by Brooks. In Nora Ephron&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;, Liev Schreiber portrays a character with a strong resemblance to Ms. Brooks for the cut of her hair, her mannerisms and facial expressions. More recently, in 2018, the PBS film &quot;The Chaperone&quot; was released, which depicts Brooks&#x27;s initial arrival in New York and alludes to her career decline as an actress. The film stars Haley Lu Richardson and Elizabeth McGovern.

=== Novels ===
Brooks&#x27;s film persona served as the literary inspiration for Adolfo Bioy Casares when he wrote his science fiction novel &quot;The Invention of Morel&quot; (1940) about a man attracted to Faustine, a woman who is only a projected 3-D image. In a 1995 interview, Casares explained that Faustine is directly based on his love for Louise Brooks who &quot;vanished too early from the movies&quot;. Elements of &quot;The Invention of Morel&quot;, minus the science fiction elements, served as a basis for Alain Resnais&#x27;s 1961 film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;.

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, the character Czernobog refers to Brooks as the greatest movie star of all time. In Ali Smith&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;There But For The&quot;, the character Brooke Bayoude is revealed at a dinner party to have been named after Louise Brooks, though in a play on Brooks&#x27;s name the dinner guests apparently mistake Brooks for Debbie Flood or Louise Woodward. In her 2011 novel of supernatural horror, &quot;Houdini Heart&quot;, Ki Longfellow uses Brooks as an actual character in the leading character&#x27;s visions. Brooks appears as a central character in the 2012 novel &quot;The Chaperone&quot; by Laura Moriarty. In Gayle Forman&#x27;s novels &quot;Just One Day&quot; and &quot;Just One Year&quot;, the protagonist is called &quot;Lulu&quot; because her bobbed hair resembles Brooks&#x27;.

In 1987, the Dutch author Willem Frederik Hermans published a book, &quot;The Saint of the Clockmakers&quot;, in which Louise Brooks plays a role.

=== Comics ===

Brooks also had a significant influence in the graphics world. She inspired the long-running &quot;Dixie Dugan&quot; newspaper strip by John H. Striebel. The strip began in the late 1920s and ran until 1966. It grew out of the serialized novel and later stage musical, &quot;Show Girl&quot;, that writer J. P. McEvoy had loosely based on Brooks&#x27;s days as a Follies girl on Broadway.

Brooks also inspired the erotic comic books of &quot;Valentina&quot;, by the late Guido Crepax, which began publication in 1965 and continued for many years. Crepax became a friend and regular correspondent of Brooks late in her life. Hugo Pratt, another comics artist, also used her as inspiration for characters, and even named them after her.

Other comics have drawn upon Brooks&#x27;s distinctive hair-style. Brooks was the visual model for the character of Ivy Pepper in Tracy Butler&#x27;s &quot;Lackadaisy&quot; comic series. More recently, illustrator Rick Geary published a 2015 graphic novel entitled &quot;Louise Brooks: Detective&quot; in which Brooks, &quot;her movie career having sputtered to a stop,&quot; returns to her native Kansas in 1940 and becomes a private investigator who solves murders.

=== Music ===
Brooks has been referenced in a number of songs. In 1991, British new wave group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark released &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; as a tribute to Brooks&#x27;s film. Similarly, Soul Coughing&#x27;s 1998 song &quot;St. Louise Is Listening&quot; contains several references to Brooks, and the song &quot;Interior Lulu&quot; released the next year by Marillion is a reference to Brooks and mentions her in its first lines.

In 2011, American metal group Metallica and singer-songwriter Lou Reed released the double album &quot;Lulu&quot; with a Brooks-like mannequin on the cover. In Natalie Merchant&#x27;s self-titled 2014 album, the song &quot;Lulu&quot; is a biographical portrait of Brooks.

== Filmography ==

As is the case with many of her contemporaries, a number of Brooks&#x27;s films are considered to be lost. Her key films survive, however, particularly &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot;, which have been released on DVD in North America by the Criterion Collection and Kino Video, respectively.

As of 2007, &quot;Miss Europe&quot; and &quot;The Show Off&quot; have also seen limited North American DVD release. Her short film (and one of her only talkies) &quot;Windy Riley Goes Hollywood&quot; was included on the DVD release of &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot;. Her final film, &quot;Overland Stage Raiders&quot;, was released on VHS and then in 2012 on DVD.

<doc id="187911" wikidata="Q336264" url="?curid=187911" title="Kyoto University">
<text>, or , is a national research university located in Kyoto, Japan. Founded in 1897, it is one of the former Imperial Universities and the second oldest university in Japan.

The university has ten undergraduate faculties, eighteen graduate schools, and thirteen research institutes. The university&#x27;s educational and research activities are centred in its three main campuses in Kyoto: Yoshida, Uji and Katsura. The Kyoto University Library Network, consisting of more than 40 libraries spread across its campuses, has a collection of more than 7.49 million books, making it the second largest university library in the country. In addition to these campuses, the university owns facilities and lands for educational and research purposes around the country.

As of 2024, Kyoto University counts two Prime Ministers of Japan amongst its alumni. Additionally, three Prime Ministers of Japan attended the Third Higher School, a university preparatory school that merged into KyotoU in 1951. 19 Nobel Prize laureates, two Fields Medalists, one Gauss Prize winner, and five Lasker Award recipients have been affiliated with KyotoU either as alumni or faculty members.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
Kyoto University can trace its roots back to the , an institution for Chemistry and Physics founded in Osaka in 1869. Seimi is a Japanese transcription of the Dutch word chemie, meaning chemistry. In 1894, this institution was replaced by the Third Higher School, which was a specialised boys&#x27; boarding school. Back then, the country had only one university, the Imperial University (today&#x27;s University of Tokyo), and the call for the nation&#x27;s second university in the Kansai region was gaining momentum. However, due to financial reasons, the government was reluctant to do so.

The situation changed when the aristocratic politician Saionji Kinmochi, who was from a prominent &quot;kuge&quot; family in Kyoto, suggested the founding of the nation&#x27;s second university using war reparations from the First Sino-Japanese War. This plan was edicted accordingly in 1896, and was established on June 18, 1897, as the second university in the country. The University started using Third Higher School&#x27;s buildings, and the higher school moved to a patch of land across the street, where the southern section of the Yoshida Campus stands today. The Imperial University in Tokyo was renamed Tokyo Imperial University following the founding of its counterpart in Kyoto.

It started teaching with the College of Science and Engineering in the year of its foundation, which was followed by the establishment of the College of Law in 1898. Other faculties and colleges were established during its first decade as a university. The low rates of success of its graduates in the Higher Civil Service Examinations led to the Chief Commercial Law Professor Yoshihito Takane (高根義人) adopting a distinct style of teaching, which he called the &#x27;German way of cherishing the freedom of research, teaching, and learning&#x27;. He is said to be the originator of the current motto &#x27;freedom of academic culture (自由の学風, &quot;Jiyū no Gakufū&quot;)&#x27;.

=== Post-war period ===
The Allied Occupation Period following Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Second World War saw a radical reform in the country&#x27;s educational system, and Kyoto University was not immune from it. Along with other Imperial Universities, Kyoto Imperial University dropped the word &#x27;imperial&#x27; from its name and came to be known as in October 1947. In May 1949, as a result of the American-led reform, former Imperial Universities merged with higher schools and became four-year universities as they are today. Kyoto University merged with the Third Higher School, which had been coexisting with the university since its founding as a university-preparatory boys&#x27; boarding school. The now-integrated higher school became the within the university in September 1949, and came to be in charge of equipping all first-year undergraduates with general knowledge such as mathematics and foreign languages. The college was replaced by the in 1992.

Kyoto University has been incorporated as a national university corporation along with all the other national universities, gaining a greater independence from the MEXT.

== Campuses ==
Kyoto University is organised across three main campuses: Yoshida, Uji, and Katsura, each playing a distinct role in the university&#x27;s academic and research activities.

Situated in Sakyo, Kyoto, the Yoshida Campus is the oldest and serves as the university&#x27;s central hub. This campus is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, from historic brick buildings such as the Clock Tower Centennial Hall to modern research facilities. It encapsulates the university&#x27;s history and is subdivided into seven areas, including the North Campus and the Yoshida-South Campus, which used to be occupied by the Third Higher School.

The Uji Campus, located in Uji, Kyoto, was formerly occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. The university acquired it just after its reorganisation into its current form, in 1949. Today, it houses several research institutes and centres focusing on natural sciences and energy. Along with its large laboratories, Uji Campus is recognised for its greenery and serene environment.

The Katsura Campus, in Nishikyo, Kyoto, is recognised as a &#x27;Techno-science Hill&#x27; for its forward-looking approach to research and education in engineering and informatics. Established in October 2003, Katsura aims to pioneer new knowledge domains in the 21st century. This campus is organised into four sections, each dedicated to different facets of technological and scientific exploration.

==Organization==
Kyoto University is organised into 10 undergraduate faculties and 19 graduate schools. The president of the university is Nagahiro Minato, who assumed the office in October 2020 and expected to serve until September 2026.

<doc id="187916" wikidata="Q1402048" url="?curid=187916" title="Man in the Moon">
<text>In many cultures, several pareidolic images of a human face, head or body are recognized in the disc of the full moon; they are generally known as the Man in the Moon. The images are based on the appearance of the dark areas (known as lunar maria) and the lighter-colored highlands (and some lowlands) of the lunar surface.

==Origin==
There are various explanations for how the Man in the Moon came to be.

A longstanding European tradition holds that the man was banished to the Moon for some crime. Jewish lore says that the image of Jacob is engraved on the Moon. Another held that he is the man caught gathering sticks on the Sabbath and sentenced by God to death by stoning in the Book of Numbers XV.32–36. Some Germanic cultures thought he was a woodcutter found working on the Sabbath. There is a Roman legend that he is a sheep-thief.

One medieval Christian tradition claims that he is Cain, the Wanderer, forever doomed to circle the Earth. Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; alludes to this:

&lt;poem&gt;
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere, touching the wave
Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight
The moon was round.&lt;/poem&gt;

This is mentioned again in his &quot;Paradise&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body, which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?&lt;/poem&gt;

John Lyly says in the prologue to his &quot;Endymion&quot; (1591), &quot;There liveth none under the sunne, that knows what to make of the man in the moone.&quot;

In Norse mythology, Máni is the male personification of the Moon who crosses the sky in a horse-drawn carriage. He is continually pursued by the Great Wolf Hati who catches him at Ragnarök. &quot;Máni&quot; simply means &quot;Moon&quot;.

In Chinese mythology, the goddess Chang&#x27;e is stranded upon the Moon after consuming a double dose of an immortality potion. In some versions of the myth, she is accompanied by Yu Tu, a Moon rabbit. Another mythology tells the story of Wu Gang, a man on the Moon who is trying to cut down a tree that always regrows. 

In Haida mythology, the figure represents a boy gathering sticks. The boy&#x27;s father had told him the Moon&#x27;s light would brighten the night, allowing the chore to be completed. Not wanting to gather sticks, the boy complained and ridiculed the Moon. As punishment for his disrespect, the boy was taken from Earth and trapped on the Moon.

In Japanese mythology, it is said that a tribe of human-like spiritual beings live on the Moon. This is especially explored in The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.

In Vietnamese mythology, the Man in the Moon is named Cuội. He was originally a woodcutter on Earth who owned a magical banyan. One day, when his wife ignorantly watered the tree with unclean water and caused it to uproot itself to fly away, Cuội grabbed its roots and was taken to the Moon. There, he eternally accompanied the Moon Lady and the Jade Rabbit. The trio has become the personifications of the Tết Trung Thu, when they descend to the mortal world and give out cellophane lanterns, mooncakes and gifts to children.

In Latvian legends, two maidens went naked from the sauna with carrying poles to the well. While collecting water, one of the women noted how beautiful the moon is. The other was unimpressed, saying her bottom was prettier and proceeded to moon the moon. As a punishment, either Dievs or Mēness (Moon deity) put the woman along with a carrying pole on the moon, with her bottom now visible to everyone.

==Traditions==
There is a traditional European belief that the Man in the Moon enjoyed drinking, especially claret. An old ballad runs (original spelling):
&lt;poem&gt;
Our man in the moon drinks clarret,
With powder-beef, turnep, and carret.
If he doth so, why should not you
Drink until the sky looks blew?&lt;/poem&gt;

In the English Middle Ages and renaissance, the Moon was held to be the god of drunkards, and at least three London taverns were named &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;.
The man in the Moon is named in an early dated English nursery rhyme:
&lt;poem&gt;
The man in the moon came tumbling down
And asked his way to Norwich;
He went by the south and burnt his mouth
With supping cold pease porridge.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Examples and occurrence globally==
One tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back. He is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog. Various cultures recognise other examples of lunar pareidolia, such as the Moon rabbit.

In the Northern Hemisphere, a common Western perception of the face has it that the figure&#x27;s eyes are Mare Imbrium and Mare Serenitatis, its nose is Sinus Aestuum, and its open mouth is Mare Nubium and Mare Cognitum. This particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the equator. However, the Moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently—and eventually not at all—as one moves toward the South Pole.

Conventionalized illustrations of the Man in the Moon seen in Western art often show a very simple face in the full moon, or a human profile in the crescent moon, corresponding to no actual markings. Some depict a man with a face turned away from the viewer on the ground, for example when viewed from North America, with Jesus Christ&#x27;s crown shown as the lighter ring around Mare Imbrium. Another common one is a cowled Death&#x27;s head looking down at Earth, with the black lava rock &#x27;hood&#x27; around the white dust bone of the skull, and also forming the eye sockets.

&quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the Moon, but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the Moon. An example is Yue-Laou, from Chinese tradition; another is Aiken Drum from Scotland.

&quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; by Francis Godwin, published in 1638, is one of the earliest novels thought of as containing several traits prototypical of science fiction.

==Scientific explanation==
The Man in the Moon is made up of various lunar maria (which ones depend on the pareidolic image seen). These vast, flat spots on the Moon are called &quot;maria&quot; or &quot;seas&quot; because, for a long time, astronomers believed they were large bodies of water. They are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled, becoming smooth, basalt rock.

The near side of the Moon with these maria that make up the man is always facing Earth due to a tidal locking, or synchronous orbit. Thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the Moon&#x27;s oblong shape, its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the Earth. This causes the same side of the Moon to always face toward Earth.

<doc id="187919" wikidata="Q64878691" url="?curid=187919" title="Cultural impact of the Beatles">
<text>The English rock band the Beatles, comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are commonly regarded as the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. They sparked the &quot;Beatlemania&quot; phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society&#x27;s developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era&#x27;s youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music&#x27;s evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.

Many cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. In Britain, their rise to prominence signalled the youth-driven changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers&#x27; commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American artists&#x27; global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US as the British Invasion) and inspired young people to pursue music careers. From 1964 to 1970, the Beatles had the top-selling US single one out of every six weeks and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band were &quot;more popular than Jesus now&quot;.

The Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, especially with the albums &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965), &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). Many of their advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group include the elevation of the album to the dominant form of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. They also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, psychedelia, art pop, progressive rock, heavy metal and electronic music. By the end of the decade, the Beatles were seen as an embodiment of the era&#x27;s sociocultural movements, exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.

Over the 1960s, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and hold a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of &quot;Yesterday&quot; reaching 1,600 by 1986. As of 2009, they were the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;RooneySmith/CNN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Time&quot; included the Beatles in its list of the twentieth century&#x27;s 100 most important people.

==Scope==
The Beatles formed in Liverpool in 1960. Comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they gained international stardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Throughout their career, they expanded collective notions regarding the limits of commercial and artistic achievement. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2001) defined their &quot;incalculable&quot; influence as encompassing &quot;all of Western culture&quot;. The writers state that the group&#x27;s discography held the precedent for &quot;virtually every rock experiment ... Although many of their sales and attendance records have since been surpassed, no group has so radically transformed the sound and significance of rock &amp; roll.&quot; Writing for AllMusic, critic Richie Unterberger recognises the Beatles as both &quot;the greatest and most influential act of the rock era&quot; and a group that &quot;introduced more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century&quot;. He adds:

Many contemporary listeners viewed the Beatles as orchestrators of society&#x27;s developments over the second half of the 1960s. Musicologist Allan F. Moore states that there have been occasions when &quot;audiences gravitate towards a centre&quot; of pop music culture, the most prominent of which was in the early to mid 1960s, a period in which it &quot;seems that almost everyone, irrespective of age, class or cultural background, listened to the Beatles&quot;. Music critic Greil Marcus described the Beatles&#x27; impact as the second &quot;pop explosion&quot;, after Elvis Presley&#x27;s emergence in the 1950s, and defined the term as &quot;an irresistible cultural explosion that cuts across lines of class and race, and, most crucially, divides society itself by age&quot;. In such a phenomenon, he continued, &quot;The surface of daily life (walk, talk, dress, symbolism, heroes, family affairs) is affected with such force that deep and substantive changes in the way large numbers of people think and act take place.&quot; According to author and film-maker Hanif Kureishi, the Beatles are &quot;the only mere pop group you could remove from history and suggest that culturally, without them, things would have been significantly different&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kureishi/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Detractors of the Beatles&#x27; legacy argue that the band are overrated and are often credited for innovations that other acts were the first to achieve. Music historian Bill Martin cites such notions as part of modern culture&#x27;s inability to fully &quot;understand them as a force&quot;, and says that although rock music has been defined by &quot;synthesis and transmutation&quot; since it began, &quot;what was original about the Beatles is that they synthesized and transmuted more or less &quot;everything&quot;, they did this in a way that reflected their time, they reflected their time in a way that spoke to a great part of humanity, and they did all of this really, really well.&quot; Ian MacDonald states that the band were keen observers who discovered trends in their infancy and were adept at mirroring the era&#x27;s &quot;social and psychological changes&quot;. He said that their connection with the times was such that the Beatles &quot;did far more mind-liberating&quot; than Bob Dylan, through their greater record sales and &quot;because they worked in simpler, less essentially sceptical ways&quot;.

==Sales and attendance records==
Over the 1960s as a whole, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred pop act on the sales charts. &quot;She Loves You&quot;, the band&#x27;s second number-one single on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart (subsequently adopted as the UK Singles Chart), became the best-selling single in UK chart history, a position it retained until 1978. The band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;With the Beatles&quot;, each topped &quot;Record Retailer&quot;″s LPs chart, for a combined run of 51 consecutive weeks. Beginning with &quot;From Me to You&quot; in 1963, the Beatles had a four-year run of eleven consecutive chart-topping singles in &quot;Record Retailer&quot;, ending when the double A-side single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; / &quot;Penny Lane&quot; peaked at number two.

On 4 April 1964, the Beatles occupied the top five US chart positions – with &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot; – as well as 11 other positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. For nine consecutive weeks, they held the top two places on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart (subsequently the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200) with reconfigured versions of their first two albums. Until 2018, they were the only act to have filled the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. They also broke 11 other chart records on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s singles and albums charts at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caulfield/BB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their chart domination was commonplace in countries around the world during 1964. In Australia, in late March, the band&#x27;s songs filled the top six chart positions; during one week, they held nine positions in Canada&#x27;s top ten.

On 15 August 1965, the Beatles became the first entertainment act to stage a concert in a sports stadium when they performed at Shea Stadium in New York City before an audience of 55,600. The event set records for attendance and revenue generation, with takings of $304,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The band&#x27;s record run of six consecutive number-ones on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 from January 1965 to January 1966 – with the songs &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; – remained unbeaten until Whitney Houston achieved a seventh in 1988.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) was the top-selling album of the 1960s in the UK, and on four occasions they had the best-selling album of the year there. As of 2019, with certified sales of 5.1 million copies in the UK, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is the all-time third best-selling album there and the best-selling studio album. The 1968 double LP &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) became the fastest-selling album in history; Capitol Records reported advance orders of 2 million in the US, with many stores selling their entire stock in one day.

In the UK, the Beatles are beaten only by Presley for their amount of number-one singles and combined weeks at number one. As of December 2018, the Beatles held the record for the most Christmas number-one hits there, with four, of which three were achieved in successive years between 1963 and 1965. In the list of the UK&#x27;s top sellers for the decade, the band&#x27;s albums filled the top ten, apart from the soundtracks to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;. The Beatles took the next three positions, meaning that all ten of their UK number-one albums were among the thirteen best-selling albums of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of US sales for the 1960s, the Beatles were the top artist, ahead of Presley, in both singles and albums. Between February 1964 and July 1970, the band maintained the number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a total of 59 weeks and topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s LPs chart for 116 weeks. In other words, they had the top-selling single one out of every six weeks, and the top-selling album one out of every three weeks.

==Breakthrough and role in Britain&#x27;s cultural resurgence==
===Merseybeat and British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll===

As the Beatles rose in popularity in 1963, the terms &quot;Mersey sound&quot; and &quot;Merseybeat&quot; were applied to bands and singers from Liverpool, making it the first time in British pop music that a sound and a location were linked together. (The River Mersey flows through Liverpool.) The city had the cultural advantages of being the UK&#x27;s main transatlantic port and having an ethnically diverse population; local musicians were able to access records by American musicians through the Cunard Yanks working on the shipping routes. 

Like many Liverpool bands, the Beatles formed their sound from skiffle and a combination of American influences, especially rhythm and blues and girl groups, and honed their live act through seasons performing in the red-light district of Hamburg in West Germany. The music was performed with an emphasis on beat and guitars, at the expense of saxophones or other instruments commonly heard on the American records. Under pressure from Liverpool venues such as the Cavern, their manager, Brian Epstein, persuaded the Beatles to swap their favoured look of black leather jackets and pants for more presentable stage suits. The group&#x27;s emergence as leaders of the Liverpool beat scene represented a departure from the London-focused tradition of the UK music industry.

Released in October 1962, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, the band&#x27;s debut single as EMI recording artists, contrasted with the polished style of contemporary UK hit songs. According to author Peter Doggett, the January 1963 follow-up, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, represented &quot;the real birth of the new&quot; as, aided by Lennon&#x27;s impassioned vocal, the song was &quot;more driven than any previous British pop record&quot;. As musicians and songwriters, the Beatles established working-class authenticity and informality as key aspects in British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Doggett adds that &quot;Most of all, the Beatles sounded like a gang: forceful, persuasive and sexually potent.&quot;

Starting in 1963, according to music historian David Simonelli, the Beatles initiated the &quot;original golden age&quot; of British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and reversed a tradition whereby domestic acts were a &quot;pale imitation&quot; of the original American purveyors of the style. During the first half of that year, the band usurped American acts including Roy Orbison to become the headline performers on their joint UK tours, something no previous British act accomplished while touring with artists from the US. Their initial success opened the way for many other Liverpool groups to achieve national success and encouraged the country&#x27;s four main, London-based record companies to seek out talent in other areas of northern England. As a result, the Beatles and other British acts dominated the charts in 1963 at the expense of American artists.

===Sociocultural influence===

The Beatles&#x27; emergence overlapped with the decline in British conservatism. In the description of author and musician Bob Stanley, their domestic breakthrough represented &quot;a final liberation for Britain&#x27;s teenagers&quot; and, by coinciding with the end of National Service, the group &quot;effectively signaled the end of World War II in Britain&quot;. For sociologists, the band typified new developments in postwar Britain such as social mobility, teenagers&#x27; commercial influence, and informality in society. In their 1965 book &quot;Generation X&quot;, Charles Hamblett and Jane Deverson said the Beatles had supplied British youth culture with a unifying and liberating influence that departed from the usual American-inspired model and, together with other groups from outside London, had fostered a sense of celebration of provincial England. The authors commented that resistance to the Beatles&#x27; progressive social influence from establishment figures was because the band were &quot;knocking the stuffing – and the stuffiness – out of the neo-Victorians&quot;.

The band&#x27;s appeal registered with members of the royal family when the Beatles played a toned-down selection of songs at the Royal Variety Performance on 4 November 1963. The show was watched by a television audience of 26 million, around half the population of the UK, and helped establish the group as one of the first &quot;spectacles&quot; of the 1960s. Reluctant to play at such a formal event, Lennon told Epstein that he planned to sabotage the occasion. He instead charmed the theatre audience with his final comment: &quot;For our last number [&#x27;Twist and Shout&#x27;], I&#x27;d like to ask your help. The people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands. And the rest of you, if you&#x27;d just rattle your jewellery.&quot;
===Political significance and awarding of MBEs===

The Beatles&#x27; international success created an export market for British pop for the first time and provided a boon to the UK government&#x27;s balance of payments deficit. This unexpected development led to approval from politicians and an eagerness on their part to be associated with the band. In the run-up to the 1964 general election, the Beatles became a political football for the two major political parties; the &quot;New Statesman&quot; reported that Conservative candidates were told to &quot;mention the Beatles whenever possible in their speeches&quot;, while a cartoon in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; showed the Conservative prime minister, Alec Douglas-Home, and Labour&#x27;s leader of the opposition, Harold Wilson, consulting the Beatles over the Profumo affair. During the election campaign, both parties accused the other of trying to use the band&#x27;s popularity for political gain. In March 1964, Wilson, who was contesting the outer Liverpool seat of Huyton, engineered a photo opportunity with the group as they received their Variety Club &quot;Show Business Personality of the Year&quot; awards. The association endured in the public&#x27;s mind, securing Wilson the youth vote and aiding in his election win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/PollPosition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beatles&#x27; international success also benefited the country&#x27;s tourism and fashion industries, and entertainment generally. In early 1965, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; initiated a campaign for the Beatles to be awarded MBEs, a move that Wilson supported and set in motion. When the band received their MBEs from Queen Elizabeth II in October, it was unprecedented recognition for pop musicians, anticipating the honours (including knighthoods) that were regularly bestowed on the country&#x27;s entertainers in subsequent decades. The award was in acknowledgement of the Beatles&#x27; contribution to the national economy and reflected the value of their popularity to the Labour government. Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet minister Tony Benn, who opposed the award, thought it was equally indicative of the royal family&#x27;s wish to appeal to the masses in the new era of egalitarianism and meritocracy.

===Britain&#x27;s leadership of international culture===
In his book on the 1960s, social historian Arthur Marwick identifies the Beatles&#x27; US breakthrough as the &quot;single critical event&quot; that established &quot;the hegemony of youth-inspired British popular culture&quot;. With other countries succumbing to the Beatles&#x27; influence, according to Simonelli, the band &quot;virtually redefined what it meant to be British&quot;, and British culture became &quot;the most exciting culture on earth&quot; for the first time since the start of the industrial age. The surge in exports revenue extended to film and other commercial artistic pursuits, and recognition of London as the &quot;Swinging City&quot; of international culture.

With the Beatles having moved to London in 1963, in Simonelli&#x27;s description, they served as the &quot;maypole&quot; at the centre of the city&#x27;s cultural influence throughout the 1960s. Marwick says they represented the popular image of a phenomenon in which &quot;hitherto invisible swathes of British society became visible and assertive&quot; and their 1966 single &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was the song that best conveyed &quot;the new class-defying tide of individualistic enterprise&quot;. Liverpool poet Roger McGough credited the Beatles with establishing the &quot;mythology of Liverpool&quot; through their 1967 songs &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, in the manner that American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs had traditionally done for US cities and roads.
==Beatlemania==
In late 1963, the British press coined the term &quot;Beatlemania&quot; to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles. The word was first widely used following the band&#x27;s 13 October appearance on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;; amid reports of wild crowd scenes outside the venue, and after 15 million viewers watched the broadcast, Britain was said to be &quot;in the grip of Beatlemania&quot;. The &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah!&quot; refrain of &quot;She Loves You&quot; was a signature hook for their European audiences. Its falsetto &quot;ooh!&quot;s elicited further fan delirium when accompanied by McCartney and Harrison&#x27;s exaggerated shaking of their moptop hair. Once it became an international phenomenon in 1964, Beatlemania surpassed in its intensity and reach any previous examples of fan worship, including those afforded to Presley and Frank Sinatra.

Displays of mania were repeated wherever the band played. When the group toured Australia in June 1964, the population afforded the visit the status of a national event. A crowd of 300,000 – the largest recorded gathering of Australians in one place – welcomed the Beatles to Adelaide. Sid Bernstein, the US promoter who arranged the band&#x27;s Shea Stadium concerts, said that only Adolf Hitler had had such power over the masses. Bernstein was sure that the group &quot;could sway a presidential election if they wanted to&quot;. Around 4,000 fans gathered outside Buckingham Palace in central London when the Beatles received their MBEs from the Queen. As the crowd chanted &quot;God save the Beatles&quot; and &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah!&quot;, some fans jostled with police officers and scaled the palace gates. Referring to this spectacle, journalist Robert Sandall later commented that &quot;Never had a ruling monarch been so thoroughly upstaged by a group of her subjects as was Elizabeth II on [26 October 1965].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandall/JointHonours&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beatles became bored with all aspects of touring – including fans offering themselves sexually to the band, and the high-pitched screaming that rendered their performances inaudible. Beatlemania continued on a reduced scale after the band retired from touring, and after the members became solo artists. In their book &quot;Encyclopedia of Classic Rock&quot;, David Luhrssen and Michael Larson write that while boy bands such as One Direction have continued to attract audiences of screaming girls, no act has &quot;moved pop culture forward or achieved the breadth and depth of the Beatles&#x27; fandom&quot;.

==US breakthrough and British Invasion==
Most Americans were introduced to the Beatles&#x27; music with the single &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; backed with &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, rising to the top of US charts on 1 February 1964. Both songs featured a harder-edged guitar sound that stood out as a revival of the &quot;rebellious&quot; spirit absent from newer rock and roll acts and as a rejection of the regular assortment of novelty songs, teen idols, folk singers and girl groups that occupied US charts in the weeks and months previous. MacDonald wrote: &quot;every American artist, black or white, asked about &#x27;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x27; has said much the same: it altered everything, ushering in a new era and changing their lives.&quot;

On 9 February, the Beatles gave their first live US television performance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 per cent of the US population. The Nielsen rating service reported that it was the largest audience number ever recorded for an American television . Music journalist Neil McCormick, writing in 2015, described the Beatles&#x27; debut on the show as pop music&#x27;s &quot;big bang moment&quot;, while Stanley calls it &quot;arguably the most significant postwar cultural event in America&quot;, adding that &quot;Their rise, the scale of it and their impact on society, was completely unprecedented.&quot; Their second appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, on 16 February, was watched by around 70 million viewers.
Eleven weeks before the Beatles&#x27; arrival in the US, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a source of profound national mourning that American commentators at the time linked to young people&#x27;s embrace of the Beatles and their music. For many Americans, particularly young baby boomers, the Beatles&#x27; visit reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had been taken by Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. A teenage New Yorker in early 1964, author Nicholas Schaffner later wrote that the Kennedy link was &quot;an exaggeration, perhaps&quot;, but the Beatles &quot;more than filled the energy gap&quot; left by the demise of 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll for an audience accustomed to the &quot;vacuous&quot; music that had replaced it.

For decades, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, and the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley. In early 1964, &quot;Life&quot; magazine declared: &quot;In [1776] England lost her American colonies. Last week the Beatles took them back.&quot; The Beatles subsequently sparked the British Invasion of the US and became a globally influential phenomenon. Recalling the Beatles&#x27; sudden popularity, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys felt that the Beatles had &quot;eclipsed ... the whole music world&quot;. Bob Dylan recalled that, by April 1964, &quot;a definite line was being drawn. This was something that had never happened before ... I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.&quot;
The Beatles&#x27; success in the US established the popularity of British groups and affected the musical style of American bands. In doing so, however, the Beatles inadvertently caused a sharp decrease in sales for black artists and the decline of many of the girl groups they admired. By mid 1964, several more UK acts arrived in the US, including the Dave Clark Five, the Rolling Stones, Billy J. Kramer and Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers. Confirming the British Invasion of the US pop market, one-third of all top ten hits there in 1964 were performed by British acts. The depth of the Beatles&#x27; US impact was also reflected in a wave of easy listening adaptations of their songs, aimed at the adult market. This trend was led by the Boston Pops Orchestra recording &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and the Hollyridge Strings covering &quot;All My Loving&quot;, after which the latter orchestra released the 1964 album &quot;The Beatles Song Book&quot;.

The extent of the Beatles&#x27; impact on American music was disputed in a 2015 study conducted by the Queen Mary University of London and Imperial College London. By analysing shifts in chord progressions, beats, lyrics and vocals, the study indicated that American music was moving away from mellow sounds like doo-wop and into more energetic rock styles since the beginning of the 1960s. Professor Armand Leroi, who led the study on behalf of Imperial College, said: &quot;They didn&#x27;t make a revolution or spark a revolution, they joined one. The trend is already emerging and they rode that wave, which accounts for their incredible success.&quot; Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn said in response: &quot;anyone who was a young person in the US when the Beatles arrived ... will tell you that the Beatles revolutionised everything.&quot; McCormick dismissed the study as &quot;sensationalist&quot;.

==Personality and fashion==
===Attitude and sensibility===

In the description of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s editors, the Beatles &quot;defined and incarnated Sixties style: smart, idealistic, playful, irreverent, eclectic&quot;. They helped popularise Northern English accents on British radio and television, reversing the preference for BBC English, and their humour and irreverence combined to mock social conventions. Writer Sean O&#x27;Hagan recalled in 2016: &quot;Everything about them – the clothes they wore, the way they spoke, the songs they created with an effortlessness that seemed almost alchemical – suggested new ways of being. More than any of their contemporaries, they challenged the tired conventions that defined class-bound, insular, early-60s Britain.&quot; According to author Jonathan Gould, in conveying &quot;Youthfulness, stylishness, unpretentiousness, and nonchalance&quot;, their early image defied the widely held stereotype of Britishness, and through their presentation as Liverpudlians, &quot;the Beatles personified an iconoclastic version of their national character that proved to be as compelling to the youth of North America, Europe, Australia and parts of Asia as it was to their British fans.&quot;

In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, MacDonald describes the band members as &quot;perfect McLuhanites&quot; who &quot;&quot;felt&quot; their way through life&quot;. He says of the group&#x27;s initial impact:
Unlike previous pop stars – programmed to recite their future itineraries and favourite colours – The Beatles replied to the press in facetious ad-libs provoked by whatever was going on in the immediate present ... Before them, pop acts had been neatly presented as soloists or well-drilled units each with its clearly identified leader. With their uncanny clone-like similarity and by all talking chattily at once, The Beatles introduced to the cultural lexicon several key Sixties motifs in one go: &quot;mass&quot;-ness, &quot;working class&quot; informality, cheery street scepticism, and – most challenging to the status quo – a &quot;simultaneity&quot; which subverted conventions of precedence in every way.

Lou Christie recalled that the Beatles&#x27; emergence underlined the staidness of the US music scene, saying: &quot;We were, in many respects, just these goofy white boys. We weren&#x27;t allowed to be seen with a cigarette in our hands ... [The Beatles] were more aggressive, they were funny and they were articulate. The minute they came to America, they literally put a halt to everything that was previously happening.&quot;

===Hair length and clothing===

The Beatles&#x27; emergence coincided with a new consideration for the concept of male beauty and its elevation in importance beside feminine attractiveness. According to Marwick, the group&#x27;s appearance and Kennedy&#x27;s provided &quot;the two great points of reference in this respect&quot;. The Beatles were dubbed &quot;moptops&quot; by some British tabloids in reference to their haircut, a mid-length hairstyle that was widely mocked by adults. It was unusually long for the era and became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.

In their 1986 book &quot;Re-making Love: The Feminization of Sex&quot;, authors Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Hess and Gloria Jacobs said that the Beatles&#x27; haircuts signalled androgyny and thus presented a less threatening version of male sexuality to teenage girls, while their presentable suits meant they seemed less &quot;sleazy&quot; than Presley to middle-class whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenreich/Hess/Jacobs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Russian historian Mikhail Safonov wrote in 2003 that in the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union, mimicking the Beatles&#x27; hairstyle was seen as highly rebellious. Young people were called &quot;hairies&quot; by their elders, and were arrested and forced to have their hair cut in police stations. As a result of the Beatles, the traditional American male look of crewcuts or combed-back hair was replaced by a preference for long hair.

Clothing styles were similarly influenced, firstly by the band&#x27;s Pierre Cardin suits and Cuban-heeled Beatle boots, and later by the Carnaby Street mod fashions they wore. Along with the Rolling Stones, Dylan and the Who, the Beatles inspired thousands of young men to wear pop art-themed designs. In the late 1960s, the band&#x27;s adoption of Nehru jackets and other Indian-style clothing was highly influential on Western fashion. In his 1970 &quot;Lennon Remembers&quot; interview, Lennon complained: &quot;When we got here [to the US], you were all walking around in fuckin&#x27; Bermuda shorts with Boston crew cuts and stuff on your teeth ... The chicks looked like 1940s horses. There was no conception of dress or any of that jazz.&quot; Writing in 2002, music journalist David Fricke said Lennon was &quot;right&quot; in his withering assessment of American youth, adding that Americans were &quot;psychologically stuck in the surface white-bread calm of the 1950s&quot; and &quot;ripe for blindsiding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fricke/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese name for the Beatles is 披头士 (Simplified) or 披頭士 (Traditional), Pītóushì in Modern Standard Mandarin. &quot;Shanghai Daily&quot; stated that the characters chosen for the Chinese name reflect the musicians&#x27; hairdos, with the first two characters referring to unruly hair; the first character alone refers to putting something on shoulders, something done with hair.

===Image and caricatures===

The Beatles differed from previous musical acts in their presentation as a group in which each of the individual personalities was seen as indispensable to the whole, and each member attracted fanatical devotion. According to cultural commentator Steven D. Stark, their lack of a designated leader aligned with a more typically feminine approach to collaboration, an aspect that increased their resonance among the female audience and subsequently influenced men&#x27;s self-perception and cultural views on masculinity. The intensity of the Beatles&#x27; appeal as live performers was such that they were often presented with people who were physically impaired, in the assumption that the band had healing powers. When the band assumed a mystical image in the late 1960s, fans increasingly identified them as the four elements, in which each member presented a complementary and essential contribution to the alchemical whole.

In 1964, the Beatles starred in the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; as fictionalised versions of themselves, which created a lasting impression of their individual personas. Lennon became known as &quot;the smart one&quot;, McCartney &quot;the cute one&quot;, Harrison &quot;the quiet one&quot;, and Starr &quot;the lucky one&quot;. Starr&#x27;s personality as the band&#x27;s affable, self-deprecating drummer proved especially popular with fans and the press in the US. In 1964, as coverage of the Beatles matched that of the Johnson–Goldwater presidential race, Starr was the subject of bumper stickers proclaiming &quot;Ringo for President&quot;, as well as several tribute songs.
Their &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; characterisations were adopted again for the children&#x27;s cartoon series &quot;The Beatles&quot;, which was made by King Features and broadcast weekly on ABC in the US from September 1965 to April 1969. It was the first animated TV series to depict living people and featured the Beatles (voiced by actors) having adventures while touring the world. The series was highly successful, although its focus on the pre-1967 era ensured that audiences were presented with an increasingly outdated image of the band.

Towards the end of 1966, by which point the Beatles&#x27; artistic maturity had left many younger listeners yearning for their innocent, &quot;mop-top&quot; image, the Monkees were assembled by a pair of Hollywood-based television executives as a four-piece band in the Beatles&#x27; mould. An immediate commercial success, the Monkees&#x27; self-titled television show evoked the Beatles&#x27; personalities from Dick Lester&#x27;s feature films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, with the characters of the individual Monkees developed to reflect those of the Beatles. In Marwick&#x27;s view, the Monkees&#x27; creation represented &quot;the most remarkable sign of direct British influence&quot; on American pop culture during the 1960s. At this time, the Beatles grew moustaches, a look that defied pop convention by implying maturation and artistry over youthfulness. Their appearance was the source of confusion for some of their young fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wawzenek/UCR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;Daily Mail&quot; writer complained that after emerging as &quot;heroes of a social revolution&quot; in 1963 and &quot;the boys whom everybody could identify with&quot;, the Beatles had become austere and exclusive.

The producers of the 1967 Disney animated film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; hoped to include the Beatles in a scene featuring four vultures with mop-top hairstyles singing &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. After the band declined to take part, the scene was voiced by actors adopting Liverpudlian accents and the song was given a barbershop quartet arrangement.
===Merchandise===
Along with Beatles-themed wallpaper and jewellery, &quot;Beatles wigs&quot; were popular and widely available in UK stores from 1963. In the US, their merchandise was extensive, and marketed through Seltaeb, a local subsidiary of a company owned by Epstein&#x27;s NEMS Enterprises. Among what Schaffner estimated to be &quot;several hundred&quot; items authorised by Seltaeb were toys, clothing, stationery, alarm clocks, pillowcases, bath products, junk food and lunchboxes, while Beatles wigs &quot;became the best-selling novelty since yo-yo&#x27;s&quot;. Beatles-brand chewing gum alone netted millions of dollars in the US. Beatle boots were also sanctioned as official merchandise by NEMS.

According to Doggett, while Presley&#x27;s image had similarly been exploited, &quot;the onslaught of ephemeral artefacts aimed at Beatles fans between 1963 and 1969 dwarfed every previous campaign.&quot; The commercial exploitation extended to novelty records such as &quot;The Chipmunks Sing the Beatles Hits&quot; and an early version of a Beatles karaoke disc. King Features&#x27; &quot;The Beatles&quot; led to a range of cartoon-style products and marketing by companies such as Nestlé, with their &quot;Beatles&#x27; Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot; confectionery, and Lux soap. A major merchandising campaign accompanied the release of the band&#x27;s 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, containing products that captured their psychedelic look.

==Growth of musicians, scenes and rock bands==
According to Gould, the Beatles served as the &quot;archetype&quot; of a rock band, in contrast to the vocal and harmony groups with which listeners were most familiar in 1964. In the US, thousands of bands sought to imitate the Beatles, some adopting English-sounding names to capitalise on the British Invasion. While the country already had a vibrant garage rock scene, the movement surged following the Beatles&#x27; first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Commentator Bill Dean writes that the exact figures are impossible to determine, but &quot;the anecdotal evidence suggests thousands – if not hundreds of thousands or even more – young musicians across the country&quot; responded by forming bands. This was sometimes to the chagrin of their parents and other adults.

Tom Petty, who joined the Sundowners in Gainesville, Florida, after seeing the Beatles&#x27; US television debut, recalled: &quot;Within weeks of that, you could drive through literally any neighborhood in Gainesville and you would hear the strains of garage bands playing ... I mean everywhere. And I&#x27;d say by a year from that time, Gainesville probably had 50 bands.&quot; The Byrds and Creedence Clearwater Revival are among the American groups said to have formed as a result of the show. Accompanying this phenomenon, the musicians typically abandoned their crewcut look and allowed their hair to grow. Joe Walsh, Nancy Wilson and Billy Joel also credited the show as the impetus for them to pursue musical careers.
The proliferation of new groups was evident in many other countries. In Spain, Los Estudiantes and Los Brincos modelled themselves on the Beatles, as did the Uruguayan band Los Shakers, who were one of many groups around the world that formed as a result of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Following the Beatles&#x27; concerts there on the 1964 world tour, new bands sprung up in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong, while some existing acts, such as the Bee Gees, instantly changed their style to match the Beatles&#x27;.

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; reported in 1965 that a band known as the Candid Lads had started in the Soviet Union, with a sound and look identical to the Beatles&#x27;. Bands there were forced to play in secret due to the communist authorities&#x27; ban on rock music, and Beatles records had to be smuggled into the country, although contrary to popular conception, it was not impossible to listen to their music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh/NYDailyNews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Russian musician Sasha Lipnitsky later recalled: &quot;The Beatles brought us the idea of democracy ... For many of us, it was the first hole in the Iron Curtain.&quot; In Japan, the Beatles influenced what was dubbed the &quot;Group Sounds&quot; era, before which Japanese bands were mainly imitations of acts such as Presley and Pat Boone. According to music-industry executive Aki Tanaka, the Beatles&#x27; 1966 concerts in Tokyo inspired &quot;the birth of a real Japanese rock music scene&quot;, in which local artists wrote their material rather than merely covering Western rock songs.

==Artistry and recognition of popular music==

===Songwriting===
Through the Beatles&#x27; early success, the Lennon–McCartney partnership revolutionised songwriting in Britain by usurping the Denmark Street tradition of in-house songwriters. In the US, they similarly inspired changes to the music industry, as did the British Invasion songwriters they influenced, by combining the roles of writer and performer. This trend threatened the Brill Building writers and other professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s editors, the Beatles thereby &quot;inaugurated the era of self-contained bands and forever centralized pop&quot;. Lennon and McCartney also supplied hit songs for several other artists up to 1966, including Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, the Fourmost and the Rolling Stones, and they opened up opportunities in the US that were previously unavailable for non-performing British songwriters, such as Tony Hatch. Direct collaboration between Lennon and McCartney was limited from 1964, but their songs continued to be credited to the partnership.

From 1963 to 1967, the Beatles increasingly broke with established rock and pop conventions. Adding to their sophistication as composers was the application of modal mixture, wider chord palettes, and extended form. One of the hallmarks of the Beatles&#x27; experimental period is their use of the flattened subtonic chord (VII). Although it was already a staple of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, the Beatles further developed and popularised the chord&#x27;s function in popular music. Another is their subversions of pop&#x27;s standard AABA form. Few electric beat artists wrote songs with bridge sections until the group&#x27;s breakthrough, after which the practice became ubiquitous.

MacDonald describes Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s growing articulacy and ambition from 1962 to 1967 as &quot;quite vertiginous&quot; and says that, with Harrison and Starr&#x27;s collaboration in the recording studio, they &quot;led a revolution in the very ethos of songwriting which consisted in seeing the song as a part of something larger: the record&quot;. Luhrssen and Larson describe the pair&#x27;s songwriting as &quot;more melodically and harmonically unpredictable than that of their peers&quot;, and say that the Beatles&#x27; sound &quot;struck many ears as outrageous, especially the falsetto leaps in songs such as &#x27;She Loves You,&#x27; which might have been inspired by Little Richard but sounded unprecedented&quot;.
&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, written primarily by Lennon, begins with a ringing chord most commonly identified as G7sus4. The specifics of its harmonic construction are often scrutinised, with many writers offering different interpretations of the chord. In 2001, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to the &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; chord as the most famous in rock history. Another chord described as among the &quot;most famous&quot; in history is the sustained E major heard at the end of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

Principally through McCartney&#x27;s melody writing, the Beatles created many songs that became the most widely recorded of all time, including &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;. According to Doggett, these mainly McCartney-written songs provided contemporary relevance for &quot;light orchestras and crooners&quot; in the easy listening category, persuaded adults that the new generation&#x27;s musical tastes had merit, and &quot;ensured that Lennon and McCartney would become the highest-earning composers in history&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s songwriting widened the Beatles&#x27; range further, although his level of contribution remained limited by Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s dominance throughout the band&#x27;s career. His song &quot;Something&quot; was also widely covered, and earned rare praise from Sinatra, who described it as &quot;the greatest love song of the past fifty years&quot;.

===Competition===
Before the mid-1960s, competition between popular recording artists was typically measured by popularity and record sales, with artistic rivalries usually only occurring between jazz or classical musicians. Comparing its effect on 1960s popular music to Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s on 1920s filmmaking, Gould credits the Beatles&#x27; increasing ambition &quot;to write better songs&quot; with inspiring &quot;intense creative rivalries&quot; between themselves and other acts who &quot;felt a need to validate their success by experimenting with songwriting and record-making in ways that would have seemed unimaginable only a few years before.&quot; Author Robert Rodriguez writes that &quot;The Beatles, Dylan, and the Rolling Stones have long been viewed as the Holy Trinity of 1960s rock, from whom every important development and innovation flowed.&quot; Author Carys Wyn Jones states that the &quot;competition, interaction, and influence&quot; between those acts (plus the Beach Boys) became &quot;central to histories of rock&quot;. The Byrds also figured highly in their importance, to the extent that they were widely celebrated as the American answer to the Beatles.
Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones were symbolic of the nascent youth revolt against institutional authority, something that was not immediately recognisable within the Beatles until 1966. The Beatles&#x27; initial clean-cut personas contrasted with the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;bad boy&quot; image, and so the music press forged a rivalry between the two acts. From 1964 onwards, the Beatles and Dylan partook in a mutual dialogue and exchange of ideas. Their engagement is referred to by Chris Smith, author of &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot;, as the &quot;single phenomenon that defined the tone of 1960s popular music and the future of music in America&quot;.

In August 1964, at the Delmonico Hotel in New York City, the Beatles met Dylan in person and were introduced to cannabis. Many commentators have referenced this meeting as a cultural turning point. Gould explains that, before then, the musicians&#x27; respective fanbases were &quot;perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds&quot;: Dylan&#x27;s audience of &quot;college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style&quot; contrasted with their fans, &quot;veritable &#x27;teenyboppers&#x27; – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists.&quot; He writes that within a year of the Beatles&#x27; first meeting with Dylan, &quot;the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated&quot;, as the Beatles&#x27; fanbase began to grow in sophistication and Dylan&#x27;s audience re-engaged with adolescent concerns presented in the &quot;newly energized and autonomous pop culture&quot;.

In July 1966, Dylan suffered a motorcycle accident and spent a period in convalescence, and principally for McCartney, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys subsequently took his place as the Beatles&#x27; chief artistic rival. The two bands inspired and endeavoured to top each other with their artistry and recording techniques, but the Beach Boys failed to maintain their career momentum after 1967. According to Jones, the interplay between the two bands during the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; era remains one of the most noteworthy episodes in rock history.

=== Cultural legitimisation of pop music===

In Britain, music journalists started including pop and rock music in serious discussion as a direct consequence of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 breakthrough. Pop gained its first exposure in the arts section of one of the country&#x27;s broadsheet newspapers when William Mann, &quot;The Times&quot;″s classical music critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963. In the United States, the Beatles were the main beneficiaries of a new widespread appreciation for pop and rock over 1966–67 among journalists and intellectuals, coinciding with the emergence there of a dedicated rock press and serious coverage of the genre in the cultural mainstream. Music critic Tim Riley identifies the Beatles as pop music&#x27;s &quot;first recording &quot;artists&quot;&quot;, whose body of work represents &quot;very intricate art&quot;. Luhrssen and Larson say the Beatles &quot;[made] it mandatory that serious rock bands aspire to be artists, not merely entertainers&quot;.

With &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; in July 1964, the band became the first pop act since Buddy Holly to issue an album consisting entirely of original compositions. The accompanying feature film endeared the Beatles to intellectuals in Britain. Lennon&#x27;s artistic standing was furthered by the critical and commercial success of his book of prose &quot;In His Own Write&quot; and its 1965 sequel, &quot;A Spaniard in the Works&quot;. Now feted by London society, Lennon and McCartney found inspiration among a network of non-mainstream writers, poets, comedians, film-makers and other arts-related individuals. According to Doggett, their social milieu in 1964 represented &quot;new territory for pop&quot; and a challenge to British class delineation as the Beatles introduced an &quot;arty middle-class&quot; sensibility to pop music. The albums &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot; (issued in December 1964 and August 1965, respectively) each marked a progression in the band&#x27;s development, in terms of lyrical content and recording sophistication. With &quot;Help!&quot;, the Beatles became the first rock group to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

Recording for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; took place over a four-week period uninterrupted by touring, filming or radio engagements, making its creation highly unusual for the time. By the time of the album&#x27;s release in December 1965, according to author Michael Frontani, each new Beatles record was received as &quot;an expansion of the parameters of popular music, and the [group&#x27;s] image reflected and promoted notions of the Beatles&#x27; artistry and importance&quot;. Simonelli describes &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as &quot;the first serious effort by a rock and roll act to produce an LP as an artistic statement&quot;, while author Christopher Bray deems it &quot;the first long-playing pop record to really merit the term &#x27;album&#x27;&quot; and the LP that &quot;turned pop music into high art&quot;. The standard of its all-original compositions was also responsible for a widespread shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual filler tracks.
The Beatles incorporated influences from the English counterculture (or London underground) more readily than any of their pop rivals. Led by McCartney&#x27;s absorption in the London arts scene and interest in the work of Stockhausen and Bach, this resulted in what musicologist Walter Everett terms a &quot;revolution in the expressive capacity of mainstream rock music&quot;. The band&#x27;s August 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot; was viewed as avant-garde and, in MacDonald&#x27;s description, &quot;initiated a second pop revolution ... galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones&quot;. According to music historian Simon Philo, &quot;Revolver&quot; announced &quot;underground London&quot;&#x27;s arrival in pop, supplanting the sound associated with Swinging London.

Released in May 1967, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; is described by Doggett as &quot;the biggest pop happening&quot; to take place between the Beatles&#x27; debut on American television in February 1964 and Lennon&#x27;s murder in December 1980. The album was a major critical and commercial success; through the level of attention it received from the rock press and more culturally elite publications, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; achieved full cultural legitimisation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. Its win in the Album of the Year category at the 1968 Grammys Awards marked the first time that a rock LP had received this award. According to author Doyle Greene, the album provided &quot;a crucial locus in the assemblage of popular music and avant-garde/experimental music – and popular culture and modernism&quot;. Chris Smith highlights &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as one of the most &quot;obvious&quot; choices for inclusion in &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot;, due to its continued commercial success, the wealth of imitative works it inspired, and its ongoing recognition as &quot;a defining moment in the history of music&quot;.

&quot;The Beatles&quot; represented a diverse collection of musical styles that one critic likened to a history of Western music, and its November 1968 release was viewed as a major cultural event. The album failed to inspire the level of creative writing that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; had introduced to rock criticism, as reviewers were unable to locate it within the Beatles&#x27; canon. Music critic John Harris wrote of the White Album: &quot;it was these 30 songs that decisively opened the way for musicians to extend their horizons beyond the standard LP format.&quot;

==Social movements==
===Generational awareness===

From 1963, the Beatles provided one of the first opportunities for female teenagers to exhibit spending power and publicly express sexual desire, while the group&#x27;s image suggested a disregard for adults&#x27; opinions and parents&#x27; ideas of morality. Simonelli writes of the Beatles&#x27; emergence and its impact on 1960s youth: &quot;British young people experimented with music, art, politics, sexual morality, fashion and the like, and the rest of the Western world watched, absorbed the changes and contributed to the process.&quot; The band&#x27;s sociocultural impact in the US began with their February 1964 visit, which served as a key moment in the development of generational awareness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmore/RS/60s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leopold/CNN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Writing that same month, American sociologist David Riesman said the Beatles&#x27; success was &quot;a form of protest against the adult world&quot;; later in 1964, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; described Beatlemania as a &quot;religion of teenage culture&quot; that was indicative of how American youth now looked to their own age group for social values and role models. According to historian Michael James Roberts, even though their early songs avoided such issues, the band represented &quot;cultural change and the oppositional stance of the youth culture against the establishment&quot;.

The group&#x27;s popularity subsequently grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade, and their artistic maturation reflected the era&#x27;s social developments. They were widely viewed as leaders of the youth culture and such a sentiment was echoed by the mainstream press. Their 1966 songs &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Taxman&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; provided social commentary, with the lyrics of &quot;Rain&quot; making explicit the delineation between the socially aware and those who were not. By contrast, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; achieved a cross-generational appeal; in &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;, McCartney and Lennon sang of a real-life teenage runaway but gave an unusually sympathetic perspective on the parents&#x27; sense of loss.

According to Stark, the social unity conveyed by the Beatles from the start of their career inspired the framework for the collectivist thinking that distinguished the 1960s and the emergence of the counterculture movement. He sees their English sense of humour as a defining trait of the counterculture and an inspiration for Yippie activists Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. Gould similarly writes that, from the band&#x27;s arrival in the US, teenagers were aware of the &quot;social dimension&quot; implicit in the group&#x27;s camaraderie, matching clothes and hair, and ensemble playing. In Gould&#x27;s view, as icons of the 1960s counterculture, the band became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women&#x27;s liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism.

According to documentary filmmaker Leslie Woodhead, a former Cold War spy, the Beatles&#x27; music helped persuade young Russians to defy communist ideology and begin the process that led to the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe. He said the extent of the band&#x27;s influence became apparent in the 1990s when local rock musicians told him that &quot;not only were the Beatles colossal from the Berlin Wall to Vladivostok but that they&#x27;d played a really significant part in helping to wash away totalitarianism ... They liberated a certain spiritual energy so that two generations of Soviet kids simply gave up on building socialism and started to realise that the Cold War enemy, instead of being a threat, made wonderful music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keal/DailyRecord&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many young Russians learnt to speak English through the Beatles&#x27; lyrics, and the band&#x27;s songs helped spread the English language throughout Europe and the rest of the world.

===Civil rights and support for African-American musicians===
Marwick writes that while American folk singers Dylan and Joan Baez were more identifiable with civil rights issues, in Beatles songs, &quot;it was a case of music and lyrics together constructing – constantly changing – moods which never failed, it seemed, to evoke responses in large numbers of listeners of the day.&quot; Roberts highlights the significance of their US breakthrough occurring in the same year that the Civil Rights Act was passed, and also that their first US LP, &quot;Introducing ... The Beatles&quot;, was released by the African-American–owned label Vee-Jay Records. Through the album&#x27;s preponderance of cover versions of recordings by black R&amp;B artists, Roberts continues, the Beatles introduced this music to a new audience of white Americans and helped to &quot;relegitimate&quot; an aspect of African-American musical history.
During the Beatles&#x27; US tour in August–September 1964, the group spoke out against racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South. When informed that the venue for their 11 September concert, the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, was segregated, the Beatles said they would refuse to perform unless the audience was integrated. City officials relented and agreed to allow an integrated show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Runtagh/RS/EightDays&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although the group held their press conference there before the concert, they cancelled their reservations at the whites-only Hotel George Washington in Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirkin/Greenlining&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to music journalist Bill DeMain, the Beatles&#x27; stand &quot;gave pop music a new-found social conscience&quot;; American singer Brian Hyland recalled of the episode: &quot;They were really the first group to have the power to do that. They used that platform really well ... It took a lot of courage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeMain/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour, the band repeatedly voiced their admiration of Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Fats Domino, and particularly soul artists such as the Miracles, Marvin Gaye and Chuck Jackson. Miracles leader Smokey Robinson said he was especially grateful for the Beatles&#x27; championing of Motown music and their choosing to cover songs by Motown artists. He added that they &quot;were the first white artists to ever admit that they grew up and honed themselves on black music. I loved the fact that they did that, that they were honest&quot;.

The Beatles subsequently invited Mary Wells to be their support act on a UK tour and in 1965 arranged for Esther Phillips to give her first performances outside the US. According to Lewisohn, documents reveal that for their tours in 1965 and 1966, the Beatles included clauses in contracts stipulating that shows be integrated. In 1966, McCartney said they had avoided performing in South Africa &quot;or any places where blacks would be separated&quot;, adding, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t out of any goody-goody thing; we just thought, &#x27;Why should you separate black people from white?&#x27;&quot; According to Moore, the Beatles and the British Invasion bands that followed them to the US initiated the process whereby Americans &quot;gradually encountered and accepted the return of their black heritage&quot;.

===Opposition from conservatives===

The Beatles were widely condemned by conservative elements of society, as Presley and other symbols of rock and roll had been during the 1950s. Israel refused to let the band perform there in early 1964, wary of &quot;attacks of mass hysteria&quot; being inflicted on the country&#x27;s youth. In August 1965, the Indonesian government burned the group&#x27;s records in order to &quot;preserve the national identity in the field of culture&quot; as part of that country&#x27;s twentieth anniversary celebrations of independence. In East Germany, the Beatles were blamed for a &quot;cultural crisis&quot; that saw artists and intellectuals pushing for more leniency from the state; by April 1966, however, the government were supportive of the Beatles and instead targeted the Rolling Stones.

The US Labor Department attempted to ban the Beatles from performing in the country, motivated by cultural conservatism and after lobbying from the American Federation of Musicians. The government sought to ban all British acts in 1965, but the financial opportunities presented by the Beatles ensured that their second North American tour went ahead. From that year onwards, right-wing Christian leaders such as Bob Larson and David Noebel were vocal in their condemnation of the Beatles&#x27; influence in the US. As a spokesman for the anti-communist Christian Crusade, Noebel denounced the band as &quot;four mop-headed anti-Christ beatniks&quot;, and published pamphlets warning that they were destroying the morals of America&#x27;s youth to facilitate a communist takeover orchestrated from Moscow. By contrast, &quot;Pravda&quot;, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said the Beatles represented &quot;a plot by the ruling classes to distract ... youngsters from politics and bitter pondering over disgraced and shattered hopes&quot;.

In the UK, criticism largely faded with the band&#x27;s international breakthrough, as commentators recognised the Beatles&#x27; value to the economy. Some traditionalists were nevertheless outraged by the group being awarded MBEs, and the Beatles, as with rock music in general, remained the target of figures such as &quot;Daily Mail&quot; columnist Monica Furlong and conservative activist Mary Whitehouse. In 1967, Whitehouse campaigned against the lyric &quot;Boy, you&#x27;ve been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down&quot; in the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; after the BBC had aired the song as part of the band&#x27;s TV film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. The BBC duly banned the song. The following year, Lennon&#x27;s relationship with Japanese avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, for whom he abandoned his wife and son, was met with strong public disapproval and racial abuse. Lennon received further condemnation from conservatives when he returned his MBE to the Queen in November 1969. He cited his opposition to the British government&#x27;s support of both US involvement in the Vietnam War and Nigeria&#x27;s role in the Biafra conflict, in addition to the poor chart performance of his and Ono&#x27;s second Plastic Ono Band single, &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;.

====Budokan, Manila and &quot;Jesus&quot; controversies====


The Japanese authorities viewed the band as subversive before they were appointed as MBEs in 1965. In the lead-up to the Beatles&#x27; concerts in Tokyo the following year, the visit was the subject of national debate as traditionalists were opposed to the group&#x27;s influence and the decision to allow them to perform at the Nippon Budokan,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nabhan/JT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a venue reserved for martial arts and a shrine to Japan&#x27;s war dead. The Beatles received death threats&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/Strokes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and ultranationalist students demonstrated outside the Budokan during their stay.

Shortly afterwards, the band played in Manila in the Philippines, at a time when the country was keen to project a pro-Western image with the recent inauguration of President Ferdinand Marcos. There, the Beatles&#x27; nonattendance at an official function organised by Imelda Marcos was perceived as an insult to the nation&#x27;s first family; it led to recrimination in the local press, the band&#x27;s security detail being withdrawn, and mob violence against them as they attempted to leave the country. Filipino writer Nick Joaquin said the situation was indicative of how the Philippines had been attracted to the Beatles&#x27; image without appreciating that their message was one advocating individuality, adventurousness and originality over the qualities that still defined the country: tradition and order. Joaquin likened the group&#x27;s presence in Manila to Batman being transplanted to Thebes in Ancient Greece.

The band enjoyed what Epstein termed a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the US until late July 1966, when &quot;Datebook&quot; magazine published an interview that Lennon gave for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; &quot;How Does a Beatle Live?&quot; series. In the interview, Lennon said the Beatles were &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;, such was the decline of Christianity. His comments caused no significant reaction in the UK, but radio stations in the US Bible Belt soon launched a boycott of Beatles music and organised bonfires of the band&#x27;s records and merchandise. For some Southern commentators, the furore over Lennon&#x27;s alleged blasphemy allowed them to air their suppressed grievances regarding the Beatles&#x27; long hair and the group&#x27;s support for African-American musicians. Spain and South Africa joined in the radio ban, as did other stations in the US, and the Vatican issued a statement condemning Lennon&#x27;s remark.

At Epstein&#x27;s insistence, Lennon apologised during a press conference at the start of the band&#x27;s US tour. Members of the Ku Klux Klan threatened reprisals against the Beatles, particularly when they were due to play in Memphis, but the tour passed without major incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Runtagh/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Further to their experiences in Tokyo and Manila, the &quot;Jesus&quot; controversy confirmed the Beatles&#x27; decision to retire as live performers in 1966. Another religious controversy ensued in the US in reaction to the band&#x27;s 1969 single &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, due to Lennon&#x27;s use of the word &quot;Christ&quot; and reference to crucifixion.

===Idealism and the counterculture===
&quot;Rubber Soul&quot; included Lennon&#x27;s &quot;The Word&quot;, the lyrics of which anticipated the ethos behind the counterculture&#x27;s 1967 Summer of Love, while &quot;Revolver&quot; included a number of songs whose lyrics address themes of death, isolation and transcendence from material concerns. Of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, Lennon&#x27;s evocation of an LSD trip, MacDonald writes that the song&#x27;s message &quot;launched the till-then élite-preserved concept of mind-expansion into pop, simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness-enhancing drugs and the ancient religious philosophies of the Orient, utterly alien to Western thought in their anti-materialism, rapt passivity, and world-sceptical focus on visionary consciousness&quot;. In author Shawn Levy&#x27;s description, &quot;Revolver&quot; presented the Beatles as &quot;the world&#x27;s first household psychedelics, avatars of something wilder and more revolutionary than anything pop culture had ever delivered before&quot;.

From 1966, the Beatles began to promulgate a world view espousing LSD-inspired higher consciousness, led by Lennon and Harrison defying Epstein&#x27;s insistence that the group refrain from commenting on political issues such as the Vietnam War. The controversy surrounding Lennon&#x27;s &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot; remark reinforced their determination to speak out and furthered their standing in the emerging counterculture. Cultural commentator Mark Hertsgaard writes that the band did not directly address racism, war or social justice in their songs from this period, yet a &quot;sensibility ... permeated their music&quot; and &quot;The essence of the Beatles&#x27; message was not simply that the world &quot;had&quot; to change, but, more importantly, that it &quot;could&quot; change.&quot; He sees this best exemplified in &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and says that Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Within You Without You&quot; &quot;contained the album&#x27;s most overt expression of the Beatles&#x27; shared belief in spiritual awareness and social change&quot;. Abbie Hoffman likened &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; to &quot;Beethoven coming to the supermarket&quot;, adding: &quot;It summed up so much of what we were saying politically, culturally, artistically, expressing our inner feelings and our view of the world in a way that was so revolutionary.&quot;
On 25 June 1967, the Beatles premiered &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Our World&quot; satellite broadcast before an international audience estimated at 400 million. In his feature on the song in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gavin Edwards writes that when &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; was issued as a single weeks later, it reached &quot;Number One all over the world, providing the sing-song anthem for the Summer of Love, with a sentiment that was simple but profound&quot;. Simonelli credits the song with formally announcing the arrival of flower power ideology as a mainstream concept. Psychiatrist R.D. Laing, who incorporated the Beatles&#x27; and Dylan&#x27;s music and LSD in his treatment at his Kingsley Hall practice, recalled of the song&#x27;s relevance: &quot;Everyone was getting the feel of the world as a global village – as us, one species ... One of the most heartening things about the Beatles was that they gave expression to a shared sense of celebration around the world, a sense of the same sensibility.&quot;

In response to the political events and more turbulent atmosphere of 1968, the Beatles released &quot;Revolution&quot;, in the lyrics to which Lennon espoused a pacifist agenda over violent confrontation. The song inspired the first in-depth debate regarding the connection between rock music and politics, where beforehand music journalists and political radicals in the US had mostly viewed their respective fields in isolation. Lennon&#x27;s stance drew heavy criticism from New Left writers as the single&#x27;s release coincided with the violent subjugation of Vietnam War protestors at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and condemnation in the West of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia and its crushing of attempts to introduce democratic reforms there. With its more universal message, McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, the A-side of the single, was adopted as an anthem by Czech citizens in their struggle. &quot;The Beatles&quot; was similarly attacked by the radical left. While the counterculture adopted &quot;Piggies&quot; as an anti-establishment anthem, many radicals viewed the band&#x27;s use of parody and satire throughout the album as evidence of their disengagement with pressing political issues.

The Beatles&#x27; influence on the more radicalised sectors of the counterculture and the New Left declined as the band refused to engage in direct activism against the establishment. Lennon furthered his stance by campaigning for world peace with Ono in 1969 and, in Simonelli&#x27;s description, remained the &quot;most popular political voice in rock music&quot; until 1972. The Beatles retained their social influence through to the band&#x27;s break-up, and their idealism continued to resonate in the politics of the Vietnam War era. Released in September 1969, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; included &quot;Come Together&quot;, which Lennon began writing as a campaign song for Timothy Leary&#x27;s bid to become governor of California. Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; was adopted by George McGovern in his campaign for the US presidency, the initial success of which, according to Schaffner, was a &quot;triumph for the counterculture&#x27;s attempt to wield power via conventional electoral politics&quot;.

====Manson, &quot;Paul is dead&quot; and break-up====
From &quot;Revolver&quot; onwards, analysing the Beatles&#x27; lyrics for hidden meaning became a popular trend in the US. The lyrics on the band&#x27;s 1968 double album progressed from being vague to open-ended and prone to misinterpretation, such as &quot;Glass Onion&quot; (the line &quot;the walrus was Paul&quot;) and &quot;Piggies&quot; (&quot;what they need&#x27;s a damn good whacking&quot;). In August 1969, Hollywood actress Sharon Tate and six other individuals were murdered by members of the Manson Family, acting on Charles Manson&#x27;s interpretation of White Album songs such as &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;Piggies&quot; and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;. Within weeks, unrelated rumours of McCartney&#x27;s death began to spread, based on perceived clues left in the Beatles&#x27; lyrics and record sleeves. It was alleged that he had been replaced by a look-alike.

MacDonald cites Manson&#x27;s Helter Skelter scenario as an example of the many &quot;crackpot fixations&quot; that the Beatles inspired in their drug-influenced audience, and a dangerous escalation of the otherwise harmless obsession that encouraged rumours such as the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; conspiracy theory. Schaffner described the latter as &quot;the most monumental hoax since Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast persuaded thousands of panicky New Jerseyites that Martian invaders were in the vicinity&quot;. Its escalation in 1969, particularly in the US, was informed by the counterculture&#x27;s disillusionment with society and, according to American broadcaster Vin Scelsa, indicative of how songs by the Beatles, Dylan and the Rolling Stones were received as &quot;personal message[s], worthy of endless scrutiny&quot; and &quot;guidelines on how to live your life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noden/MojoSpecialRevolution&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Manson murders and the Beatles&#x27; break-up are often cited as marking the decade&#x27;s closure. According to Burns, the break-up in April 1970 was &quot;like the Kennedy assassination all over again, or one&#x27;s parents divorcing&quot;. The event was afforded the attention of a presidential assassination or the 1969 Moon landing, as commentators analysed the causes and speculated about the possibilities of a reunion. Burns writes that, throughout the 1970s, there persisted a sense that if the Beatles re-formed, it might revive &quot;the &#x27;era&#x27; that had seemed to have passed. When Lennon died, that truly was the end of ... the innocent, comforting, naive belief that the world at large could, somehow, be &#x27;together&#x27; in the 1960s sense of the term.&quot;

===Drug culture===
According to music critic Jim DeRogatis, the Beatles are seen as the &quot;Acid Apostles of the New Age&quot;. The band&#x27;s connection with recreational drugs was important to their position as leaders of the counterculture, as was their embrace of Indian religion. According to Kureishi, drugs had long been connected to music, but &quot;the Beatles were the first to parade their particular drug use – marijuana and LSD – without shame ... The Beatles made taking drugs seem an enjoyable, fashionable and liberating experience, like them, you would see and feel in ways you hadn&#x27;t imagined possible.&quot;

The band&#x27;s drug-taking became public knowledge with the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, the album&#x27;s closing track, was banned by the BBC for an alleged drug reference in the line &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot;; with &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, the title was widely read as a code for LSD. Although he had long resisted Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s urging before trying the drug, McCartney announced in a &quot;Life&quot; article in June 1967 that he had taken LSD. When asked to confirm his statement by an ITN reporter, McCartney repeated that he had taken the drug. In the UK, according to MacDonald, the admission &quot;brought howls of righteous anger on their heads&quot; in a manner similar to the 1966 Jesus controversy. As a show of support, Lennon, Harrison and Epstein announced that they too had taken LSD. In July 1967, all four Beatles added their signatures to a petition demanding the legalisation of marijuana and paid for its publication in a full-page ad in &quot;The Times&quot;.

McCartney&#x27;s admission formalised the link between rock music and drugs, and, as in the 1966 controversy, attracted scorn from American religious leaders and conservatives. In early August 1967, Harrison made a well-publicised visit to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, the epicentre of the counterculture during the Summer of Love, which was viewed as a further endorsement of the drug culture. Leary, an LSD advocate whose text &quot;The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; Lennon had used in his lyrics for &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, declared the Beatles to be &quot;the wisest, holiest, most effective avatars (Divine Incarnate, God Agents) that the human race has ever produced&quot;. A United Nations report stated that the Beatles, along with the Rolling Stones and other rock bands, promoted drug use through their music, and that young listeners were following their lead. Bray writes that, rather than advocating drug-taking as a road to &quot;mindless oblivion&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; espousal of LSD was focused on enlightenment and was therefore one of their &quot;key legacies to the counterculture&quot;.

In early 1967, the Beatles&#x27; elevated status as MBEs ensured that Harrison and his wife, English model Pattie Boyd, were allowed to leave a party in Sussex before Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones were arrested on drugs charges. As a result of McCartney&#x27;s LSD admission, however, the British authorities&#x27; indulgence of the band started to wane significantly. According to Harris, the turning point was &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, which was broadcast on Boxing Day 1967 and earned the group their first scathing reviews. In October 1968, Lennon and Ono were arrested on charges of cannabis possession; Lennon maintained he had been warned of the raid and that the drugs were planted by the arresting officers from the London Drug Squad. The same senior officer, Norman Pilcher, arrested Harrison and Boyd for possession in March 1969. Harrison also said that the evidence, which was found on a carpet, was planted, since: &quot;I keep my socks in the sock drawer and my stash in the stash box. Anything else they must have brought.&quot;

With the release of &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, which the other Beatles had rejected as a possible single, Lennon made heroin addiction the subject of a pop hit for the first time. As part of an escalating national debate that had triggered an investigation by the US Congress, Vice-president Spiro Agnew launched a campaign in 1970 to address the issue of American youth being &quot;brainwashed&quot; into taking drugs through the music of the Beatles and other rock artists.

===Spirituality and Transcendental Meditation===
The Beatles&#x27; interest in Eastern religions is described by MacDonald as arguably the &quot;most striking example&quot; of the band&#x27;s ability to transform a minor social trend into a world-wide phenomenon and thereby &quot;magnify&quot; cultural developments during the second half of the 1960s. From 1967 to 1968, the group were promoters of Transcendental Meditation and the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, which resulted in Transcendental Meditation becoming a worldwide phenomenon. As a result of the coverage given to the Beatles&#x27; interest, words such as &quot;mantra&quot; and &quot;guru&quot; became commonly used in the West for the first time. While the band&#x27;s new, anti-LSD message was met with approval, their championing of the Maharishi and his TM technique was often the subject of confusion and ridicule in the mainstream press, particularly in Britain.

Before departing for the Maharishi&#x27;s ashram in Rishikesh in February 1968, the Beatles recorded two songs that reflected their interest in TM: Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Inner Light&quot;. Philip Goldberg, in his book &quot;American Veda&quot;, writes that the band&#x27;s stay in Rishikesh &quot;may have been the most momentous spiritual retreat since Jesus spent those forty days in the wilderness&quot;. Despite their later rejection of the Maharishi, the Beatles generated wider interest in Transcendental Meditation, which encouraged the study of Eastern spirituality in Western popular culture.

MacDonald credits Harrison with inspiring &quot;the West&#x27;s mainstream acquaintance with Hindu religion and creat[ing] the late-&#x27;60s so-called Spiritual Revival&quot;, and he deems this &quot;a fundamental cultural sea-change ... [and] an abiding testimony to Harrison&#x27;s importance as a counter-cultural figure&quot;. Spiritual biographer Gary Tillery also recognises the Beatles, or more specifically Harrison, as having &quot;abruptly brought Indian spirituality to everyday awareness&quot; through their association with the Maharishi. Tillery writes that, while the influence of Indian gurus such as Vivekananda, Yogananda, the Maharishi and Prabhupada was well established by the late 1960s, it was the Beatles&#x27; endorsement of their respective philosophies that most contributed to yoga and meditation centres becoming ubiquitous in Western cities and towns over subsequent decades. According to author Andrew Grant Jackson:

The Beats had promoted Buddhism since the 1950s, but it was George Harrison&#x27;s songs espousing Hindu philosophy and featuring Indian musicians, and the Beatles&#x27; study of Transcendental Meditation, that truly kick-started the human potential movement of the 1970s (rebranded New Age in the 1980s). In this way, the musicians helped expand the freedom of religion the United States was founded on to encompass options outside the Judeo-Christian tradition.

==Artistic presentation==
The Beatles introduced new methods of artistic presentation for pop musicians. They were the first band to be fully marketed through television and continued to find new ways to disseminate their music through the medium. As live performers, they pioneered the world tour and stadium concerts, as sports stadiums became the primary venues for rock tours. Gould says that, aside from their influence on pop songwriting, the Beatles played &quot;a leading role in revolutionizing the way that popular records were made, the way that popular records were listened to ... and the role that popular music itself would play in people&#x27;s lives&quot;.

The band&#x27;s achievements were a key factor in the music industry becoming a multi-million-dollar enterprise and one that approached Hollywood film-making in terms of worldwide influence and turnover. In 1965, the Beatles&#x27; music publishing company Northern Songs was floated on the London Stock Exchange, a move that was unprecedented for a band&#x27;s song catalogue. The flotation defied analysts&#x27; predictions by becoming a major financial success.

===Record formats===
Both sides of the Beatles&#x27; singles were often major US hits, an achievement that helped elevate the perception of a B-side from its role as a disposable song. The group&#x27;s December 1965 single pairing &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; was the first example of a double A-side single in Britain. Its success popularised the format and, in giving equal treatment to two songs, allowed recording artists to show their versatility.&lt;ref name=&quot;White/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The band issued further double A-sides – &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; / &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; / &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; / &quot;Come Together&quot; – when they thought that both songs in the pairing were equally strong. Their &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; double EP, containing the six new songs from the TV film, was also the first example of that format being used in the UK.

In January 1966, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine cited the initial US sales of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format. According to Gould, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;″s impact was such that it &quot;revolutionize[d] both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 1963&quot;. Although &quot;The Beatles&quot; was not the first rock double album, it was the longest up to that time, at close to 94 minutes.

===Album artwork===
The Beatles&#x27; album covers furthered the medium as an art form and were widely imitated. Doggett recognises the cover photos for &quot;With the Beatles&quot; and &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as examples of the band&#x27;s image being used to &quot;test the limits of the portrait&quot;, a movement that was also reflected in the cover designs for contemporary albums by Dylan and the Rolling Stones. Robert Freeman&#x27;s monochrome cover shot for &quot;With the Beatles&quot; (or Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; in the US) departed from convention, and alarmed EMI, by showing the band members looking austere and unsmiling. This stance was heightened in Freeman&#x27;s cover portrait for &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;, which departed further from the standard pop LP by reducing the album title to minuscule type and otherwise making no mention of the band&#x27;s name. According to Schaffner, each Beatles LP cover represented a &quot;revolution in artwork&quot; starting with &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. The latter featured a distorted image of the band&#x27;s faces, which were nevertheless so instantly recognisable by 1965 that no artist credit was necessary.

For the US LP &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; in 1966, the Beatles supplied Capitol with a cover showing them in butcher&#x27;s white coats and clutching raw meat and dismembered dolls. Known as the &quot;butcher cover&quot;, it was intended as a comment on the Vietnam War, although the photo was also interpreted as a criticism of Capitol&#x27;s policy of altering the content of Beatles albums for the North American market. American disc jockeys and retailers were appalled by the image; &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; magazine described it as &quot;the most nauseating album cover ever seen in the US&quot;. Capitol soon recalled all copies of the album and replaced the cover with a less provocative band portrait. The episode predated cover controversies such as those for LPs by the Rolling Stones (with &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;) and Blind Faith in the late 1960s and by Alice Cooper, Mom&#x27;s Apple Pie, Roxy Music and Golden Earring in the 1970s.
Writing in their book &quot;The Art of the LP&quot;, Johnny Morgan and Ben Wardle say the Beatles were arguably the leaders in &quot;creating identity&quot; through album artwork, an approach they consider motivated by the group&#x27;s retirement as live performers, as well as the catalyst for record company art designers to incorporate drug allusions in their LP covers following the example set by &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The design for &quot;Revolver&quot; was markedly different from LP covers of 1966, particularly in its eschewing of vibrant psychedelic colours for black-and-white; in Gould&#x27;s view, it supported the aesthetic of the music and the Beatles&#x27; determination to reinvent themselves on record. Created by Klaus Voormann, the band&#x27;s friend from their years in Hamburg, the cover combined line-drawing caricatures of the Beatles&#x27; faces with a collage of older photos. In the line drawings, Voormann drew inspiration from the work of the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, who was the subject of a long-running exhibition at London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum and highly influential on fashion and design themes of the time. Voormann placed the various photos within the tangle of hair connecting the four faces, thereby, in Rodriguez&#x27;s description, capturing both the long hair synonymous with the band&#x27;s public image and &quot;the explosion of ideas that were pouring out of their heads&quot;.

According to author Ian Inglis, the cover for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is widely recognised for demonstrating an &quot;unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space&quot;, and it initiated an acceptance of album artwork as an &quot;integral component&quot; of the listening experience. The LP&#x27;s gatefold packaging included cardboard cutouts and, for the first time in a pop album, printed lyrics. The inclusion of the lyrics infuriated sheet music publishers, who lost the revenue from sales of the songs&#x27; sheet music. In the late 1990s, the BBC included the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; cover in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design, placing it ahead of the red telephone box, Mary Quant&#x27;s miniskirt, and the Mini motorcar. The cover of &quot;The Beatles&quot; contrasted with that of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; by featuring a minimalist concept of plain white, with the title rendered in plain type. Each copy was individually numbered on the cover, thereby lending a uniqueness to each one and reflecting a tenet of conceptual art.

===Film and music videos===
&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; broke new ground in the field of British and American musical feature films, particularly in its abandoning of the genre&#x27;s standard rags-to-riches premise for a comedic presentation of the artists playing themselves. Film historian Stephen Glynn describes it as &quot;the canonical pop music film&quot;. He highlights the innovative techniques Lester uses in the sequence for &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, as does Saul Austerlitz, who deems it the precursor to the modern music video. Lester&#x27;s use of devices from the European art-house tradition, combined with the film&#x27;s comedic and satirical qualities, ensured that &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; defied easy categorisation and won critical recognition for the rock music film. Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of jukebox musicals&quot;.
With &quot;Help!&quot;, Lester presented the Beatles in &quot;one of the central surrealist texts&quot; of the 1960s, according to Bray. The film uses pop art visuals and satirises James Bond films, particularly the latter&#x27;s depiction of the British Secret Service as an efficiently run organisation, and one enjoying a level of influence equal to its US counterpart in their shared operations. In addition to inspiring &quot;The Monkees&quot;, the film influenced the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series.

Starting with &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; in late 1965, the band filmed promotional clips for their singles to circumvent the industry norm of having to make numerous personal appearances on television shows. The Beatles&#x27; promotional clips anticipated the music video and the rise of MTV in the 1980s. The clips for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; are considered pioneering works in the medium. Both avoided performance of the song in response to the 1966 Musicians&#x27; Union&#x27;s ban on miming on TV; in the case of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, the clip employs abstract imagery and features reverse film effects, stop motion animation, jump-cuts from day- to night-time, superimposition and close-up shots. Referring to the 1968 clip for &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and the sight of the Beatles engulfed by a crowd made up of &quot;young, old, male, female, black, brown, and white&quot; fans, Hertsgaard describes it as &quot;a quintessential sixties moment, a touching tableau of contentment and togetherness&quot;.

&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; third film for United Artists, provided a revolution in animated film and allowed animators to fully express ideas using psychedelic visuals. It marked a departure from the confines of Disney&#x27;s productions and was credited with saving the feature-length animated film. Austerlitz describes the Beatles&#x27; rooftop performance of &quot;Get Back&quot; as &quot;legendary&quot;. Filmed in January 1969 for the finale to the United Artists documentary film &quot;Let It Be&quot;, the clip was homaged by U2 in the video for their 1987 single &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; and by Red Hot Chili Peppers in the video for their 2011 single &quot;The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie&quot;.

===As dedicated recording artists===
In Gould&#x27;s description, the Beatles&#x27; career trajectory was largely self-determined and free of the show business considerations that had limited and defined the model of stardom represented by Presley and Sinatra. The band&#x27;s decision to retire from live performance in 1966 and become a group focused solely on studio recording had no precedent. Given the premium placed on concerts, the press assumed the Beatles were due to break up. From that year onwards, according to Everett, their albums &quot;each suggested ... a different set of rules and that these rules were dictated by the artists&quot;. Barry Miles, a leading figure in the 1960s London underground, described &quot;Revolver&quot; as the &quot;step-change&quot; that signalled &quot;the way forward for all rock musicians who wondered if there was life after teen scream status&quot;.

According to Doyle Greene, while academics disagree on whether the Beatles were modernists or postmodernists, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;arguably marked rock&#x27;s music&#x27;s entry into postmodernism as opposed to high-modernism&quot;. At McCartney&#x27;s suggestion, the group adopted alter egos as members of the fictitious Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, an approach that inspired similar practices by glam rock acts of the 1970s. McCartney assumed an unofficial leadership role of the Beatles following Epstein&#x27;s death in August 1967, but his bandmates soon challenged this position after the critical failure of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. Stark cites the TV film as the first example of the Beatles being afflicted by &quot;Michael Jordan syndrome&quot;, in that they excelled as songwriters and recording artists but mistakenly believed that their talents would transfer effectively to film and business projects.
The group recorded their 1968 double album in an often divisive atmosphere, which was partly a backlash against the level of McCartney&#x27;s involvement in the band&#x27;s activities. The postmodern traits of politics, parody and pastiche were the subject of adverse scrutiny on &quot;The Beatles&quot;. Everett says that for the majority of baby boomers, the White Album represents &quot;the double album&quot; of the era. Cultural critic Camille Paglia likened the Beatles&#x27; final recording projects – the &quot;Get Back&quot; filmed rehearsals, which subsequently produced &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; – to the last phase in a &quot;tripartite pattern&quot; that typified the early, high and late periods of painters such as Picasso and Donatello; within this final phase, just as &quot;major artists revolt, resimplify&quot;, the band sought to abandon the studio sophistication of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. &quot;Abbey Road&quot; reflected a compromise in the diverging artistic visions of Lennon and McCartney but became the Beatles&#x27; best-selling album. In Stark&#x27;s description, some critics came to view the LP as the band&#x27;s &quot;farewell to their fans and an attack on &#x27;selfishness and self-gratification&#x27;&quot;, particularly through McCartney&#x27;s closing statement in the side two &quot;Long Medley&quot;.

===Apple Corps===
The Beatles founded Apple Corps in January 1968. The company was intended as an alternative system of cultural production and consumption, run on countercultural principles whereby artists would not have to conform to established industry practice. McCartney likened its ethos to &quot;Western communism&quot;. Schaffner described Apple Corps as &quot;a Pepperland of their own&quot; and &quot;the first multi-million dollar, multi-media conglomerate to be operated both by and for the turned-on generation without any interference from the &#x27;men in suits&#x27;&quot;.
One of several divisions within the conglomerate was Apple Records, which Burns calls &quot;the first record label of any consequence started by a band&quot;. The EMI-distributed label allowed the band members to further their individual interests and support artists of their choice, and it was a rare example of an artist-run label that progressed beyond a vanity project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose/NPR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Philo writes that, with the international success of the singles &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and Mary Hopkin&#x27;s &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, &quot;Apple&#x27;s launch was comfortably the most successful label launch of all time.&quot; By 1970, with Harrison and McCartney as its principal producers, it had launched the international careers of acts such as Billy Preston, James Taylor and Badfinger.

Along with its subsidiary Zapple Records, Apple provided an outlet for Lennon to present himself as a fully fledged avant-garde artist in his collaborations with Ono, a direction that was at odds with the Beatles&#x27; work. In doing so, according to Schaffner, Lennon attracted ridicule and admiration alike as his work resembled &quot;a one-way mirror that offered the world a clearer, more intimate picture of a celebrity than it had ever before known on such a scale&quot;. Harrison also issued solo albums on the label in the late 1960s, starting with the &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; soundtrack. Author Peter Lavezzoli&#x27;s describes the top 20 UK chart placing of the Radha Krishna Temple&#x27;s &quot;Hare Krishna Mantra&quot; single, which Harrison produced in 1969, as an &quot;astonishing achievement&quot; that was indicative of the Beatles&#x27; ability to influence by association. Until the label&#x27;s closure in the mid-1970s, Apple had the highest success rate of any British record company with regard to UK chart hits.

While Apple Corps soon floundered, it provided the inspiration for corporate philosophies adopted by companies such as Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Apple Computer, Inc. and Google. Beatles historian Bruce Spizer identifies the Apple iPod as the realisation of Lennon&#x27;s idea of combining music, film and electronics.
==Music and recording aesthetics==
===Jangle, folk rock and power pop===
Music journalist Mark Kemp credits the Beatles with leading pop music&#x27;s expansion into styles such as world music, psychedelia, avant-pop and electronica, and attracting a bohemian audience that had previously focused on jazz and folk. According to Luhrssen and Larson, the Beatles affected every genre of rock music except jazz rock. Together with the Byrds, they are commonly credited with launching the popularity of the &quot;jangly&quot; sound that defined jangle pop. Harrison was one of the first people to own a Rickenbacker 360/12, an electric guitar with twelve strings. His use of this guitar during the recording of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that &quot;Melody Maker&quot; termed it the Beatles&#x27; &quot;secret weapon&quot;. Roger McGuinn liked the effect so much that he made it his signature guitar sound with the Byrds.

Within a year of their 1964 meeting, the Beatles and Dylan adopted elements of each other&#x27;s respective genres, rock and folk, into their music. Both acts became a significant influence on the folk rock movement that followed in 1965. In Jackson&#x27;s view, it was Harrison&#x27;s twelve-string arpeggios at the end of the Beatles&#x27; July 1964 single, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, that &quot;birthed&quot; the folk-rock sound. Dubbed for the Byrds&#x27; debut single, a cover of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, the term &quot;folk rock&quot; referred to &quot;Dylanesque lyrics combined with rock rhythm and Beatlesque harmonies&quot;. In response to the Byrds, the Beatles developed the jangle-pop sound of folk rock with the treble-heavy guitars on the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; tracks &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;. Gould describes the altered US edition of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as the release that encouraged &quot;legions of folk-music enthusiasts&quot; to embrace pop. According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, building on the &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot;, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was as an early example of country rock, anticipating the Byrds&#x27; 1968 album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

According to author Carl Caferelli, while the Who have been credited for heralding the power pop genre, &quot;the story really begins circa 1964, with the commercial ascension of the Beatles in America.&quot; He recognises the Beatles as the embodiment of the &quot;pop band&quot; ideal. Only a few acts continued the tradition of Beatles-style pop during the first half of the 1970s, but late in the decade, there was a renewed interest in the music and culture of the 1960s, with examples such as the &quot;Beatlemania&quot; musical and the growing mod revival. From the mid-1970s onwards, power pop bands drew inspiration from the jangle guitars, vocal harmonies and sense of &quot;teenage innocence&quot; that had been characteristics of the Merseybeat sound first popularised by the Beatles. In a 1991 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article covering newer power pop bands, Chris Willman wrote that many of the groups were &quot;very&quot; influenced by the Beatles, although &quot;not always directly&quot;, as some of the musicians said that they were instead predominately influenced by 1970s and 1980s artists who emulated the Beatles.

===Recording practices and electronic music===

In his role as the Beatles&#x27; record producer, George Martin is generally credited with helping to popularise the idea of the recording studio as an instrument used for in-studio composition. Although he was nominally the Beatles&#x27; producer, however, from 1964 he ceded control to the band, allowing them to use the studio as a workshop for their ideas and later as a sound laboratory. Musicologist Olivier Julien writes that the Beatles&#x27; &quot;gradual integration of arranging and recording into one and the same process&quot; began as early as 1963, but developed in earnest during the sessions for &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;ultimately blossomed&quot; during the sessions for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. In acquiring control over the recording process, whereby Martin and his engineers became facilitators of the musicians&#x27; ideas, the Beatles reversed the strict hierarchy that had long been in place at EMI. In addition to inspiring other artists, their example helped break the hold that EMI and Decca Records had on the British recording industry, leading to the growth of independent studios there, including the Beatles&#x27; own Apple Studio.

In Everett&#x27;s description, &quot;Revolver&quot; was both an &quot;innovative example&quot; of electronic music and a work that &quot;advanced the leading edge of the rock world&quot;. The album makes full use of an assortment of studio tricks such as varispeed and backwards (or backmasked) taping; according to authors Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew, artificial double tracking (ADT), backwards recording, and close-miked drums were among the nine techniques that the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions introduced into the recording world for the first time. The 1966 B-side &quot;Rain&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions, was the first pop recording to include reversed sounds, while the album track &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; included the first example of backwards lead guitar on a pop recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick/Tele&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing composer and producer Virgil Moorefield&#x27;s book &quot;The Producer as Composer&quot;, author Jay Hodgson highlights &quot;Revolver&quot; as representing a &quot;dramatic turning point&quot; in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the &quot;performability&quot; of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners&#x27; preconceptions of a pop recording. &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, according to author David Howard, was one of two pop recordings that ensured that the studio &quot;was now its own instrument&quot; (the other being Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;). ADT soon became a standard pop production technique, and led to related developments such as the artificial chorus effect. MacDonald credits the use of damping and close-miking on Starr&#x27;s drums with creating a &quot;three-dimensional&quot; sound that, along with other Beatles innovations, engineers in the US would soon adopt as standard practice.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, according to Julien, represents the &quot;epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool&quot;, marking the moment when &quot;popular music entered the era of phonographic composition.&quot; Quoting a composer from the UCLA School of Music, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s appreciation of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; recognised the Beatles as having adopted concepts first pioneered by the Cologne group, thereby making an &quot;enormous contribution to electronic music&quot;. Musician and producer Alan Parsons believed that with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, &quot;people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.&quot;

Released on &quot;The Beatles&quot;, the eight-minute &quot;Revolution 9&quot; was an overt exercise in electronic music and the avant-garde. MacDonald identifies the track as another example of the Beatles introducing a previously elite scene to a mainstream audience and describes it as &quot;the world&#x27;s most widely distributed avant-garde artifact&quot;. In early 1969, Harrison became one of the first musicians in the UK to own a Moog synthesizer, which the Beatles went on to use on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; tracks such as &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;. Writing in his book on electronic music, author Thom Holmes says that in this way the Beatles were &quot;one of the first groups to effectively integrate the sounds of the Moog into their music&quot;.

===Psychedelia and progressive music===
====Western classical fusion====

Music critics Robert Christgau and Mark Ellen each identify &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as the album that laid the foundations for psychedelia. Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, Everett identifies it as a work that was &quot;made more to be thought about than danced to&quot;, and an album that &quot;began a far-reaching trend&quot; in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. Many baroque-rock works appeared soon afterwards, particularly due to Martin&#x27;s harpsichord-like solo on the track &quot;In My Life&quot;, while the album also marked the introduction into pop of the pump organ or harmonium. &quot;Revolver&quot; ensured that psychedelic pop emerged from its underground roots and into the mainstream, while &quot;Rain&quot; originated British psychedelic rock. The chamber-orchestrated &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; is cited by Simonelli as an example of the Beatles&#x27; influence being such that, whatever the style of song, it helped to define the parameters of rock music.

The 1967 double A-side single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; / &quot;Penny Lane&quot; comprised two songs in which Lennon and McCartney, respectively, celebrated their Liverpool upbringing. Simonelli writes that the songs instilled the Romantic artistic tradition as a central tenet of psychedelic rock. In MacDonald&#x27;s view, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; launched both the &quot;English pop-pastoral mood&quot; typified by bands such as Pink Floyd, Family, Traffic and Fairport Convention, and English psychedelia&#x27;s LSD-inspired preoccupation with &quot;nostalgia for the innocent vision of a child&quot;. The Mellotron&#x27;s appearance on the track remains the most celebrated use of the instrument on a pop or rock recording. Together with the resonant tone of Starr&#x27;s drums, the cello arrangement on &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (as with &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; from &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;) was much admired by other musicians and producers, and proved highly influential on 1970s bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Wizzard.

According to Everett, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts&quot; on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; &quot;encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s&quot;. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (along with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;) is largely viewed as originating the progressive rock genre due to the album&#x27;s lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism and influences derived from classical music forms. For several years following its release, straightforward rock and roll was supplanted by a growing interest in extended form, and numerous English psychedelic bands developed characteristics of the Beatles&#x27; music (specifically their classical influence) further than either the Beatles or contemporaneous West Coast psychedelic bands.

Art pop is often traced to the Beatles&#x27; first recording with a string quartet (&quot;Yesterday&quot;) in conjunction with the group&#x27;s mid-1960s contemporaries. AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is also frequently cited as the first true concept album, a medium that became central to progressive rock. According to Moore, &quot;Even though previous albums had set a unified mood (notably Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers!&quot;), it was on the basis of the influence of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that the penchant for the concept album was born.&quot;

Progressive soul artists at the turn of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, George Clinton, and War, drew on the Beatles&#x27; album-oriented approach and experimentation with non-traditional music influences. As bandleader for Parliament and Funkadelic, Clinton specifically pointed to how the Beatles &quot;made an art out of nonsense&quot; on songs such as &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, alongside other influences from Bob Dylan&#x27;s music and &quot;Black Power&quot; literature.

====Raga rock and Eastern fusion====
Indian culture, in the form of music and mysticism, was a significant component of the Beatles&#x27; image. Following on from the Kinks, the Yardbirds and the Beatles themselves (with &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;) incorporating droning guitars to mimic the qualities of the Indian sitar, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;″s &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; featured the first use of the instrument by a Western pop musician. Played by Harrison, the sitar part launched a craze that Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar termed &quot;the great sitar explosion&quot;, as the instrument became a popular feature in raga rock and psychedelic music. The song is often identified as the first example of raga rock,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bag/LiveMint&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a subgenre that was officially launched by the Byrds with their March 1966 single &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;.

&quot;Revolver&quot; featured two overtly Indian-styled songs: &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, with its foundation of heavy tambura drone, and &quot;Love You To&quot;. According to the &quot;Garland Encyclopedia of World Music&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot; was the first major American-derived popular music to incorporate Asian techniques and instrumentation. In his book &quot;Popular World Music&quot;, Andrew Shahriari writes that the Beatles are not usually recognised as world music artists, yet their use of Indian musical instruments, which was led by Harrison&#x27;s interest, was &quot;revolutionary&quot; in the context of 1960s European and American popular music. While Harrison was not the only rock musician to experiment with Indian styles in the mid-1960s, the Beatles&#x27; association with the genre ensured that Indian classical music reached its widest audience, through songs such as &quot;Within You Without You&quot;. In his 1997 book &quot;Indian Music and the West&quot;, ethnomusicologist Gerry Farrell said that &quot;nearly thirty years on, the Beatles&#x27; &#x27;Indian&#x27; songs remain among the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, &#x27;Blue Jay Way&#x27; and &#x27;The Inner Light.&#x27;&quot;

===Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll revival and heavy metal===
The Beatles&#x27; March 1968 single &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; was at the forefront of a contemporary rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll revival, which marked the end of the psychedelic era. In the song, McCartney sought to create a boogie-woogie piece in the style of Fats Domino. Harris says that in addition to anticipating similar revival recordings by the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; ensured that Berry and Little Richard returned to &quot;the rarified pedestals where the British Invasion groups had originally placed them&quot;.

The Beatles directly influenced the development of heavy metal in the late 1960s. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was a product of McCartney&#x27;s attempt to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible, and the recording has been noted for its &quot;proto-metal roar&quot; by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Recorded in the hard rock style with heavily distorted guitars, &quot;Revolution&quot; was the subject of complaints at retail level in 1968, since many listeners assumed the sound was the result of a manufacturing error.

Discussing Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;, &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s Josh Hart and Damien Fanelli called the song a &quot;bluesy rocker&quot; that &quot;might have inadvertently started doom metal&quot;. Jo Kendall of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine similarly commented that the song predated &quot;Black Sabbath&#x27;s creation of doom rock by several months&quot; and noted the &quot;Santana-like Latin blues section&quot; in the song. James Manning, of &quot;Time Out London&quot;, describes the song as the foundation for stoner rock.

==Continued interest and influence==

===Literature, academia and science===

In his biographical article on the Beatles for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger states, &quot;Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970.&quot; Writing in 2009, Gary Burns commented that the Beatles continue to &quot;enjoy a canonized status&quot; unprecedented for popular musicians and that they are &quot;canonical figures&quot; in each of the three categories within the rock canon: sociological, literary and musicological. He identifies them as a key influence in the foundation of hundreds of organisations and publications dedicated to serious appreciation of rock music, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Cambridge University Press&#x27;s journal &quot;Popular Music&quot;, the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, and the University of Liverpool&#x27;s Institute of Popular Music.

Hundreds of books have been written about the Beatles&#x27; career. Jonathan Gould says that the band &quot;represent a bibliographical phenomenon as well as a musical one&quot;, with the group&#x27;s history having become a folk tale that &quot;has been put to many different uses by its many different narrators&quot;. He comments that the range and variety of literature is &quot;all the more remarkable considering that, prior to the Beatles, not a single significant book had been written on the subject of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. Burns states that the quality and preponderance of &quot;scholarly, quasi-scholarly, journalistic, and fan attention&quot; given to the band far surpasses that given to Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. In her book &quot;The Rock Canon&quot;, Carys Wyn Jones affords them an elevated status akin to Shakespeare&#x27;s position of eminence in Harold Bloom&#x27;s canon of Western literature.

Relevant scholarly studies range from discussions of the band&#x27;s history and cultural impact to musicological work on such subjects as chord progressions, melody and automated analysis.
* In 2009, Liverpool Hope University started to offer a Master&#x27;s degree in &quot;The Beatles, Popular Music and Society&quot;. The program focuses on the political, social, and cultural aspects related to the Beatles and their music.
* In 2014, Thomson Reuters analyst and &quot;ScienceWatch&quot; editor Christopher King investigated 12,000 journals and books and found that 500 mentioned the Beatles in their topics or titles.
* A 2017 study of AllMusic&#x27;s catalogue indicated the band as the most frequently cited artist influence in its database. Of the 2000 artists selected for the study, 1230 were stated to be influenced by the Beatles, ahead of Dylan, with 669.
* In 2019, a scientific study involving over 80,000 different chord progressions and conducted by the Max Planck Institute in Germany indicated &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; as &quot;the perfect pop song&quot; based on how enjoyable recipients found its chord changes.
* In 2021, the University of Liverpool announced a &quot;The Beatles: Music Industry and Heritage&quot; MA, which would examine the group&#x27;s influence on popular music and culture and how the band&#x27;s influence could be replicated in different places, industries and contexts around the world. That same year, Liverpool University Press announced an upcoming &quot;Journal of Beatles Studies&quot;. The first issue was released in September 2022.
Since the early 2000s, historian Mark Lewisohn has been writing &quot;The Beatles: All These Years&quot;, a three-part set of Beatles biographies whose first volume exceeds 1,700 pages. The impetus for the project was his disappointment that none of the group&#x27;s biographies had approached a depth or breadth comparable to Robert A. Caro&#x27;s ongoing book series, &quot;The Years of Lyndon Johnson&quot;.

===Twenty-first-century relevance===

The Beatles continue to be viewed as representing the ideals of the 1960s. In Inglis&#x27;s description, &quot;their voices and faces were the most recognized symbols of the &#x27;swinging sixties&#x27; and they became – and remain – the iconic images of the decade.&quot; In 2004, the band were the most-represented act in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, with seven out of 23 Beatles songs making the top 30. In 2009, Global Beatles Day was founded as an international celebration of the band&#x27;s music and social message.&lt;ref name=&quot;GBD/IndianExpress&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The event takes place on 25 June each year in memory of the &quot;Our World&quot; performance of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 2016, cultural commentator Chuck Klosterman said that the group were &quot;only slightly less popular now&quot; than they were in the 1960s. He wrote that the group were &quot;arguably&quot; responsible for everything related to rock music, &quot;including the very notion of a band&#x27;s breaking up&quot;, and noted that no other rock group had faced unrelated assassination attempts against half its members. Klosterman concluded that, &quot;In any reasonable world, the Beatles are the answer to the question &quot;Who will be the Sousa of rock?&quot;

In the 2000s, Elvis Presley had been the only other defunct musical act to generate as much continued news and interest as the Beatles. His mass appeal curtailed significantly by the end of the 2010s, while the Beatles&#x27; popularity has endured with younger generations. The amount of Google searches for &quot;Beatles&quot; spiked by 48.59% in 2019, relative to the previous four years. That same year, the Beatles&#x27; music was streamed on Spotify 1.7 billion times; 30% of listeners were between the ages of 18 and 24, followed by 25- to 29-year-olds, at 17%. In other words, almost half of listeners were aged under 30.

As of June 2019, &quot;Yesterday&quot; remained one of the most covered songs in the history of recorded music, with over 2,200 versions. According to figures published by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI), the song was played over 7 million times on American radio during the twentieth century.

In March of 2024, Beyoncé released a cover of &quot;Blackbird&quot; on her 8th studio album &quot;Cowboy Carter.&quot;

<text>Benjamin Robertson Harney (March 6, 1872 – March 2, 1938) was an American songwriter, entertainer, and pioneer of ragtime music. His 1895 composition &quot;You&#x27;ve Been a Good Old Wagon but You Done Broke Down&quot; is known as the second ragtime composition to be published and the first ragtime hit to reach the mainstream. The first Ragtime composition published was La Pas Ma La written by Ernest Hogan in 1895. The copyright for &quot;You&#x27;ve Been a Good Old Wagon but You Done Broke Down&quot; was registered in January of 1895 (Greenup Music Co.)source, a few months prior to La Pas Ma La (September of 1895, J. R. Bell)source, suggesting (contrary to popular belief) it was in fact the first of the two. During the early years of Harney&#x27;s career, he falsely promoted himself as being the inventor of ragtime and never acknowledged the genre&#x27;s black origin. Many contemporary musicians criticized him for it. Although ragtime is now probably more associated with Scott Joplin, in 1924 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Ben Harney &quot;Probably did more to popularize ragtime than any other person.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;Ragtime&#x27;s Father&quot; in 1938.

==Life and career==


Harney is generally said to have been born in Louisville, Kentucky. Although some sources put his birthplace as Nashville, Tennessee, according to his father&#x27;s military records he was born in Memphis, Tennessee. In the past some have claimed that Harney was African-American and early in his career he is said to have played with African-American theater troupes. But, W.C. Handy referred to him as &quot;white&quot;. All photographic and contemporary accounts show that Harney was light skinned with red hair. He married and lived in white society and always represented himself as White. Furthermore, his well-documented family background conclusively proves his ethnicity. Harney was the son of Benjamin Mills Harney, a veteran of both the Mexican–American War and the Civil War, and his second wife Margaret Wellington Draffin, daughter of a prominent Kentucky lawyer. His grandfather was John Hopkins Harney, the first mathematics professor at Indiana University and author of the first algebra textbook ever published in the United States. His uncle William Wallace Harney was a renowned journalist and author. He counted two prominent U.S. generals as distant cousins: Lew Wallace and William Selby Harney.

Harney&#x27;s tunes &quot;You&#x27;ve Been a Good Old Wagon but You Done Broke Down&quot;, &quot;Mister Johnson, Turn Me Loose&quot;, and &quot;Cake Walk In The Sky&quot; were big hits in the late 1890s. In 1896, the cover of Ben Harney&#x27;s song &quot;You&#x27;ve Been a Good Old Wagon but You Done Broke Down&quot;, stated that Harney was the &quot;Original Introducer to the Stage of the Now Popular &#x27;Rag Time&#x27; in Ethiopian Song.&quot; This was one of the earliest known references to ragtime on sheet music and some sources have regarded the composition as being the first published rag. The sheet music version of &quot;Cake Walk in the Sky&quot; provided the first written out example of vocal ragging (early scat). A recording of Harney singing &quot;The Wagon&quot; (see below), although recorded many years later, in 1925, fits early accounts of Harney&#x27;s, then, very remarkable vocal style and suggests that Harney was singing very authentic sounding blues back in the 1890s. &quot;Cake Walk in the Sky&quot; was published by M. Witmark &amp; Sons in New York in 1899. On the cover to the sheet music, &quot;Cake Walk in the Sky&quot; is described as a &quot;March A La Ragtime&quot; and as &quot;A Rag-Time Nightmare&quot;.

In January 1896 Harney moved to New York City, where he appeared regularly at Tony Pastor&#x27;s Music Hall. That same year Harney was referred to in print as &quot;the rag time pianist&quot;. Harney&#x27;s appearances in New York, such as at the Weber and Fields&#x27; Broadway Music Hall, the Metropolitan Opera House, and Tony Pastor&#x27;s Music Hall, promoting ragtime music, did much to create widespread popular and commercial enthusiasm for ragtime as a new genre of American music. He also organized and directed a variety show called &quot;Ragtime Reception&quot;.

In 1897 Harney published his book &quot;Ben Harney&#x27;s Rag Time Instructor&quot;, the first description of how to &quot;rag&quot;: how to improvise rag time music by syncopating unsyncopated popular tunes. His &quot;Rag Time Instructor&quot; was arranged by ragtime composer Theodore H. Northrup and included written-out examples of &quot;ragged&quot; popular tunes including light classics and opera songs.

Also in 1897, Harney married Edyth Murray of Streator, Illinois. They later divorced, and he married an actress, Jessie Boyce, whose stage name was Jessie Haynes.

Harney toured widely on the vaudeville circuits in the United States, as well as tours of theaters in Europe and Asia, Australasia and the South Pacific. Once ragtime became popular he started billing himself as The Originator of Ragtime or The Father of Ragtime, which most (but not all) of his contemporaries thought was an overstatement for the sake of advertising. Harney&#x27;s act included him ragging tunes at the piano, scat singing, and dancing. Theatrical photographs from his Australasia tour (1911) show him dancing in blackface.

Harney quit touring after suffering from a heart attack in 1928.

Ben Harney died of a heart attack at the age of 66 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1938. In an appreciation that appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine on March 14, 1938, a week after his death, he was described as &quot;Ragtime&#x27;s Father&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; wrote that &quot;the first man to write ragtime down on paper was a slick-haired Kentuckian, Ben Harney.&quot;

== Listen ==
While Harney was neglected by commercial recording studios during his lifetime, in 1925 a folklorist, Robert Winslow Gordon, recorded Harney singing an example of an early ragtime or rag-blues song, &quot;The Wagon&quot;, on a dictaphone phonograph cylinder, and this recording has survived. Harney stated on the recording: &quot;This is absolutely the first song published in ragtime; the first song ever written in ragtime. The idea was conceived by Ben Harney, in Louisville, Kentucky.&quot;

<doc id="187923" wikidata="Q4774220" url="?curid=187923" title="Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric">
<text>Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric comprises themes, catchphrases, and slogans that have been used in order to demean lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people. Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric is widely considered a form of hate speech, which is illegal in countries such as the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.

Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric often consists of moral panic and conspiracy theories. LGBTQ movements and individuals are often portrayed as subversive and foreign, similar to earlier conspiracy theories targeting Jews and communists.

== As a foreign conspiracy ==
In 1969, the Greek junta exited the Council of Europe after being found in violation of the European Convention of Human Rights, judging that the European Commission of Human Rights was &quot;a conspiracy of homosexuals and communists against Hellenic values&quot;.

This discourse, promoted by the governments of Hungary and Poland, alleges that LGBTQ rights movements are controlled by foreign forces (such as the European Union) and are a threat to national independence and western civilization. Anti-government protests in Russia and the Euromaidan have also been portrayed by the Russian government as the work of an LGBTQ conspiracy. Furthermore, although Russia considers itself to be a European country, its government also considers its values as entirely different from those of the European Union. More specifically, Russia has distanced itself from the values of the EU by propagating its own anti-LGBTQ values.

== As an ideology ==


In 2013, the conservative blog &quot;American Thinker&quot; published several articles using the phrase &quot;LGBT ideology&quot;. The Italian Catholic philosopher used the phrase in a 2015 article, equating it with the earlier concept of &quot;gender ideology&quot;. In his article he does not define either &quot;LGBT ideology&quot; or &quot;gender ideology&quot;. In 2017, several conservative Islamic politicians in Malaysia and Indonesia denounced &quot;LGBT ideology&quot;.

During a sermon on 1 August 2019, Polish Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski called &quot;LGBT ideology&quot; a &quot;rainbow plague&quot; and compared it to the &quot;Red Plague&quot; of Communism. Following this, the Czech cardinal Dominik Duka also commented on &quot;LGBT ideology&quot;. However, because Czech society is secular and the Catholic Church has little influence on Czech politics, his comments had little impact. In September 2019, Stanley Bill, a lecturer at Cambridge University who studies Poland, stated &quot;Scaremongering about &#x27;LGBT ideology&#x27; has almost become official policy in Poland with often nasty insinuations from members of the government and public media now the norm&quot;.

In June 2020, Polish President Andrzej Duda drew international attention when he called LGBTQ an &quot;ideology&quot; and a form of &quot;Neo-Bolshevism&quot;. Agreement Party MP Jacek Żalek stated in an interview that the LGBT community &quot;are not people&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s an ideology&quot;, which led to the journalist asking him to leave the studio; the row caused controversy. The next day, Duda said at a rally in Silesia: &quot;They are trying to convince us that [LGBT] is people, but it is just an ideology.&quot; He promised to &quot;ban the propagation of LGBT ideology in public institutions&quot;, including schools, similar to the Russian gay propaganda law. On the same day, PiS MP Przemysław Czarnek said on a TVP Info talk show, regarding a photo of a naked person in a gay bar, &quot;Let&#x27;s defend ourselves against LGBT ideology and stop listening to those idiocies about human rights or equality. These people are not equal to normal people.&quot;

In July 2020, the European Union announced that it will not provide funding to six Polish towns that have declared themselves &quot;LGBT-free zones&quot;, after nearly 100 local governments, a third of Poland&#x27;s territory, declared themselves &quot;free from LGBT ideology.&quot; On 1 August 2020, the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, ultranationalist Robert Winnicki compared LGBT to communist and Nazi ideology. He stated, &quot;Every plague passes at some point. The German plague passed, which was consuming Poland for six years, the red plague passed, the rainbow plague is also going to pass.&quot; 

In August 2020, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro announced a new program for &quot;counteracting crimes related to the violation of freedom of conscience committed under the influence of LGBT ideology&quot;. From a government fund intended to help victims of crime, PLN 613,698 was awarded to a foundation to combat the alleged crimes of &quot;LGBT ideology&quot;. The project, among other things, explores a supposed connection between LGBT ideology and the Frankfurt School. At the 16 August &quot;Stop LGBT aggression&quot; rally that year, Krzysztof Bosak said that even irreligious people are among opponents of &quot;LGBT ideology&quot; because it is &quot;contrary to common sense and rational thinking&quot;. He also said that the LGBT community is &quot;a lower form of social life&quot;.

=== Criticism ===
According to &quot;Krakow Post&quot;, a Polish newspaper, &quot;LGBT is not an ideology ... The phrase &#x27;LGBT ideology&#x27; makes about as much sense as &#x27;redhead ideology&#x27; or &#x27;left-handed ideology. While the support of many LGBT people and their allies improved LGBT rights, they have differing political views. According to Notes from Poland, &quot;attacks on &#x27;LGBT ideology&#x27; – which often rely on exaggerated, distorted or invented claims – result in the marginalisation and demonisation of such people.&quot; Center-right presidential candidate Szymon Hołownia, who is a practicing Catholic, stated, &quot;there is no such thing as LGBT ideology, there are [LGBT] people&quot;. He said that anti-LGBT rhetoric from politicians could lead vulnerable people to suicide. In protest at the comments made by the president and Żalek, LGBT people have held pickets in various towns and cities in Poland, opposing the idea that LGBT is an ideology. Activists also created a film, &quot;Ludzie, nie ideologia&quot; (People, not ideology) showcasing the families of LGBT people.

An article in OKO.press compared the anti-LGBT campaign to the 1968 &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; campaign: the anti-Zionist campaign ostensibly targeted Zionism as an ideology, but actually targeted Jews as people. Many Jews were forced out of the country in 1968, and many LGBT people have been pressured to emigrate from Poland in 2020. According to Polish historian Adam Leszczyński, &quot;LGBT ideology&quot; is

== Dehumanization ==
Dehumanization is a frequent feature of anti-LGBT rhetoric, which may take the form of comparing LGBT people to animals or equating homosexual relationships with bestiality.

In 2025, the social media conglomerate Meta updated its hate speech policies to allow &quot;allegations of mental illness or abnormality&quot; based on sexual orientation or gender identity, which the LGBTQ magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; said would allow &quot;hateful and dehumanizing rhetoric&quot; on Meta&#x27;s platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

== Slurs ==
According to one study, &quot;homophobic epithets foster dehumanization and avoidance of gay people, in ways that other insults or labels do not.&quot; Another study found that homophobia &quot;results in substantial health and welfare effects&quot;.

== Calls for violence ==
Anti-LGBT rhetoric also includes calls for violence against LGBT people and suggestions that they should be killed or die, such as in Cyprus, Iran, Russia, the United States, Malawi, and Uganda.

In Serbia, members of Obraz chanted &quot;Death to faggots&quot; () and posted posters stating &quot;we are waiting for you&quot; () next to an image of a baseball bat. In 2012, the organization was banned by the Constitutional Court of Serbia due to extremism.

== Anti-gay themes ==
Anti-gay activists claim that homosexuality goes against traditional family values, that homosexuality is a Trojan Horse, or that it destroys families and humankind through homosexual which will lead to the extinction of humanity.

=== Homosexuality as a cause of disasters ===
The argument that homosexuals cause natural disasters has been around for more than a thousand years, even before Justinian blamed earthquakes on &quot;unchecked homosexual behavior&quot; in the sixth century. This trope was common in early modern Christian literature; homosexuals were blamed for earthquakes, floods, famines, plagues, invasions of Saracens, and field mice. This discourse was revived by Anita Bryant in 1976 when she blamed homosexuals for droughts in California. In the U.S., right-wing religious groups including the Westboro Baptist Church continue to claim that homosexuals are responsible for disasters. Homosexuals have been blamed for hurricanes, including Isaac, Katrina, and Sandy. In 2020, various religious figures including Israeli rabbi Meir Mazuz have argued that the COVID-19 pandemic is divine retribution for same-sex activity or pride parades.

Following the September 2001 attacks, televangelist Jerry Falwell blamed &quot;the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way&quot; for provoking the aggression of Islamic fundamentalists and causing God to withdraw his protection for America. On the broadcast of the Christian television program &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, Falwell said, &quot;You helped this happen&quot;. He later apologized and said, &quot;I would never blame any human being except the terrorists&quot;.

In 2012, Chilean politician Ignacio Urrutia claimed that allowing homosexuals to serve in the Chilean military would cause Perú and Bolivia to invade and destroy his country.

=== AIDS as punishment ===
An outgrowth of the discourse on homosexuality argues that HIV/AIDS is divine punishment for homosexuality. During the early years of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, mainstream newspapers labeled it a &quot;gay plague&quot;. For a few years, the misleading technical name for the disease was gay-related immune deficiency.

The slogan &quot;AIDS Kills Fags Dead&quot; (a pun on the commercial slogan for Raid insecticide &quot;Raid Kills Bugs Dead&quot;) appeared during the early years of AIDS in the United States, when the disease was mainly diagnosed among male homosexuals and was almost invariably fatal. The slogan caught on quickly as a catchy truism, a chant, or simply something written as graffiti. It is reported that the slogan first appeared in public in the early 1990s, when Sebastian Bach, the former lead singer of the heavy metal band Skid Row, wore it on a t-shirt thrown to him by an audience member. The slogan &quot;AIDS cures fags&quot; is used by the Westboro Baptist Church.

=== Homosexuality as unnatural ===
Describing homosexuality as unnatural dates back to Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas. However, there is no single definition of &quot;unnatural&quot;. Some of those who argue that homosexuality is unnatural in the sense of being absent from nature, an argument refuted by the presence of homosexuality in animals. Others mean that the genitals were created for reproduction (either by God or natural selection) and are not intended to be used for purposes they deem &quot;unnatural&quot;. Proponents of this idea often argue that homosexuality is immoral because it is unnatural, but opponents argue that this argument makes an is–ought conflation. Some proponents of the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; thesis argue that homosexual behavior is the result of &quot;&quot; or willful sinfulness.

=== Homosexuality as a disease ===
Nazi propaganda described homosexuality as a contagious disease but not in the medical sense. Rather, homosexuality was a disease of the (national body), a metaphor for the desired national or racial community (). According to Nazi ideology, individuals&#x27; lives were to be subordinated to the like cells in the human body. Homosexuality was seen as a virus or cancer in the because it was seen as a threat to the German nation. The SS newspaper &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; argued that 40,000 homosexuals were capable of &quot;poisoning&quot; two million men if left to roam free.

Some of those who called homosexuality , such as Traditional Values Coalition head and Christian right activist Louis Sheldon, said that if it were proven to be a biologically based phenomenon, it would still be diseased. The psychiatric establishment in the west once medicalized same-sex desire. In the United States, homosexuality was removed in 1973 as a mental disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as it did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder. The Catholic Church still officially teaches that &quot;homosexual tendencies&quot; are &quot;objectively disordered&quot;. In 2016, anti-LGBT rhetoric was increasing in Indonesia under the Twitter hashtag #TolakLGBT (#RejectLGBT), stating that LGBT is a disease. In 2019, Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski said that a &quot;rainbow plague&quot; was threatening Poland. In 2020, the education minister defended an official who warned that &quot;LGBT virus&quot; was threatening Polish schools, and was more dangerous than COVID-19.

=== Homosexuality as a choice or lifestyle ===
Along with the idea of &quot;homosexual recruitment&quot;, the idea of a &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; or &quot;homosexual lifestyle&quot; is used by social and religious conservatives in the United States to argue that non-heterosexual sexual orientations are consciously chosen. 
However, scientists favor biological explanations for sexual orientation, arguing that people typically feel no sense of control over their sexual orientation or attractions.
The term &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; may also be used disparagingly for a series of stereotyped behaviours.

Christian right activists may worry that increasing LGBT rights will make the &quot;gay lifestyle&quot; more attractive to young people.
US media in the 1970s frequently used the term &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; as a euphemism for homosexuality, and the term was employed in an anti-gay context by opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as supporters of California&#x27;s Proposition 6, which would have barred openly gay teachers in public schools.
In 1977, while campaigning against a local ordinance protecting gay teachers against employment discrimination, anti-gay activist Anita Bryant stated, &quot;A homosexual is not born, they are made&quot;.
US president Ronald Reagan described the gay rights movement in opposition to American culture, saying the movement was &quot;asking for a recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone&quot;.

=== Homosexuality as sinful or ungodly ===

Many conservative Christians consider homosexual acts to be inherently sinful based on common interpretations of scriptural passages such as Leviticus 18:22 (&quot;You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination&quot;), Leviticus 20:13 (&quot;If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them&quot;), and 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 (&quot;Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers—none of these will inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;) The story of Sodom and Gomorrah, two biblical cities which were burned down due to the sins of its inhabitants, is mostly portrayed as divine retribution for homosexual behavior.

Various inflammatory and controversial slogans have been used by opponent congregations and individuals, particularly by Fred Phelps, founder of the Westboro Baptist Church. These slogans have included &quot;God Hates Fags&quot;, &quot;Fear God Not Fags&quot;, and &quot;Matthew Shepard Burns In Hell&quot;.

Homosexuality is also frequently considered sinful in Islam. In some Middle Eastern countries, acts of homosexuality are punishable by death. Anti-LGBT rhetoric and political homophobia are growing in some Muslim countries.

Other religious leaders including Christians, Muslims, and Jews have denounced anti-LGBT rhetoric.

The slogan &quot;God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve&quot; alludes to a Bible-based argument that homosexuality is sinful and unnatural.
A 1970 editorial in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; quoted a graffito in San Francisco that read, &quot;If God had wanted homosexuals, he would have created Adam and Freddy.&quot; In 1977, anti-gay activist Anita Bryant made a similar comment using the phrase &quot;Adam and Bruce&quot;. The version with &quot;Adam and Steve&quot; first appeared on a protest sign at a 1977 anti-gay rally in Houston, Texas, featuring Christian right figures such as Phyllis Schlafly and National Right to Life Committee founder Mildred Jefferson. The slogan was also used in &quot;The Gay Bar,&quot; a 1977 episode of the sitcom &quot;Maude&quot;. In 1979, Jerry Falwell used the &quot;Adam and Steve&quot; slogan in a press conference cited in &quot;Christianity Today&quot;. During the initial outbreak of HIV/AIDS in the United States in 1985, conservative congressman William E. Dannemeyer used the slogan to argue that gay men were a threat to public health.

The phrase later acquired a certain notoriety, and, when used to name a pair of characters in a work of fiction, helps to identify them as members of a homosexual pair (as in Paul Rudnick&#x27;s play &quot;The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told&quot; and the 2005 film &quot;Adam &amp; Steve&quot;). The phrase was used by Democratic Unionist MP David Simpson during a debate on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 in the British House of Commons, although his slip of the tongue saying &quot;in the Garden of Eden, it was Adam and Steve&quot; initially caused laughter in the chamber. Zimbabwean presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa said in a 2019 interview that &quot;[w]e must be able to respect what God ordained and how we are created as a people, there are a male and a female, there are Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve&quot;. The phrase has been reclaimed by LGBT people and used in blogs, comics, and other media mocking the anti-gay message.

=== Homosexuality as a Western ill ===

Homosexuality is sometimes claimed to be non-existent in some non-Western countries, or to be an evil influence imported from the West.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia employed anti-gay rhetoric as part of his &quot;Asian values&quot; program, describing homosexuality as one of several Western ills.
Mohamad used it for political advantage in the 1998 scandal involving the sacking and jailing of MP and former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim by Mohamad amidst accusations of sodomy that the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; termed a &quot;blatantly political fix-up&quot;. Anwar was subsequently subjected to two trials and sentenced to nine years imprisonment for corruption and sodomy.

While in New York for a meeting of the United Nations, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was invited to speak at Columbia University in New York to give a lecture. When responding to a student question afterward, he said, speaking through an interpreter: &quot;In Iran, we don&#x27;t have homosexuals like in your country.&quot; In his native Farsi, he used the slang equivalent of &quot;faggot&quot;, not the neutral term for a &quot;homosexual&quot;.

Claims that homosexuality is a Western disease have been observed in Vietnam, China, India, Ethiopia and other African nations, as well as among many Muslims worldwide.

=== Conflation with pedophilia ===

The claim that homosexuals sexually abuse children predates the current era, as it was leveled against pederasts even during antiquity. Lawmakers and social commentators have sometimes expressed a concern that normalizing homosexuality would also lead to normalizing pedophilia, if it were determined that pedophilia too were a sexual orientation. A related claim is that LGBT adoption is done for the purpose of grooming children for sexual exploitation. The empirical research shows that sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children.

Others have made hoaxes intending to falsely associate pedophilia with the LGBT community by rebranding it as a sexual orientation, including claims that the &quot;+&quot; in &quot;LGBT+&quot; refers to &quot;pedophiles, zoophiles, [and] necrophiles&quot;, as well as the invented terms &quot;agefluid&quot;, &quot;clovergender&quot; (a hoax executed by users of the imageboard 4chan, whose logo is a stylized four-leaf clover), and &quot;pedosexual&quot;.

Starting in 2022, some conservatives, including Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok, started using the terms &quot;grooming&quot;, &quot;groomer&quot; and &quot;pro-pedophile&quot; against their opponents and LGBT people over anti-LGBT legislation, such as laws restricting and banning discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. Critics say that these usages of the terms diminish the experiences of sexual assault survivors, smear the LGBT community, and are dangerous in general.

=== &quot;Gay agenda&quot; ===
=== Recruitment ===

The charge of &quot;homosexual recruitment&quot; is an allegation by social conservatives that LGBT people engage in concerted efforts to indoctrinate children into homosexuality. In the United States, this dates back to the early post-war era. Proponents were found especially among the New Right, as epitomized by Anita Bryant. In her Save Our Children campaign, she promoted a view of homosexuals recruiting youth. A common slogan is &quot;Homosexuals cannot reproduce — so they must recruit&quot; or its variants. Supporters of recruitment allegations point at &quot;deviant&quot; and &quot;prurient&quot; sex education as evidence. They express concern that anti-bullying efforts teach that &quot;homosexuality is normal, and that students shouldn&#x27;t harass their classmates because they&#x27;re gay&quot;, suggesting recruitment as the primary motivation. Supporters of this myth cite the inability for same-sex couples to reproduce as a motivation for recruitment.

Sociologists and psychologists describe such claims as an anti-gay myth, and a fear-inducing bogeyman. Many critics believe the term promotes the myth of homosexuals as pedophiles:

* In 1977, Anita Bryant successfully campaigned to repeal an ordinance in Miami-Dade County that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Her campaign was based upon allegations of homosexual recruitment. Writing about Bryant&#x27;s efforts to repeal a Florida anti-discrimination law in the &quot;Journal of Social History&quot;, Michel Boucai wrote that &quot;Bryant&#x27;s organization, Save Our Children, framed the law as an endorsement of immorality and a license for &#x27;recruitment&#x27;.&quot;
* Oregon&#x27;s proposed 1992 Ballot Measure 9 contained language that would have added anti-LGBT rhetoric to the state Constitution. U.S. writer Judith Reisman justified her support for the measure, citing &quot;a clear avenue for the recruitment of children&quot; by gays and lesbians.
* In a 1998 debate in the British House of Lords on lowering the same-sex age of consent to 16 (equalising it with the opposite-sex age of consent), former Labour cabinet minister Lord Longford opposed the change by stating that &quot;If some elderly, or not so elderly, schoolmaster seduced one of my sons and taught him to be a homosexual, he would ruin him for life.&quot; The age of consent was equalised in the UK in 2001.
* A small newspaper in Uganda&#x27;s capital attracted international attention in 2010 when it outed 100 gay people alongside a banner that said, &quot;Hang them&quot;, and claimed that homosexuals aimed to &quot;recruit&quot; Ugandan children, and that schools had &quot;been penetrated by gay activists to recruit kids.&quot; According to gay rights activists, many Ugandans were attacked afterward as a result of their real or perceived sexual orientation. Minorities activist David Kato, who was outed in the article and a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit against the paper, was subsequently murdered at home by an intruder and an international outcry resulted.
* In 1998, &quot;The Onion&quot; parodied the idea of &quot;homosexual recruitment&quot; in an article titled &quot;&#x27;98 Homosexual-Recruitment Drive Nearing Goal&quot;, saying &quot;Spokespersons for the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Recruitment Task Force announced Monday that more than 288,000 straights have been converted to homosexuality since January 1, 1998, putting the group well on pace to reach its goal of 350,000 conversions by the end of the year.&quot; According to Mimi Marinucci, most US adults who support gay rights would recognize the story as satire due to unrealistic details. The Westboro Baptist Church passed along the story as fact, citing it as evidence of a gay conspiracy.

=== Homosexual conspiracies ===
==== &quot;Homintern&quot; ====
During the Cold War, anti-queer commentators in the United States sought to link homosexuality and Communism, using the terms &quot;homintern&quot; and &quot;homosexual mafia&quot; as shorthand for a purported homosexual conspiracy in the arts. &quot;Homintern&quot; is a reference to the &quot;Comintern&quot;, the Soviet-sponsored international organization of communist political parties. According to historian Michael S. Sherry, the term was probably used jokingly among artists and writers in England in the 1930s to mock the idea of a powerful cabal of queer artists. Coining of the term has been attributed to various writers including W. H. Auden, Cyril Connolly, Jocelyn Brooke, Harold Norse, and Maurice Bowra.

Sherry coined the phrase &quot;homintern discourse&quot; to refer to mid–20th century American conspiracy theories targeting gay artists, many of whose works were prominently used as propaganda in the Cultural Cold War against the Soviet Union. During the second Red Scare in the 1950s, the &quot;homintern&quot; was invoked by American Senator Joseph McCarthy, who used it to claim that the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman were set on destroying America from within. According to Sherry, the &quot;homintern discourse&quot; began to decline with the growth of 1960s counterculture and skepticism about the United States&#x27; role in the Cold War and Vietnam War.

==== &quot;Gaystapo&quot; ====
The term &quot;Gaystapo&quot; () was coined in France in the 1940s by political satirist Jean Galtier-Boissière for the Vichy education minister, Abel Bonnard. It was subsequently applied by National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen to Florian Philippot, whom he accused of being a bad influence on Marine Le Pen.

==== &quot;Gay mafia&quot; ====
The English critic Kenneth Tynan wrote to A.C. Spectorsky (editor of &quot;Playboy&quot;) in 1967 proposing an article on the &quot;Homosexual Mafia&quot; in the arts. Spectorsky declined, although he stated that &quot;culture hounds were paying homage to faggotismo as they have never done before&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; would subsequently run a panel on gay issues in April 1971.

The similar term, &quot;velvet mafia,&quot; used to describe the influential gay crowd who supposedly ran Hollywood and the fashion industry in the late 1970s, was coined by &quot;New York Sunday News&quot; writer Steven Gaines in reference to the Robert Stigwood Organization, a British record company and management group.

&quot;Gay mafia&quot; became more widely used in the US media in the 1980s and 1990s, such as the American daily &quot;New York Post&quot;. The term was also used by the British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1998 in response to what it claimed was sinister dominance by gay men in the Labour Party Cabinet.

==== &quot;Lavender mafia&quot; ====
While the term &quot;Lavender Mafia&quot; has occasionally been used to refer to informal networks of gay executives in the US entertainment industry, more generally it refers to Church politics. For example, a faction within the leadership and clergy of the Roman Catholic Church that allegedly advocates the acceptance of homosexuality within the Church and its teachings.

==== &quot;Gay lobby&quot; ====
The term &quot;homo lobby&quot; or &quot;gay lobby&quot; is often used by opponents of LGBT rights in Europe. 
For example, the Swedish neo-Nazi party Nordic Resistance Movement runs a &quot;crush the homo lobby&quot; campaign. 
According to the German newspaper &quot;Der Tagesspiegel&quot;, advocating for LGBT rights could accurately be called lobbying, but the term (&#x27;gay lobby&#x27;) is insulting because it is used to suggest a powerful conspiracy which does not actually exist.

In 2013, Pope Francis spoke about a &quot;gay lobby&quot; within the Vatican, and promised to see what could be done. In July 2013, Francis went on to draw a distinction between the problem of lobbying and the sexual orientation of people: &quot;If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?&quot; &quot;The problem&quot;, he said, &quot;is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem.&quot;

== Anti-transgender rhetoric ==
 

=== Misgendering ===
Misgendering is the act of labelling others with a gender that does not match their gender identity. Misgendering can be deliberate or accidental. It can involve using pronouns to describe someone that are not the ones they use, calling a person &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;sir&quot; in contradiction to the person&#x27;s gender identity, and using a pre-transition name for someone instead of a post-transition one (deadnaming).

=== Deception and masquerade ===

Some terms often considered to be anti-trans such as &quot;shemale, trap,&quot; and &quot;ladyboy&quot; are perceived to promote the belief that trans women are men masquerading as women. Transgender individuals are often perceived as more deceptive than sexual minorities.

=== Bathroom bills ===
=== In feminism ===
Some positions within feminist theory have used denialist rhetoric viewed as transphobic. Those that hold these positions are known as trans-exclusionary radical feminists, or &quot;TERF&quot; for short. This term was coined by feminist blogger Viv Smythe in 2008 as a value-neutral descriptor of feminists that engage in denialism.

In 1979, American radical feminist Janice Raymond published &quot;The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male&quot;. In it, she wrote that, &quot;All transsexuals rape women&#x27;s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.&quot; A common position in radical feminism maintain that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be in women-only spaces.

Some second-wave feminists perceive trans men and women respectively as &quot;traitors&quot; and &quot;infiltrators&quot; to womanhood. In a 1997 article, Australian lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys wrote that should be seen as a violation of human rights.&quot; Jeffreys also argued that by transitioning medically and socially, trans women are &quot;constructing a conservative fantasy of what women should be. They are inventing an essence of womanhood which is deeply insulting and restrictive.&quot;

=== Social contagion ===

Some anti-transgender rhetoric centers on the idea of transgender identity being due to indoctrination or social contagion. According to GLAAD, &quot;Another prominent anti-LGBTQ trope includes the use of anti-trans buzzwords like &#x27;gender ideology&#x27; and &#x27;transgenderism&#x27; to claim that the LGBTQ+ community and its allies aim to indoctrinate or brainwash kids into identifying as transgender.&quot; Some conservative publications have argued that peer pressure and social media causes teens, especially those assigned female at birth, to be influenced into becoming transgender; they argue this results in harm to youth by leading them to undergo transition. 

Social contagion rhetoric has seen use in the TERF and transmedicalism community with the term transtrender, a pejorative term that implies some people, especially transgender youth and non-binary people, choose to be transgender due to a trend or social contagion. 

A scientifically unsupported hypothesis called rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) also incorporates the idea of social contagion. The hypothesis is that people who identify as transgender in adolescence rather than before puberty do so as a result of social contagion. It is believed that that people assigned female at birth as well as people with mental health issues, neurodevelopmental disorders, or maladaptive coping mechanisms are particularly susceptible to ROGD. Clinical data from transgender adolescents does not support an association between recent/rapid knowledge of one&#x27;s gender and mental health issues, neurodevelopmental disorders, self-harm, depression symptoms or social support.

The term rapid-onset gender dysphoria was created in 2016 on 4thWaveNow, a blog against gender-affirming care. Through 4thWaveNow, TransgenderTrend, and Youth Trans Critical Professionals, Lisa Littman found parents to participate in her study on ROGD. The study ended up being corrected after publication to make it clear it established a hypothesis, but did not prove it. Despite the correction, ROGD increased in use following the study.

ROGD has been used to argue against gender affirming care for minors and positive LGBT representation in schools. According to a study in Pediatrics, &quot;The deleterious effect of unfounded hypotheses stigmatizing TGD youth, particularly the ROGD hypothesis, cannot be overstated, especially in current and longstanding public policy debates. Indeed, the notion of ROGD has been used by legislators to prohibit TGD youth from accessing gender-affirming medical care&quot;. The Coalition for the Advancement and Application of Psychological Science calls for the elimination of the term due to its potential to limit and stigmatize gender-affirming care.

===Transgender as mental illness===

Conservative groups and governments have classified transgender identities as a mental disorder or caused by mental illness. Peru passed a short-lived insurance law in 2024 categorizing transgender identities as a mental disorder. The American College of Pediatricians, described as an anti-LGBT group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, says that &quot;adolescents can embrace their bodies through counseling alone when it is directed toward underlying psychological issues.&quot; The belief that non-cisgender identity are mental disorders is an underlying assumption of conversion therapy.

==Legality and censorship==
Hate speech against LGBT people, or incitement to hatred against them, is criminalized in some countries, for example, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.

<doc id="187924" wikidata="Q1387970" url="?curid=187924" title="Francis Ledwidge">
<text>Francis Edward Ledwidge (19 August 188731 July 1917) was a 20th-century Irish poet. From Slane, County Meath, and sometimes known as the &quot;poet of the blackbirds&quot;, he was later also known as a First World War war poet. He befriended the established writer Lord Dunsany, who helped with publication of his works. He was killed in action at Ypres in 1917.

Born to a poor family in Slane, County Meath, Ledwidge started writing at an early age, and was first published in a local newspaper at the age of 14. Finding work as a labourer and miner, he was also a trade union activist, and a keen patriot and nationalist, associated with Sinn Féin. He became friendly with a local landowner, the writer Lord Dunsany, who gave him a workspace in the library of Dunsany Castle, and introduced him to literary figures including William Butler Yeats, Æ and Katherine Tynan, with whom he had a long-term correspondence. He was elected to a local government post and helped organise the local branch of the Irish Volunteers, while Dunsany edited a first volume of his poetry and helped him secure publication for it.

Despite having sided with the faction of the Irish Volunteers which opposed participation in the war, and against the wishes of Lord Dunsany, he enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in October 1914, and continued to write poetry on campaign, sending work to Dunsany and to family and other friends. Having been posted to several theatres of the war, he was killed in action in July 1917 during the early phase of the Battle of Passchendaele. At the time of his death, he and Dunsany were in advanced preparation for a second volume of his work, and Dunsany later arranged for a third volume, and a collected edition of 122 poems in 1919. Some musical settings of his work were also composed. Further poems, from the archives at Dunsany Castle and some material held by families of relatives and friends, were published by Ledwidge&#x27;s biographer, Alice Curtayne, in 1974, by enthusiast Hubert Dunn and by the two major Ledwidge memorial groups, in 1997 and 2022 respectively.

A museum of his life and work was opened in his birthplace cottage in 1982 and was the site of multiple events in the decades after; it remains operational as of 2022. Ledwidge was selected as one of twelve prominent war poets - and the only Irish one - for the exhibition &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; at the Imperial War Museum in London in 2002. He has been memorialised at events at the Slane museum, in Ypres and in Inchicore, Dublin, with his official centenary commemoration at Slane in 2017 and his work set to music and performed by Anúna at the former Inchicore barracks the same year. A few Ledwidge manuscripts are held in the National Library of Ireland, and the main surviving collection, including his early works, in the archives of Dunsany Castle, along with letters. Selections of both handwritten and typed manuscripts have been shown publicly at the &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; exhibition and at a book launch at Slane Castle in 2022, and privately to scholars and members of the Ledwidge Cottage Museum committee.

==Early life and work==
Francis Ledwidge, known to his family as &quot;Frank&quot;, was born at Janeville (Baile Sinead) on the eastern edge of Slane, in County Meath, Ireland, the eighth of nine children in a poverty-stricken family. His parents, Patrick Ledwidge and wife Anne Lynch (1853–1926), believed in giving their children the best education they could afford; however, when Francis was only five, his father Patrick died, which forced his wife and the children out to work at an early age. 

Francis left the local national school aged thirteen, and while he continued to educate himself, he worked at what work he could find. Employment included work as a farm hand, road surface mender and supervisor of roadwork, copper miner at Beaupark Mine near Slane (from which post he was sacked for organising a strike for better mining conditions, three years before the general 1913 strike, having been a trade union activist since 1906) and, briefly, a shop assistant in Dublin.

Appointed secretary of the Slane branch of the Meath Labour Union (1913–14) he had aspirations towards permanent white-collar work. He was known for his connections with Sinn Féin.

==Early poetry and nationalism==
Strongly built, with striking brown eyes and a sensuous face, Ledwidge was a keen poet, writing where ever he could – sometimes even on gates or fence posts. From the age of fourteen his works were published in a local newspaper, the &quot;Drogheda Independent&quot;, and reflected his passion for the Boyne Valley. He was also published with some regularity in the &quot;Irish Weekly Independent&quot; and &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; from mid-1909. These early poetry publications were largely unpaid.

While working as a road labourer, he wrote to the Anglo-Irish landlord and fantasy writer and dramatist Lord Dunsany, in 1912, enclosing copybooks containing his early work. Dunsany, a man of letters already well known in Dublin and London literary and dramatic circles, and whose own start in publishing had been with a few poems, felt that his work had potential, and promoted him in Dublin, including at a salon of Æ. Dunsany and Æ introduced Ledwidge to a range of Irish literary figures, including W.B. Yeats and Oliver St. John Gogarty, with whom Ledwidge became further acquainted.

Dunsany supported Ledwidge with money and literary advice for some years, providing him with access to and a workspace in Dunsany Castle&#x27;s library, where he met the Irish writer Katharine Tynan, subsequently corresponding with her regularly. Dunsany later prepared his first collection of poetry &quot;Songs of the Fields&quot;, which successfully appealed to the expectations of the Irish Literary Revival and its social taste for rural poetry. Despite Ledwidge&#x27;s growing association with the aristocratic Lord Dunsany, he retained a keen interest in the conditions of working men. He was one of the founder members in 1906 of the Slane branch of the Meath Labour Union. He familiarised himself with the writings of James Connolly and, despite the Vatican&#x27;s condemnations of Marxism, Ledwidge found no contradiction between Roman Catholicism and socialism. In 1913 he was temporary secretary of the union, the following year elected to the Navan district rural council and board of guardians.

===Home Rule===

Ledwidge was a keen patriot and nationalist. His efforts to found a branch of the Gaelic League in Slane were thwarted by members of the local council. The area organiser encouraged him to continue his struggle, but Francis gave up. He did manage to act as a founding member with his brother Joseph of the Slane Branch of the Irish Volunteers (1914), a paramilitary force created in response to the founding of the Ulster Volunteers, who had sworn to resist Home Rule for Ireland even if it meant civil war. The Irish Volunteers were set up to fight the Unionists if necessary and to ensure that Home Rule would come to pass.

==Military service==
On the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, and on account of Ireland&#x27;s involvement in the war, the Irish Volunteers split into two factions, the National Volunteers who supported John Redmond&#x27;s appeal to join Irish regiments in support of the Allied cause and those who did not. Francis was originally of the latter party. Nevertheless, having defended this position strongly at a local council meeting, he soon after enlisted (24 October 1914) in Lord Dunsany&#x27;s regiment, joining 5th battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, part of the 10th (Irish) Division. This was against Lord Dunsany&#x27;s wishes and he had offered Ledwidge a stipend to support him if he stayed out of the war. Some have speculated that he went to war because his sweetheart Ellie Vaughey had found a new lover, John O&#x27;Neill, whom she later married, but Ledwidge himself wrote, quite forcefully, that he could not stand aside while others sought to defend Ireland&#x27;s freedom.

===Later poetry and war===
Ledwidge seems to have fitted into Army life well, and rapidly achieved promotion to lance corporal. In 1915, he saw action in the Landing at Suvla Bay during the Gallipoli Campaign, where he suffered severe rheumatism. Having survived huge losses sustained by his company, Ledwidge became ill after a back injury gained during the Battle of Kosturino in Serbia (December 1915), a locale which inspired a number of poems.

Ledwidge was dismayed by the news of the Easter Rising, writing a lament for his friend Thomas MacDonagh, one of the Rising&#x27;s leaders who was executed in May 1916. He grew disenchanted with the war effort, and was court-martialled and demoted for overstaying his furlough and being drunk in uniform (May 1916). He gained and lost stripes over a period in Derry (he was a corporal when the introduction to his first book was written), and then, returned to the front, received back his lance corporal&#x27;s stripe one last time in January 1917 when posted to the Western Front, joining 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, part of 29th Division.
Ledwidge continued to write when feasible throughout the war years, though he lost many works, for example, in atrocious weather in Serbia. He sent much of his output to Lord Dunsany, himself moving on war assignments, as well as to readers among family, friends and literary contacts.

==Death and aftermath==

The poems Ledwidge wrote on active service reveal his pride at being a soldier, as he believed, in the service of Ireland. He often wondered whether he would find a soldier&#x27;s death. On 31 July 1917, a group from Ledwidge&#x27;s battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers were road-laying in preparation for an assault during the earliest stages of the Third Battle of Ypres (July to November 1917), near the village of Boezinge, northwest of Ypres.

According to Alice Curtayne, &quot;Ledwidge and his comrades had been toiling since the early morning at road-making. The army&#x27;s first need was men; their second, guns; their third roads. These latter consisted mainly of heavy beech planks bolted together, which could be rapidly laid down. No advance could be supported in that sodden land without a sufficiency of these communications tracks, six or seven feet wide. Supplies were conveyed by pack mules over the wooden paths. Survivors concur in placing the road work done by B Company that day one mile north-east of Hell Fire Corner, so called because it was very exposed to German shelling. There was a violent rainstorm in the afternoon, shrouding the region in a gray monochrome. Sullenly, the enemy&#x27;s long-range guns continued to fling their shells far behind the lines. Road-work could not be suspended, however, as the tracks were in use as fast as they were laid down. Tea was issued to the men and, drenched to the skin, they stopped to swallow it. A shell exploded beside Ledwidge and he was instantly killed.&quot;

A Roman Catholic military chaplain, Father Devas, was the first on the scene. That night, Father Devas wrote in his diary, &quot;Crowds at Holy Communion. Arranged for service but washed out by rain and fatigues. Walk in rain with dogs. Ledwidge killed, blown to bits; at Confession yesterday and Mass and Holy Communion this morning. R.I.P.&quot;

=== Burial ===
Francis Ledwidge was first buried at Carrefour de Rose, and later re-interred in the nearby Artillery Wood Military Cemetery, at Boezinge, (where the Welsh poet Hedd Wyn, who was killed in action on the same day, also lies buried).

=== Folklore ===
According to a local folktale the ghostly apparition of Ledwidge appeared in Navan at the same time he died on the Western front. His ghost greeted a friend before fading away.

==Legacy==
A stone tablet commemorates Ledwidge in the Island of Ireland Peace Park, Messines, Belgium. His work as &quot;peasant poet&quot; and &quot;soldier poet&quot;, once a standard part of the Irish school curriculum, faded from view for several decades of the 20th century. Its intensity, coupled with a revived interest in his period, has restored it to life.

The Flanders Fields memorial in Dublin&#x27;s Peace Park is engraved with poetry from Ledwidge.

===Memorial groups===
A local committee opened the &quot;Ledwidge Cottage Museum&quot; in the poet&#x27;s childhood home at Janeville, Slane, in June 1982, and is now run by the founding committee&#x27;s successor and their dedicated non-profit company, Francis Ledwidge Museum and War Memorial Centre CLG. The cottage museum contains displays on his life and work; it charges a small fee for admission.

The Inchicore Ledwidge Society was founded in 1995.

===Memorial events===
The centenary of his birth was marked with events and a booklet published by a committee in 1987.

On the 81st anniversary of his death in 1998 a simple non-militaristic monument was unveiled by the poet&#x27;s nephew, Joe Ledwidge, and the writer Dermot Bolger, on the exact spot where he was killed - the location having been unearthed by Piet Chielens, the director of the &quot;In Flanders Fields Museum&quot;. The monument consists of a portrait of Ledwidge on glass over yellow Ieper brick, with the text of his poem &quot;Soliloquy&quot; printed in English and in Dutch.

In 2002, Ledwidge was selected as one of twelve representative World War I soldier poets by the Imperial War Museum, the only Irish poet chosen. Personal and written material connected to him was included in their &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; exhibition, which ran into 2003. His family and Dunsany Castle&#x27;s archives lent original materials, and he and images of these were featured on the museum&#x27;s website, and in a chapter in the exhibition book of the same title.

In a 2016 episode of the BBC Radio 3 series &quot;Minds at War&quot; Belfast academic Gerald Dawe contributed a commentary entitled &quot;Francis Ledwidge&#x27;s poem &#x27;O&#x27;Connell Street&#x27;&quot;.

====Centenary of death====
The official national commemoration for Ledwidge was held at the birthplace cottage at the edge of Slane on 24 June 2017, with Ireland represented by Minister for European Affairs, Helen McEntee, joined by four members of Ledwidge&#x27;s family, an Irish Army Brigadier General, a Garda Assistant Commissioner, various politicians, the Belgian ambassador, the UK defence attache, and many locals. There were also events at Ieper (Ypres) in Belgium, where the Irish poet Dermot Bolger gave an oration at his grave, and in the former Richmond Barracks in Inchicore Dublin on July 30, where there was a musical memorial event featuring the musical group &quot;Anúna&quot;, including some of Ledwidge&#x27;s poetry set to music.

==Publications and reception==
===Poetry===

Ledwidge was writing poetry from childhood, and from age 14, he would routinely send poetry to a number of newspapers in Ireland. Selected items were published, notably between 1909 and 1914; later some UK publication was added. The newspaper publications were largely unpaid, though the Irish Weekly Independent would pay a small reward to the first-printed poem each week.

The only work published in book form during Ledwidge&#x27;s lifetime was the original volume &quot;Songs of the Fields&quot; (1915), containing fifty poems, which was very well received. The poems in this volume were reviewed by Lord Dunsany, and selected by Dunsany and Ledwidge working together. Dunsany helped Lediwdge secure a publisher, Herbert Jenkins. The critic Edward Marsh printed three of the poems in the &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; series, and remained a correspondent for the remainder of Ledwidge&#x27;s life.

A second volume, &quot;Songs of Peace&quot;, had its 39 poems selected and was fully drafted when Ledwidge died; patron and friend Lord Dunsany wrote the introduction while both were in Derry in September 1916, and arranged for its publication in September 1917, with an additional foreword. Following the war, Dunsany arranged for more of Ledwidge&#x27;s work to be published, selecting 33 poems for a third and final volume, &quot;Last Songs&quot;. The 122 poems from the three volumes were assembled into a collection, &quot;The Complete Poems of Francis Ledwidge&quot;, released in 1919, which went through at least three editions.

Dunsany commented on the work with words such as:

&quot;[I was] &quot;astonished by the brilliance of that eye and that had looked at the fields of Meath and seen there all the simple birds and flowers, with a vividness which made those pages like a magnifying glass, through which one looked at familiar things for the first time.&quot;&quot;
====Posthumous publication====
In 1974, Alice Curtayne assembled a new collection of Ledwidge&#x27;s poems, &quot;Francis Ledwidge : Complete Poems&quot; adding 44 pieces from various sources, many of the newly-collected items having had newspaper appearances. Curtayne organised the poems into thematic groups. The collection was reprinted. In mid-1997, Liam O&#x27;Meara and the Inchicore Ledwidge Society published a new collection, &quot;Francis Ledwidge : The Poems Complete&quot;, with 66 poems added to the Curtayne selection, many found in the archives at Dunsany Castle; around 20 of the poems had not previously been published.

A Ledwidge enthusiast, retired British judge Hubert Dunn, who had spoken of Ledwidge at commemorative events, and had contact with the Ledwidge and Dunsany families, and interest groups, secured permission to review some materials at Dunsany Castle. Working with the literary curator at Dunsany, Dunn located some unpublished poems, and in 2006, he released a narrative of Ledwidge&#x27;s life and influences, with dozens of poems incorporated, including a small number of previously unpublished works. 
The Ledwidge Cottage Museum and the Gallery Press of Loughcrew, County Meath, led by Peter Fallon, with support from Randal, the 21st Lord Dunsany, and the Dunsany archivist, Joe Doyle, jointly issued a new collection, &quot;Poems&quot;, in 2022. Containing 140 works, one not previously seen, the book was launched at an event at Slane Castle on 7 August 2022. The launch, in the castle’s famous Georgian ballroom, was attended by local activists, politicians, librarians, the 21st Lord Dunsany and the Dunsany literary curator, among many others.

===Prose and drama===

Ledwidge&#x27;s submissions to the Drogheda Independent in 1913 were done with the eventual aim of publishing a book: &quot;Legends and Stories of the Boyne Side&quot;. The book was unfinished, having reached the entry for Slane, but some material was drafted, typeset, and some copies of this partial work printed, but it was then &quot;shelved&quot;, and the early print material was dumped in the 1970s, except for one set, which was recovered, and published as &quot;Legends and Stories of the Boyne Side&quot;. A further edition, expanded to include some short stories, a war record, and the full text of an autobiographical letter to Lewis Chase, was released in 2006: &quot;Legends of the Boyne and Selected Prose&quot;. Researched and edited by Liam O&#x27;Meara, it was launched by Senator David Norris at Liberty Hall in 2006.

Ledwidge also wrote of working on a play, &quot;The Crock of Gold&quot;, but no Ledwidge drama has yet been published or performed. There are also references to other writing, but none has been published.

===Settings and adaptations===
Some of Ledwidge&#x27;s poetry was set to music by the British composer and songwriter Michael Head, most notably in the song cycle published in 1920, &quot;Over the rim of the moon&quot;. This includes the song, &quot;The Ships of Arcady&quot;. There were also further musical settings, and compact discs and audiobooks of readings of his work, sometimes to music, have also been released.

===Studies of Ledwidge and his work===
A substantial biography was written by Alice Curtayne, and published in 1972. In 2020, a short book, &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Heart: Francis Ledwidge at war&quot; , a biographical account of his military service years, was published by his grand-nephew, Frank Ledwidge.

Liam O&#x27;Meara, chairman of the Inchicore Ledwidge Society, published &quot;To One Dead&quot;, a play based on the life &amp; writings of Francis Ledwidge (), and &quot;Francis Ledwidge Poet Activist &amp; Soldier&quot; (Riposte Books/Inchicore Ledwidge Society, ).

In 2012, Miriam O&#x27;Gara-Kilmurry was awarded a Masters in Literature from the Open University with a thesis on Ledwidge titled, &quot;A defence of Francis Ledwidge as a War Poet through an exploration of War Imagery, Nationalism and Canonical Revisions.&quot; She asserted that until 2011, Ledwidge had no &#x27;WWI War Poet&#x27; presence online, and that no searches containing the specific words &#x27;Irish WWI war poets&#x27; turned up any results, and that Ledwidge&#x27;s poems written from the front-lines received little if no attention as examples of unique nationalist &#x27;hybrid&#x27; war poems. On the eve of All-Ireland Poetry Day&#x27;, 2 October 2013, O&#x27;Gara-Kilmurry was invited by the National Library of Ireland to deliver a lecture on &quot;Francis Ledwidge: WWI Irish Nationalist War Poet.&quot; In 2016, the thesis was published as a book, &quot;Eire&#x27;s WWI War Poet: F. E. Ledwidge&quot;. According to O&#x27;Gara-Kilmurry:

==Politics==
His politics are described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as nationalist as well as left-wing. However far from simply being an Irish Nationalist, his poems &quot;O’Connell Street&quot; and &quot;Lament for the Poets of 1916&quot; clearly describe his sense of loss and an expression of holding the same &quot;dreams&quot; as the Easter Rising&#x27;s Irish Republicans who fought and died for the Irish Republic in and around O&#x27;Connell Street in 1916.

==Quotes==
Oh what a pleasant world &#x27;twould be,How easy we&#x27;d step thro&#x27; it,If all the fools who meant no harm,Could manage not to do it!

– From a personal letter.

 He shall not hear the bittern cryin the wild sky, where he is lain,Nor voices of the sweeter birdsAbove the wailing of the rain   Nor shall he know when the loud March blowsThro&#x27; slanting snows her fanfare shrill,Blowing to flame the golden cupOf many an upset daffodil.   But when the dark cow leaves the moorAnd pastures poor with greedy weedsPerhaps he&#x27;ll hear her low at morn
Lifting her horn in pleasant meads. 

– &quot;Lament for Thomas MacDonagh&quot;

==Media and popular culture==

Ledwidge was the subject of an RTÉ documentary entitled &quot;Behind the Closed Eye&quot;, first broadcast on 18 January 1973. It won awards for Best Story and Best Implementation Documentary at the Golden Prague International Television Festival.

<text>In mathematics and physics, the centroid, also known as geometric center or center of figure, of a plane figure or solid figure is the arithmetic mean position of all the points in the figure. The same definition extends to any object in formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space.

In geometry, one often assumes uniform mass density, in which case the &quot;barycenter&quot; or &quot;center of mass&quot; coincides with the centroid. Informally, it can be understood as the point at which a cutout of the shape (with uniformly distributed mass) could be perfectly balanced on the tip of a pin.

In physics, if variations in gravity are considered, then a &quot;center of gravity&quot; can be defined as the weighted mean of all points weighted by their specific weight.

In geography, the centroid of a radial projection of a region of the Earth&#x27;s surface to sea level is the region&#x27;s geographical center.

== History ==
The term &quot;centroid&quot; was coined in 1814. It is used as a substitute for the older terms &quot;center of gravity&quot; and &quot;center of mass&quot; when the purely geometrical aspects of that point are to be emphasized. The term is peculiar to the English language; French, for instance, uses &quot;&quot; on most occasions, and other languages use terms of similar meaning.

The center of gravity, as the name indicates, is a notion that arose in mechanics, most likely in connection with building activities. It is uncertain when the idea first appeared, as the concept likely occurred to many people individually with minor differences. Nonetheless, the center of gravity of figures was studied extensively in Antiquity; Bossut credits Archimedes (287–212 BCE) with being the first to find the centroid of plane figures, although he never defines it. A treatment of centroids of solids by Archimedes has been lost.

It is unlikely that Archimedes learned the theorem that the medians of a triangle meet in a point—the center of gravity of the triangle—directly from Euclid, as this proposition is not in the &quot;Elements&quot;. The first explicit statement of this proposition is due to Heron of Alexandria (perhaps the first century CE) and occurs in his &quot;Mechanics&quot;. It may be added, in passing, that the proposition did not become common in the textbooks on plane geometry until the nineteenth century.

== Properties ==
The geometric centroid of a convex object always lies in the object. A non-convex object might have a centroid that is outside the figure itself. The centroid of a ring or a bowl, for example, lies in the object&#x27;s central void.

If the centroid is defined, it is a fixed point of all isometries in its symmetry group. In particular, the geometric centroid of an object lies in the intersection of all its hyperplanes of symmetry. The centroid of many figures (regular polygon, regular polyhedron, cylinder, rectangle, rhombus, circle, sphere, ellipse, ellipsoid, superellipse, superellipsoid, etc.) can be determined by this principle alone.

In particular, the centroid of a parallelogram is the meeting point of its two diagonals. This is not true of other quadrilaterals.

For the same reason, the centroid of an object with translational symmetry is undefined (or lies outside the enclosing space), because a translation has no fixed point.

== Examples ==
The centroid of a triangle is the intersection of the three medians of the triangle (each median connecting a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side).

For other properties of a triangle&#x27;s centroid, see below.

== Determination ==
=== Plumb line method ===
The centroid of a uniformly dense planar lamina, such as in figure (a) below, may be determined experimentally by using a plumbline and a pin to find the collocated center of mass of a thin body of uniform density having the same shape. The body is held by the pin, inserted at a point, off the presumed centroid in such a way that it can freely rotate around the pin; the plumb line is then dropped from the pin (figure b). The position of the plumbline is traced on the surface, and the procedure is repeated with the pin inserted at any different point (or a number of points) off the centroid of the object. The unique intersection point of these lines will be the centroid (figure c). Provided that the body is of uniform density, all lines made this way will include the centroid, and all lines will cross at exactly the same place.

This method can be extended (in theory) to concave shapes where the centroid may lie outside the shape, and virtually to solids (again, of uniform density), where the centroid may lie within the body. The (virtual) positions of the plumb lines need to be recorded by means other than by drawing them along the shape.

=== Balancing method ===
For convex two-dimensional shapes, the centroid can be found by balancing the shape on a smaller shape, such as the top of a narrow cylinder. The centroid occurs somewhere within the range of contact between the two shapes (and exactly at the point where the shape would balance on a pin). In principle, progressively narrower cylinders can be used to find the centroid to arbitrary precision. In practice air currents make this infeasible. However, by marking the overlap range from multiple balances, one can achieve a considerable level of accuracy.

=== Of a finite set of points ===
The centroid of a finite set of formula_2 points formula_3 in formula_4 is
formula_5
This point minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances between itself and each point in the set.

=== By geometric decomposition ===
The centroid of a plane figure formula_6 can be computed by dividing it into a finite number of simpler figures formula_7 computing the centroid formula_8 and area formula_9 of each part, and then computing

formula_10

Holes in the figure formula_11 overlaps between the parts, or parts that extend outside the figure can all be handled using negative areas formula_12 Namely, the measures formula_9 should be taken with positive and negative signs in such a way that the sum of the signs of formula_9 for all parts that enclose a given point formula_15 is formula_16 if formula_15 belongs to formula_11 and formula_19 otherwise.

For example, the figure below (a) is easily divided into a square and a triangle, both with positive area; and a circular hole, with negative area (b).

The centroid of each part can be found in any list of centroids of simple shapes (c). Then the centroid of the figure is the weighted average of the three points. The horizontal position of the centroid, from the left edge of the figure is
formula_20
The vertical position of the centroid is found in the same way.

The same formula holds for any three-dimensional objects, except that each formula_9 should be the volume of formula_22 rather than its area. It also holds for any subset of formula_23 for any dimension formula_24 with the areas replaced by the formula_25-dimensional measures of the parts.

=== By integral formula ===
The centroid of a subset formula_6 of formula_4 can also be computed by the vector formula

formula_28

where the integrals are taken over the whole space formula_29 and formula_30 is the characteristic function of the subset formula_6 of formula_32 if formula_33 and formula_34 otherwise. Note that the denominator is simply the measure of the set formula_35 This formula cannot be applied if the set formula_6 has zero measure, or if either integral diverges.

Alternatively, the coordinate-wise formula for the centroid is defined as

formula_37

where formula_38 is the formula_2th coordinate of formula_40 and formula_41 is the measure of the intersection of formula_6 with the hyperplane defined by the equation formula_43 Again, the denominator is simply the measure of formula_35

For a plane figure, in particular, the barycentric coordinates are

formula_45

where formula_46 is the area of the figure formula_11 formula_48 is the length of the intersection of formula_6 with the vertical line at abscissa formula_50 and formula_51 is the length of the intersection of formula_6 with the horizontal line at ordinate formula_53

==== Of a bounded region ====
The centroid formula_54 of a region bounded by the graphs of the continuous functions formula_55 and formula_30 such that formula_57 on the interval formula_58 formula_59 is given by

formula_60

where formula_46 is the area of the region (given by formula_62).

=== With an integraph ===
An integraph (a relative of the planimeter) can be used to find the centroid of an object of irregular shape with smooth (or piecewise smooth) boundary. The mathematical principle involved is a special case of Green&#x27;s theorem.

=== Of an L-shaped object ===
This is a method of determining the centroid of an L-shaped object.

#Divide the shape into two rectangles, as shown in fig 2. Find the centroids of these two rectangles by drawing the diagonals. Draw a line joining the centroids. The centroid of the shape must lie on this line formula_63
#Divide the shape into two other rectangles, as shown in fig 3. Find the centroids of these two rectangles by drawing the diagonals. Draw a line joining the centroids. The centroid of the L-shape must lie on this line formula_64
#As the centroid of the shape must lie along formula_65 and also along formula_66 it must be at the intersection of these two lines, at formula_67 The point formula_68 might lie inside or outside the L-shaped object.

=== Of a triangle ===

The centroid of a triangle is the point of intersection of its medians (the lines joining each vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side). The centroid divides each of the medians in the ratio formula_69 which is to say it is located formula_70 of the distance from each side to the opposite vertex (see figures at right). Its Cartesian coordinates are the means of the coordinates of the three vertices. That is, if the three vertices are formula_71 formula_72 and formula_73 then the centroid (denoted formula_74 here but most commonly denoted formula_75 in triangle geometry) is

formula_76

The centroid is therefore at formula_77 in barycentric coordinates.

In trilinear coordinates the centroid can be expressed in any of these equivalent ways in terms of the side lengths formula_78 and vertex angles 

formula_79

The centroid is also the physical center of mass if the triangle is made from a uniform sheet of material; or if all the mass is concentrated at the three vertices, and evenly divided among them. On the other hand, if the mass is distributed along the triangle&#x27;s perimeter, with uniform linear density, then the center of mass lies at the Spieker center (the incenter of the medial triangle), which does not (in general) coincide with the geometric centroid of the full triangle.

The area of the triangle is formula_80 times the length of any side times the perpendicular distance from the side to the centroid.

A triangle&#x27;s centroid lies on its Euler line between its orthocenter formula_81 and its circumcenter formula_82 exactly twice as close to the latter as to the former:

formula_83

In addition, for the incenter formula_84 and nine-point center formula_85 we have
formula_86

If formula_75 is the centroid of the triangle formula_88 then

formula_89

The isogonal conjugate of a triangle&#x27;s centroid is its symmedian point.

Any of the three medians through the centroid divides the triangle&#x27;s area in half. This is not true for other lines through the centroid; the greatest departure from the equal-area division occurs when a line through the centroid is parallel to a side of the triangle, creating a smaller triangle and a trapezoid; in this case the trapezoid&#x27;s area is formula_90 that of the original triangle.

Let formula_91 be any point in the plane of a triangle with vertices formula_92 and centroid formula_93 Then the sum of the squared distances of formula_91 from the three vertices exceeds the sum of the squared distances of the centroid formula_75 from the vertices by three times the squared distance between formula_91 and 

formula_97

The sum of the squares of the triangle&#x27;s sides equals three times the sum of the squared distances of the centroid from the vertices:

formula_98

A triangle&#x27;s centroid is the point that maximizes the product of the directed distances of a point from the triangle&#x27;s sidelines.

Let formula_99 be a triangle, let formula_75 be its centroid, and let formula_101 be the midpoints of segments formula_102 respectively. For any point formula_91 in the plane of formula_88

formula_105

=== Of a polygon ===
The centroid of a non-self-intersecting closed polygon defined by formula_1 vertices formula_107formula_108formula_109 is the point formula_110 where

formula_111

and

formula_112

and where formula_46 is the polygon&#x27;s signed area, as described by the shoelace formula:

formula_114

In these formulae, the vertices are assumed to be numbered in order of their occurrence along the polygon&#x27;s perimeter; furthermore, the vertex formula_115 is assumed to be the same as formula_116 meaning formula_117 on the last case must loop around to formula_118 (If the points are numbered in clockwise order, the area formula_119 computed as above, will be negative; however, the centroid coordinates will be correct even in this case.)

The centroid of a non-triangular polygon is not the same as its &quot;vertex centroid&quot;, considering only its vertex set (as the centroid of a finite set of points; ).

=== Of a cone or pyramid ===
The centroid of a cone or pyramid is located on the line segment that connects the apex to the centroid of the base. For a solid cone or pyramid, the centroid is formula_120 the distance from the base to the apex. For a cone or pyramid that is just a shell (hollow) with no base, the centroid is formula_70 the distance from the base plane to the apex.

===Of a tetrahedron and -dimensional simplex===
A tetrahedron is an object in three-dimensional space having four triangles as its faces. A line segment joining a vertex of a tetrahedron with the centroid of the opposite face is called a &quot;median&quot;, and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a &quot;bimedian&quot;. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians. These seven line segments all meet at the &quot;centroid&quot; of the tetrahedron. The medians are divided by the centroid in the ratio formula_122 The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter (center of the circumscribed sphere). These three points define the &quot;Euler line&quot; of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the Euler line of a triangle.

These results generalize to any formula_1-dimensional simplex in the following way. If the set of vertices of a simplex is formula_124 then considering the vertices as vectors, the centroid is

formula_125

The geometric centroid coincides with the center of mass if the mass is uniformly distributed over the whole simplex, or concentrated at the vertices as formula_126 equal masses.

=== Of a hemisphere ===
The centroid of a solid hemisphere (i.e. half of a solid ball) divides the line segment connecting the sphere&#x27;s center to the hemisphere&#x27;s pole in the ratio formula_127 (i.e. it lies formula_128 of the way from the center to the pole).
The centroid of a hollow hemisphere (i.e. half of a hollow sphere) divides the line segment connecting the sphere&#x27;s center to the hemisphere&#x27;s pole in half.

<text>Xootr (pronounced &quot;zoo-ter&quot;) is an American manufacturer of folding kick scooters and was formerly a seller of folding bicycles. Xootr scooters are characterized by 180mm wheels with aluminum hubs, and a hand brake for the front wheel (for the rear on old models). One defining feature of Xootr scooters is the relatively large wheels they are equipped with, as well as the hinge system, which uses a pin. 

Xootr scooters were originally introduced in 1999 by &quot;Nova Cruz Products&quot;. Since 2003, the Xootr scooter has been manufactured and sold by Xootr LLC.

==Manufacturer==
Xootr began when Karl Ulrich, Nathan Ulrich, and Tom Miner (along with partners, Lunar Design and Cheskin Research, and several other investors) founded Nova Cruz Products. Nova Cruz designed, manufactured, and sold the Xootr kick scooter. Including the Xootr eX3 electric scooter, and the Voloci electric motorbike.

==Products==
===Kick scooter models===
===Swift folding bicycle (discontinued)===
The Swift Folder is a folding bicycle designed by Peter Reich of Design Mobility Inc. of Brooklyn, New York, in collaboration with Jan VanderTuin of the Center for Appropriate Transport in Eugene, Oregon. The Swift Folder folds more quickly, though less compactly, than many other folding bicycles. From 2004 until about the end of 2016, the bicycle was sold under license by Xootr as the Xootr Swift — fully assembled to a standard specification, in a choice of single or 8-speed models.

===Bicycle rack system===

The Xootr CrossRack Bicycle Rack enables the mounting of a standard bicycle bag to almost any bicycle especially bicycles with small wheels.

===Hand trucks===

Xootr markets a line of folding hand trucks as well.

===Clothing===
Xootr markets its own line of baseball caps and tee-shirts.

=== Wheels ===
Xootr wheels were originally sold in two styles: standard (translucent yellow) and ultra (black), with the ultra wheels having 10% lower rolling resistance.

Teams using Xootr wheels with a custom rubber formulation won the top three places at the All-American Soap Box Derby Ultimate Speed championships in July 2008.

==In popular culture==
The Xootr was featured in the film Little Manhattan, where a Xootr Street serves as the primary means of transportation for the main character, Gabe. In one scene, one of his friends has a Xootr Ultra Cruz while another friend makes do with a Razor.

<text>Jonatha Brooke (born January 23, 1964) is an American folk rock singer-songwriter and guitarist from Massachusetts, United States. Her music merges elements of folk, rock and pop, often with poignant lyrics and complex harmonies. She has been a performer, writer, and artist since the late 1980s, and her songs have been used in television shows and movies.

==Education==
Jonatha Brooke attended Shady Hill School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Commonwealth School in Boston. She graduated from Amherst College in 1985.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Jonatha Brooke and fellow Bostonian Jennifer Kimball began playing music together in the 1980s after having met at Amherst College. They performed regularly during their college years. Their folk songs were marked by &quot;witty wordplay and sumptuous pop harmonies,&quot; according to one music critic. Another critic suggested Brooke (the duo&#x27;s principal songwriter) was the creative dynamo behind the team. Another suggested that many artists of this era were inspired by Joni Mitchell to strive for excellent musicianship, singing, and writing. Brooke was sometimes grouped with emerging 1990s talents such as the Indigo Girls, Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, and Mary Chapin Carpenter.

In 1989, the duo played the coffeehouse folk circuit and radio as The Story and were described as an example of the &quot;folk-rock singer-songwriter aesthetic,&quot; according to one account. That year they created a demo called &quot;Over Oceans&quot;. They were signed to the independent label Green Linnet which, in 1991, issued the duo&#x27;s debut full-length album &quot;Grace in Gravity&quot;. Later Elektra Records signed &quot;The Story&quot; and re-issued their debut. Their second album, &quot;The Angel in the House&quot;, was released in 1993, highlighting their intricate and sometimes dissonant harmonies.

One music critic described their approach as &quot;levity&quot; between heavy songs about &quot;God, church, death, female oppression, self-suppression, mothers and daughters.&quot; Their songs adroitly avoided &quot;heavy-handedness&quot; with a certain &quot;winning buoyancy of tune and/or spirit&quot; with &quot;sophisticated harmonic changes whose intriguing hooks come at you cockeyed and sideways more often than they swoop down from the heavens.&quot; The duo were compared with artists such as Suzanne Vega and Indigo Girls.

===Solo career===
In 1994, Brooke pursued a solo career. One critic described Brooke as having a &quot;lovely soprano voice&quot; and liked the &quot;catchy original melodies and thorny lyrics.&quot; On her first solo effort &quot;Plumb&quot; (1995) &quot;People Magazine&quot; noted that &quot;Brooke glides through poignant, multifaceted songs with her sweet, insinuating voice. The effect, on limpid compositions such as &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; and &quot;Inconsolable,&quot; is both ravishing and heartbreakingly sad.&quot; Her followup &quot;10 Cent Wings&quot; earned her a review in &quot;Billboard Magazine,&quot; which declared that &quot;&quot;10 Cent Wings&quot; is essential, like taking a deep breath after witnessing something magnificent.&quot;

===Going Independent===
The changing dynamics of the music business in the middle 1990s had a &quot;sell-or-perish&quot; pattern featuring a &quot;leaner, meaner record industry,&quot; as one critic described the industry in the 1990s. &quot;I was in the middle of a national tour [for &quot;10 Cent Wings&quot;] when MCA dropped me,&quot; Brooke recalled. &quot;One second you&#x27;re a princess on the throne, and the next week no one will return your phone calls,&quot; she commented to a reporter.

She recalled: &quot;I realized nothing had changed. I didn&#x27;t have a contract with MCA Records, and I didn&#x27;t have tour support, and I wasn&#x27;t going to get to make a video, which they had promised. The shows were still sold out, my audience was still there and they didn&#x27;t care whether or not I was part of the Universal conglomerate. That was a really empowering and reassuring time.&quot;

While in her early 30s without backing from a major label, she became known as an industrious &quot;cutting-edge world of do-it-yourself&quot; marketer by using the Internet creatively to reach out to fans. She recorded &quot;Jonatha Brooke Live&quot; (1999) on her own label, Bad Dog Records. At first she sold via the Internet. She packaged and mailed about 2,500 copies and autographed each one for a personal touch. She moved to Malibu in 2000.

Critics wrote mostly positive reviews. One described her as a &quot;down-to-earth poet&quot; with &quot;an apparently inexhaustible supply of anecdotes&quot; and &quot;flawlessly crafted lush backdrops for songs that mused wistfully about love and destiny,&quot; although &quot;emotions were often obscured by the complex arrangements and gorgeous vocal harmonies.&quot; Another critic described her earlier songs as &quot;introspective, sometimes bleak Joni Mitchell-esque compositions.&quot; Another described her music as &quot;contemporary folk&quot;.

===The 2000s===
Brooke&#x27;s next album, &quot;Steady Pull&quot; (2001) reflected &quot;relief and optimism.&quot; She again released it on her own label, commenting that there were &quot;still plenty of dark corners on this record, but I wanted to push boundaries.&quot; A critic said she opened up more with this album. Her song &quot;New Dress&quot; (with background vocals from Crowded House frontman Neil Finn) was about a newfound romantic bliss. This rock-influenced album was co-produced by Brooke and veteran producer/engineer Bob Clearmountain, best known for his work with artists such as Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, The Corrs, and Hall &amp; Oates. Clearmountain had, at that point, retired from recording and producing artists, focusing solely on mixing music, but came out of that &quot;retirement&quot; specifically to work with Jonatha, who recorded the album at Clearmountain&#x27;s Mix This! studio. Later, her song &quot;Your House&quot; was included in the ABC series entitled &quot;Once and Again&quot;. Brooke was featured as a guest vocalist with artists such as Lisa Loeb, Chris Botti and Patty Larkin, and has co-written tracks for Joe Sample&#x27;s &quot;The Pecan Tree&quot;.

In 2002 she moved from California to New York and married manager Patrick Rains. She performed two songs on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Return to Never Land&quot; (2002) soundtrack, a movie based on the Peter Pan story, contributing her original song &quot;I&#x27;ll Try&quot; and a cover &quot;The Second Star to the Right&quot;.

In 2003, Brooke revamped 1995&#x27;s song &quot;War&quot; as a protest against the Gulf War. In 2004, she released &quot;Back in the Circus&quot; with new material plus song covers from songs by The Alan Parsons Project, The Beach Boys, and James Taylor. The album was also released in the United Kingdom in 2005 and combined tracks with several &quot;Steady Pull&quot; songs. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;stocked with lovingly detailed songs.&quot; In August 2006, she released a combination CD and DVD titled &quot;Live in New York&quot;. In April 2007, Brooke released &quot;Careful What You Wish For&quot; via Rykodisc distribution. &quot;The vibe of the album,&quot; she wrote in notes for reporters, was &quot;all about busting out, being on the edge, playing with great abandon to see what we could come up with.&quot;

Some Brooke songs have been sung or covered by other artists. Her tune &quot;Because I Told You So&quot; from &quot;Ten Cent Wings&quot; was covered by Nick Lachey on his 2006 album &quot;What&#x27;s Left of Me&quot;. Her song &quot;Inconsolable&quot; from &quot;Plumb&quot; was featured in a TV episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; entitled &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;. Buffy creator Joss Whedon enlisted Brooke to create &quot;What You Don&#x27;t Know,&quot; the theme song for the TV series &quot;Dollhouse&quot; starring Eliza Dushku.
In 2008, Brooke appeared on the &quot;Tinker Bell&quot; movie soundtrack with the song &quot;Be True.&quot; The movie&#x27;s soundtrack was released on October 14, 2008, a week before the DVD release and contains songs from and inspired by the film. In February 2008, Brooke recorded &quot;The Works&quot; which was her seventh solo release. This effort was inspired by the music of late folk legend Woody Guthrie. Brooke was invited by Guthrie&#x27;s daughter Nora to sift through the private archives and hunt through Guthrie&#x27;s unreleased material for possible adaptations. Brooke said she was &quot;smitten&quot; with Guthrie&#x27;s work and going through it was like &quot;going to church.&quot; She liked his poetic love songs like &quot;My Sweet and Bitter Bowl&quot; and spiritual deeper tunes like &quot;My Battle&quot; and loved Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;full spectrum of craziness&quot; as she described his writings. Musicisns featured on Brooke&#x27;s &quot;The Works&quot; include keyboard player Joe Sample, bassist Christian McBride, drummer Steve Gadd, and pedal steel guitarist Greg Leisz.

One reviewer lauded Brooke&#x27;s &quot;forceful, girlish voice&quot; and described her tune &quot;My Sweet and Bitter Bowl&quot; as a &quot;driving opener&quot; and &quot;standout&quot; and described the entire suite of songs as &quot;solid.&quot; The critic described the album as a &quot;Brooke record&quot; not a &quot;Guthrie one&quot;. Another critic described the album as &quot;Woody Guthrie&#x27;s lyrics&quot; with &quot;an urbane new voice within Brooke&#x27;s sleek, winking alt-pop ... if the Dust Bowl troubadour had matriculated at Amherst, he&#x27;d sound just like this.&quot; In 2008, she participated in the music album &quot;Songs for Tibet&quot;, an initiative to support Tibetan Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. The album was issued on August 5 via iTunes and on August 19 in stores. In 2009, she shared vocal duties with Davy Knowles on the song &quot;Taste of Danger&quot; on the album &quot;Coming Up For Air&quot; from Davy Knowles &amp; Back Door Slam.
Brooke was a judge on the 10th and 11th annual Independent Music Awards. She was also a judge for the 5th and 9th Independent Music Awards. According to Brooke in an interview, her favorite collaboration with other artists was the song &quot;Forgiven&quot; with Chris Botti (in Chris&#x27; 2002 CD &quot;The Very Best of Chris Botti&quot;).

===The 2010s===
In 2010, Jonatha Brooke performed as the opening act of the French tour of Nolwenn Leroy, singing songs in English and in French, and joined Nolwenn Leroy for some duets.

In February 2014, Brooke opened in her one-woman play &quot;My Mother Has 4 Noses&quot; off-Broadway at the Duke Theater in New York City. The play, written by Brooke, recounts in words and music Brooke&#x27;s relationship with her mother, who suffered from dementia. It earned favorable reviews, including a &quot;NY Times Critics&#x27; pick&quot; designation. She released a CD of the same title simultaneously which one reviewer described as &quot;an intimate, string laden album full of warmth and sadness.&quot;

In October 2016, Jonatha released the album &quot;Midnight. Hallelujah.&quot; Recorded at Sweetwater Studios in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and mixed by Bob Clearmountain, the collection features a broader mix of instruments than her previous two albums. Brooke supported the release of the album with tour dates across the United States.

In February 2019, Jonatha Brooke won Overall Grand Prize in the 15th Annual IAMA (International Acoustic Music Awards), as well as Best Female Artist with her song &quot;Put the Gun Down&quot;.

Brooke released an EP, &quot;Imposter&quot;, in 2019. In an interview for the EP, Brooke revealed that she now lives in Minneapolis.

<doc id="187933" wikidata="Q61666" url="?curid=187933" title="Hugo Eckener">
<text>Hugo Eckener (10 August 1868 – 14 August 1954) was the manager of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin during the inter-war years, and also the commander of the famous &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; for most of its record-setting flights, including the first airship flight around the world, making him the most successful airship commander in history. He was also responsible for the construction of the most successful type of airships of all time. An anti-Nazi who was invited to campaign as a moderate in the German presidential elections, he was blacklisted by that regime and eventually sidelined.

== Background ==

Eckener was born in Flensburg as the first child of Johann Christoph Eckener from Bremen and Anna Lange, daughter of a shoemaker. As a youth he was judged an &quot;indifferent student&quot;, and he spent summers sailing and winters ice skating.

Nevertheless, by 1892 under Professor Wilhelm Wundt, Eckener had earned a doctorate &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in what today might be deemed experimental psychology at Leipzig University.

Eckener then began his military service in the Infantry Regiment 86 in Flensburg.

Eckener&#x27;s early career was as a journalist and editor; by August 1893 he was working for the &quot;&quot;; in October 1897 he married Johanna, daughter of the publisher family Maaß. He later became a correspondent for the Frankfurter Zeitung in 1905 and 1906, whilst writing a book on the social effects of capitalism.

== Pre-war airship activities ==
Asked to cover the first flights of the Zeppelins LZ 1 and LZ 2, Eckener was critical of both airships&#x27; marginal performances, but praised Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin&#x27;s dedication to his cause. Because several scientists and engineers had criticized his airship plans, the Count sought to speak to Eckener. Eckener was so impressed by him that during October 1908 he agreed to be a part-time publicist for the Zeppelin Company. He became extremely interested in airships, and joined the company on a full-time basis.

His aptitude at flying was noticed early on in his career, and he became an airship captain, obtaining his airship license in 1911. However, when Eckener attempted his first flight on 16 May 1911 in the LZ 8, christened &quot;Deutschland II&quot;, he decided to launch it in a strong wind, which pushed the craft into the hangar wall, damaging it seriously. Nonetheless, he became a very successful airshipman.

== World War I ==
Eckener was responsible for training most of Germany&#x27;s airship pilots both during and after World War I. Despite his protestations, he was not allowed on operational missions due to his value as an instructor.

== Head of the Zeppelin Company ==

After the War, Eckener succeeded Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who had died on 8 March 1917. After considerable conflict with Zeppelin&#x27;s business manager, Alfred Colsman, who wanted to replace the production of airships with production of other (and likely more profitable) products, Eckener was able to keep the Zeppelin factory at Friedrichshafen on Bodensee (Lake Constance) in Württemberg, southern Germany, from being retooled. Colsman left the company soon afterwards.

The Treaty of Versailles had forbidden Germans to construct airships of the size needed to operate the profitable trans-Atlantic service that was Eckener&#x27;s goal. However, after much skillful lobbying, he persuaded the U.S. and German governments to allow the company to build LZ 126, later rechristened the USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (ZR-3), for the United States Navy as part of Germany&#x27;s war reparations. Eckener captained the airship on its delivery flight to Lakehurst, New Jersey. The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; became the longest-serving rigid airship ever operated by the United States Navy.

== The golden age of the rigid airship ==

Refused funds by the penniless Weimar government, Eckener and his colleagues began a nationwide fund-raising lecture tour in order to commence construction of &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, which became the most successful rigid airship ever built.

The first flight to America was fraught with drama. Near Bermuda on the outbound flight the airship was nearly lost after becoming caught in a severe storm during which fabric was ripped off the left fin. The ship was saved only by Eckener&#x27;s skilled piloting and the courage of his son, Knut Eckener, and other crew members who climbed out onto the fin to repair the damage. Upon arrival in America, a country which Eckener grew to love, he and the crew were subject to the first of two New York ticker tape parades.

Eckener captained &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; during most of its record-setting flights, including the 1928 first intercontinental passenger airship flight, the 1929 flight around the world (the only such flight by an airship, and the second by an aircraft of any type) and the 1931 Arctic flight.

A master of publicity as well as a master airship captain, Eckener used the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; to establish the Zeppelin as a symbol of German pride and engineering.

After these flights the public treated Eckener as a national hero. During the early 1930s, Eckener was one of the most well-known and respected figures in Weimar Republic Germany. In the 1932 presidential election Eckener was a potential unity candidate against Adolf Hitler, encouraged to campaign by leaders of both the SPD and the Zentrum, but he bowed out when Paul von Hindenburg decided to run for a second term. However, his potential candidacy had already angered the Nazi Party. In supposed anger and fear of Eckener, Hitler&#x27;s de facto deputy, Hermann Esser, once called him the &quot;director of the flying Weisswurst&quot;, a greyish-white Bavarian sausage.

== Sidelined ==
The Nazis came to power in January 1933. A planned arrest of Eckener in 1933 was blocked by Hindenburg. Hitler met Eckener only once, in July 1933, but the two barely spoke. Eckener did not make any secret of his dislike of the Nazis and the disastrous events he foresaw. He criticised the regime frequently, and refused to allow the Nazis to use the large hangars at Frankfurt for a rally. Eventually the Nazis declared Eckener to be &quot;persona non grata&quot; and his name was no longer allowed to appear in print.

During the 1930s, the Nazi government nationalized the Zeppelin operation under the name Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei GmbH (DZR). The Nazis sidelined Eckener in favour of men who were more compliant with their wishes. In their haste to please the Nazi regime, these newly promoted airshipmen did not always obey Eckener&#x27;s safety procedures. For example, the maiden voyage of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; nearly resulted in disaster when Captain Ernst A. Lehmann brought the ship out in strong winds in order to undertake a Nazi propaganda flight. The ship was damaged, and there was an argument between Eckener, Lehmann and the Nazi propaganda ministry.

Hugo Eckener had always made safety his absolute priority during his many years managing airship operations. With Eckener&#x27;s management, the Zeppelin company had a perfect safety record with no passenger ever sustaining a serious injury on any of the more than 1 million air miles that the rigid airships flew, until the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster of 1937. Eckener was in Graz, Austria when he heard news of the Hindenburg disaster on 6 May 1937. In the official inquiry he concluded that a static spark ignited leaking hydrogen in the aft section of the ship. The leak would have been caused by a sharp turn, which he believed overstrained a bracing wire, causing it to snap and rip open an adjacent gas cell.

After the destruction of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, the nearly-completed LZ-130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; was redesigned as a helium-filled ship, although, owing to geo-political considerations, the American helium was not available. Thus the ship never began commercial service. However, under the command of Captain Albert Sammt, who had previously survived the fiery destruction of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, albeit with severe burns, the ship performed an espionage mission off the coast of Great Britain, intended to investigate the radar defences. Eckener, however, had by this time little influence on the Zeppelin Company.

==After World War II==
Eckener survived World War II despite his disagreements with the Nazis. Post-war, he was involved in a plan by the Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation to build large rigid airships, but the project came to nothing.

In 1945, Johannes Weyl and Eckener co-founded the &quot;&quot; regional newspaper and Eckener started writing for German-French co-operation. In November 1945 Eckener was confronted with the charge of collaboration with Nazi Germany. In 1947 the French occupying powers fined him . Many personalities lobbied for Eckener&#x27;s rehabilitation. The judgement was rejected in July 1948 and Eckener was rehabilitated.

Eckener&#x27;s home town of Flensburg had a Danish-oriented majority in its council since 1945, with the goal of unification with Denmark. Eckener remained active in local politics campaigning for a German majority in Flensburg, while at the same time, during a &quot;thundering&quot; one-hour speech in 1951, warning against small-mindedness in border concerns.

Eckener died in Friedrichshafen on 14 August 1954, four days after his 86th birthday.

==Legacy==
Eckener was responsible for many innovative aviation developments, notably the trans-Atlantic passenger services offered by the airships &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; and &quot;Hindenburg&quot;.

Since his death his achievements have been remembered by airship enthusiasts and historians. Additionally, the town of Friedrichshafen, scene of his many triumphant homecomings in &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, has recognised his memory by naming a large new conference centre after him.

The Nazi Esser vented his anger on Dr. Eckener because Eckener has stood up for Hindenburg. Esser also fears Eckener because he was once named as a candidate against Hitler. Who knows what is still to come? Therefore, Esser providently intended to smash Herr Eckener with a dreadful blow. In a Munich meeting he called him the &quot;Director of the Flying White Sausage&quot;.

<text>is the pen-name of , a Japanese &quot;tanka&quot; poet active during the Taishō and Shōwa periods of Japan. He is regarded as one of the most popular and important poets in modern Japanese literature.

==Early life==
Kitahara was born in Yanagawa, Fukuoka prefecture, to a family of &quot;sake&quot; brewers. He attended the English literature department of Waseda University, but he left the university soon after without graduating. As a student he became interested in the poetry of Tōson Shimazaki, especially his &quot;Wakanashu&quot; (Collection of Young Herbs, 1897), which was written in the &quot;Shintaishi&quot;, or New Style, format.

==Literary career==
In 1904, Kitahara moved to Tokyo and began submitting his poetry to various literary magazines. In 1906, he joined the &quot;Shinshisha&quot; (New Poetry Association) at the invitation of Yosano Tekkan, and he published poems in its magazine Myōjō (Bright Star) that brought him instant fame as a rising young poet, and served as an introduction to a wide circle of writers and poets. From these contacts, Kitahara formed his own literary group, the &quot;Pan no kai&quot; (The Society of Pan), which was innovative in including painters, musicians and actors as well as writers.

In 1909, he became one of the founding members of the literary magazine, &quot;Subaru&quot; (The Pleiades), where he published his first collection of verses, &quot;Jashumon&quot; (Heretics), which took the poetic world by storm. Through the use of its rich imagery and innovative structure, it (along with Yosano Akiko&#x27;s &quot;Midaregami&quot;), is credited by critics with having set a new baseline for modern Japanese poetry. Kitahara&#x27;s initial success was followed by &quot;Omoide&quot; (Memories, 1912), in which he evokes memories of the world from a child&#x27;s perspective.

In 1907 he published the essays &quot;5 Pairs of Shoes&quot;, together with Yosano Tekkan, Mokutaro Kinoshita, Hirano Banri and Yoshii Isamu.

In 1912, Kitahara was arrested for adultery and jailed for two weeks. Though the charges were later dropped, the experience was traumatic, as it was mentioned briefly in his first &quot;tanka&quot; anthology, &quot;Kiri no hana&quot; (Paulownia Blossoms, 1913), as having led to a religious influence in his outlook on life. This became evident in his second anthology, &quot;Shinju Sho&quot; (Selection of Pearls, 1914), and his third, &quot;Hakkin no koma&quot; (Platinum Top, 1915), which include one-line poems in the form of Buddhist prayers. He strove for what he called “oriental simplicity”, a concept which he borrowed from his understanding of Zen in &quot;Suibokushu&quot; (Collection of Ink drawings, 1923) and &quot;Suzume no tamago&quot; (Sparrow&#x27;s Eggs, 1921).

==Children&#x27;s poems==
In 1918, he joined the &quot;Akai tori&quot; (Red Bird) literary magazine at the request of founder Suzuki Miekichi, and was assigned to create children&#x27;s songs, take charge of screening the poems submitted to the magazine, and collect nursery rhymes from around the country. The same year, he relocated from Tokyo to Odawara, Kanagawa. In 1919 he published &quot;Tonbo no medama&quot; (Dragonfly&#x27;s Eyes), a collection of lyrics for children he had previously published serially in Akai Tori. In 1921 &quot;Maza gusu&quot; (Mother Goose), a collection of his translations of the English classic, came out, and that year, &quot;Usagi no denpo&quot; (Rabbit Telegrams), a collection of his nursery rhymes, was published. Starting with its April 1922 issue, &quot;Kodomo no kuni&quot; (Children&#x27;s Land), it invited readers to submit children&#x27;s songs, and Kitahara took charge of the screening and comments. In 1929 he published a collection of essays on children&#x27;s songs, &quot;Midori no shokkaku&quot; (The Feel of Green).

==Later life==
Always enjoying travel, Kitahara visited Misaki, Chiba, Nagano, Shiobara in 1923, Shizuoka in 1924, Hokkaidō and Karafuto in 1925.

Kitahara moved back to Tokyo in 1926, living at first in Yanaka, then moving to Setagaya in 1928. Kitahara continued to experiment with his style, and continued to be inspired by classical Japanese literature (such as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;), as seen in his &quot;Kaihyo no kumo&quot; (Sea and Clouds, 1929). This later work was inspired by a trip from Oita to Osaka by airplane, which was sponsored by the Asahi Shimbun as a publicity stunt. In 1930, Kitahara travelled to Manchuria, and rode on the South Manchurian Railroad. On his return to Japan, he visited Nara.

In 1935, Kitahara founded &quot;Tama&quot;, a &quot;tanka&quot; magazine, and became known as the spearhead of the fourth stage of the symbolist movement. Among his protégés were Kimata Osamu and Miya Shuji. He also accepted an invitation by the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun to tour Korea (then under Japanese rule), in exchange for poems on his impressions. Kitahara remained active even after almost going blind due to complications arising from diabetes in 1937. In 1940, he returned for a visit to Yanagawa after many years, and also visited Miyazaki and Nara. That same year he was made a member of the Japan Art Academy. In 1942, his health condition worsened, and he died of complications from his diabetes. His grave is located at the Tama Reien in the outskirts of Tokyo.

==Legacy==
Kitahara published a total of over 200 books within his lifetime. In addition to his writings, he also edited the poetry magazine &quot;Chijo junrei&quot; (Earthly Pilgrimage), which enabled later authors, such as Hagiwara Sakutaro to get their start into the literary world. He also wrote anthems for high schools around the country, including Tōyō Eiwa Jogakuin. Many of his poems remain popular to this day. The &quot;Nihon Densho Doyo Shusei&quot; [Collection of Traditional Japanese Nursery Rhymes], a six-volume publication edited by Kitahara, finally came out in 1976.

An annual festival celebrating the life and works of Kitahara is still held in his hometown of Yanagawa during the month of November. Stages are set up along the canals of the city, and at night, by firelight, fans of Kitahara&#x27;s works read poems and passages from them aloud. There are also canal parades and musical performances.

<doc id="187943" wikidata="Q5133568" url="?curid=187943" title="Climate of Missouri">
<text>Missouri generally has a variety of seasonal humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with cool winters and long, hot summers. In the southern part of the state, particularly in the Bootheel, the climate borders on a more mild-type humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), and in the northern third, the state transitions into a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;). Because of its location in the interior United States, Missouri often experiences extremes in temperatures. Lacking either large mountains or oceans nearby to moderate its temperature, its climate is alternately influenced by air from the cold Arctic and the hot and humid Gulf of Mexico.

<text>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid search traffic (usually referred to as &quot;organic&quot; results) rather than direct traffic, referral traffic, social media traffic, or paid traffic. 

Unpaid search engine traffic may originate from a variety of kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine results, what people search for, the actual search queries or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by a target audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), with the aim of either converting the visitors or building brand awareness.

== History ==
Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, webmasters submitted the address of a page, or URL to the various search engines, which would send a web crawler to &quot;crawl&quot; that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed.

According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan, the phrase &quot;search engine optimization&quot; probably came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.

Early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page&#x27;s content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster&#x27;s choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site&#x27;s actual content. Flawed data in meta tags, such as those that were inaccurate or incomplete, created the potential for pages to be mischaracterized in irrelevant searches. Web content providers also manipulated attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines. By 1997, search engine designers recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank in search engines and that some webmasters were manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as Altavista and Infoseek, adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings.

By heavily relying on factors such as keyword density, which were exclusively within a webmaster&#x27;s control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their results pages showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals. 

Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate.

Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization. Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website. Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the &quot;crawl rate&quot;, and track the web pages index status.

In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products. In response, many brands began to take a different approach to their Internet marketing strategies.

===Relationship with Google===
In 1998, two graduate students at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, developed &quot;Backrub&quot;, a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. The number calculated by the algorithm, PageRank, is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links. PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web and follows links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is more likely to be reached by the random web surfer.

Page and Brin founded Google in 1998. Google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design. Off-page factors (such as PageRank and hyperlink analysis) were considered as well as on-page factors (such as keyword frequency, meta tags, headings, links and site structure) to enable Google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. Although PageRank was more difficult to game, webmasters had already developed link-building tools and schemes to influence the Inktomi search engine, and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming PageRank. Many sites focus on exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these schemes involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming.

By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization and have shared their personal opinions. Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users.

In 2007, Google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer PageRank. On June 15, 2009, Google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of PageRank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links. Matt Cutts, a well-known software engineer at Google, announced that Google Bot would no longer treat any no follow links, in the same way, to prevent SEO service providers from using nofollow for PageRank sculpting. As a result of this change, the usage of nofollow led to evaporation of PageRank. In order to avoid the above, SEO engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated JavaScript and thus permit PageRank sculpting. Additionally, several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes, Flash, and JavaScript.

In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. On June 8, 2010 a new web indexing system called Google Caffeine was announced. Designed to allow users to find news results, forum posts, and other content much sooner after publishing than before, Google Caffeine was a change to the way Google updated its index in order to make things show up quicker on Google than before. According to Carrie Grimes, the software engineer who announced Caffeine for Google, &quot;Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index...&quot; Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs, the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results.

In February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice. However, Google implemented a new system that punishes sites whose content is not unique. The 2012 Google Penguin attempted to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine. Although Google Penguin has been presented as an algorithm aimed at fighting web spam, it really focuses on spammy links by gauging the quality of the sites the links are coming from. The 2013 Google Hummingbird update featured an algorithm change designed to improve Google&#x27;s natural language processing and semantic understanding of web pages. Hummingbird&#x27;s language processing system falls under the newly recognized term of &quot;conversational search&quot;, where the system pays more attention to each word in the query in order to better match the pages to the meaning of the query rather than a few words. With regards to the changes made to search engine optimization, for content publishers and writers, Hummingbird is intended to resolve issues by getting rid of irrelevant content and spam, allowing Google to produce high-quality content and rely on them to be &#x27;trusted&#x27; authors.

In October 2019, Google announced they would start applying BERT models for English language search queries in the US. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was another attempt by Google to improve their natural language processing, but this time in order to better understand the search queries of their users. In terms of search engine optimization, BERT intended to connect users more easily to relevant content and increase the quality of traffic coming to websites that are ranking in the Search Engine Results Page.

== Methods ==

=== Getting indexed ===

The leading search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine-indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. The Yahoo! Directory and DMOZ, two major directories which closed in 2014 and 2017 respectively, both required manual submission and human editorial review. Google offers Google Search Console, for which an XML Sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links in addition to their URL submission console. Yahoo! formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed to crawl for a cost per click; however, this practice was discontinued in 2009.

Search engine crawlers may look at a number of different factors when crawling a site. Not every page is indexed by search engines. The distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled.

Mobile devices are used for the majority of Google searches. In November 2016, Google announced a major change to the way they are crawling websites and started to make their index mobile-first, which means the mobile version of a given website becomes the starting point for what Google includes in their index. In May 2019, Google updated the rendering engine of their crawler to be the latest version of Chromium (74 at the time of the announcement). Google indicated that they would regularly update the Chromium rendering engine to the latest version. In December 2019, Google began updating the User-Agent string of their crawler to reflect the latest Chrome version used by their rendering service. The delay was to allow webmasters time to update their code that responded to particular bot User-Agent strings. Google ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor.

=== Preventing crawling ===

To avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots.txt file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine&#x27;s database by using a meta tag specific to robots (usually &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex&quot;&gt; ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish to crawl. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login-specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam. 

In 2020, Google sunsetted the standard (and open-sourced their code) and now treats it as a hint rather than a directive. To adequately ensure that pages are not indexed, a page-level robot&#x27;s meta tag should be included.

=== Increasing prominence ===
A variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility. Page design makes users trust a site and want to stay once they find it. When people bounce off a site, it counts against the site and affects its credibility. 

Writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrases so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page&#x27;s metadata, including the title tag and meta description, will tend to improve the relevancy of a site&#x27;s search listings, thus increasing traffic. URL canonicalization of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the canonical link element or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page&#x27;s link popularity score. These are known as incoming links, which point to the URL and can count towards the page link&#x27;s popularity score, impacting the credibility of a website. 

=== White hat versus black hat techniques ===

SEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design (&quot;white hat&quot;), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (&quot;black hat&quot;). Search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them spamdexing. Industry commentators have classified these methods and the practitioners who employ them as either white hat SEO or black hat SEO. White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.

An SEO technique is considered a white hat if it conforms to the search engines&#x27; guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online &quot;spider&quot; algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility, although the two are not identical.

Black hat SEO attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible div, or positioned off-screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as cloaking. Another category sometimes used is grey hat SEO. This is in between the black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.

Search engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines&#x27; algorithms or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both BMW Germany and Ricoh Germany for the use of deceptive practices. Both companies subsequently apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google&#x27;s search engine results page.

Companies that employ black hat techniques or other spammy tactics can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on a company, Traffic Power, which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the ban. Google&#x27;s Matt Cutts later confirmed that Google had banned Traffic Power and some of its clients.

== As marketing strategy ==
SEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be more effective, such as paid advertising through pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns, depending on the site operator&#x27;s goals. Search engine marketing (SEM) is the practice of designing, running, and optimizing search engine ad campaigns. Its difference from SEO is most simply depicted as the difference between paid and unpaid priority ranking in search results. SEM focuses on prominence more so than relevance; website developers should regard SEM with the utmost importance with consideration to visibility as most navigate to the primary listings of their search. A successful Internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building high-quality web pages to engage and persuade internet users, setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure results, and improving a site&#x27;s conversion rate. In November 2015, Google released a full 160-page version of its Search Quality Rating Guidelines to the public, which revealed a shift in their focus towards &quot;usefulness&quot; and mobile local search. In recent years the mobile market has exploded, overtaking the use of desktops, as shown in by StatCounter in October 2016, where they analyzed 2.5 million websites and found that 51.3% of the pages were loaded by a mobile device. Google has been one of the companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their Google Search Console, the Mobile-Friendly Test, which allows companies to measure up their website to the search engine results and determine how user-friendly their websites are. The closer the keywords are together their ranking will improve based on key terms.

SEO may generate an adequate return on investment. However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantee and uncertainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors. Search engines can change their algorithms, impacting a website&#x27;s search engine ranking, possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to Google&#x27;s CEO, Eric Schmidt, in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes – almost 1.5 per day. It is considered a wise business practice for website operators to liberate themselves from dependence on search engine traffic. In addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers (addressed above), user web accessibility has become increasingly important for SEO.

== International markets and SEO ==
Optimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the target market.
The search engines&#x27; market shares vary from market to market, as does competition.
In 2003, Danny Sullivan stated that Google represented about 75% of all searches. In markets outside the United States, Google&#x27;s share is often larger, and data showed Google was the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007. As of 2006, Google had an 85–90% market share in Germany. While there were hundreds of SEO firms in the US at that time, there were only about five in Germany. As of March 2024, Google still had a significant market share of 89.85% in Germany. As of June 2008, the market share of Google in the UK was close to 90% according to Hitwise. As of March 2024, Google&#x27;s market share in the UK was 93.61%.

Successful search engine optimization (SEO) for international markets requires more than just translating web pages. It may also involve registering a domain name with a country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) or a relevant top-level domain (TLD) for the target market, choosing web hosting with a local IP address or server, and using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve website speed and performance globally. It is also important to understand the local culture so that the content feels relevant to the audience. This includes conducting keyword research for each market, using hreflang tags to target the right languages, and building local backlinks. However, the core SEO principles—such as creating high-quality content, improving user experience, and building links—remain the same, regardless of language or region. 

Regional search engines have a strong presence in specific markets:

* China: Baidu leads the market, controlling about 70 to 80% market share.
* South Korea: Since the end of 2021, Naver, a domestic web portal, has gained prominence in the country.
* Russia: Yandex is the leading search engine in Russia. As of December 2023, it accounted for at least 63.8% of the market share.

=== The Evolution of International SEO ===
By the early 2000s, businesses recognized that the web and search engines could help them reach global audiences. As a result, the need for multilingual SEO emerged. In the early years of international SEO development, simple translation was seen as sufficient. However, over time, it became clear that localization and transcreation—adapting content to local language, culture, and emotional resonance—were far more effective than basic translation. 

== Legal precedents ==
On October 17, 2002, SearchKing filed suit in the United States District Court, Western District of Oklahoma, against the search engine Google. SearchKing&#x27;s claim was that Google&#x27;s tactics to prevent spamdexing constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations. On May 27, 2003, the court granted Google&#x27;s motion to dismiss the complaint because SearchKing &quot;failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.&quot;

In March 2006, KinderStart filed a lawsuit against Google over search engine rankings. KinderStart&#x27;s website was removed from Google&#x27;s index prior to the lawsuit, and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70%. On March 16, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (San Jose Division) dismissed KinderStart&#x27;s complaint without leave to amend and partially granted Google&#x27;s motion for Rule 11 sanctions against KinderStart&#x27;s attorney, requiring him to pay part of Google&#x27;s legal expenses.

<text>Lira is the name of several currency units. It is the current currency of Turkey and also the local name of the currencies of Lebanon and of Syria. It is also the name of several former currencies, including those of Italy, Malta and Israel. The term originates from the value of a Roman pound (, about 329g, 10.58 troy ounces) of high purity silver. The was the basis of the monetary system of the Roman Empire. When Europe resumed a monetary system, during the Carolingian Empire, the Roman system was adopted. The Roman denominations were used (becoming known in England as £sd).

Specifically, this system was kept during the Middle Ages and Modern Age in England, France, and Italy. In each of these countries the was translated into local language: pound in England, in France, in Italy. The Venetian lira was one of the currencies in use in Italy and due to the economic power of the Venetian Republic a popular currency in the Eastern Mediterranean trade.

During the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire and the Eyalet of Egypt adopted the as their national currency, equivalent to 100 piasters or kuruş. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed between 1918 and 1922, many of the successor states retained the lira as their national currency. In some countries, such as Cyprus, which have belonged to both the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire, the words &quot;lira&quot; and &quot;pound&quot; are used interchangeably.

== Lira sign ==

For the Turkish lira, the Turkish lira sign () is used. The Lebanese lira uses (before numerals) or (after numerals) in Latin and in Arabic. The Syrian lira uses (before numerals) or (after numerals) in Latin and in Arabic.

The Italian lira had no official sign, but the abbreviations and and the symbols (two bars), (one bar) were all commonly used.

The Maltese lira used before 1986 and thereafter (both as prefixes), though £M continued to be used in unofficial capacities.

The Unicode system allocated to the Italian lira, to provide compatibility with a legacy HP character set. As with , where the one-bar and the two-bar versions are treated as allographs and the choice between them is merely stylistic, no evidence has been found that either style predominated in Italy or anywhere else.

==Current uses==

===Turkey===
The Turkish lira was introduced in 1844 during the Ottoman reign. The Turkish lira is now the currency of Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and used in Turkish-occupied northern Syria.

===Lebanon and Syria===
The Lebanese pound and Syrian pound are both called &quot;lira&quot; () in Arabic, the national language of both Lebanon and Syria.

==Historic use==
===Italy===

The lira was the currency of Italy from its unification until it was merged into the euro in 1999.

<text>was a Japanese novelist and author of children&#x27;s stories from Hiroshima.

==Biography==

Suzuki was born in Hiroshima. He studied English literature at Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo), and later launched a children&#x27;s literature magazine called 赤い鳥 (&quot;Akai tori&quot; / Red Bird) in 1918. Unusually for its time, the journal emphasized learning from observation and experience rather than rote learning, and focused on everyday language as much as ceremonial language. 196 issues were published.

<text>The Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway (SMJR) was a railway company in the southern Midlands of England, formed at the beginning of 1909 by the merger of three earlier companies: 
*the &quot;East and West Junction Railway&quot;, 
*the &quot;Evesham, Redditch, and Stratford-upon-Avon Junction Railway&quot;, and 
*the &quot;Stratford-upon-Avon, Towcester, and Midland Junction Railway&quot;. 
In 1910 the &quot;Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway&quot; was purchased and an east–west network was formed which linked routes to Bedford and Northampton in the east to lines leading towards Banbury and Gloucester in the west, by way of Towcester and Stratford-on-Avon.

The constituent lines had each been built with a view to carrying Northamptonshire iron ore to South Wales and the West Midlands, but they were all unable to finance their planned lines in full. The formation of the in 1909 was in effect a financial reconstruction, but the management of the combined company also showed a certain flair for generating tourist income, based on the connection with Shakespeare and also the family connections with George Washington. Additionally, the line developed as a shorter route for Midland Railway goods traffic from the Bristol area to London.

Some upgrading of the poor-quality infrastructure was undertaken, and some heavy mineral flows – continuing until as late as 1960 – passed along the line, but the severe operational constraints led to the diversion of traffic to other routes in 1964. By that time all of the passenger traffic had dwindled to nothing and the line was closed down piece by piece. A short section of the original network remains in use serving a Ministry of Defence depot at Kineton.

==Origins==
The &quot;Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway&quot; (SMJR) was formed by the combination of four railway companies. Those companies themselves had been formed with the intention of facilitating the transport of Northamptonshire iron ore to South Wales. The ironstone available to the South Wales iron-making industries had become scarce and was of poor quality, and there was huge demand. The Northamptonshire ore was not of the highest quality but it was abundantly available and conveying it to South Wales was worthwhile.

==The Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway==

The &quot;Northampton and Banbury Railway&quot; was authorised by the (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. clxxviii) on 9 July 1847, with the intention of connecting the ironstone fields of Northamptonshire with a market for iron ore in South Wales. In the first instance it was to do this by connecting from Gayton Wharf, near Northampton, to the Buckinghamshire Railway, at Cockley Brake, near Banbury, running via Towcester.
In fact the ambitious scheme failed to raise the capital it needed to carry out its plans, and it had to obtain powers for an extension of time when the original authorisation lapsed; the second act, the (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. ccxx), was passed on 28 July 1863; the name was changed to the &quot;Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway&quot; (N&amp;BJR). Even then it was forced to content itself with a short line from Blisworth, on the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) main line to Towcester, opened on 1 May 1866. It built its own station at Blisworth alongside the station.

The extended its line to Cockley Brake, approaching Banbury, on 1 June 1872, authorised by the (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. cxxii). Goods traffic had been carried as far as Helmdon since August 1871. The extension was in length, and was constructed using very light permanent way materials, which caused difficulties later. The junction at Cockley Brake was over from Banbury, and running powers over the Buckinghamshire Railway were necessary to reach that place. The company was able to operate a passenger service from Blisworth through Towcester, Wappenham, Helmdon and Cockley Brake to Banbury. It worked the line itself with second hand engines acquired from the until 1875, from which time they were hired from that company throughout the remaining lifetime of the .

Still intending to reach South Wales independently, the obtained authorisation in the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccclxii) for a further extension to Blockley, Gloucestershire, (near Moreton-in-Marsh) in 1865 and to Ross-on-Wye in 1866. This line would have turned south-west on the approach to Banbury; the company signalled its intention by changing its name to the &quot;Midland Counties and South Wales Railway&quot;. However it quickly became obvious that these ambitious plans— of railway was contemplated at a cost of £1,250,000—were impossible to put into effect, and the company reverted to its former name. In fact the desired connecting line across the hills to Chipping Norton was built much later by the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway, which opened on 6 April 1887. The Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway did not generate much passenger traffic, and the train service was limited to three or four return trains daily, but cattle proved a very successful traffic as Banbury cattle market grew in importance.

The small scale ironstone workings around Blisworth and Gayton (just over south-west of Blisworth on the line) developed in the 1880s and with the advance of mechanisation so the workings expanded considerably; this later became an extensive site operated by Richard Thomas and Baldwins.

==The East and West Junction Railway==
The next line to be authorised was the &quot;East and West Junction Railway&quot; (E&amp;WJR); it obtained its act of Parliament, the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. lxxvi), on 23 June 1864. It was to build a line from the Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway at Green&#x27;s Norton Junction, a short distance west of Towcester, and to continue from there, crossing the Great Western Railway south of Fenny Compton, to join the Stratford on Avon Railway at Stratford-upon-Avon. That was planned to give the access both to Birmingham northwards and via Honeybourne south-westwards; the authorised line included running powers over the Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway between Towcester and Blisworth.
The huge authorised capital of £300,000 turned out to be not enough and in 1866 a further act, the (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cxlii), for another £300,000 was passed. Also in the same year the company submitted a bill to extend from Towcester to join the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Hitchin, on condition that the subscribed £200,000. The evident objective was to create a further London connection in which the would be a major partner. The declined to make the financial commitment; powers to extend westward to Worcester were also considered, but that scheme was abandoned. Obtaining parliamentary authority to raise capital was one thing, but it proved much more difficult actually to obtain the money from potential subscribers.

On 1 June 1871 the first section of the line, from Fenny Compton to Kineton, a distance of six miles, was opened and a passenger service started over that section. They hired a contractor&#x27;s engine for the purpose and later bought it, at which stage the locomotive became no. 1.

A further time extension had to be sought in Parliament, the (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. lxxxi), and preference loans obtained to build further, but on 1 July 1873 the western (Stratford to Kineton) and eastern (Fenny Compton to Green&#x27;s Norton Junction, Towcester) ends of the line were ready, and trains ran between Blisworth and Stratford. Between Blisworth and Green&#x27;s Norton Junction this was by running powers over the Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway.

At the Stratford end the company was to build its own station, but at first the Great Western Railway (GWR) station, accessed by a spur connection, was used. In June 1875 the had a temporary station of its own ready and trains were transferred to that, and they opened a permanent station in January 1876.

However, soon after the opening, a newspaper believed that the was using its own, separate station:

We hope to see the East and West Junction running into the Great Western line at this town. Every one is too familiar with the annoyances of a break in the line of communication, and travellers by the east and West Junction coming from the south and desirous of proceeding to Birmingham &amp;c., have to land at one end of Stratford and journey by omnibus or car, or walk to the opposite extremity of the town, causing fatigue, anxiety, and delay... we hope some means will be used to effect a junction in the two lines, so that one station can be used, and the Great Western Company have a station in the Alcester-road, particularly accessible from the town.

From this time the London and North Western Railway ran through carriages from London Euston to Stratford via Blisworth.

Income on the was so poor that it fell into receivership from 29 January 1875 to 1902. The passenger service was withdrawn from 31 July 1877 and not resumed until 2 March 1885.

The East and West Junction Railway, which runs from Stratford-on-Avon to Blisworth, a distance of about , was opened for passenger traffic on Monday [2 March 1885].&quot;

==The Evesham, Redditch and Stratford-upon-Avon Junction Railway==


The still saw its destiny in reaching further west, giving access ultimately to the iron industries of South Wales and the West Midlands, and if possible avoiding dependency on the powerful Great Western Railway (GWR) at Stratford. The Evesham and Redditch Railway (E&amp;RR) had opened a north–south line in 1866, and was aligned to the Midland Railway. Its line lay only eight miles west of Stratford, and the sponsored the promotion of the &quot;Evesham, Redditch and Stratford-upon-Avon Junction Railway&quot; (ER&amp;SJR). This line was authorised by the (36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. ccxlv) on 5 August 1873, and ran west from Stratford to a junction at Broom on the . The junction at Broom led towards Birmingham. The heavy mineral traffic was destined to move southwards, and the reversal in the restricted layout was to prove inconvenient.

It opened on 2 June 1879 and the seven mile line was worked by the . Running powers were obtained to Redditch, but they were only exercised from the junction at Broom to the station there.

This line was immediately unprofitable and it too went into receivership, but continuing to trade, from 2 January 1886.

==The Stratford-upon-Avon, Towcester and Midland Junction Railway==

Continuing its quest to find a connecting line that would be successful, the now looked to the south-east. It observed that the Bedford and Northampton Railway opened its line in 1872; aligned to the Midland Railway it connected to the Midland main line to Bedford and London. Olney, on the , was only ten miles or so east of Towcester.


In 1879 the East and West Junction Railway sponsored this line; it would build from Towcester to a junction near Olney (Ravenstone Junction). The proposed railway was called the &quot;Easton Neston Mineral and Towcester, Roade and Olney Junction Railway&quot;; it was incorporated on 15 August 1879, with share capital of £230,000. Running powers for goods and mineral trains were granted to the Midland Railway. The ten mile line took some time to construct due to difficulty in raising money, and before it opened the company changed its name to the &quot;Stratford-upon-Avon, Towcester and Midland Junction Railway&quot; (ST&amp;MJR), by the (45 &amp; 46 Vict. c. ccix) of 10 August 1882.

In 1883 a joint committee was formed with the East and West Junction Railway to operate the line. It opened to goods traffic on 13 April 1891. The line crossed the main line at Roade, and a short spur for goods purposes was laid in to connect with that line. The spur was only used for exchange of goods wagons, and in later years the signalbox at the junction on the line was replaced by a ground frame; the daily goods train exchanging wagons waited at the ground frame while the fireman walked to the signalbox to collect the train staff for the line, returning to his train to unlock the ground frame with the key on the train staff.

A passenger service on the main line was inaugurated on 1 December 1892, operated by hiring in a Midland Railway locomotive and coaches, but this was unsuccessful and it ceased from 30 March 1893.

Cheap iron ore from Spain became easily available before the line opened, and abstracted most of the intended revenue. Nonetheless the Midland Railway was quick to exploit the new shorter route from the West of England to London and by 1883 was working goods trains between Broom Junction and Olney with its own engines. The Midland Railway locomotives proved too heavy for the lightly constructed permanent way on the line and the local company&#x27;s own engines were substituted.

The passenger station at Broom was an unadvertised exchange platform only at first, but it became a public station on 1 November 1880.

To add to the financial agonies, the was obliged to modernise the lines, which had been built cheaply of poorly specified materials: £160,000 was to be spent; evidently the was in part intended as a means of financial manipulation to rescue the . Nonetheless, the money was simply not available.

==The Great Central Railway==
In 1893 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) purchased £294,971 worth of shares in the East and West Junction Railway and £42,345 worth in the Evesham, Redditch and Stratford Junction Railway with an eye to future use, and the now had majority voting in the two smaller companies. The was planning its London extension, and it changed its name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1897. When it opened the London extension line in 1899, the provided a north-facing and a south-facing spur where it crossed the Stratford line at Byfield to Woodford on the , opened 15 March 1899. It closed again to passenger trains in August 1899 and to goods traffic on 22 October 1900. While open, it carried the 5.20 pm train from London Marylebone to Byfield, which was then attached to the 7.17 pm Blisworth to Stratford train.

There was a north curve opened at the same time and it remained open much longer; the Marylebone to Stratford through carriage was slipped at Woodford and ran to Stratford over the north curve. The through carriage was operated from 16 June 1902. The curve closed to passengers on 31 May 1948 and to goods on 1 March 1965.

==The Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway==
The three railways – the , the , and the – were only notionally independent and the reality was given official recognition when an act of Parliament of 13 April 1891 established a joint committee of the three lines, which could now openly work in concert. The network reached from the Midland Railway at Broom to the Midland at Olney, a west-to-east spread of nearly 60 miles.

The Midland Railway had been running through goods and mineral trains over the line between Broom and Olney for some time with its own engines, but the very light track on the line was experiencing serious damage, and from 8 December 1891 the Midland engines were taken off and the through traffic worked by engines.
The joint committee had made strenuous efforts to sell its lines to a larger railway, ideally the Midland Railway, but notwithstanding the interest shown by the , no company made an offer; the lines were still heavily loss-making and there was a huge backlog of modernisation and upgrading required. The joint committee decided to try to raise more money on the market, and to amalgamate their three lines formally, and to create £600,000 of capital. This was authorised by the (8 Edw. 7. c. lxxvii) of 1 August 1908, by which the three railways were formed into the ; the merger was effective on 1 January 1909, and the joint committee was dissolved on 21 April 1909. The attractiveness of investing in this new company must have been affected by the fact that the total population between Broom and Blisworth was only 18,000 in 1900: the only large settlements were Towcester (population 2,775) and Stratford-upon-Avon (8,500).
The Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway joined the new group by being purchased by the for £53,223. This was authorised by the (10 Edw. 7 &amp; 1 Geo. 5. c. viii) of 29 April 1910, which took effect on 1 July 1910.

The chairman of the was Harry Willmott, and his son Russell Willmott was appointed traffic manager and engineer from 31 December 1913. The Willmotts were energetic in promoting the tourism potential of the line; in addition to the connection with Shakespeare at Stratford, there were considerable areas of natural beauty on the line, and combined tickets were issued for excursions including river trips and refreshments. Moreton Pinkney station was entitled &quot;Moreton Pinkney for Sulgrave&quot; from 10 January 1913 to build on the connection with the family of George Washington, who had inhabited Sulgrave Manor. The line was promoted in publicity material as &quot;The Shakespeare Route&quot;, and powers were obtained in 1910 to operate motor buses.

Certain economies in train mileage were possible after acquisition of the Northampton line, and the opportunity was taken to rationalise the junction at Greens Norton: the junction (and signalbox) was abolished by running a second single track from Towcester; two single tracks ran side by side, and for the expense of the additional track the signalmen&#x27;s wages were saved.

For some time the Midland Railway had been using the route for its Bristol to London traffic, in competition with the Great Western Railway which had a more advantageous route. For a time this usage of the Stratford route flourished, but the Midland withdrew the lucrative banana traffic—5,500 tons and £1,100 in revenue annually—from Avonmouth to London, and also coal traffic to London, from 1912 or 1913. The long single line through Stratford with inevitable traffic delays and slow permitted speeds militated against reliable use of the line.

==Railophone==
A means of instant communication with moving trains had long been wished for, and in 1910 an experiment was carried out on the line with the &quot;Railophone&quot; system that had been developed by an engineer by the name of Hans von Kramer. A demonstration set-up was installed on the line; an inductive conductor was placed along the track, and two sets of coils in the train were able to receive and transmit speech. Apparatus was fitted that enabled an electrical signal to the train to apply the train brakes in an emergency. A public demonstration of the system was arranged for 28 June 1912.

In view of the extraordinary number of terrible railway accidents that have occurred in different parts of the world during the last few months, the latest invention in the science of wireless electricity deserves far more public attention than has been given to it. [The invention] promises to create a beneficial revolution in railway traffic by making a train the safest as well as the most comfortable means of travelling. As soon as the &quot;railophone&quot; comes into general use a collision between two trains will practically be an impossibility. Moreover, the difficult art of the signalman will be transformed into a science. The reach and flexibility of the arm of the law will be marvellously extended to the detriment of wrongdoers flying from justice; and a passenger on an English express, while travelling along at will soon be able to hold a quiet conversation with a person as far away as Astrakan.

Mr Hans von Kramer, the inventor of the &quot;railophone,&quot; is an electrical engineer of Birmingham. He has worked on the old idea of electro-magnetic induction discovered by Faraday about 80 years ago.

The demonstration was evidently a technical success; as well as showing that trains could be stopped remotely, von Kramer accidentally leant on the activation button and a movement shunting to the platform was instantly stopped. Nonetheless the cost of installing the system on a widespread basis seems to have deterred its general adoption.

==From 1914==
During World War I the railways came under the control of the Railway Executive Committee, and leisure travel was discouraged.

On 24 May 1917 the connection at Roade to the was removed, and the track materials were reused elsewhere.

During the war there was heavy demand for iron ore for the materiel of war. Harry Willmott drew attention to the large deposits of easily winnable iron ore near Burton Dassett; 30 million tons were claimed to be accessible. A suggestion from Willmott that the government might wish to support a railway to get access to the deposits did not find favour, and commercial interests combined to build an access line privately. The ironstone was to be extracted by the Edge Hill Ironstone Company.

==The Edge Hill Light Railway==
A provisional railway company, the Edge Hill Light Railway, was formed, and the engineer and manager Colonel Stephens was engaged to plan the line. Eleven miles of railway were designed including an incline at 1 in 6 to reach an altitude of . Capital was to be £200,000. However, there was intense local opposition on the grounds of spoilt amenity. The resulting negotiations resulted in a railway network planned to be less than in extent, with capital of £90,000, joining the lines at Burton Dassett.

A Light Railway Order, the , was issued on 28 January 1919; the track was to be standard gauge. The incline was on the balanced system, with descending loaded wagons hauling empties upwards by a cable. Two former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway &quot;terrier&quot; locomotives and a former Manning Wardle 0-4-0ST locomotive were engaged on the construction work.

The mines started production on 22 January 1922, obviously too late to assist in the war effort, and the railway started work in June 1922. Indeed, the market for the ore was not what had been assumed; the quality was indifferent and the demand was considerably reduced. Production ceased on 27 January 1925, at first apparently temporarily but the work never resumed.

==After 1923==
The railways of Great Britain were &quot;grouped&quot; following the Railways Act 1921; the was a subsidiary of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the Midland Railway and the were constituents of it. The consisted of of route and had a capital value of £600,000. Ordinary shareholders received 39% of their shareholding face value in cash. A dividend of 1% had been paid in 1921 and 0.5% in 1922.

The was in competition with the and in 1927–28 it put in hand work to upgrade the line to use it for traffic from Bristol and Avonmouth. Track was relaid and upgraded, with extensions to the passing loops, and signalling systems were improved. Banana specials ran on the route once more, a remarkably lucrative traffic. The speed limit on the line was raised to .

For some years the railways had been giving attention to the economical carriage of passengers on very lightly used lines. A number of options were tried, and in 1931 the arranged with the company Karrier of Huddersfield, who produced a vehicle that came to be called the &quot;Ro-railer&quot;. It strongly resembled an ordinary 26-seat single decker bus; the bodywork was supplied by Cravens of Sheffield. It had pneumatic-tyred road wheels and railway wheels as well. The railway wheels were wood laminate; a wooden ramp was provided at the changeover point and the driver steered so as to descend on to the rails. The road wheels had to be raised manually and locked; the process took about five minutes. There were separate transmission gear boxes for road and rail with a faster ratio on the rail system. On 22 January 1931 there was a press demonstration, then the vehicle entered ordinary service between the Welcombe Hotel near Stratford and Stratford station, by road, and from there it ran by rail to Blisworth.

It was modified in 1932, with pneumatic wheel jacks and a reduction in weight to about 6 tons.

The vehicle was prone to failure and had difficulties on gradients; it was not able to run on a fast main line so passengers still needed to change at the main line junction. It ceased to run from 2 July 1932, being regarded as an unsuccessful experiment, and the journey was replaced by a steam train connecting with taxis in the ordinary way.

Broom Junction was awkwardly laid out for the dominant mineral traffic heading from Northamptonshire towards South Wales, as it required reversal at the station. Engines working through required to turn on the turntable. On 28 September 1942 a south curve was opened by the enabling direct running without entering Broom station. The passenger service between Stratford and Broom was closed temporarily on 16 June 1947, and the closure was made final on 23 May 1949.

==Nationalisation==
At the beginning of 1948 the railways of Great Britain were once again reorganised compulsorily by Government; this time they were taken into national ownership, as British Railways. As a result, the management of the line was divided organisationally between the London Midland Region and the Western Region: the boundary was at Fenny Compton.

Local passenger services in thinly populated rural areas had long been hit hard by more efficient road bus operations, and the new British Railways management, under pressure to reduce losses, looked hard at the value for money of the passenger work. The passenger service over the northward spur to the Great Central line, Byfield to Woodford Halse, ceased to have a passenger service from 31 May 1948.

In 1950 they reported that passenger bookings between Blisworth and Stratford were two per day, from Ettington one per month, and from Kineton one per day. It was obvious that the passenger service would have to close, and the last passenger train ran on 5 April 1952. The goods service continued until 1965. The Banbury to Towcester and Blisworth service closed earlier on 2 July 1951, followed soon by the goods service on that route, on 29 October 1951.

Conversely the core route had a strategic, long-distance potential, and from 4 June 1951 four through freight trains each way daily were routed from the Great Central line at Woodford to Broom South Junction, continuing through Ashchurch to South Wales.

The line between Ravenstone Junction and Towcester closed after 8 June 1958.

After the initial opening of the East and West Junction line, the layout at Fenny Compton placed the two railways side by side, with only a siding connection for exchange of goods wagons between the two. The SMJR line crossed over the by a bridge further south. On 7 March 1960 however a new junction was installed at the station, providing a shorter route for iron ore trains from Banbury to South Wales than the former route by way of Leamington. A new staging yard was provided at Honeybourne West Junction.

The connection at Fenny Compton was commissioned on 7 March 1960. A new south facing curve at Stratford was opened on 13 June 1960, as part of the same scheme. Line and signalling improvements had been implemented in addition. However the Oxfordshire Ironstone Company&#x27;s operations did not have a long life, closing down completely at Banbury on 2 October 1967.

During 1964 and 1965 all the residual local traffic was closed down and through transits were diverted away. The only remaining operational part of the former SMJR system was the connection from Fenny Compton to Kineton Ministry of Defence Establishment. The branch stub was transferred to the Ministry of Defence on 19 July 1971, and is worked by them with their own locomotives.

==Locomotives==
The Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway ordered four locomotives for the start of its service, from Neilson of Glasgow. However it was unable to produce the cash to pay for them. In difficulty, the hired in two locomotives from I W Boulton. One was ex- No. 1125, a 2-2-2 of 1866: it was in very poor condition, as the other engine, &quot;The Owl&quot;, about which little detail is recorded. The arrangements actually made are unknown, until 1866 when the worked the line until 1872. From that year the acquired three engines second hand from the and worked its own trains the engines were a Tayleur 0-6-0 No. 1827, a Sharp, Stewart 0-4-2T No. 1831, and a Hawthorn 0-6-0 No. 1849. By 1876 the was unable to continue working its own trains and the stepped in once again.

The East and West Junction Railway started its basic train service with the 1866 Manning Wardle 0-6-0ST used by the contractor in the construction of the line. In 1873 six locomotives were ordered on the hire purchase system from Beyer, Peacock and Company; the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company provided the financing. After about a year in service, the was unable to keep up the payments and the locomotives were repossessed. Two second hand engines were now acquired, brought from France by the contractor Crampton. They were in very poor condition but they worked on the lines for some time. In 1875 two 0-6-0ST locomotives were hired in from I. W. Boulton.

In 1876 the acquired two Fairlie locomotives that had been built for a Mexican Railway; one was a double Fairlie 0-6-6-0 and became No. 1; the other was an 0-4-4T and became No. 2. They were disposed of in 1878, and some unknown engines were hired in from I. W. Boulton.

In 1879 an 0-6-0ST was supplied by Beyer Peacock, allocated No. 1, the third to bear the number, to work to Broom, but its water tank capacity proved too small and it was sold on. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were Beyer Peacock double-framed 0-6-0s built in 1880, 1881 and 1885. Nos. 5 and 6 followed from Beyer, Peacock, but were 2-4-0Ts for passenger traffic, and were fitted with Westinghouse brake.

In August 1888 a 2-4-0T was acquired second hand from the Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway; it was named &quot;Hope&quot; and became the fourth No. 1 on the line, working on the Broom route. Three more second-hand engines were bought from the in December 1891; they were DX class 0-6-0 goods engines and worked between Olney and Broom.

Next came three 0-6-0s from Beyer Peacock, numbered 10 11 and 12; they were fitted with dual brakes. No. 13 was a 2-4-0 express engine from Beyer, Peacock, in 1903. Five more Beyer, Peacock 0-6-0s followed (Nos. 14 to 18) in quick succession, ordered by the but financed at the end by the formation of the . Finally the ordered a second hand Stroudley &quot;Large C&quot; class 0-6-0 from the LBSCR; built in 1884 it arrived in November 1920.

The Edge Hill Light Railway acquired two LBSCR Terrier 0-6-0Ts and one or other of them, regarded as spare by the Edge Hill Railway, was occasionally put on passenger trains on the Broom line.

When the absorbed the line, most of the locomotive stock was soon classified as life expired, and in due course Midland Railway pattern 0-6-0 types became dominant. When the Ro-railer was taken off the Welcombe Hotel run, three 0-4-4T engines were brought in to operate on the line. Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway engines worked in from Northampton in this period.

The improvements made to the track by the aided the engine power situation considerably as heavier types could be used, and in fact after 1945 the former War Department Austerity 2-8-0 class were commonly used on the line, as well as other heavy types.

==Description of a ride on the line==
In August 1955 a writer took a footplate ride on a goods train along the line from Towcester to Stratford. The journey took five hours for thirty or so miles. Although the passenger service was no more, the line was remarkably busy, and the relative infrequency of passing places made progress slow.

The train left Towcester punctually at 10.12 am hauled by a class &quot;4F&quot; 0-6-0 with 19 wagons and a brake van. An eastbound train crossed at Towcester station.

&quot;A run of about ten minutes with speed round about 20 m.p.h. [30 km/h] brought the train into Blakesley, where... [a] stop of five minutes was made to allow another eastbound train to pass... The next section is a long one, reaching to Woodford Halse... A steady climb, at places 1 in 100, brings the railway to Woodford, and for a short while it runs close to the Marylebone main line, until it crosses it a few hundred yards south of Woodford Halse Station. Exchange sidings are provided here with the former Great Central line, and the passenger service used to run in and out of the passenger station on the main line.&quot;

At Woodford, a wagon was left and another picked up.

&quot;The train then drew forward to await the arrival from Stratford of the crew who were to work it on. Most day rotas change here, the Northampton men working a train back over the eastern part of the line, and the Stratford men returning to the west... the Stratford freight was very late in arriving, and [our train] had to wait a full hour before proceeding on its way. A train of 20 empties ran through without stopping... to be followed a few minutes later by another [engine] and 12 wagons, manned by the Stratford crew. Once the train had run in, the two crews quickly changed locomotives, and in a few minutes both were once again on their way.&quot;

A wagon was picked up at Byfield.

&quot;Occasional excursions are still run from this station to London via Blisworth... At Byfield Ironstone Sidings another stop was made beside the ground frame, and 15 empties were shunted on to one of the sidings to be filled with ore. This left only six wagons to continue the journey.&quot;

The train arrived at Fenny Compton and there was a half hour delay until an engine with two brake vans arrived from the section ahead. The writer&#x27;s train ran the next mile or two to Burton Dassett.

&quot;The large W.D. [War Department] depot here brings a good deal of traffic to this section, and after a lengthy halt outside the yard instructions were given to run through and reverse into the sidings. Three small W.D. tank [engines] were in evidence... Once the local freight was clear of the line, a heavy W.D. special backed slowly out of the depot yards and on to the running line. This train consisted of 35 wagons, and was... soon on its way westward to Stratford and beyond... The line was now clear for shunting, but such is the layout here that it was quite a complicated business to pick up eight wagons and detach one. However, the job was completed eventually, and the train remarshalled, though a further wait was necessary until the 1.15 p.m. from Stratford arrived. This train of 21 wagons... reached Burton Dassett considerably behind schedule, and after one hour spent in the sidings here [our train] left on the last stage of its journey at 2.30 p.m.&quot;

At Kineton a wagon was to be picked up. Five hours after leaving Towcester, the train arrived at Stratford Old Town Station...

The lines were undulating with ruling gradients of about 1 in 80 and lengthy climbs averaging 1 in 100. There was a significant summit at Tiffield between Blisworth and Towcester; again approaching Morton Pinkney, near Byfield and near Fenny Compton; and at Ettington Lime Works, a mile west of Ettington station. he line to Ravenstone Wood Junction was also undulating at 1 in 100 with a mile of 1 in 82, and the Midland Railway section onward to Olney fell at 1 in 75 and 1 in 70 for four miles. The Cockley Brake line climbed continuously to a summit a mile east of Cockley Brake, the final ascent being over a mile of 1 in 65, followed by a fall of over a mile at 1 in 70.

<text>The Acela ( ; originally the Acela Express until September 2019) is Amtrak&#x27;s flagship passenger train service along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in the Northeastern United States between Washington, D.C. and Boston via 13 intermediate stops, including Baltimore, New York City and Philadelphia. &quot;Acela&quot; trains are the fastest in the Americas, reaching (qualifying as high-speed rail), but only over of the route.

&quot;Acela&quot; carried more than 2.9 million passengers in fiscal year 2023, second only to the slower and less expensive &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, which had over 9 million passengers. Ridership is down from the pre-Covid-19 pandemic high of 3,557,455 passengers in 2019. Its 2016 revenue of $585 million was 25% of Amtrak&#x27;s total.

&quot;Acela&quot; operates along routes that are used by freight and slower regional passenger traffic, and reaches the maximum allowed speed of the tracks only along some sections, with the fastest peak speed along segments between Mansfield, Massachusetts, and Richmond, Rhode Island, and South Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. &quot;Acela&quot; trains use active tilting technology, which helps control lateral centrifugal force, allowing the train to travel at higher speeds on the sharply curved NEC without disturbing passengers. The high-speed operation occurs mostly along the route from Pennsylvania Station in New York City to Union Station in Washington, D.C., with a fastest scheduled time of 2 hours and 45 minutes and an average speed of , including time spent at intermediate stops. Over this route, &quot;Acela&quot; and the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; service captured an 83% share of air/train commuters between New York and Washington in 2021, up from 37% in 2000.

The &quot;Acela&quot; speed is limited by traffic and infrastructure on the route&#x27;s northern half. On the section from Boston&#x27;s South Station to New York&#x27;s Penn Station, the fastest scheduled time is 3 hours and 30 minutes, or an average speed of . Along this section, &quot;Acela&quot; has captured a 54% share of the combined train and air market. The entire route from Boston to Washington takes between 6 hours, 38 minutes and 6 hours, 50 minutes, at an average speed of around .

The present Acela Express equipment will be replaced by new Avelia Liberty trainsets in early 2025. The new trains will have greater passenger capacity and an enhanced active tilt system that will allow higher speed on the many curved sections of the route.

==History==
===Background===
Following the success of Japan&#x27;s newly inaugurated Shinkansen network, the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 authorized the U.S. government to explore the creation of high-speed rail, which resulted in the introduction of the higher-speed &quot;Metroliner&quot; trains between Washington, D.C., and New York City in 1969, the predecessor to &quot;Acela&quot;. During the 1980s, the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration explored the possibilities of high-speed rail in the United States. On December 18, 1991, five potential high speed rail corridors were authorized, including the Northeast Corridor.

In the early 1990s, Amtrak tested several different high-speed trains from Europe on the Northeast Corridor. An X 2000 train was leased from Sweden for test runs from October 1992 to January 1993, followed by revenue service between Washington, D.C., and New York City from February to May and August to September 1993. Siemens showed the ICE 1 train from Germany, organizing the ICE Train North America Tour which started to operate on the Northeast Corridor on July 3, 1993.

===Building and development===
With the testing of the trains from Europe complete, Amtrak was able to define a set of specifications for high-speed equipment and in October 1994, Amtrak requested bids from train manufacturers for a trainset that could reach . A consortium of Bombardier (75%) and GEC Alsthom (now Alstom) (25%) was selected in March 1996.

On March 9, 1999, Amtrak unveiled its plan for the &quot;Acela Express,&quot; a high-speed train on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston. Several changes were made to the corridor to make it suitable for higher-speed electric trains. The Northend Electrification Project extended existing electrification from New Haven, Connecticut, to Boston to complete the overhead power supply along the route, and several grade crossings were improved or removed. Prior to 2000, all trains bound for Boston had to switch to diesel power at New Haven.
A pilot trainset was completed by early 2000 and sent to Transportation Technology Center (TTC) for testing in June 2000. An inaugural VIP run of the &quot;Acela&quot; occurred on November 16, 2000, with the VIP train being led by power car number 2020 with no. 2009 at the opposite end, followed by the first revenue run on December 11, 2000, a few months after the intended date.

===Cost===
Amtrak&#x27;s original contract with the Bombardier-Alstom consortium was for the delivery of 20 trainsets (six coaches each, with power cars at front and rear) for $800 million. By 2004, Amtrak had settled contract disputes with the consortium, paying a total of $1.2 billion for the 20 trainsets plus 15 extra high-speed locomotives and the construction of maintenance facilities in Boston, New York, and Washington.

===Impact of the &quot;Acela&quot;===

By 2005, Amtrak&#x27;s share of the common-carrier market between New York and Boston had reached 40%, from 18% pre-&quot;Acela&quot;. With the increasing popularity of the faster, modern &quot;Acela Express&quot;, &quot;Metroliner&quot; service was phased out in late 2006. To meet the demand, more &quot;Acela&quot; services were added in September 2005. By August 2008 crowding had become noticeable.

By 2011, the &quot;Acela&quot; fleet had reached half of its designed service life. Amtrak proposed several replacement options, including one as part of its &quot;A Vision for High-Speed Rail in the Northeast Corridor&quot;. In 2011, Amtrak announced that forty new &quot;Acela&quot; coaches would be ordered in 2012 to increase capacity on existing trainsets. The existing trains would have received two more coaches, lengthening the trainsets from a 1-6-1 configuration to 1-8-1 (power car—passenger cars—power car). The longer trainsets would have required the modifications of the &quot;Acela&quot; maintenance facilities in Boston, New York and Washington. The first of the stretched trainsets was to have entered service in fiscal year 2014. This plan was cancelled in 2012 in favor of replacing, rather than refurbishing, the &quot;Acela&quot; fleet.

In January 2014, Amtrak issued a request for proposals on 28 or more new model &quot;Acela&quot; trainsets, in a combined order with the California High-Speed Rail Authority. These bids were due May 17, 2014. After discussions with manufacturers, Amtrak and the California High Speed Rail Authority concluded their needs were too disparate for common rolling stock and decided not to pursue the joint option.

===Branding===
Before the introduction of the Acela, there were several classes of trains on the Northeast Corridor: the express &quot;Metroliners&quot;, the Philadelphia-New York &quot;Clockers&quot;, &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains between New York City and Niagara Falls via the Empire Corridor, &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains between New York City and to Harrisburg via the Keystone Corridor, and the umbrella term &quot;NortheastDirect&quot;, applied to other trains on the corridor (in addition to unique names assigned to many departures).
The &quot;Acela&quot; name was announced on March 9, 1999, as a part of the original announcement of the service itself. The branding team based the name &quot;Acela&quot; on the ideas of acceleration and excellence. At the same time, Amtrak launched what it called the Capstone Program, a short-lived plan to rebrand the &quot;NortheastDirect&quot;, &quot;Keystone Service&quot; and &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains as &quot;Acela Regional&quot; and the &quot;Clocker&quot; trains as &quot;Acela Commuter&quot;.

The &quot;Acela Regional&quot; name was first applied to &quot;NortheastDirect&quot; trains 130–133 on January 31, 2000. Those trains were the first electrified trains to run on the full Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston. As more trains were electrified, they too were rebranded.

Following mass rider confusion between the three services, the branding was removed from the lower-speed &quot;Acela Regional&quot; and &quot;Acela Commuter&quot; trains in 2003.&quot;&quot;

On September 23, 2019, Amtrak shortened the name of the service from &quot;Acela Express&quot; to simply &quot;Acela&quot;.

At the same time, Amtrak introduced the &quot;Acela Nonstop&quot;, a direct train from Washington, D.C., to New York&#x27;s Penn Station. The nonstop service was temporarily suspended as of March 10, 2020, due to low ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Engineering==
===First-generation trainsets===
The first-generation &quot;Acela&quot; trainset is a unique set of vehicles designed specifically to satisfy governmental rolling stock requirements established primarily by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). This includes the ability to withstand a collision with a freight train at speed without collapsing. Most manufacturers that bid on the &quot;Acela&quot; were unable to meet the structural requirements, due to increased costs and complications for the manufacture of the trains, and the need for manufacturers to make significant engineering changes to their standard designs. In the end, only three qualified bidders remained: ABB (Swedish-Swiss manufacturer of the X 2000 train), Siemens (manufacturer of the German ICE), and a consortium of Bombardier (manufacturer of the LRC trains) and Alstom (manufacturer of the French TGV).

The design, using identical power cars at each end which operate on voltages of 12 kV, 12.5 kV, and 25 kV AC, and either 25 or 60 Hz frequency, derives several components from the TGV, such as the third-generation TGV&#x27;s traction system (including the four asynchronous AC motors per power car, rectifiers, inverters, and regenerative braking), the trucks/bogies structure (a long-wheelbase dual transom H frame welded steel with outboard mounted tapered roller bearings), the brake discs (although there are only three per axle, versus four on the TGV), and crash energy management techniques to control structural deformation in the event of an accident.

The tilting carriages are based upon Bombardier&#x27;s earlier LRC trains used on Via Rail rather than the TGV&#x27;s non-tilting articulated trailers. &quot;Acela&quot; power cars and passenger cars are much heavier than those of the TGV in order to meet the FRA&#x27;s crash standards. French and Canadian crews testing the &quot;Acela&quot; referred to it as &quot;the pig&quot; due to its weight. The extra weight leads to the &quot;Acela&quot; power-to-weight ratio being about 22.4 hp per tonne, compared to 30.8 hp for a SNCF TGV Reseau trainset. The Tier II crash standards, adopted in 1999, have also resulted in the passenger cars being designed without steps and trapdoors, which means that the trainsets can only serve lines with high-level platforms such as the Northeast Corridor. &quot;Acela&quot; trains are semi-permanently coupled (but not articulated as in the TGV) and are referred to as trainsets. Bombardier later used the &quot;Acela&quot; carriage design and a diesel/gas turbine variant of the power car for its experimental JetTrain.

=== Second-generation trainsets ===
On August 26, 2016, then-Vice President Joe Biden announced a $2.45 billion federal loan package to pay for new equipment for the &quot;Acela Express&quot; service, as well as upgrades to the NEC. The loans will finance 28 Avelia Liberty trainsets that will be built by Alstom in Hornell and Rochester, New York, and will replace the existing fleet of twenty Acela trainsets.

The fleet expansion will allow for hourly New York-Boston service all day and half-hourly New York-Washington service at peak hours. The new trainsets will be longer, have 386 seats compared to 304 on Acela Express (a 27% increase) and will feature active tilt technology that will initially allow service to operate at 160 mph (260 km/h) and would allow for service if proposed infrastructure improvements are completed.

The new trains were expected to be phased in between 2021 and 2022, after which the current fleet was to be retired. Trains are now expected to enter passenger service in spring 2025.

==== Operating speeds ====

Although the first-generation Acela Express trainsets were designed with a top speed of and the second-generation Avelia Liberty trainsets will be designed to reach , the existing infrastructure of the Northeast Corridor significantly limits speeds.

The maximum speed limit on the Northeast Corridor is on of the route, in four sections of track in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. The &quot;Acela&quot; achieves an average speed (including stops) of between Washington and New York, and an average speed of from New York to Boston. The average speed over the entire route is .

Speeds are limited by the route the corridor takes through urban areas, and there are several speed restrictions below over bridges or through tunnels that are over a century old. Altogether, Amtrak has identified 224 bridges along &quot;Acela&quot; route that are beyond their design life.

South of the Delaware River, the &quot;Acela&quot;&#x27;s top speed is . One limiting factor is the overhead catenary support system which was constructed before 1935 and lacks the constant-tension features of the new catenary east of New Haven. The Pennsylvania Railroad ran &quot;Metroliner&quot; test trains in the late 1960s as fast as and briefly intended to run the &quot;Metroliner&quot; service at speeds reaching . Certification testing for commercial operation at involving test runs at up to began between Trenton and New Brunswick in September 2012. Passenger operation at began in this region in late May 2022.

The fastest schedule between New York and Washington, DC was 2 hours, 43 minutes in 2012. $450 million was allotted by President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration to replace catenary and upgrade signals between Trenton and New Brunswick, which will allow speeds of over a stretch. The improvements were scheduled to be completed in 2016, but have been delayed; the project was partially completed in late May 2022, with the remainder projected in 2024. This section of track holds the record for the highest speed by a train in the US, which is , achieved in a test run by the U.S./Canada-built UAC TurboTrain on December 20, 1967.

North of New York City, Amtrak upgraded the track along the Connecticut shoreline east of New Haven to allow maximum speeds in excess of , in preparation for the &quot;Acela&quot; launch. Although this area contains the fastest current operating speeds (), it also has the slowest section of the NEC: between New Rochelle, New York, and New Haven, Connecticut. This section is owned by Metro-North Railroad and the Connecticut Department of Transportation and is heavily used by commuter trains which limit the speed of the &quot;Acela&quot;. Amtrak&#x27;s trains achieve only on a limited stretch in New York State and rarely exceed at any time eastbound through Connecticut until reaching New Haven. In 1992, ConnDOT began plans to upgrade the catenary system and replace outdated bridges on the New Haven Line to enable the &quot;Acela&quot; to run slightly faster. the catenary replacement and bridge work were under way and expected to be completed by mid-2018.

On July 9, 2007, Amtrak introduced a limited-stop round trip, with trains stopping only at Philadelphia between New York and Washington. This shortened the trip between the two cities to 2 hours 35 minutes, making the trip roughly an hour faster than some of the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; train services. These trains were an experiment to find ways to expedite travel time on the &quot;Acela&quot;; Amtrak has since dropped them.

===High speed infrastructure===
The dense population of the northeastern United States makes the Northeast Corridor the most heavily traveled portion of the American passenger rail system. Two-thirds of rail passengers in the United States live in or near New York City, also home to the nation&#x27;s busiest passenger rail station, Penn Station. In order to compete with airliners, Amtrak needed to increase the speed of trains in the region. The former Shore Line from New Haven to Boston is burdened by sharp turns and grade crossings, the crossings being of special concern.

Tilting enables passengers to ride more comfortably on curved sections of track faster than would otherwise be possible, by leaning into the bend. &quot;Acela&quot; trainsets use active tilting above on most of the system, but some segments of track in the Northeast Corridor are too close together for the cars to safely tilt while maintaining FRA minimum space between trains on parallel tracks. Metro-North Railroad restricts tilting on the segment of track north of New York which it owns. The system was originally designed for a 6.8° tilt, but the cars were redesigned wider to accommodate wider seats and aisles that reduced allowable tilt to 4.2° to fit within the clearance constraints of the existing tracks. Traveling at higher than also requires constant-tension catenary, which is only implemented on the more modern catenary system north of New York City. South of New York City, the trains are restricted to . By comparison, the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and the now-defunct &quot;Metroliner&quot; service reached .

&quot;Acela&quot; service was originally expected to begin in late 1999 but was delayed. The catenary system could not support the intended speeds between Washington DC and New York City, but the newer system between New York City and Boston allows the higher speeds. Attention was drawn to the decreased 4.2° tilt, but this was not the root of the speed problem, as the tracks from New York to Boston are similar to those between New York and Washington, and the tilt mechanism is not the factor enabling higher speeds. Following repairs, the first &quot;Acela&quot; service began on December 11, 2000, a year behind schedule.

&quot;Acela&quot; travels between Boston and New York in about three and a half hours (an improvement of half an hour); New York to Washington runs take a minimum of two hours and forty-five minutes. These schedules, as well as the relative convenience of direct downtown-to-downtown rail service as opposed to air travel, especially after the September 11 attacks, have made the &quot;Acela Express&quot; more competitive with the air shuttles. Due to this competition, Southwest Airlines canceled service between Washington and New York.

====Platform track speeds====

Due to the high speed at which &quot;Acela&quot; trains bypass platforms of local stations, concerns have mounted in some communities over inadequate warnings and safeguards for passengers waiting for other trains, including that the two-foot wide yellow platform markings may not keep people at a safe distance. At Kingston station in Rhode Island and Mansfield station in Massachusetts, &quot;Acela&quot; trains pass by at . Suggestions include platform safety barriers, or use of different announcements for approaching &quot;Acela&quot; trains versus slower ones.

===Outages===
In August 2002, shortly after their introduction, &quot;Acela&quot; trainsets were briefly removed from service when the brackets that connected truck (bogie) dampers (shocks) to the powerunit carbodies (&quot;yaw dampers&quot;) were found to be cracking. The &quot;Acela&quot; returned to service when a program of frequent inspections was instituted. The damper brackets have since been redesigned and old brackets replaced by the newer design.

On April 15, 2005, the &quot;Acela&quot; was removed from service when cracks were found in the disc brakes of many passenger coaches. The Bombardier-Alstom consortium replaced the discs under warranty. Limited service resumed in July 2005, as a portion of the fleet operated with new brake discs. &quot;Metroliner&quot; trains, which the &quot;Acela Express&quot; was intended to replace, filled in during the outage. Amtrak announced on September 21, 2005, that all 20 trainsets had been returned to full operation.

In October 2012, &quot;Acela&quot; service was cancelled immediately before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy, which damaged the North River Tunnels causing lasting delays and reliability problems.

In March 2020, all &quot;Acela&quot; trips were suspended as part of a round of service reduction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Amtrak resumed &quot;Acela&quot; service on June 1, 2020.

==Service==

===Composition===
The production sets are formed as follows:

The &quot;Acela Express&quot; trainset consists of two power cars, a Café car, a First Class car, and four Business Class cars, semi-permanently coupled together. It has fewer seats than its regional service counterparts. The First Class car has 44 seats, being three seats across (one on one side, two on the other side), four-seat tables and assigned seating. There are 260 Business Class seats on each trainset; these cars have four seats across (two on each side), four-seat tables, and assigned seating. Baggage may be stowed in overhead compartments or underneath seats. Trains are wheelchair-accessible. Each car has one or two toilets, with one being ADA compliant.

The Business Class car adjacent to First Class is designated as a quiet car, where passengers are asked to refrain from loud talking and phone conversations. Automatic sliding doors between cars reduce noise.

===Operations and staffing===
&quot;Acela&quot; offers two classes of seating, Business Class and First Class. Unlike most other Amtrak trains, Business Class is the &quot;de facto&quot; standard class on &quot;Acela&quot; trains; there is no coach service.

&quot;Acela&quot; maintenance is generally taken care of at the Ivy City facility in Washington, DC; Sunnyside Yard in Queens, New York; or Southampton Street Yard in Boston.

The &quot;Acela&quot; trainsets underwent minor refurbishments between mid-2009 and 2010 at Penn Coach Yard, next to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These refurbishments included new blue leather seats throughout the trainset.

In May 2018, Amtrak announced a 14-month program to refresh the interiors of the &quot;Acela&quot; trainsets, including new seat cushions and covers, new aisle carpeting, and a deep clean. This refurbishment program has been completed as of June 2019.

====Wi-Fi service====
Wireless Internet station service began in 2004. In 2010, with services provided by The GBS Group, all &quot;Acela&quot; trains began offering &quot;AmtrakConnect&quot; supporting IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and standard VPN connections. In 2016, Amtrak upgraded to a faster wifi service.

==== Staffing ====
Generally, Amtrak train crews consist of an engineer, a conductor, and at least one assistant conductor. &quot;Acela&quot; trains also have an On-Board Service crew consisting of two First Class attendants and a Café Car attendant. In addition to the food service provided in the Café Car, on most trains an attendant will also provide at-seat cart service, serving refreshments throughout the train. First Class passengers are served meals at their seats on all services.

==Notable incidents==
* During the Northeast blackout of 2003, a northbound &quot;Acela Express&quot; train was stuck on the Hell Gate Bridge for over nine hours, until a rescue engine from Sunnyside Yard was able to tow the train back to New York&#x27;s Penn Station.
* The first &quot;Acela&quot; grade crossing accident occurred on September 27, 2005, when a car rolled under closed crossing gate arms in Waterford, Connecticut, and was struck by a train traveling at , killing three automobile passengers. None of the 130 &quot;Acela&quot; passengers were injured. The gates were found to have been functioning properly, but the incident drew much criticism regarding the eleven remaining grade crossings along Amtrak&#x27;s busy Northeast Corridor.
* On March 24, 2017, an &quot;Acela Express&quot; train derailed at low speed in New York&#x27;s Penn Station, during morning rush hour. All 248 passengers were safely evacuated. The derailment was caused by a defective section of track, of which Amtrak was aware, but had not yet fixed.
* On February 6, 2018, &quot;Acela Express&quot; train No. 2150 split apart between the first and second cars in the trainset, at , near Havre de Grace, Maryland. There were no injuries of the crew nor the 52 passengers on board, who were transferred to &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; train No. 180.

== Station stops ==
A limited number of Acela trains previously stopped at New Rochelle, New York; New London, Connecticut; and Trenton, New Jersey; service was eliminated in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

<doc id="187964" wikidata="Q3541638" url="?curid=187964" title="Tsugi Takano">
<text>was a female novelist from Hamamatsu in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. She was born in 1890 as the second daughter of a local merchant. In 1904, she entered Hamamatsu Women&#x27;s High School and in 1907 she entered Shizuoko Women&#x27;s High School. However, she was forced to withdraw because of an eye disease. In 1909, at the age of 19, she married newspaper reporter Yasaburō Takano despite the objections of those around her. She moved with her husband to Toyohashi, Fukushima, and Tokyo. In the midst of her husband&#x27;s long unemployment, six of eight of her children succumbed to ill health. She herself fought a long battle with tuberculosis to which she succumbed to in 1943 at the age of 52.

From her time at Hamamatsu Woman&#x27;s High School developed a deepening interest in the writings of female literary circles. In 1922 she published her first novel, . Later, while on her sickbed, she wrote a novel with 11 volumes. Her works urged the calm self-discovery and self-reformation of woman.

There is a stone monument dedicated to Takano at Hamamatsu Municipal High School (the original Hamamatsu Woman&#x27;s High). Inscribed on the monument is one of her poems where she writes about thinking of her home town.

==Works==
Her works include:
* &quot;A grassy hedge&quot;
* &quot;Window&quot;
* &quot;Time&quot;
* &quot;Drying Insects&quot;
