<doc id="197789" wikidata="Q2636053" url="?curid=197789" title="Leader of the House of Commons">
<text>The Leader of the House of Commons is a minister of the Crown of the Government of the United Kingdom whose main role is organising government business in the House of Commons. The Leader is always a member or attendee of the cabinet of the United Kingdom.

The House of Commons devotes approximately three-quarters of its time to debating and explaining government business, such as bills introduced by the government and ministerial statements. The Leader of the House of Commons, with the parties&#x27; chief whips (&quot;the usual channels&quot;), is responsible for organising government business and providing time for non-government (backbench) business to be put before the House of Commons.

The position of leader of the House of Commons is currently held by Lucy Powell, who was appointed on 5 July 2024 by Keir Starmer.

== Responsibilities ==
The current responsibilities of the Leader of the House of Commons are as follows:

*Planning and supervising the Government&#x27;s Legislative Programme;
*Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Business and Legislation;
*Managing the business of the House of Commons and preparing weekly statements on upcoming business;
*Facilitating motions and debate in the Chamber;
*Serving as the Government&#x27;s representative in the House, namely as a voting member of the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission, the Members Estimate Committee, and the Speaker&#x27;s Committee for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority;
*Reforming parliamentary procedure and operations;
*Representing the House of Commons within Government, be it contributing to the Civil Service&#x27;s efforts to build parliamentary capability or receiving MPs&#x27; requests for assistance on ministerial correspondence and questions; and
*Ministerial responsibility for the Privy Council Office.

The Osmotherly Rules, which set out guidance on how civil servants should respond to parliamentary select committees, are jointly updated by the Office of the Leader of the House of Commons and the Cabinet Office.

== History ==

The title was not established until about the middle of the 19th century, although the institution is much older.

Until 1942, the title was usually held by the prime minister if he sat in the House of Commons, however, in more recent years, the title has been held by a separate politician.

The title holder is not formally appointed by the Crown and the title alone does not attract a salary, so is now usually held in addition to a sinecure, currently Lord President of the Council.

== Deputy Leader of the House of Commons ==
From 1922, when the prime minister was also Leader of the House of Commons, day-to-day duties were frequently carried out by a Deputy Leader of the House of Commons. At other times, a Deputy Leader of the House of Commons was appointed merely to enhance an individual politician&#x27;s standing within the government.

The title has been in use since 1942, but was not used from the 2019 dissolution of the Second May ministry to 2022, when it was revived by Boris Johnson. This was shortlived however, as it was abolished by Liz Truss after she became Prime Minister a few months later.

<doc id="197794" wikidata="Q639356" url="?curid=197794" title="Priscillianism">
<text>Priscillianism was a Christian sect developed in the Roman province of Hispania in the 4th century by Priscillian. It is derived from the Gnostic doctrines taught by Marcus, an Egyptian from Memphis. Priscillianism was later considered a heresy by both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.

==History==
Marcus, a native of Memphis in Egypt, came to Spain and taught Gnostic theories. Two of his followers, a Spanish woman named Agape and the rhetorician Helpidius, converted Priscillian, who was a layman &quot;of noble birth, of great riches, bold, restless, eloquent, learned through much reading, very ready at debate and discussion&quot;. Through his oratorical gifts and reputation for extreme asceticism, Priscillian attracted a large following, including Helpidus and two bishops, Instantius and Salvianus. 

They established a new sect as an oath-bound society, attracting the attention of the bishop Hyginus of Cordoba. Hyginus made his fears known to Hydatius, Bishop of Emerita, and Ithacius of Ossonoba. The bishops of Hispania and Aquitaine held a synod at Zaragoza in 380. Though summoned, the Priscillianists refused to appear. The synod pronounced sentence of excommunication against the four leaders, Instantius, Salvianus, Helpidius and Priscillian.

Ithacius was chosen to enforce the synod&#x27;s decrees, but he failed to bring the heretics to terms. In defiance Priscillian was ordained to the priesthood and appointed Bishop of Avila. Ithacius then appealed to the imperial authorities. The emperor Gratian issued a decree which deprived the Priscillianists of their churches and sentenced them to exile. Instantius, Salvianus and Priscillian proceeded to Rome to gain the aid of Pope Damasus I (also from Hispania) in having this sentence revoked. On their journey they were joined by many supporters from Gaul, including a large number of women mentioned in contemporary sources. Reports of improper behavior by their followers and benefactors – possibly fabricated – were circulated against them.

Denied an audience by Pope Damasus, they went to Milan to make a similar request of St. Ambrose, but with the same result. They then resorted to intrigue and bribery at the court with such success that they were not only freed from the sentence of exile, but permitted to regain possession of their churches in Hispania, where, under the patronage of the imperial officials, they enjoyed such power as to compel Ithacius to leave the country. He, in turn, appealed to Gratian, but before anything had been accomplished the emperor was murdered in Lyon, and Magnus Maximus had taken his place.

Maximus treated the matter not as one of ecclesiastical rivalry, but as one of morality and society. As he wished to curry favour with the orthodox bishops and to replenish his treasury through confiscations, the Emperor gave orders for a synod, which was held in Bordeaux in 384. Instantius was first tried and condemned to deposition. Priscillian appealed to the emperor at Trier. Ithacius acted as his accuser and was so vehement in his denunciations that St. Martin of Tours, who was then in Trier, intervened. After expressing his disapproval of bringing an ecclesiastical case before a civil tribunal, he obtained from the emperor a promise not to carry his condemnation to the extent of shedding blood.

After St. Martin had left the city, the emperor appointed the prefect Evodius as judge. He found Priscillian and some others guilty of the crime of magic. This decision was reported to the emperor, who ordered the execution of Priscillian and several of his followers. The property of others was confiscated and they were banished. The conduct of Ithacius was severely criticized. St. Martin, hearing what had taken place, returned to Trier and compelled the emperor to rescind an order to military tribunes, who were on their way to Hispania to extirpate the heresy. The Church did not invoke civil authority to punish heretics. The pope censured not only the actions of Ithacius but also that of the emperor. St. Ambrose was equally stern in his denunciation of the case. Some of the Gallican bishops, who were in Trier under the leadership of Theognistus, broke off communion with Ithacius. He was subsequently deposed from his see by a synod of Hispanic bishops, and his friend and abettor Hydatius was compelled to resign.

After the executions of Priscillian and his followers by the emperor, however, the numbers and zeal of the heretics increased. In 400 another synod was held in Toledo to deal with this problem; many, including bishops Symphonius and Dictinnius, were reconciled to the Church through this synod. Dictinnius was the author of a book &quot;Libra&quot; (Scales), a moral treatise from the Priscillianist viewpoint. The upheaval in the Hispania due to the invasion of the Vandals, the Alans and the Suevi aided the spread of Priscillianism. Paulus Orosius, a Gallaecian priest from northwest Hispania, wrote to St. Augustine (415 CE) to enlist his aid in combating the heresy. Pope Leo I at a later date took active steps for its repression and at his urgent insistence, councils were held in 446 and 447 at Astorga, Toledo and Braga. In spite of these efforts, the sect continued to spread during the fifth century. In the following century it began to decline. After the First Council of Braga (561), which specifically targeted its doctrines, it soon died out.

==Teaching==

The Priscillianists taught a Gnostic doctrine of dualism, a belief in the existence of two kingdoms, one of Light and one of Darkness. Angels and the souls of men were said to be severed from the substance of the Deity. Human souls were intended to conquer the Kingdom of Darkness, but fell and were imprisoned in material bodies. Thus both kingdoms were represented in man. Their conflict was symbolized on the side of Light by the Twelve Patriarchs, heavenly spirits, who corresponded to certain of man&#x27;s powers, and on the side of Darkness by the Signs of the Zodiac, the symbols of matter and the lower kingdom. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter. The twelve heavenly spirits having failed to accomplish their release, the Saviour came in a heavenly body that appeared to be like that of other men. Through His doctrine and His apparent death, he released the souls of the men from the influence of earthly matter.
These doctrines could be harmonized with the teaching of Scripture only by a complex system of exegesis, rejecting conventional interpretations and relying on personal inspiration. The Priscillians respected most of the Old Testament but rejected the Creation story. They believed that several of the apocryphal Scriptures were genuine and inspired. Because the Priscillians believe that matter and nature were evil, they became ascetics and fasted on Sundays and Christmas Day. Because their doctrines were esoteric and exoteric, and because it was believed that men in general could not understand the higher paths, the Priscillianists, or at least those of them who were enlightened, were permitted to tell lies for the sake of a holy end. Augustine wrote a famous work, &quot;Contra Mendacium&quot; (&quot;Against Lying&quot;), in reaction to this doctrine.

==Writings and rediscovery==

Some writings by Priscillian were accounted Orthodox and were not burned. For instance, he divided the Pauline epistles (including the Epistle to the Hebrews) into a series of texts based on their theological points and wrote an introduction to each section. These &quot;canons&quot; survived in a form edited by Peregrinus. They contain a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including celibacy and abstinence from meat and wine. The charismatic gifts of all believers are equally affirmed. Study of scripture is urged. Priscillian placed considerable weight on the deuterocanonical books of the Bible, not as being inspired but as helpful in discerning truth and error; however, several of the books were considered to be genuine and inspired.

It was long thought that all the writings of Priscillian himself had perished, but in 1885, Georg Schepss discovered at the University of Würzburg eleven genuine tracts, published as &quot;Priscilliani quae supersunt&quot;. Edited by Georg Schepss. (Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum, 18.) Vienna, 1889. Though they bear Priscillian&#x27;s name, four describing Priscillian&#x27;s trial appear to have been written by a close follower.

According to Raymond Brown&#x27;s &quot;Epistle of John&quot;, the source of the &quot;Comma Johanneum&quot; appears to be the Latin book &quot;Liber Apologeticus&quot; by Priscillian.

== Zoroastrian influence ==
The potential influence of Zoroastrian thought on Priscillianism remains a matter of scholarly debate. While direct evidence of Persian religious influence in 4th-century Hispania is limited, several scholars have identified theological parallels between Priscillianist and Zoroastrian concepts.

=== Contemporary Accusations ===
Jerome, in his Letter to Ctesiphon, provides one of the most direct contemporary sources linking Priscillianism to Zoroastrian practices. Writing as part of a polemic against Pelagius and his followers, Jerome describes Priscillian as &quot;a most devoted student of the magus Zoroaster&quot; (Zoroastris magi studiosissimum) who &quot;from a magus became bishop.&quot; This characterization appears within a catalog of heretical pairs, where Jerome positions Priscillian as a successor to Agape and Elpidius.

The connection to Zoroastrian practices in Jerome&#x27;s account may have been influenced by Orosius&#x27; earlier report of Priscillian&#x27;s interest in astrology.

=== Theological Parallels ===
Analysis of the Würzburg Tractates identifies astrological elements in Priscillian&#x27;s teachings that show similarities to Zoroastrian priestly traditions, particularly in their understanding of celestial bodies&#x27; spiritual significance. These elements demonstrate sophisticated cosmological frameworks that parallel Persian models.

The movement&#x27;s dualistic tendencies, often criticized by orthodox Christians as Manichaean, may indicate earlier Zoroastrian influences. Burrus argues that while Priscillianism&#x27;s dualism was less absolute than that found in Manichaeism, it shows distinct patterns that could suggest indirect Zoroastrian sources. The emphasis on the struggle between light and darkness in Priscillian&#x27;s theology bears notable similarities to Zoroastrian concepts of cosmic conflict.

=== Historical context ===
Archaeological evidence from late Roman Hispania shows trading connections with the East, providing possible channels for Persian religious ideas.[8] However, Van Dam suggests that many of Priscillianism&#x27;s apparently &quot;eastern&quot; elements could be explained by broader ascetic trends in late antique Christianity.

Jerome&#x27;s association of Priscillian with Zoroastrian practices reflects a common late antique heresiological strategy of linking heterodox Christian movements to &quot;eastern&quot; or &quot;Persian&quot; influences. While this does not necessarily demonstrate direct Zoroastrian influence on Priscillianism, it shows that such connections were perceived or constructed by contemporary critics.

<doc id="197798" wikidata="Q895401" url="?curid=197798" title="Bowdoin College">
<text>Bowdoin College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Brunswick, Maine. Chartered in 1794, the college offers 35 majors and 40 minors, as well as several joint engineering programs with Columbia, Caltech, Dartmouth College, and the University of Maine.

The college was a founding member of its athletic conference, the New England Small College Athletic Conference, and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium, an athletic conference and inter-library exchange with Bates College and Colby College. Bowdoin has over 30 varsity teams, and the school mascot was selected as a polar bear in 1913 to honor Robert Peary, a Bowdoin alumnus who led the first successful expedition to the North Pole. Between the years 1821 and 1921, Bowdoin operated a medical school called the &quot;Medical School of Maine.&quot;

The main Bowdoin campus is located near Casco Bay and the Androscoggin River. In addition to its Brunswick campus, Bowdoin owns a coastal studies center on Orr&#x27;s Island and a scientific field station on Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy.

== History ==

===Founding and 19th century===
Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794 by the Massachusetts State Legislature and was later redirected under the jurisdiction of the Maine Legislature. It was named for former Massachusetts governor James Bowdoin, whose son James Bowdoin III was an early benefactor.

Bowdoin began to develop in the 1820s, a decade in which Maine became an independent state as a result of the Missouri Compromise and graduated U.S. President Franklin Pierce. The college also graduated two literary philosophers, the writers Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, both of whom graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1825. Pierce and Hawthorne began an official militia company called the &#x27;Bowdoin Cadets&#x27;.The Phi Beta Kappa Society was active at Bowdoin College before the Civil War. It had several anti-slavery people speak at the Society.

From its founding, Bowdoin was known to educate the sons of the political elite and &quot;catered very largely to the wealthy conservative from the state of Maine.&quot; During the first half of the 19th century, Bowdoin required of its students a certificate of &quot;good moral character&quot; as well as knowledge of Latin and Ancient Greek, geography, algebra, and the major works of Cicero, Xenophon, Virgil and Homer.

Harriet Beecher Stowe started writing her influential anti-slavery novel, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, in Brunswick while her husband was teaching at the college, and Brigadier General (and Brevet Major General) Joshua Chamberlain, a Bowdoin alumnus and professor, was present at the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House in 1865. Chamberlain, a Medal of Honor recipient who later served as governor of Maine, adjutant-general of Maine, and president of Bowdoin, fought at Gettysburg, where he was in command of the 20th Maine in defense of Little Round Top. Major General Oliver Otis Howard, class of 1850, led the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau after the war and later founded Howard University; Massachusetts Governor John Andrew, class of 1837, was responsible for the formation of the 54th Massachusetts; and William P. Fessenden (1823) and Hugh McCulloch (1827) both served as Secretary of the Treasury during the Lincoln Administration.

With strained slave-relations between political parties, President Franklin Pierce appointed Jefferson Davis as his Secretary of War, and the college awarded the soon-to-be President of the Confederacy an honorary degree. The Jefferson Davis Award was given to a student who excelled in legal studies after a donation was given to the college by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The award, however, was discontinued in 2015, with the current college president citing it as inappropriate because it was named after someone &quot;whose mission was to preserve and institutionalize slavery&quot;.

===20th century===
Although Bowdoin&#x27;s Medical School of Maine closed its doors in 1921, it produced Augustus Stinchfield, who received his M.D. in 1868 and became one of the co-founders of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. In 1877, the college would go on to graduate Charles Morse, the American banker who established a near-monopoly of the ice business in New York, which directly led to the financial Panic of 1907.

The college went on to educate and eventually graduate Arctic explorers Robert E. Peary, class of 1877, and Donald B. MacMillan, class of 1898. Robert Peary named Bowdoin Fjord and Bowdoin Glacier after his alma mater. Peary led the first successful expedition to the North Pole in 1908, and MacMillan, a member of Peary&#x27;s crew, explored Greenland, Baffin Island, and Labrador in the schooner &quot;Bowdoin&quot; between 1908 and 1954.

Wallace H. White, Jr., class of 1899, served as Senate Minority Leader from 1944 to 1947 and Senate Majority Leader from 1947 to 1949; George J. Mitchell, class of 1954, served as Senate Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995 before assuming an active role in the Northern Ireland peace process.

In 1970, the college became one of a very limited number of liberal arts colleges to make the SAT optional in the admissions process, and in 1971, after nearly 180 years as a small men&#x27;s college, Bowdoin admitted its first class of women. On February 28, 1997 Bowdoin&#x27;s Board of Trustees approved a plan to phase out fraternities on campus, replacing them with a system of college-owned social houses.

In 1970, Bowdoin began competing in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium, with Bates and Colby. The consortium became both an athletic rivalry and an academic exchange program.

===21st century===
On January 18, 2008, Bowdoin announced that it would eliminate loans for all new and current students receiving financial aid, replacing those loans with grants beginning with the 2008–2009 academic year. President Barry Mills stated, &quot;Some see a calling in such vital but often low paying fields such as teaching or social work. With significant debt at graduation, some students will undoubtedly be forced to make career or education choices not based on their talents, interests, and promise in a particular field but rather on their capacity to repay student loans. As an institution devoted to the common good, Bowdoin must consider the fairness of such a result.&quot;

In February 2009, following a US$10 million donation (equivalent to $ million in ) by Subway co-founder and alumnus Peter Buck, class of 1952, the college completed a $250-million capital campaign. Additionally, the college has also recently completed major construction projects on the campus, including a renovation of the college&#x27;s art museum and a new fitness center named after Peter Buck.

On July 1, 2015, Clayton Rose succeeded Mills as president. Eight years later, on July 1, 2023, Safa Zaki succeeded Rose as the first woman ever to assume presidency of the college.

In February 2025, the first pro-Palestinian encampment during the second Trump administration began when students occupied the Smith Union building to demand that the university divest from arms manufacturers. The encampment came after Trump&#x27;s comments on occupying Gaza and a perceived lack of action following an Israel divestment referendum passed by the student body a year prior.

==Admissions==
The acceptance rate for the class of 2028 was 7%. The college received just over 13,200 applications for the class of 2028 – the highest application numbers in the college&#x27;s history and a continuation of the rise in applications over the past two years. Applications increased by 21%, surpassing the 10,930 applications received in the class of 2027.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; classifies Bowdoin as &quot;most selective&quot;. Of enrolling students, 89% are in the top 10% of their high school graduating class. Although Bowdoin does not require the SAT in admissions, all students may submit a score upon application. The middle 50% SAT range for the verbal and math sections of the SAT is 660–750 and 660–750, respectively—numbers of only those submitting scores during the admissions process. The middle 50% ACT range is 30–33.

The April 17, 2008, edition of &quot;The Economist&quot; noted Bowdoin in an article on university admissions: &quot;So-called &#x27;almost-Ivies&#x27; such as Bowdoin and Middlebury also saw record low admission rates this year (18% each). It is now as hard to get into Bowdoin, says the college&#x27;s admissions director, as it was to get into Princeton in the 1970s.&quot; Many students apply for financial aid, and around 85% of those who apply to receive aid. Bowdoin is a need-blind and no-loans institution. While a significant portion of the student body hails from New England—including nearly 25% from Massachusetts and 10% from Maine—recent classes have drawn from an increasingly national and international pool. The median family income of Bowdoin students is $195,900, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% of highest-earning families and 17.5% from the bottom 60%. Although Bowdoin once had a reputation for homogeneity (both ethnically and socioeconomically), a diversity campaign has increased the percentage of students of color in recent classes to more than 31%. In fact, admission of minorities goes back at least as far as John Brown Russwurm 1826, Bowdoin&#x27;s first Black college graduate and the third Black graduate of any American college.

==Academics==
Course distribution requirements were abolished in the 1970s but were reinstated by a faculty majority vote in 1981 due to an initiative by oral communication and film professor Barbara Kaster. She insisted that distribution requirements would ensure students a more well-rounded education in a diversity of fields and therefore present them with more career possibilities. The requirements of at least two courses in each of the categories of Natural Sciences/mathematics, social and behavioral sciences, humanities/Fine Arts, and foreign studies (including languages) took effect for the class of 1987 and have been gradually amended since then. Current requirements require one course each in natural sciences, quantitative reasoning, visual and performing arts, international perspectives, and difference, power, and inequity. A small writing-intensive course, called a first-year seminar, is also required. The most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Political Science and Government (82)
::Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (61)
::Biology/Biological Sciences (30)
::Biochemistry (28)
::Neuroscience (25)
::English Language and Literature (25)
::Mathematics (25)

In 1990, the Bowdoin faculty voted to change the four-level grading system to the traditional A, B, C, D, and F system. The previous system, consisting of high honors, honors, pass, and fail, was devised primarily to de-emphasize the importance of grades and to reduce competition. In 2002, the faculty decided to change the grading system to incorporate plus and minus grades. In 2006, Bowdoin was named a &quot;Top Producer of Fulbright Awards for American Students&quot; by the Institute of International Education.

Other notable Bowdoin faculty include (or have included): Edville Gerhardt Abbott, Charles Beitz, John Bisbee, Paul Chadbourne, Thomas Cornell, Kristen R. Ghodsee, Eddie Glaude, Joseph E. Johnson, Richard Morgan, Elliott Schwartz, Kenneth Chenault, and Scott Sehon.

===Rankings===
In the 2024 edition of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, Bowdoin was ranked tied at 5th best overall among liberal arts colleges in the United States, tied at 6th for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;, 7th in &quot;Best Value Schools&quot;, and tied at 30th for &quot;Most Innovative Schools&quot;.

In the 2022 &quot;Forbes&quot; college rankings, Bowdoin was ranked 48th overall among 498 universities, liberal arts colleges, and service academies and 7th among private liberal arts colleges.

Bowdoin College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

Bowdoin was ranked first among 1,204 small colleges in the U.S. by Niche in 2017, but has since fallen to 6th.

Based on students&#x27; SAT scores, Bowdoin is tied with Williams for 5th in Business Insider&#x27;s smartest liberal arts colleges, with an average score of 1435 for math and critical reading combined. Among all colleges, it is tied with Brown, Carnegie Mellon, and Williams for 22nd.

The college was ranked 5th in the country by &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; in 2019 based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

In 2006, &quot;Newsweek&quot; described Bowdoin as a &quot;New Ivy&quot;, one of a number of liberal arts colleges and universities outside of the Ivy League, and it has also been dubbed a &quot;Hidden Ivy&quot;.

==Student life==
Bowdoin&#x27;s dining services have been ranked No. 1 among all universities and colleges nationally by &quot;Princeton Review&quot; in 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporting: &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for the trays, and for the fact that most diners are under 25, you&#x27;d think it was a restaurant.&quot;

Bowdoin uses food from its organic garden in its two major dining halls, and every academic year begins with a lobster bake outside Farley Fieldhouse.

Recalling his days at Bowdoin in a 2005 interview, Professor Richard E. Morgan (class of 1959) described student life at the then-all-male school as &quot;monastic&quot; and noted that &quot;the only things to do were either work or drink&quot;. This is corroborated by the &quot;Official Preppy Handbook,&quot; which in 1980 ranked Bowdoin the number two drinking school in the country, behind Dartmouth. These days, Morgan observed, the college offers a far broader array of recreational opportunities: &quot;If we could have looked forward in time to Bowdoin&#x27;s standard of living today, we would have been astounded.&quot;

Since abolishing Greek fraternities in the late 1990s, Bowdoin has switched to a system in which entering students are assigned a &quot;college house&quot; affiliation correlating with their first-year dormitory. While six houses were originally established following the construction of two new dorms, two were added effective in the fall of 2007, and one added in the fall of 2019, bringing the current total to eight: Baxter, Quinby, MacMillan, Howell, Helmreich, Reed, Burnett, and Boody-Johnson. The college houses are physical buildings around campus that host parties and other events throughout the year. Those students who choose not to live in their affiliated house retain their affiliation and are considered members throughout their Bowdoin career.

===Clubs===
The largest student group on campus is the Outing Club, which leads canoeing, kayaking, rafting, camping, and backpacking trips throughout Maine. One of the school&#x27;s two historic rival literary societies, The Peucinian Society, has recently been revitalized from its previous form. The Peucinian Society was founded in 1805. This organization counts such people as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain among its former members. The other, the now-defunct Athenian Society, included Nathaniel Hawthorne and Franklin Pierce as members.

Bowdoin competes in the Standard Platform League of RoboCup as the Northern Bites, where teams compete with five autonomous Aldebaran Nao robots. Bowdoin won the world championship in RoboCup 2007, beating Carnegie Mellon University, and finished 2nd in the 2015 US Open.

====Media and publications====
Bowdoin&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Bowdoin Orient&quot;, is the oldest continuously published college weekly in the United States. The Orient was named the second-best tabloid-sized college weekly at a Collegiate Associated Press conference in March 2007 and the best college newspaper in New England by the New England Society of News Editors in 2018.

The school&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;The Quill&quot;, was published between 1897 and 2015. &quot;The Bowdoin Globalist&quot;, an international news, culture, and politics magazine affiliated with the Global21 organization of college magazines, has been publishing since 2012. &quot;The Bowdoin Globalist&quot; transitioned to a digital-only platform in 2015 and changed its name to &quot;The Bowdoin Review&quot;. The college&#x27;s radio station, WBOR, has been operating since the early 1940s. In 1999, &quot;The Bowdoin Cable Network&quot; was formed, producing a weekly newscast and several student-created shows per semester.

==== &quot;A cappella&quot; ====
Six &quot;a cappella&quot; groups are on campus; the Meddiebempsters are the oldest. Founded in the spring of 1937, the Meddies performed in USO shows after World War II.

== Environmental record ==

Bowdoin College signed onto the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment in 2007. The college followed through with a carbon neutrality plan released in 2009, with 2020 as the target year for carbon neutrality. According to the plan, general improvements to Maine&#x27;s electricity grid will account for 7% of carbon reductions, commuting improvements will account for 1%, and the purchase of renewable energy credits will account for 41%. The plan includes the construction of a solar thermal system, part of the &quot;Thorne Solar Hot Water Project&quot;; cogeneration in the central heating plant (for which Bowdoin received $400,000 in federal grants); lighting upgrades to all campus buildings; and modern monitoring systems of energy usage on campus. In 2017, the college was on track to meet the 28% own source reduction target, and efforts have continued in the areas of energy conservation, efficiency upgrades and transitioning to lower carbon fuel sources. Bowdoin&#x27;s facilities are heated by an on-campus heating plant that burns natural gas.

Between 2002 and 2008, Bowdoin College decreased its CO2 emissions by 40%. It achieved that reduction by switching from No. 6 to No. 2 oil in its heating plant, reducing the campus set heating point from 72 to 68 degrees, and by adhering to its own Green Design Standards in renovations. In addition, Bowdoin runs a single stream recycling program, and its dining services department has begun composting food waste and unbleached paper napkins. Bowdoin received an overall &quot;B−&quot; grade for its sustainability efforts on the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.

In 2003, Bowdoin committed to achieving LEED-certification for all new campus buildings. The college has since completed construction on Osher and West residency halls, the Peter Buck Center for Health &amp; Fitness, the Sidney J. Watson Arena, 216 Maine Street, and 52 Harpswell all of which have attained LEED, Silver LEED or Gold LEED certification. The new dorms partially use collected rainwater as part of an advanced flushing system.

==Campus==

===Brunswick main campus===

Bowdoin College&#x27;s main campus in Brunswick ranges over an area of and includes 120 buildings, some of which date back to the 18th century. Prominent buildings on the campus include the college&#x27;s oldest building, Massachusetts Hall, the Parker Cleaveland House, and the Harriet Beecher Stowe House. The campus has two museums. The Bowdoin College Museum of Art is in the Walker Art Building and the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum is in the Gibbons Center for Arctic Studies.

===Other properties===
The Schiller Coastal Studies Center is located south of Orr&#x27;s Island in Harpswell, Maine.

Bowdoin College operates the Bowdoin Scientific Station on Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick.

==Athletics==

Organized athletics at Bowdoin began in 1828 with a gymnastics program established by the &quot;father of athletics in Maine&quot;, John Neal. In the proceeding years, Neal agitated for more programs, and himself taught bowling, boxing, and other sports.

Bowdoin College teams are known as the Polar Bears. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level, primarily competing in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), of which they were a founding member in 1971.

The mascot for all Bowdoin College athletic teams is the Polar bear, generally referred to in the plural, i.e., &quot;The Polar Bears.&quot; The uniform color is white. The fight song, &quot;Forward The White&quot;, was composed by Kenneth A. Robinson, class of 1914.

The college&#x27;s rowing club competes in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Chase Regatta annually. The rowing club also competes as a member of the American Collegiate Rowing Association; the women&#x27;s team won its first national championship in 2023. The field hockey team are four-time NCAA Division III National Champions; winning the title in 2007 (defeating Middlebury College), 2008 (defeating Tufts University), 2010 (defeating Messiah College), and 2013 (defeating Salisbury University). The men&#x27;s tennis team won the 2016 NCAA Division III Championship after defeating Emory University in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Principal athletic facilities include Whittier Field (capacity: 9,000), Morrell Gymnasium (1,500), Sidney J. Watson Arena (2,300), Pickard Fields, and the Buck Center for Health and Wellness.

==Notable alumni==


Bowdoin graduates have led all three branches of the American federal government, including both houses of Congress. Franklin Pierce (1824) was America&#x27;s fourteenth President; Melville Weston Fuller (1853) served as Chief Justice of the United States; Thomas Brackett Reed (1860) was twice elected Speaker of the House of Representatives; and Wallace H. White, Jr. (1899) and George J. Mitchell (1954) both served as Majority Leader of the United States Senate.

<text>The Engadin or Engadine (; ; ; ) is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps in the canton of Graubünden in southeasternmost Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn () from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, little less than one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Danube, making it the only Swiss river to drain into the Black Sea. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities.

==Name==
In English, the valley is known as either &quot;Engadin&quot; (, ) or &quot;Engadine&quot; ( , ).

The Romansh toponym &quot;Engiadina&quot; was first attested as Latin &quot;vallis Eniatina&quot; in AD 930. A derivation from the reconstructed ethnonym *&quot;Eniates&quot; (with a Celtic suffix &quot;-ates&quot; denoting &quot;settlers, inhabitants&quot;, as in &quot;Licates&quot; or &quot;Atrebates&quot;) has been suggested, with the first part of the ethnonym in turn containing the name of the En (&quot;Aenus (Enus)&quot;). By that derivation the name would mean .

Especially in touristic and advertising contexts, the meaning of the name is widely given as &quot;garden of the Inn&quot;, presumably based on an incorrect folk etymology involving the Italian word &quot;&quot;. The Romansh languages retain descendants of Latin &quot;&quot; to refer to a garden, namely &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, and not the ultimately Germanic loanword found in modern-day French and Italian.

==Geography==

The Engadine lies at the southeasternmost end of Switzerland and at the western end of the Eastern Alps, and constitutes the Swiss part of the -long valley drained by the En/Inn until it turns northeast again after a large bend to northwest just before Landeck in Austria. The Austrian part is simply called the &quot;Inntal&quot; (Inn Valley). From the Maloja Pass () to the border of Tyrol, just before the Schergenbach, coming from Samnaun, enters the Inn, it runs for the whole Swiss length of , always above in elevation.

The Engadine is connected by the Julier, Albula, and Flüela Passes and the Vereina Tunnel to the northern part of Switzerland and the rest of the canton of Grisons. It can be reached from northern Italy by the Maloja Pass to the west and the Bernina Pass to the south. Via the Pass dal Fuorn () it connects to the southern Val Müstair () and further south over the border to the Val Venosta () in Italy.
The highest mountains in the wider area of the Engadine are in the Bernina Range in the southwestern part. The formation of the Engadine is linked to the activity of the Engadine Line.

The Engadine is traditionally divided into two parts:

# The Upper Engadine, from Maloja Pass to the dell near Brail, in the west, where the valley stays fairly flat and is remarkably wide (up to ) as far as S-chanf. Its major center is St. Moritz and very bustling during touristic peak seasons, winter and summer. The traditionally spoken Romansh idiom in the Upper Engadine is called Putèr.
# The Lower Engadine, from Brail to the Austrian border in the far east, where the Inn drops more quickly, runs now more eastwards after Susch, the valley becomes narrower and steeper, and the En&#x27;s path is more tortuous, the area is much more secluded and therefore more quiet; its major center is Scuol (). The traditionally spoken Romansh idiom in the Lower Engadine is called Vallader.

===Upper Engadine===

The Upper Engadine (; ) begins at the Maloja mountain pass () in the southwest with a subsequent chain of lakes running southwest–northeast: Lej da Segl (, ), Lej da Silvaplauna (, ), both famous for windsurfing, and Lej da San Murezzan (; , ). To the southwestern side, the Maloja Pass drops precipitously down to the Italian spoken Val Bregaglia () and then over the Swiss-Italian border further down to Chiavenna (), and thence southwards to Como. Near the Lunghin Pass (), northwest from and above Maloja, lies the most notable triple watershed in Western Europe, from where the water flows via the Inn and then via the Danube to the Black Sea, via the Maira and then via the Po to the Mediterranean Sea, and via the Gelgia and then via the Rhine to the North Sea.

The resort of St. Moritz at around sits on Lej da San Murezzan. It was the host city for the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics. There are numerous ski resorts in the area served by the ski areas of Piz Corvatsch and Piz Nair.


Northeast of St. Moritz lies the village of Samedan, which is the capital of the Upper Engadine. Near Samedan, the river Flaz joins the Inn from the south and the valley opens into a wide meadow framed with mountains. The Flaz is a major tributary which flows north, down the Val Bernina starting in Pontresina at the confluence of the Ova da Roseg and Ova da Bernina. Here, on the flat between those two rivers one also finds the Engadin Airport.

The highest mountain in the wider area of the Engadine – and in the Eastern Alps – is Piz Bernina, which is high and southeast of St. Moritz.

Further down from Samedan to the northeast are a number of villages lying on the banks of the Inn. One of it is Zuoz (), which is a village of typical Engadine houses, with large, thick stone and masonry walls, funnel-shaped windows, and wall paintings called sgraffito. These houses are large and are traditionally shared by two or more families, and they may have what used to be a stable or livestock area underneath. In a typical Engadine village, there are numerous fountains, free-flowing all year round, which were formerly used for drinking water, washing, and for watering livestock.

The red trains by Rhaetian Railways (RhB) connects St. Moritz with Samedan and runs mainly on a north–south axis via the Albula Tunnel to the north and connects the Upper Engadine via Filisur and Thusis with Chur, the capital of the canton and consequently with the rest of Switzerland, and to the south via the Bernina Pass (, the highest traverse of a train in Europe) through the Val Bernina on its northern side and the Swiss but Italian spoken Val Poschiavo on its southern side with Tirano in Italy.

The RhB also connects the Upper Engadine with the Lower Engadine as far as Scuol, and connects the Lower Engadine since 1999 via the Vereina Tunnel to Klosters and the Prätigau; another connection to the rest of Switzerland. In the summer, the Albula Pass is also open for car travel. The Julier Pass, north above St. Moritz, connects the Engadine with the rest of Graubünden for the whole year. Regular Swiss PostBus lines connects the Upper Engadine with the Val Bregaglia, Chiavenna in Italy, and even further to Lugano in Switzerland again in the west.

Immediately next to northeast of Zuoz is the village of S-chanf, which is the end of the large flat meadows next to the Inn. Every year, there is a famous mass-cross-country ski race called the Engadin Skimarathon from Maloja, across the frozen lakes and over the open meadows and ending in S-chanf; 11&#x27;000 to 13&#x27;000 skiers participate every year.

Below S-chanf the landscape suddenly changes. The Inn, now rather wild, flows through a deep gorge with steep walls and meadows give way to larch woods. At Zernez, the Inn valley opens up again for a short distance. In Zernez () the Fuorn Pass goes south, passing through the Val del Spöl on its north side, where one part of the Swiss National Park is also to be found, to the Romansh-speaking Val Müstair () on its south side.

The border between the Upper and Lower Engadine is at the dell near Brail.

===Lower Engadine===

With Brail the Lower Engadine (; ) begins. Here the villages are no longer located on the valley floor, with the exception of Zernez, but higher up on sunny terraces formed during glacial periods.

In contrast to the elevated plain of the Upper Engadine, where the upper reaches of the En flow gently down the valley, the geological background of the Lower Engadine forms a very different landscape. The right flank of the valley, the Lower Engadine Dolomites, is highly jagged, densely forested and steep. Glaciers and rivers have marked the left side of the valley in many different ways, where the geological structure has allowed for the formation of a fairly broad valley floor and softly rising, rounded landscape features with high-lying terraces, which is where most of the villages - with the notable exception of the main town Scuol - are located.
To the north, another train route connects the Lower Engadine with Klosters (and Davos) in the Prätigau via the recently built Vereina Tunnel. And further via Landquart to Chur or Zürich. The capital of the Lower Engadine is the ski and spa resort Scuol at around . At the very end of the Engadine, a curvaceous mountain road through the deep gorge-like Val da Tschera, not build before 1912, connects to the remote, very secluded and duty-free ski resort Samnaun, which shares a huge ski area with Austrian Ischgl.

Samnaun, as well as all larger and even most smaller villages in the main valley or its side valleys, is connected by regular PostBus Switzerland services with RhB stations either in Scuol or any other stop further up the main valley. Regular bus services connects Scuol also via Martina and the Austrian Pfunds with the Landeck-Zams in the Tyrolian Upper Inn Valley (). Here you meet the main railway line between Zürich – Innsbruck – Salzburg – Vienna. PostBus Switzerland also connects the main valley from Zernez with the Val Müstair or even further to the South-Tyrolian Mals, and by an Italian bus service back to the Lower Engadine via Martina, or vice versa.

==Demographics==

In the Upper Engadine, as a result of the strong influx of people related to tourism, mainly from outside of Switzerland (mainly from Italy, Austria, Germany), the number of (Swiss) German and Italian speakers outnumber Romansh speakers, and in the heavily touristed village of St. Moritz there are few Romansh speakers to be found. In the Lower Engadine, Romansch is still the most widely spoken language, but almost all of the people also speak the Grisonian Swiss German and (the Swiss variety of) Standard German as a second and third language. Most place signs in both the Upper and Lower Engadine show both languages (German/Italian and Romansh), e.g. St. Moritz - San Murezzan, Sils - Segl, Celerina - Schlarigna.

== Tourism ==
=== History of tourism ===
St. Moritz is a major resort of the Alps. Tourism started in the 19th century. It is also one of the oldest winter sport resorts in the world, being popular in winter since 1864.

In the Lower Engadine tourism became important in 1913 with the opening of the train station in Scuol, since then it has been well connected to the rest of Switzerland.
In 1369 the mineral sources in Scuol were mentioned for the first time but the health benefits were known even earlier. The most important tourism attraction is the Bogn Engiadina Scuol inaugurated in 1993. With 80 km of courses, the inauguration of the Motta Naluns ski area in 1956 was another important date in the history of tourism in Scuol.

Further, the opening of the Vereina tunnel in 1999 reduced the trip length from Zürich to Scuol considerably so now it is possible to do a one-day trip to Scuol, visit the Bogn Engiadina and return in the evening.

==Traditions==

Though no one knows how far back it dates, the traditional winter horse-drawn sleigh ride takes place every winter. Many of the sleighs once came from local families who have been living in the area over many generations. The fact that their carriages go as far back as they do, helps to identify the tradition as one that has possibly been around for centuries.

The (&quot;sleigh ride&quot;; ) is composed of many sleighs, each carrying a young woman and a young man paired up by a lottery, and one sleigh carrying a musician or group of musicians to serenade the riders and the accompanying audience.

Typical black and red Engadine dress is used by the townspeople and the horses are decorated with plumage and trimmings in addition to the bells. Throughout the day-long ride, stops, that have been planned ahead of time, are made where eating, dancing, and drinking occur. At the end of the night, the young woman&#x27;s companion (who had been selected by lottery) is invited to her home for more celebratory dining.

==Local cuisine==
The Engadine cuisine has not lost its originality. This regional cuisine is characterized by the use of selected local spices which have the rare ability to infuse a dish with a certain Engadine taste. In general, the basic ingredients of the dishes are quite elementary, using potatoes and meat because the Engadine farmers of former times had a hard daily working life. Additionally, expensive ingredients were not available to the mainly poor farmers. Because of the local way of preparation, dishes vary from kitchen to kitchen and village to village.

One of the most well-known foods associated to this region is the Bündner Nusstorte, also known as Engadiner Nusstorte, which is a traditional sweet, caramelised nut-filled pastry (generally walnut).

<text>Ella Maillart (or Ella K. Maillart; 20 February 1903, Geneva – 27 March 1997, Chandolin) was a Swiss adventurer, travel writer and photographer, as well as a sportswoman.

== Early life ==
Ella ‘Kini’ Maillart was the second child, born to a wealthy fur trader from Geneva. Her father was Swiss and her mother was Danish. At the age of 20 she and a friend sailed from Cannes to Corsica, then to Sardinia, Sicily and Greece. She competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics as a sailor in the Olympic monotype competition where she was the only female competitor and finished ninth out of 17. At this time she was also the captain of the Swiss Women&#x27;s field hockey team and was an international skier. 

==Career==

From the 1930s onwards she spent years exploring Muslim republics of the USSR, as well as other parts of Asia, and published a rich series of books which, just as her photographs, are today considered valuable historical testimonies. Her early books were written in French but later she began to write in English. &quot;Turkestan Solo&quot; describes a journey in 1932 in Soviet Turkestan. Photos from this journey are now displayed in the Ella Maillart wing of the Karakol Historical Museum. In 1934, the French daily &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot; sent her to Manchuria to report on the situation under the Japanese occupation. It was there that she met Peter Fleming, a well-known writer and correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, with whom she would team up to cross China from Peking to Srinagar (3,500 miles), much of the route being through hostile desert regions and steep Himalayan passes. The journey started in February 1935 and took seven months to complete, involving travel by train, on lorries, on foot, horse and camelback. Their objective was to ascertain what was happening in Xinjiang (then also known as Sinkiang or Chinese Turkestan) where the Kumul Rebellion had just ended. Maillart and Fleming met the Hui Muslim forces of General Ma Hushan. Ella Maillart later recorded this trek in her book &quot;Forbidden Journey&quot;, while Peter Fleming&#x27;s parallel account is found in his &quot;News from Tartary&quot;. In 1937 Maillart returned to Asia for &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot; to report on Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey, while in 1939 she undertook a trip from Geneva to Kabul by car, in the company of fellow Swiss writer, Annemarie Schwarzenbach. &quot;The Cruel Way&quot; is the title of Maillart&#x27;s book about this experience, cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War.

She spent the war years at Tiruvannamalai in the South of India, learning from different teachers about Advaita Vedanta, one of the schools of Hindu philosophy. On her return to Switzerland in 1945, she lived in Geneva and at Chandolin, a mountain village in the Swiss Alps. She continued to ski until late in life and last returned to Tibet in 1986. She was pioneer of color photography before the Second World War.

==Legacy==
Ella Maillart&#x27;s manuscripts and documents are kept at the Bibliothèque de Genève (Library of the City of Geneva), her photographic work is deposited at the Musée de l&#x27;Élysée in Lausanne, and her documentary films (on Afghanistan, Nepal and South India) are part of the collection of the Swiss Film Archive in Lausanne, Switzerland.

<doc id="197810" wikidata="Q1433006" url="?curid=197810" title="Flooring">
<text>Flooring is the general term for a permanent covering of a floor, or for the work of installing such a floor covering. Floor covering is a term to generically describe any finish material applied over a floor structure to provide a walking surface. Both terms are used interchangeably but floor covering refers more to loose-laid materials.

Materials almost always classified as flooring include carpet, laminate, tile, and vinyl.

==Subfloor==
The floor under the flooring is called the subfloor, which provides the support for the flooring. Special purpose subfloors like floating floors, raised floors or sprung floors may be laid upon another underlying subfloor which provides the structural strength. Subfloors that are below grade (underground) or ground level floors in buildings without basements typically have a concrete subfloor. Subfloors above grade (above ground) typically have a plywood subfloor. 

==Flooring materials==
The choice of materials for floor covering is affected by factors such as cost, endurance, noise insulation, comfort, and cleaning effort. Some types of flooring must not be installed below grade, including laminate and hardwood due to potential damage from moisture.

The sub-floor may be finished in a way that makes it usable without any extra work, see:
* Earthen floor adobe or clay floors
* Solid ground floor, cementitious levelling/wearing/granolithic screeds, polymer-modified concretes and levelling/wearing screeds.

===Carpeting===
Carpet is a soft floor covering made of bound carpet fibers or stapled fibers. Carpeting refers to wall-to-wall coverage, whereas a rug is simply used to cover a space. This type of flooring is typically used indoors and can be used in both high and low-traffic areas. It typically lasts for 15–18 years before it needs to be replaced. The quality of a carpet is usually measured in face weight, or how many fibers there are per square inch. The higher the face weight the more plush a carpet will feel.

Carpets come in a variety of materials including wool, nylon, olefin, and polyester.

There are different types of carpet like twists, which is commonly referred to as berber. Twist carpeting is composed of multiple twisted fibers set into the carpet backing. It is typically used in low-traffic areas. Another type of carpeting is looped carpets, which are composed of looped fibers set into the carpet backing. This type of carpeting is typically used in high-traffic areas as it is easy to clean.

There are four common widths for carpeting goods: 6&#x27; wide, 12&#x27; wide, 13&#x27;6&quot; wide, and 15&#x27; wide.

==== Installation Methods ====
Today, there are two primary forms of carpet installation: tackless installation and direct glue down. Tackless installation occurs when a tack strip is installed around the perimeter of a room and the carpet is stretched over padding onto those tack strips to hold it in place. Before this installation method, the carpet was tacked down with staples throughout the installation which is why the new method is called &quot;tackless&quot; installation; as you no longer need nails in the middle of the floor. Direct glue down occurs when you spread special carpet adhesive over the substrate and then roll the carpet onto the glue to hold it in place.

==== Carpet underlay ====
Padding can be placed underneath the carpet to add comfort and provide some noise insulation. The level of comfort is determined by the type of material used, which can include memory foam and rubber regrind.

Carpet underlay is rated by density in pounds. For example, you could purchase a carpet pad with an 8-pound density rating, which would be softer than a carpet pad with a 10-pound density rating. Softer carpet pads feel better to walk on but sacrifice durability of the carpet that sits on top of it. The denser the carpet pad, the longer the carpet lasts.

===Wood flooring===
Many different species of wood are fabricated into wood flooring in two primary forms: plank and parquet. Hardwoods are typically much more durable than softwoods. Reclaimed lumber has a unique appearance and is used in green (environmentally responsible) building. The thermal conductivity of the hardwood flooring is less as compared to laminate wood flooring.

Engineered hardwood has a thin solid wood layer on top with a composite core, which is generally plywood, but can be high density fiberboard, stone polymer composite, or strips of a solid wood such as spruce or birch. The composite core increases the dimensional stability of the planks, which expand and contract less than those of solid wood flooring. As a result, engineered wood planks can be significantly larger than solid wood planks while retaining structural integrity. The thickness of the wood layer atop the core determines its ability to be sanded and refinished; engineered wood floors can generally be sanded and refinished 1-2 times, though some cannot be refinished while others can be refinished as many times as a solid wood floor.

Bamboo flooring is a floor manufactured from the bamboo plant and is a type of hardwood flooring, though technically not a wood. Bamboo is known to be durable and environmentally friendly. It is available in many different patterns, colors, and textures. There are three types of bamboo flooring construction: horizontal cut, vertical cut, and strand woven. Strand woven is the hardest and most durable of the three types.

Cork flooring is a flooring material manufactured from the by-product of the cork oak tree. Cork floors are considered to be eco-friendly since the cork oak tree bark is stripped every nine to ten years and doesn&#x27;t damage the tree. Cork flooring comes in both tiles and planks, and can have glue or glues-less installation.

Hardwood durability and hardness is determined by a ranking system called the Janka scale. The Janka scale is the force that it takes to embed a steel ball into the hardwood. The more force it takes to do so, the harder the wood. 

Hardwood floors can either be purchased as pre-finished planks or as planks that need to be sanded and finished in the home following installation. Manufacturers of pre-finished hardwood floors use varying materials for the finish, which usually include layers of polyurethane and aluminum oxide. The hardness of aluminum oxide can made these floors particularly difficult and costly to refinish, to the extent that most engineered wood floors do not get refinished, even if they can be.

Hardwood floors can be repaired by spot-sanding and refinishing, plank replacement, or a refinish of the full floor.

=== Laminate ===
Laminate is a floor covering that appears similar to hardwood but is made with a plywood or medium density fiberboard (&quot;MDF&quot;) core with a plastic laminate top layer. HDF laminate consists of high density fiberboard topped by one or more layers of decorative paper and a transparent protective layer. Laminate may be more durable than hardwood, but cannot be refinished like hardwood. Laminate flooring is available in many different patterns which can resemble different woods or even ceramic tile. It usually locks or taps together. Underlayment is required for laminate flooring to provide moisture and noise control.

The common installation method for laminate flooring is a floating installation, which means the floor connects to each other to form interlocked flooring system and is not attached to the sub-floor which means it is free to &quot;float&quot; over a variety of sub-floors. This includes existing flooring like ceramic tile and hardwood floors. It is the most versatile installation method because it can be put over any substrate that is flat.

=== Hybrid flooring ===
Hybrid combines the best attributes of both laminate and vinyl to create a rigid floating floor that can be installed throughout the entire home. Hybrid is made of multiple layers of materials pressed together for an extremely hard wearing floor.

=== Hard flooring ===

Hard flooring (not to be confused with &quot;hardwood&quot;) is a family of flooring materials that includes concrete or cement, ceramic tile, glass tiles, and natural stone products.

Ceramic tiles are clay products that are formed into thin tiles and fired. Ceramic tiles are set in beds of mortar or mastic with the joints between tiles grouted. Varieties of ceramic tiles include quarry tile, porcelain, and terracotta.

Many different natural stones are cut into a variety of sizes, shapes, and thicknesses for use as flooring. Stone flooring uses a similar installation method to ceramic tile. Slate and marble are popular types of stone flooring that requires polishing and sealing. Stone aggregates, like Terrazzo, can also be used instead of raw cut stone and are available as either preformed tiles or to be constructed in-place using a cement binder.

Porcelain stoneware can be used instead of natural stone. It is a ceramic material like a tile; however, it is typically thick and often comes in squares of .

==== Polished concrete ====
Concrete or cement finished floor is also used for its ability to be treated for different feel and its durability, such as polished concrete. Epoxy resurfacing of concrete flooring is used to update or upgrade concrete floor surfaces in commercial and residential applications – see seamless polymer flooring section below.

Floating tile flooring, also called modular tile flooring, includes a range of porcelain and ceramic tile products that can be installed without adhesive or mortar. Generally, the tile is rectified to precise dimensions, and fused to an interlocking base. Some products require use of a flexible grout and others have an integrated grout strip. The advantages include speed of installation, ease of use, reusability, and low cost relative to using traditional tile installation methods.

===Resilient flooring===
Unlike ceramic and stone tiles, which are made of minerals, resilient flooring is made of materials that have some elasticity, giving the flooring a degree of flexibility called resilience. Performance surfaces used for dance or athletics are usually made of wood or resilient flooring.

Resilient flooring includes many different manufactured products including linoleum, sheet vinyl, vinyl composition tile (VCT), cork (sheet or tile), and rubber.

Vinyl flooring is available in large sheets or pre-cut tiles; the former is resilient. Some come with a pre-applied adhesive for peel-and-stick installation, others require adhesive to be spread onto the substrate.

The two basic categories of vinyl floor tiles are solid vinyl (products with vinyl on binder content higher than 34%) and vinyl composition (products with a vinyl or binder content lower than 34%), and the three basic categories of vinyl sheet flooring are homogeneous, inlaid, and layered composite. These types of vinyl flooring differ in manufacturing process and content, ranging in vinyl (polyvinyl chloride) content from 11% to 55%.

Resilient flooring products, such as PVC and polypropylene are becoming more popular in specialty applications such as trailer flooring and garage flooring. New applications have also emerged for marine flooring. There are important factors to consider in specialty applications, that may not be present in a typical application. For example, certain tires will leave marks on PVC flooring but those marks will be less prevalent on polypropylene products. Adhesives also change based on application.

===Seamless polymer flooring===

Many different seamless flooring materials are available that vary from air-drying latex emulsion polymers to reactive thermoset resins such as waterborne, solvents or solvent-free urethanes, polyaspartics , and epoxies. Applied in liquid form, when allowed to dry and/or cure to provide a completely seamless floor covering.

They find use in situations ranging from the simple protection of domestic garage floors to the restoration and protection of commercial and industrial flooring. They are also used to solve a vast array of problems in industry such as wet areas in laboratories or food processing plants where spillages of oils and fats tend to be easily absorbed and/or difficult to clean. Other reasons for covering concrete with synthetic resin flooring are to improve resistance to chemicals, enhancing resistance to impact and wear, and for aesthetic appearance purposes.

Seamless polymer flooring can take many forms:
* Floor seals applied at less than 6 mil (0.15 mm)
* Floor coatings applied at 6 - 12 mil (0.15 – 0.3 mm)
* High-build floor coatings applied at 6 - 40 mil (0.15 – 1 mm)
* Broadcast flooring with embedded aggregate applied in excess of 80 mil (2 mm)
* Flow applied (self-smoothing/self-leveling flooring) applied at 80 – 120 mil (2 – 3 mm)
* Trowel finished bound resin screed flooring applied in excess of 160 mil (4 mm)
* Heavy-duty flow applied to floor applied at 160 – 240 mil (4 – 6 mm)
* Heavy-duty trowel finished resin screed flooring applied in excess of 240mil (6 mm)

They typically have granular or rubberized particles added to give better traction/slip resistance on walkways and steps especially in areas subject to frequent washing, and for better traction/skid resistance in traffic aisles.

==Sustainable flooring==

Sustainable flooring is produced from more sustainable materials (and by more sustainable processes) that reduces demands on ecosystems during its life-cycle.

==Features==
There are a number of special features that may be used to ornament a floor or perform a useful service:
* Floor medallions decorative centerpieces of a floor design.
* Doormats to help keep a floor clean.
* Gratings used to drain water or to rub dirt off shoes.
* Tactile or rumble strips to warn of for instance a wheelchair ramp, these would normally also be distinctively colored or patterned.
* Light strips to show an escape route out, especially on airplanes.
* Moldings or baseboards to decorate the sides of a floor or to cover the edge of a floating floor.
* Anti-slip mats: The addition of either granular or rubberized particles that will allow wheels, shoes, or feet better traction.

<doc id="197811" wikidata="Q568395" url="?curid=197811" title="John Fortescue (judge)">
<text>Sir John Fortescue ( 1394 – December 1479), of Ebrington in Gloucestershire, was Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench and the author of &quot;De Laudibus Legum Angliae&quot; (&quot;Commendation of the Laws of England&quot;), first published posthumously &quot;circa&quot; 1543, an influential treatise on English law. In the course of Henry VI&#x27;s reign, Fortescue was appointed one of the governors of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn three times and served as a Member of Parliament from 1421 to 1437. He became one of the King&#x27;s Serjeants during the Easter term of 1441, and subsequently served as Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 25 January 1442 to Easter term 1460.

During the Wars of the Roses, Henry VI was deposed in 1461 by Edward of York, who ascended the throne as Edward IV. Henry and his queen, Margaret of Anjou, later fled to Scotland. Fortescue remained loyal to Henry, and as a result was attainted of treason. He is believed to have been given the nominal title of Chancellor of England during Henry&#x27;s exile. He accompanied Queen Margaret and her court while they remained on the Continent between 1463 and 1471, and wrote &quot;De Laudibus Legum Angliae&quot; for the instruction of young Prince Edward. After the defeat of the House of Lancaster, he submitted to Edward IV who reversed his attainder in October 1471.

==Origins==
Born about 1397, he was the second son of John Fortescue and his first wife Clarice. His elder brother was Henry Fortescue.
The earliest surviving record of the Fortescue family relates to their manor of Whympston in the parish of Modbury, Devon.

==Career==
He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, favoured by many Devonshire gentry families. He was elected as a Member of Parliament for Tavistock (1421 to 1425), Totnes (1426 and 1432), Plympton Erle (1429) and Wiltshire (1437).

During the reign of Henry VI, Fortescue was thrice appointed one of the governors of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. During the Easter term of 1441 he was made one of the King&#x27;s Serjeants, and on 25 January in the following year Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, a position he held till Easter term 1460. As a judge Fortescue was recommended for his wisdom, gravity and uprightness, and he is said to have been favoured by the king.

He held his office during the remainder of the reign of Henry VI, to whom he was loyal; as a result, he was attainted of treason in the first parliament of Edward IV. When Henry subsequently fled to Scotland, he is supposed to have appointed Fortescue, who appears to have accompanied him in his flight, Chancellor of England. Fortescue referred to himself in this manner on the title page of &quot;De Laudibus Legum Angliae&quot;, but as the King did not possess the Great Seal of England during his exile it has been suggested that the title was &quot;nominal&quot; and &quot;merely illusory&quot;.

In 1463 Fortescue accompanied Queen Margaret and her court in their exile on the Continent, and returned with them to England in 1471. During their exile he wrote for the instruction of the young Prince Edward his celebrated work &quot;De laudibus legum Angliæ&quot; (&quot;Commendation of the Laws of England&quot;, first published posthumously around 1543), in which he made the first expression of what would later become known as Blackstone&#x27;s formulation, stating that &quot;one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned, and suffer capitally&quot;. On the defeat of the Lancastrian party he made his submission to Edward IV, who reversed his attainder on 13 October 1471.

==Family==
By 1423 he was married to Elizabeth Bright, daughter of Robert Bright from Doddiscombsleigh in Devon, but in 1426 she died without coming into her inheritance and without children. By 1436 he was married to Isabella James, daughter and heiress of John James who held land at Norton St Philip in Somerset as well as in Wiltshire, and they had three known children:
* Martin Fortescue, born about 1430 and died 1472, who in 1454 married Elizabeth Denzill, daughter and heiress of Richard Denzill, landholder at Filleigh, Weare Giffard, Buckland Filleigh and other places in Devon. 
* Elizabeth Fortescue, who in 1455 married Edward Whalesborough.
* Maud Fortescue, who in 1456 married Robert Corbet.

==Death and burial==

The exact date of Fortescue&#x27;s death is not known, but is believed to be shortly before 18 December 1479. He was buried in the Church of St Eadburga, Ebrington in Gloucestershire, in the manor he had purchased, and after which his descendants took the name of their title Viscount Ebrington, today used as the courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of Earl Fortescue. A painted stone effigy of John Fortescue, wearing his scarlet robes of office with collar of ermine, exists within the church, against the north wall of the chancel within the communion rails. Above it was erected in 1677 by Col. Robert Fortescue (1617–1677) (eight times his descendant and the second son of Hugh Fortescue (1593–1663) of Filleigh) a mural monument with a biographical inscription in Latin. A smaller tablet is affixed below stating that the monument was repaired in 1765 by Matthew Fortescue, 2nd Baron Fortescue. A brass plate below states: &quot;Restored by the Rt Honble. Hugh, 3rd Earl Fortescue, AD 1861&quot;.

==Legacy==
John Fortescue&#x27;s description of England&#x27;s mixed monarchy as a &quot;dominium politicum et regale&quot; (a political and regal kingdom) has been profoundly influential in the history of British constitutional thought. During the 20th century, the earlier portrayal of Fortescue as a constitutionalist has come under pressure from legal and constitutional historians. Scholars of literature have taken an interest in Fortescue&#x27;s contribution to the development of English prose, and in his role as a Lancastrian writer. More recently, Fortescue&#x27;s constitutional thought has been reassessed and his Lancastrian affiliation has been challenged.

To this day the John Fortescue Society is joined by students of law at Exeter College, Oxford.

==Works==
Fortescue&#x27;s most significant works were composed in Scotland and France, where the Lancastrian party had taken refuge, between 1463 and 1471. Taken together, &quot;Opusculum de natura legis naturæ et de ejus censura in successione regnorum suprema&quot; (&quot;A Small Work on the Nature of the Law of Nature, and on its Judgment on the Succession to Supreme Office in Kingdoms&quot;, c. 1463), &quot;De laudibus legum Angliæ&quot; (1468–1471), and a work written in English around 1471 which was later published as &quot;The Difference between an Absolute and Limited Monarchy&quot; (1714) and as &quot;The Governance of England&quot; (1885), provide the first discussion of the political and conceptual underpinnings of the common law, besides commenting on England&#x27;s constitutional framework. His works, in particular the masterly vindication of the laws of England &quot;De laudibus legum Angliæ&quot;, circulated in manuscript in late medieval England and were cited by the leading thinkers of the early Tudor period, among them the printer and playwright John Rastell and the lawyer Christopher St. Germain. &quot;De laudibus legum Angliae&quot; did not appear in print until about 1543 in the reign of Henry VIII as &quot;Prenobilis militis, cognomento Forescu &quot;[sic]&quot;, qui temporibus Henrici sexti floruit, de politica administratione, et legibus ciuilibus florentissimi regni Anglie, commentarius&quot; (&quot;Commentary on Political Administration and on the Civil Laws of the Most Flourishing Kingdom of England, of the Very Noble Knight, surnamed Forescu &quot;[sic]&quot;, who Flourished during the Reign of Henry VI&quot;). It was subsequently reprinted many times under different titles.

&quot;The Difference between an Absolute and Limited Monarchy&quot;, based on Fortescue&#x27;s c. 1471 manuscript, was published in 1714 by a descendant, John Fortescue Aland. In the Cotton library there is a manuscript of this work, and its title indicates that it was addressed to Henry VI. However, many passages show plainly that it was written in favour of Edward IV. A revised edition of this work, with a historical and biographical introduction, was published in 1885 by Charles Plummer under the title &quot;The Governance of England&quot;.

Fortescue also wrote a number of mostly topical works that addressed the political conflict during the Wars of the Roses. Among the surviving works are the pamphlets &quot;De titulo Edwardi comitis Marchiæ&quot; (&quot;The Title of Edward, Earl of March&quot;), &quot;Of the Title of the House of York&quot;, &quot;Defensio juris domus Lancastriæ&quot; (&quot;Defence of the Rights of the House of Lancaster&quot;), &quot;Replication ageinste the Clayme&quot;, and &quot;Title of the Duke of Yorke for the Crownes of England and France&quot;, as well as the treatise &quot;Opusculum de natura legis naturæ et de ejus censura in successione regnorum suprema&quot; already mentioned. Two further works, &quot;Declaration upon Certayn Wrytinges Sent oute of Scotteland&quot; and &quot;Articles Sent to Warwick&quot; have been discussed by recent scholarship. All of Fortescue&#x27;s minor writings appear in &quot;&quot;, published in 1869 for private circulation by another descendant, Thomas Fortescue, 1st Baron Clermont.

<doc id="197812" wikidata="Q1191836" url="?curid=197812" title="Probabilistic Turing machine">
<text>In theoretical computer science, a probabilistic Turing machine is a non-deterministic Turing machine that chooses between the available transitions at each point according to some probability distribution. As a consequence, a probabilistic Turing machine can (unlike a deterministic Turing machine) have stochastic results; that is, on a given input and instruction state machine, it may have different run times, or it may not halt at all; furthermore, it may accept an input in one execution and reject the same input in another execution.

In the case of equal probabilities for the transitions, probabilistic Turing machines can be defined as deterministic Turing machines having an additional &quot;write&quot; instruction where the value of the write is uniformly distributed in the Turing machine&#x27;s alphabet (generally, an equal likelihood of writing a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot; on to the tape). Another common reformulation is simply a deterministic Turing machine with an added tape full of random bits called the &quot;random tape&quot;.

A quantum computer (or quantum Turing machine) is another model of computation that is inherently probabilistic.

==Description==
A probabilistic Turing machine is a type of nondeterministic Turing machine in which each nondeterministic step is a &quot;coin-flip&quot;, that is, at each step there are two possible next moves and the Turing machine probabilistically selects which move to take.

==Formal definition==
A probabilistic Turing machine can be formally defined as the 7-tuple formula_1, where
* formula_2 is a finite set of states
* formula_3 is the input alphabet
* formula_4 is a tape alphabet, which includes the blank symbol #
* formula_5 is the initial state
* formula_6 is the set of accepting (final) states
* formula_7 is the first probabilistic transition function. formula_8 is a movement one cell to the left on the Turing machine&#x27;s tape and formula_9 is a movement one cell to the right.
* formula_10 is the second probabilistic transition function.

At each step, the Turing machine probabilistically applies either the transition function formula_11 or the transition function formula_12. This choice is made independently of all prior choices. In this way, the process of selecting a transition function at each step of the computation resembles a coin flip.

The probabilistic selection of the transition function at each step introduces error into the Turing machine; that is, strings which the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings which the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. To accommodate this, a language formula_8 is said to be recognized &quot;with error probability formula_14&quot; by a probabilistic Turing machine formula_15 if:
# a string formula_16 in formula_8 implies that formula_18
# a string formula_16 not in formula_8 implies that formula_21

==Complexity classes==

As a result of the error introduced by utilizing probabilistic coin tosses, the notion of acceptance of a string by a probabilistic Turing machine can be defined in different ways. One such notion that includes several important complexity classes is allowing for an error probability of 1/3. For instance, the complexity class BPP is defined as the class of languages recognized by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of 1/3. Another class defined using this notion of acceptance is BPL, which is the same as BPP but places the additional restriction that languages must be solvable in logarithmic space.

Complexity classes arising from other definitions of acceptance include RP, co-RP, and ZPP. If the machine is restricted to logarithmic space instead of polynomial time, the analogous RL, co-RL, and ZPL complexity classes are obtained. By enforcing both restrictions, RLP, co-RLP, BPLP, and ZPLP are yielded.

Probabilistic computation is also critical for the definition of most classes of interactive proof systems, in which the verifier machine depends on randomness to avoid being predicted and tricked by the all-powerful prover machine. For example, the class IP equals PSPACE, but if randomness is removed from the verifier, we are left with only NP, which is not known but widely believed to be a considerably smaller class.

One of the central questions of complexity theory is whether randomness adds power; that is, is there a problem that can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine but not a deterministic Turing machine? Or can deterministic Turing machines efficiently simulate all probabilistic Turing machines with at most a polynomial slowdown? It is known that P ⊆ BPP, since a deterministic Turing machine is just a special case of a probabilistic Turing machine. However, it is uncertain whether (but widely suspected that) BPP ⊆ P, implying that BPP = P. The same question for log space instead of polynomial time (does L = BPLP?) is even more widely believed to be true. On the other hand, the power randomness gives to interactive proof systems, as well as the simple algorithms it creates for difficult problems such as polynomial-time primality testing and log-space graph connectedness testing, suggests that randomness may add power.

<text>Edward Foss (16 October 1787 – 27 July 1870) was an English lawyer and biographer. He became a solicitor, and on his retirement from practice in 1840, devoted himself to the study of legal antiquities. His &quot;Judges of England&quot; (9 vols., 1848–1864) was regarded as a standard work, characterized by accuracy and extensive research. &quot;Biographia Juridica, a Biographical Dictionary of English Judges&quot;, appeared shortly after his death.

He was the eldest son of Edward Smith Foss, solicitor, of 36 Essex Street, The Strand, London (d.1830), by Anne, his wife, daughter of Dr. William Rose of Chiswick, and was born in Gough Square, Fleet Street, 16 October 1787. He was educated under Dr. Charles Burney, his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law, at Greenwich, and remained there until he was articled in 1804 to his father, whose partner he became in 1811. In 1822 he became a member of the Inner Temple, but never proceeded further towards a call to the bar.

On his father&#x27;s death, in 1830, Foss moved to Essex Street, and carried on the practice alone until 1840, when he retired. During his professional career he had, owing to his literary tastes and connections, been specially concerned with questions relating to publishers and literary men. In 1827–8 he served the office of under-sheriff of London. He was connected with the Law Life Assurance Society from its foundation in 1823, first as auditor and afterwards as director, and was active in founding the Incorporated Law Society, of which he was president in 1842 and 1843. In 1844 he moved from Streatham to Canterbury, where he became chairman of the magistrates&#x27; bench, in 1859 to Dover, and in 1865 to Addiscombe.

He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1822, was a member of the council of the Camden Society from 1850 to 1853, and from 1865 to 1870, a member of the Royal Society of Literature from 1837, and on the council of the Royal Literary Fund, and until 1839 secretary to the Society of Guardians of Trade. He died of apoplexy on 27 July 1870.

==Works==
As a young man he contributed to periodicals: the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, &quot;Aikin&#x27;s Athenæum&quot;, the &quot;London Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;. In 1817 he published &quot;The Beauties of Massinger&quot;, and in 1820 an abridgment of William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, begun by John Gifford and published under his name, later translated into German. On retiring from professional practice he devoted himself to collecting materials for the history of the legal profession, which he lent to Lord Campbell for his &quot;Lives of the Chancellors&quot;. He published in 1843 &quot;The Grandeur of the Law&quot;, and in 1848 the first two volumes of the &quot;Judges of England&quot; appeared. The work was at first unsuccessful, but it rose in favour, and became a standard authority. In recognition Lord Langdale, to whom the first two volumes were dedicated, procured for him a grant of the entire series of publications of the Record Commission. The third and fourth volumes appeared in 1851, fifth and sixth in 1857, and seventh, eighth, and ninth in 1864.

In 1865 Foss published &quot;Tabulæ Curiales&quot;, and the printing of his &quot;Biographia Juridica&quot;—an abbreviation of his &quot;Judges of England&quot;—was in progress when he died.

Foss also contributed to the &quot;Standard&quot;. He was an original member of the Archæological Institute, and contributed a paper on Westminster Hall to its publication, &quot;Old London&quot;, 1867. He contributed to &quot;Archæologia&quot; papers ‘On the Lord Chancellors under King John,’ ‘On the Relationship of Bishop FitzJames and Lord Chief Justice Fitzjames,’ ‘On the Lineage of Sir Thomas More,’ and ‘On the Office and Title of Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer.’ For the Kent Archæological Association, which he helped to found, he wrote a paper ‘On the Collar of S.S.’; and a privately printed volume of poems, ‘A Century of Inventions,’ appeared in 1863.

==Family==
He married in 1814 Catherine, eldest daughter of Peter Finch Martineau, by whom he had one son, who died in infancy, and in 1844 Maria Elizabeth, eldest daughter of William Hutchins, by whom he had six sons (of whom the eldest, Edward, a barrister, assisted in the preparation of the ‘Biographia Juridica’) and three daughters. One of his grandsons was the composer, critic, and publisher of music Hubert J. Foss.

<text>A general practitioner (GP) or family physician is a doctor who is a consultant in general practice. 

GPs have distinct expertise and experience in providing whole person medical care, whilst managing the complexity, uncertainty and risk associated with the continuous care they provide. GPs work at the heart of their communities, striving to provide comprehensive and equitable care for everyone, taking into account their health care needs, stage of life and background. GPs work in, connect with and lead multidisciplinary teams that care for people and their families, respecting the context in which they live, aiming to ensure all of their physical health and mental health needs are met. They are trained to treat patients to levels of complexity that vary between countries. The term &quot;primary care physician&quot; is used in the United States. 

A core element in general practice is continuity of care, that bridges episodes of various illnesses over time. Greater continuity with a general practitioner has been shown to reduce the need for out-of-hours services and acute hospital admittance. Continuous care by the same general practitioner has been found to reduce mortality.

The role of a GP varies between and within countries, and is often dependent on local needs and circumstances. In urban areas their roles may focus on: 
* care of chronic/complex health conditions 
* treatment of urgent/acute non-life-threatening diseases 
* mental health care
* preventive care, including health education and immunisation. 
* screening/early detection of disease
* palliative care
* care coordination/referral to allied health professions or specialised medical care 

In rural areas, a GP may additionally be routinely involved in pre-hospital emergency care, the delivery of babies, community hospital care and performing low-complexity surgical procedures. GPs may work in larger primary care centers where they provide care within a multidisciplinary healthcare team, while in other cases GPs may work as sole practitioners or in smaller practices.

The term &quot;general practitioner&quot; or &quot;GP&quot; is common in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, Canada, Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries. In these countries, the word &quot;physician&quot; is largely reserved for medical specialists often working in hospitals, notably in internal medicine. In North America the term is sometimes synonymous with the terms &quot;family doctor&quot; or &quot;primary care physician&quot;.

General practice is an academic and scientific discipline with its own educational content, research, evidence base and clinical activity. Historically, the role of a GP was performed by any doctor with qualifications from a medical school working in the community. However, since the 1950s, general practice has become a medical specialty with additional training requirements. The 1978 Alma Ata Declaration set the intellectual foundation of primary care and general practice.

== Asia ==

=== India ===
The basic medical degree in India is MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery). These generally consist of a four-and-a-half-year course followed by a year of compulsory rotatory internship in India. The internship requires the candidate to work in all departments for a stipulated period of time, to undergo hands-on training in treating patients.

The registration of doctors is usually managed by state medical councils. A permanent registration as a Registered Medical Practitioner is granted only after satisfactory completion of the compulsory internship.

The Federation of Family Physicians&#x27; Associations of India (FFPAI) is an organization which has a connection with more than 8000 general practitioners through having affiliated membership.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, the completion of a 5-year MBBS program is succeeded by a one-year rotational internship encompassing various specialties. Bangladesh Medical &amp; Dental Council (BM&amp;DC) then provides permanent registration to the doctors, after which the candidate may choose to practice as a GP or opt for specialty training.. As of 2019, there are some 86,800 doctors, and dentists registered with the BM&amp;DC.

Bangladesh College of Physicians and Surgeons (BCPS) has a one-year membership and four-year fellowship program in Family Medicine.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, 5 years of MBBS is followed by one year of internship in different specialties. Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) then confers permanent registration, after which the candidate may choose to practice as a GP or opt for specialty training.

The first Family Medicine Training programme was approved by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan (CPSP) in 1992 and initiated in 1993 by the Family Medicine Division of the Department of Community Health
Sciences, Aga Khan University, Pakistan.

Family Medicine residency training programme of Ziauddin University is approved for Fellowship in Family Medicine.

== Europe ==

=== European Union ===
General practitioners are regulated in the EU by Directive 2005/36/EC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directive 2005/36/EC&quot;&gt;Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications, Official Journal of the European Union, 30.9.2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
In France the médecin généraliste (commonly called &quot;médecin de famille&quot;) is responsible for primary care medicine, including non-vital emergencies and patient&#x27;s follow up. This implies prevention, education, care of the diseases and traumas. The general practitionner orientates the patients to other specialists when necessary. 

They have a role in the survey of epidemics, a legal role (constatation of traumas that can bring compensation, certificates for the practice of a sport, death certificate, certificate for hospitalisation without consent in case of mental incapacity), and a role in the emergency care (they can be called by the &quot;samu&quot;, the French EMS). They often go to a patient&#x27;s home when the patient cannot come to the consulting room (especially in case of children or old people), and have to contribute to night and week-end duties. 

The studies consist of six years at university (common to all medical specialities), and four years as a resident (&quot;interne&quot;) :
* the first year (PASS, &quot;Parcours d&#x27;Accès Spécifique Santé&quot;, often abbreviated to &quot;P1&quot; by students) is common with the dentists, pharmacists and midwives. The rank at the final competitive examination determines in which branch the student can choose to study.
* the following two years, called &quot;propédeutique&quot;, are dedicated to the fundamental sciences: anatomy, human physiology, biochemistry, bacteriology, statistics...
* the three following years are called &quot;externat&quot; and are dedicated to the study of clinical medicine; they end with a classifying examination, the rank determines in which specialty (general medicine is one of them) the student can make her or his &quot;internat&quot;;
* the &quot;internat&quot; is three years -or more depending on the specialty- of initial professional experience under the responsibility of a &quot;senior&quot;; the &quot;interne&quot; can prescribe, s/he can replace physicians, and usually works in a hospital.
This ends with a doctorate, a research work which usually consist of a statistical study of cases to propose a care strategy for a specific condition (in an epidemiological, diagnostic, or therapeutic point of view).

==== Greece ====
General Practice was established as a medical specialty in Greece in 1986. To qualify as a General Practitioner (γενικός ιατρός, genikos iatros) doctors in Greece are required to complete four years of vocational training after medical school, including three years and two months in a hospital setting. General Practitioners in Greece may either work as private specialists or for the National Healthcare Service, ESY (Εθνικό Σύστημα Υγείας, ΕΣΥ).

==== Netherlands and Belgium ====
General practice in the Netherlands and Belgium is considered advanced. The &quot;huisarts&quot; (literally: &quot;home doctor&quot;) administers first line, primary care. In the Netherlands, patients usually cannot consult a hospital specialist without a required referral. Most GPs work in private practice although more medical centers with employed GPs are seen. Many GPs have a specialist interest, e.g. in palliative care.

In Belgium, one year of lectures and two years of residency are required. In the Netherlands, training consists of three years (full-time) of specialization after completion of internships of 3 years. First and third year of training takes place at a GP practice. The second year of training consists of six months training at an emergency room, or internal medicine, paediatrics or gynaecology, or a combination of a general or academic hospital, three months of training at a psychiatric hospital or outpatient clinic and three months at a nursing home (verpleeghuis) or clinical geriatrics ward/policlinic. During all three years, residents get one day of training at university while working in practice the other days. The first year, a lot of emphasis is placed on communications skills with video training. Furthermore, all aspects of working as a GP gets addressed including working with the medical standards from the Dutch GP association NHG (Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap).
All residents must also take the national GP knowledge test (Landelijke Huisartsgeneeskundige Kennistoets (LHK-toets)) twice a year. In this test of 120 multiple choice questions, medical, ethical, scientific and legal matters of GP work are addressed.

==== Spain ====
In Spain GPs are officially especialistas en medicina familiar y comunitaria but are commonly called &quot;&quot;médico de cabecera&quot; or &quot;médico de familia&quot;&quot;. It was established as a medical specialty in Spain in 1978.

Most Spanish GPs work for the state-funded health services provided by the county&#x27;s 17 regional governments (&quot;comunidades autónomas&quot;). They are in most cases salary-based healthcare workers.

For the provision of primary care, Spain is currently divided geographically in basic health care areas (&quot;áreas básicas de salud&quot;), each one containing a primary health care team (&quot;Equipo de atención primaria&quot;). Each team is multidisciplinary and typically includes GPs, community pediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists and social workers, together with ancillary staff. In urban areas all the services are concentrated in a single large building (Centro de salud) while in rural areas the main center is supported by smaller branches (&quot;consultorios&quot;), typically single-handled.

Becoming a GP in Spain involves studying medicine for 6 years, passing a competitive national exam called MIR (&quot;Medico Interno Residente&quot;) and undergoing a 4-year training program. The training program includes core specialties as general medicine and general practice (around 12 months each), pediatrics, gynecology, orthopedics and psychiatry. Shorter and optional placements in ENT, ophthalmology, ED, infectious diseases, rheumathology or others add up to the 4 years curriculum. The assessment is work based and involves completing a logbook that ensures all the expected skills, abilities and aptitudes have been acquired by the end of the training period.

===Russia===
In the Russian Federation, the General Practitioner&#x27;s Regulation was put into effect in 1992, after which medical schools started training in the relevant specialty.
The right to practice as a general practitioner gives a certificate of appropriate qualifications. General medical practice can be carried out both individually and in a group, including with the participation of narrow specialists. The work of general practitioners is allowed, both in the medical institution and in private.
The general practitioner has broad legal rights. He can lead junior medical personnel, provide services under medical insurance contracts, conclude additional contracts to the main contract, and conduct an examination of the quality of medical services. For independent decisions, the general practitioner is responsible in accordance with the law.

The main tasks of a general practitioner are:
*Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the most common diseases;
*Emergency and emergency medical care;
*Performance of medical manipulations.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom physicians wishing to become GPs take at least five years&#x27; training after medical school, which is usually an undergraduate course of five to six years (or a graduate course of four to six years) leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery.

Until 2005, those wishing to become a general practitioner of medicine had to do a minimum of the following postgraduate training:
* One year as a pre-registration house officer (PRHO) (formerly called a house officer), in which the trainee would usually spend six months on a general surgical ward and six months on a general medical ward in a hospital;
* Two years as a senior house officer (SHO) – often on a General Practice Vocational Training Scheme (GP-VTS) in which the trainee would normally complete four six-month jobs in hospital specialties such as obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, geriatric medicine, accident and emergency or psychiatry;
* One year as a general practice registrar on a GPST.

This process changed under the programme Modernising Medical Careers. Medical practitioners graduating from 2005 onwards have to do a minimum of five years postgraduate training:
* Two years of &quot;Foundation Training&quot;, in which the trainee will do a rotation around either six four-month jobs or eight three-month jobs – these include at least three months in general medicine and three months in general surgery, but will also include jobs in other areas;
* A three-year &quot;run-through&quot; GP Speciality Training Programme containing (GPSTP): This comprises a minimum of twelve months as a hospital based Specialty Trainee during which time the trainee completes a mixture of jobs in specialties such as obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, geriatric medicine, accident and emergency or psychiatry; eighteen to twenty-four months as a GP Specialty Trainee working in General Practice. The balance of training time spent in hospital versus in GP is planned to shift in 2022 to be consistently 12 months&#x27; hospital training and 24 months&#x27; training time in general practice.


The postgraduate qualification Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) was previously optional. In 2008, a requirement was introduced for physicians to succeed in the MRCGP assessments in order to be issued with a certificate of completion of their specialty training (CCT) in general practice. After passing the assessments, they are eligible to use the post-nominal letters MRCGP (so long as the physicians continued to pay membership fees to the RCGP, though many do not). During the GP specialty training programme, the medical practitioner must complete a variety of assessments in order to be allowed to practice independently as a GP. There is a knowledge-based exam with multiple choice questions called the Applied Knowledge Test (AKT). The practical examination takes the form of a &quot;simulated surgery&quot; in which the physicians is presented with thirteen clinical cases and assessment is made of data gathering, interpersonal skills and clinical management. This Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) is held on three or four occasions throughout the year and takes place at the renovated headquarters of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), at 30 Euston Square, London. Finally, throughout the year the physician must complete an electronic portfolio which is made up of case-based discussions, critique of videoed consultations and reflective entries into a &quot;learning log&quot;.

In addition, many hold qualifications such as the DCH (Diploma in Child Health of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health) or the DRCOG (Diploma of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists), the DPD (Diploma in Practical Dermatology) or the DGH (Diploma in Geriatric Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians). Some General Practitioners also hold the MRCP (Member of the Royal College of Physicians) or other specialist qualifications, but generally only if they had a hospital career, or a career in another speciality, before training in General Practice.

There are many arrangements under which general practitioners can work in the UK. While the main career aim is becoming a principal or partner in a GP surgery, many become salaried or non-principal GPs, work in hospitals in GP-led acute care units or perform locum work. Whichever of these roles they fill, the vast majority of GPs receive most of their income from the National Health Service (NHS). Principals and partners in GP surgeries are self-employed, but they have contractual arrangements with the NHS which give them considerable predictability of income.

Visits to GP surgeries are free in all countries of the United Kingdom, but charges for prescriptions are applied in England (except for those over 60, under 18, and those on low incomes and welfare). Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have abolished all charges.

Recent reforms to the NHS have included changes to the GP contract. General practitioners are no longer required to work unsociable hours and get paid to some extent according to their performance, (e.g. numbers of patients treated, what treatments were administered, and the health of their catchment area, through the Quality and Outcomes Framework). The IT system used for assessing their income based on these criteria is called QMAS. The amount that a GP can expect to earn does vary according to the location of their work and the health needs of the population that they serve. Within a couple of years of the new contract being introduced, it became apparent that there were a few examples where the arrangements were out step with what had been expected. A full-time self-employed GP, such as a GMS or PMS practice partner, might currently expect to earn a profit share of around £95,900 before tax while a GP employed by a CCG could expect to earn a salary in the range of £54,863 to £82,789. This can equate to an hourly rate of around £40 an hour for a GP partner.

A survey by Ipsos MORI released in 2011 reports that 88% of adults in the UK &quot;trust doctors to tell the truth&quot;.

In May 2017, there was said to be a crisis in the UK with practices having difficulties recruiting GPs they need. Helen Stokes-Lampard of the Royal College of General Practitioners said, &quot;At present, UK general practice does not have sufficient resources to deliver the care and services necessary to meet our patients&#x27; changing needs, meaning that GPs and our teams are working under intense pressures, which are simply unsustainable. Workload in general practice is escalating – it has increased 16% over the last seven years, according to the latest research – yet investment in our service has steadily declined over the last decade and the number of GPs has not risen in step with patient demand ... This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.&quot;. Professor Azeem Majeed from Imperial College has also raised concerns about general practice in the UK.

In 2018 the average GP worked less than three and a half days a week because of the &quot;intensity of working day&quot;.

There is an NHS England initiative to situate GPs in or near hospital emergency departments to divert minor cases away from A&amp;E and reduce pressure on emergency services. 97 hospital trusts have been allocated money, mostly for premises alterations or development.

== North America ==

=== United States ===

The population of this type of medical practitioner is declining, however. Currently, the Medical Departments of the US Air Force, Army and Navy have many of these general practitioners, known as General Medical Officers or GMOs, in active practice. The GMO is an inherent concept to all military medical branches. GMOs are the gatekeepers of medicine in that they hold the purse strings and decide upon the merit of specialist consultation. The US now holds a different definition for the term &quot;general practitioner&quot;. The two terms &quot;general practitioner&quot; and &quot;family practice&quot; were synonymous prior to 1970. At that time both terms (if used within the US) referred to someone who completed medical school and the one-year required internship, and then worked as a general family doctor. Completion of a post-graduate specialty training program or residency in family medicine was, at that time, not a requirement. A physician who specializes in &quot;family medicine&quot; must now complete a residency in family medicine and must be eligible for board certification, which is required by many hospitals and health plans for hospital privileges and remuneration, respectively. It was not until the 1970s that family medicine was recognized as a specialty in the US.

Many licensed family medical practitioners in the United States after this change began to use the term &quot;general practitioner&quot; to refer to those practitioners who previously did not complete a family medicine residency. Family physicians (after completing medical school) must then complete three to four years of additional residency in family medicine. Three hundred hours of medical education within the prior six years is also required to be eligible to sit for the board certification exam; these hours are largely acquired during residency training.

The existing general practitioners in the 1970s were given the choice to be grandfathered into the newly created specialty of Family Practice. In 1971 the American Academy of General Practice changed its name to the American Academy of Family Physicians. The prior system of graduating from medical school and completing one year of post-graduate training (rotating internship) was not abolished as 47 of the 50 states allow a physician to obtain a medical license without completion of residency. If one wanted to become a &quot;house-call-making&quot; type of physician, one still needs to only complete one or two years of a residency in either pediatrics, family medicine or internal medicine. This would make a physician a non-board eligible general practitioner able to qualify and obtain a license to practice medicine in 47 of the 50 United States of America. Since the establishment of the Board of Family Medicine, a family medicine physician is no longer the same as a general practitioner. What makes a Family Medicine Physician different from a General Practitioner/Physician is two-fold. First off a Family Medicine Physician has completed the three years of Family Medicine residency and is board eligible or board certified in Family Medicine; while a General Practitioner does not have any board certification and cannot sit for any board exam. Secondly, a Family Medicine Physician is able to practice obstetrics, the care of the pregnant woman from conception to delivery, while a general practitioner is not adequately trained in obstetrics.

Prior to recent history most postgraduate education in the United States was accomplished using the mentor system. A physician would finish a rotating internship and move to some town and be taught by the local physicians the skills needed for that particular town. This allowed each community&#x27;s needs to be met by the teaching of the new general practitioner the skills needed in that community. This also allowed the new physician to start making a living and raising a family, etc. General practitioners would be the surgeons, the obstetricians, and the internists for their given communities. Changes in demographics and the growing complexities of the developing bodies of knowledge made it necessary to produce more highly trained surgeons and other specialists. For many physicians it was a natural desire to want to be considered &quot;specialists&quot;.

What was not anticipated by many physicians is that an option to be a generalist would lose its prestige and be further degraded by a growing bureaucracy of insurance and hospitals requiring board certification. It has been shown that there is no statistically significant correlation between board certification and patient safety or quality of care which is why 47 states do not require board certification to practice medicine. Board certification agencies have been increasing their fees exponentially since establishment and the board examinations are known to not be clinically relevant and are at least 5 years out of date. Yet, there is still a misbelief that board certification is necessary to practice medicine and therefore it has made a non-board eligible general physician a rare breed of physician due to the lack of available job opportunities for them.

Certificates of Added Qualifications (CAQs) in adolescent medicine, geriatric medicine, sports medicine, sleep medicine, and hospice and palliative medicine are available for those board-certified family physicians with additional residency training requirements. Recently, new fellowships in International Family Medicine have emerged. These fellowships are designed to train family physicians working in resource-poor environments.

In 2009 an ongoing shortage of primary care physicians (and also other primary care providers) was reported. It was due to several factors, notably the lesser prestige associated with the young specialty, the lower pay, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment. In the US physicians are increasingly forced to do more administrative work, and pay higher malpractice insurance premiums.

=== Canada ===
The College of General Practice of Canada was founded in 1954 but in 1967 changed its name to College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC).

=== Australia ===

General Practice in Australia and New Zealand has undergone many changes in training requirements over the past decade. The basic medical degree in Australia is the MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery), which has traditionally been attained after completion of an undergraduate five or six-year course. Over the last few years, an ever-increasing number of post-graduate four-year medical programs (previous bachelor&#x27;s degree required) have become more common and now account more than half of all Australian medical graduates. After graduating, a one-year internship is completed in a public and private hospitals prior to obtaining full registration. Many newly registered medical practitioners undergo one year or more of pre-vocational position as Resident Medical Officers (different titles depending on jurisdictions) before specialist training begins. For general practice training, the medical practitioner then applies to enter a three- or four-year program either through the &quot;Australian General Practice Training Program&quot;, &quot;Remote Vocational Training Scheme&quot; or &quot;Independent Pathway&quot;. The Australian Government has announced an expansion of the number of GP training places through the AGPT program- 1,500 places per year will be available by 2015.
A combination of coursework and apprenticeship type training leading to the awarding of the FRACGP (Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners) or FACRRM (Fellowship of Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine), if successful. Since 1996 this qualification or its equivalent has been required in order for new GPs to access Medicare rebates as a specialist general practitioner. Doctors who graduated prior to 1992 and who had worked in general practice for a specified period of time were recognized as &quot;Vocationally Registered&quot; or &quot;VR&quot; GPs, and given automatic and continuing eligibility for general practice Medicare rebates. There is a sizable group of doctors who have identical qualifications and experience, but who have been denied access to VR recognition. They are termed &quot;Non-Vocationally Registered&quot; or so-called &quot;non-VR&quot; GPs. The federal government of Australia recognizes the experience and competence of these doctors, by allowing them access to the &quot;specialist&quot; GP Medicare rebates for working in areas of government policy priority, such as areas of workforce shortage, and metropolitan after hours service. Some programs awarded permanent and unrestricted eligibility for VR rebate levels after 5 years of practice under the program. There is a community-based campaign in support of these so-called Non-VR doctors being granted full and permanent recognition of their experience and expertise, as fully identical with the previous generation of pre-1996 &quot;grandfathered&quot; GPs. This campaign is supported by the official policy of the Australian Medical Association (AMA).

Medicare is Australia&#x27;s universal health insurance system, and without access to it, a practitioner cannot effectively work in private practice in Australia. 

Procedural General Practice training in combination with General Practice Fellowship was first established by the &quot;Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine&quot; in 2004. This new fellowship was developed in aid to recognise the specialised skills required to work within a rural and remote context. In addition it was hoped to recognise the impending urgency of training Rural Procedural Practitioners to sustain Obstetric and Surgical services within rural Australia. Each training registrar select a speciality that can be used in a rural area from the Advanced Skills Training list and spends a minimum of 12 months completing this specialty, the most common of which are Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynaecology and Anaesthetics. Further choices of specialty include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, Adult Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Mental Health, Paediatrics, Population health and Remote Medicine. Shortly after the establishment of the FACRRM, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners introduced an additional training year (from the basic 3 years) to offer the &quot;Fellowship in Advanced Rural General Practice&quot;. The additional year, or Advanced Rural Skills Training (ARST) can be conducted in various locations from Tertiary Hospitals to Small General Practice.

The competent authority pathway is a work-based place assessment process to support International Medical Graduates (IMGs) wishing to work in General Practice. Approval for the ACRRM to undertake these assessments was granted by the Australian Medical Council in August 2010 and the process is to be streamlined in July 2014.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, most GPs work in clinics and health centres usually as part of a Primary Health Organisation (PHO). These are funded at a population level, based on the characteristics of a practice&#x27;s enrolled population (referred to as capitation-based funding). Fee-for-service arrangements still exist with other funders such as Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and Ministry of Social Development (MSD), as well as receiving co-payments from patients to top-up the capitation-based funding.

The basic medical degree in New Zealand is the MBChB degree (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery), which has traditionally been attained after completion of an undergraduate five or six-year course. In NZ new graduates must complete the GPEP (General Practice Education Program) Stages I and II in order to be granted the title Fellowship of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (FRNZCGP), which includes the PRIMEX assessment and further CME and Peer group learning sessions as directed by the RNZCGP. Holders of the award of FRNZCGP may apply for specialist recognition with the New Zealand Medical Council (MCNZ), after which they are considered specialists in General Practice by the council and the community. In 2009 the NZ Government increased the number of places available on the state-funded programme for GP training.

There is a shortage of GPs in rural areas and increasingly outer metropolitan areas of large cities, which has led to the use of overseas trained doctors (international medical graduates (IMGs)).

<text>Dollis Hill is an area in northwest London, which consists of the streets surrounding the Gladstone Park. It is served by a London Underground station, Dollis Hill, on the Jubilee line, providing good links to central London. It is in the London Borough of Brent, close to Willesden Green, Neasden and Cricklewood, and is in the postal districts of NW2 and
NW10 

The area is mainly residential (Edwardian terraced and 1920s/30s semi-detached houses) with a restaurant, greengrocer and convenience stores near the underground station. The Dollis Hill ward has the highest Irish population in London.

Dollis Hill played a part in the Second World War as the code-breaking computer used at Bletchley Park was built at the Post Office Research Station in Dollis Hill and the rarely used alternative Cabinet War Room bunker for Winston Churchill&#x27;s government was dug underground here.

==History==


The Dollis Hill Estate was formed in the early 19th century, when the Finch family bought up a number of farms in the area to form a single estate. Dollis Hill House itself was built in the 1820s. It was later occupied by Lord Aberdeen who often had Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone to stay as a guest.

In 1901, a new public park was created the Gladstone Park, named after the former Prime Minister. An underground station, Dollis Hill Underground station, was opened on 1 October 1909 as part of the Metropolitan line, now on the Jubilee line. Between the park and the underground station, Edwardian terraced houses were built at this time on a grid with names starting with letters in alphabetical order (with some letters missing) from Aberdeen to Normanby.

The first railway in the area was the Dudding Hill Line, opened in 1875 by the Midland Railway to connect its Midland Main Line and Cricklewood goods yard in the east to other lines to the southwest. The Dudden Hill station on the line closed for passengers in 1902, but the line still carried freight.

In World War I, between 1917 and 1921, the tank design team (The Mechanical Warfare Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions) responsible for the new Anglo-American or Liberty tank, Mark VIII was located here. Early trials of some of the first military tanks were conducted in Dollis Hill. Images of the tanks in Dollis Hill are held at The Imperial War Museum, London.


The Post Office Research Station was built in 1921. The code-breaking Colossus computer, used at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, was built at here by a team led by Tommy Flowers. The station was relocated to Martlesham Heath at the end of the 1970s. The Post Office Research Station building has now been converted into 62 flats and is now known as &#x27;Chartwell Court&#x27;, with an access road called &#x27;Flowers Close&#x27;.

The alternative Cabinet War Room bunker for Winston Churchill&#x27;s World War II government code-named Paddock is located under a corner of the former Post Office Research Station in Brook Road.

Medium-sized, semi-detached houses were built to the east of this area between 1927 and 1935.

The Grunwick dispute in the late 1970s concerned trade union recognition, working conditions and employment law. It centred on the Grunwick Film Processing Laboratories in Chapter Road, Dollis Hill. The protracted dispute became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in the trade union movement at the time, with several acrimonious interactions between large numbers of police and mass pickets.

==Demographics==
Dollis Hill has a very diverse mix of ethnicities and nationalities. The largest single ethnic group in the Dollis Hill ward of the 2011 Census, White British, comprises 14.3% of the population. The next largest are Other White (13.7%), Indians (11.4%) and Black Africans (10.6%).

44.6% of people living in Dollis Hill were born in England in the 2011 census. The next most common countries of birth were Ireland (5.1%), India (4.3%), Pakistan (4%) and Somalia (3.9%).

The main religious affiliations of Dollis Hill are Christians (43.9%), Muslims (31.3%), and Hindus (10.1%).

==Transport==
The area is served by a London Underground station, Dollis Hill, on the Jubilee line. There are regular services to Baker Street in 15 minutes and Westminster in 20 minutes. It is in Travelcard Zone 3, three stops from West Hampstead and within easy reach of Wembley Stadium.

London Buses routes 226, 302 and N98 serve the area south of Gladstone Park. The area north of Gladstone Park is served by routes 182, 232, 245 and 332. There are a large number of buses that service nearby Willesden Green.

==Notable residents==

William Ewart Gladstone, the British Prime Minister, was a frequent visitor to Dollis Hill House in the late 19th century. The year after his death, 1899, Willesden Council acquired much of the Dollis Hill Estate for use as a public park, which was named Gladstone Park.

Mark Twain stayed in Dollis Hill House in the summer of 1900. He wrote &quot;Dollis Hill comes nearer to being a paradise than any other home I ever occupied.&quot;

Eric Simms, the ornithologist, broadcaster and author, lived in Brook Road. His book, &quot;Birds of Town and Suburb&quot; (1975), was based on his studies of the birds in Dollis Hill.

David Baddiel grew up in the area.

Nihal Arthanayake, BBC Radio 5 Live DJ, resides here with his family.

Mark Gottsche, London county team Gaelic footballer, lived on Chapter Road between 2012 and 2019.

Ken Livingstone former MP and Mayor of London.

==In popular culture==
Next to Dollis Hill tube station was home to both The Future Sound of London&#x27;s Earthbeat and 4 Hero&#x27;s recording studios during the 1990s.

==Fictional references==
The fictional Dollis Hill Football Club features occasionally in the British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; as arch-rivals to Neasden Football Club, with on at least one occasion the fictional Dollis Hill South council ward used in the irregular &quot;Those Election Results In Full&quot; mock section. 

George Bowling, hero of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;, lives in Ellesmere Road.

<doc id="197820" wikidata="Q138540" url="?curid=197820" title="Michael Drayton">
<text>Michael Drayton ( – ) was an English poet who came to prominence in the Elizabethan era, continuing to write through the reign of James I and into the reign of Charles I. Many of his works consisted of historical poetry. He was also the first English-language author to write odes in the style of Horace. He died on 23 December 1631 in London.

==Early life==
Drayton was born at Hartshill, near Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, in early 1563. Not much is documented about his early life, except that in 1580 he was in the service of Thomas Goodere of Collingham, Nottinghamshire. In his early years, it is believed that Drayton entered the service of Sir Henry Goodere, who provided for Drayton&#x27;s education. Nineteenth- and 20th-century scholars, on the basis of scattered allusions in his poems and dedications, suggested that Drayton might have studied at the University of Oxford, and been intimate with the Polesworth branch of the Goodere family. More recent work has cast doubt on those speculations, suggesting that it is more likely Drayton&#x27;s &quot;social status was inferior to that of William Shakespeare and well below that of Edmund Spenser or Samuel Daniel, both of whom obtained university degrees&quot;.

==Literary career==

===1590–1602===
In 1590, he produced his first book, &quot;The Harmony of the Church&quot;, a volume of spiritual poems, dedicated to Lady Devereux. It is notable for a version of the &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, executed with considerable richness of expression. However, with the exception of forty copies, seized by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the whole edition was destroyed by public order. Nevertheless, Drayton published a vast amount within the next few years.

In 1593, appeared &quot;Idea: The Shepherd&#x27;s Garland&quot;, a collection of nine pastorals, in which he celebrated his personal love-sorrows under the pseudonym of Rowland. Drayton then produced two further &#x27;Ideas&#x27;: a cycle of 51 sonnets entitled &quot;Ideas Mirrour&quot; (1594, expanded and revised as &quot;Idea&quot; in several versions from 1599 to 1619), by which we learn that the lady lived by the river Ankor in Warwickshire, and an epyllion, &quot;Endimion and Phoebe: Ideas Latmus&quot; (1595). 

This has led to the notion that he failed to win his &quot;Idea&quot;, and lived and died a bachelor, one of a series of biographical interpretations of the poems that Jean Brink sees as &quot;romantic flourishes&quot;. 

It has been said Drayton&#x27;s sonnets possess a direct, instant and universal appeal because of their simple straightforward ring and foreshadowing of the smooth style of Fairfax, Waller and Dryden. Drayton was the first to bring the term ode, for a lyrical poem, to popularity in England and was a master of the short, staccato Anacreontics measure.

Also in 1593 there appeared the first of Drayton&#x27;s historical poems, &quot;The Legend of Piers Gaveston&quot;, and the next year saw the publication of &quot;Matilda&quot;, an epic poem in rhyme royal. It was about this time, too, that he brought out &quot;Endimion and Phoebe&quot;, a volume which he never republished, but which contains some interesting autobiographical matter, and acknowledgments of literary help from Thomas Lodge, if not from Edmund Spenser and Samuel Daniel also. In his &quot;Fig for Momus&quot;, Lodge reciprocated these friendly courtesies.

In 1596, Drayton published his long and important poem &quot;Mortimeriados&quot;, a very serious production in &quot;ottava rima&quot;. He later enlarged and modified this poem, and republished it in 1603 under the title of &quot;The Barons&#x27; Wars&quot;. In 1596 also appeared another historical poem, &quot;The Legend of Robert, Duke of Normandy&quot;, with which &quot;Piers Gaveston&quot; was reprinted. In 1597 appeared &quot;England&#x27;s Heroical Epistles&quot;, a series of historical studies, in imitation of those of Ovid. These last poems, written in the heroic couplet, contain some of the finest passages in Drayton&#x27;s writings.

===1603–1631===
By 1597, the poet was resting on his laurels. It seems that he was much favoured at the court of Elizabeth, and he hoped that it would be the same with her successor. In 1603, he addressed a poem of compliment to James I on his accession, but it was ridiculed and his services were rejected. His bitterness found expression in a satire, &quot;The Owl&quot; (1604), but he had no talent in this kind of composition. Not much more entertaining was his scriptural narrative of &quot;Moses in a Map of his Miracles&quot;, a sort of epic in heroics printed the same year. In 1605 Drayton reprinted his most important works, his historical poems and the &quot;Idea&quot;, in a single volume which ran through eight editions during his lifetime. He also collected his smaller pieces, hitherto unedited, in a volume undated, but probably published in 1605, under the title of &quot;Poems Lyric and Pastoral&quot;; these consisted of odes, eclogues and a fantastic satire called &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;. Some of the odes are extremely spirited.

He had adopted as early as 1598 the extraordinary resolution of celebrating all the points of topographical or antiquarian interest in the island of Great Britain, and on this laborious work he was engaged for many years. At last, in 1613, the first part of this vast work was published under the title of &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot;, eighteen books being produced, to which the learned John Selden supplied notes. 

The success of this work, which has since become so famous, was very small at first, and not until 1622 did Drayton succeed in finding a publisher willing to undertake the risk of bringing out twelve more books in a second part. This completed the survey of England, and the poet, who had hoped &quot;to crown Scotland with flowers,&quot; and arrive at last at the Orcades, never crossed the Tweed.

In 1627, he published another of his miscellaneous volumes, and this contains some of his most characteristic writing. It consists of the following pieces: &quot;The Battle of Agincourt&quot;, an historical poem in ottava rima (not to be confused with his ballad on the same subject), and &quot;The Miseries of Queen Margaret&quot;, written in the same verse and manner; &quot;Nimphidia, the Court of Faery&quot;, an epic of fairyland; &quot;The Quest of Cinthia&quot; and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Sirena&quot;, two lyrical pastorals; and finally &quot;The Moon Calf&quot;, a sort of satire. &quot;Nimphidia&quot; is the most critically acclaimed, along with his famous ballad on the battle of Agincourt. 

The last of Drayton&#x27;s voluminous publications was &quot;The Muses&#x27; Elizium&quot; in 1630. He died in London, was buried in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey, and had a monument placed over him by the Countess of Dorset, with memorial lines attributed to Ben Jonson. The memorial was sculpted by Edward Marshall.

===Theatre===
Like other poets of his era, Drayton was active in writing for the theatre; but unlike Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, or Samuel Daniel, he invested little of his art in the genre. For a period of only five years, from 1597 to 1602, Drayton was a member of the stable of playwrights who supplied material for the theatrical syndicate of Philip Henslowe. Henslowe&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; links Drayton&#x27;s name with 23 plays from that period, and shows that Drayton almost always worked in collaboration with other Henslowe regulars, like Thomas Dekker, Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle, among others. Of these 23 plays, only one has survived, that being Part 1 of &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot;, which Drayton composed in collaboration with Munday, Robert Wilson and Richard Hathwaye. The text of &quot;Oldcastle&quot; shows no clear signs of Drayton&#x27;s hand; traits of style consistent through the entire corpus of his poetry (the rich vocabulary of plant names, star names and other unusual words; the frequent use of original contractional forms, sometimes with double apostrophes, like &quot;th&#x27;adult&#x27;rers&quot; or &quot;pois&#x27;ned&#x27;st&quot;) are wholly absent from the text, suggesting that his contribution to the collaborative effort was not substantial. &quot;William Longsword,&quot; the one play that Henslowe&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; suggests was a solo Drayton effort, was never completed.

Drayton may have preferred the role of impresario to that of playwright; he was one of the lessees of the Whitefriars Theatre, together with Thomas Woodford, nephew of the playwright Thomas Lodge, when it was started in 1608. Around 1606, Drayton was also part of a syndicate that chartered a company of child actors, The Children of the King&#x27;s Revels. These may or may not have been the Children of Paul&#x27;s under a new name, since the latter group appears to have gone out of existence at about this time. The venture was not a success, dissolving in litigation in 1609.

===Friendships===

Drayton was a friend of some of the most famous men of the age. He corresponded familiarly with Drummond; Ben Jonson, William Browne, George Wither and others were among his friends. Vicar John Ward, who was translated to Stratford-on-Avon in 1661, in his attempt to compile hearsay of Shakespeare, wrote that &quot;Shakespear Drayton and Ben Jhonson (sic) had a merry meeting and it seems drank too hard for Shakespear died of a feavour there contracted.&quot;

In one of Drayton&#x27;s poems, an elegy or epistle to Mr Henry Reynolds, he has left some valuable criticisms on English poets from Chaucer&#x27;s time to his own, including Shakespeare. That he was a restless and discontented, as well as a worthy, man may be gathered from his own admissions.

==Editions==
In 1748 a folio edition of Drayton&#x27;s complete works was published under the editorial supervision of William Oldys, and again in 1753 there appeared an issue in four volumes quarto but these were very unintelligently and inaccurately prepared. 

A complete edition of Drayton&#x27;s works with variant readings was projected by Richard Hooper in 1876, but was never carried to a conclusion; a volume of selections, edited by A. H. Bullen, appeared in 1883. See especially Oliver Elton, &quot;Michael Drayton&quot; (1906).

A complete five-volume edition of Drayton&#x27;s work was published by Oxford in 1931–41 (revised 1961), edited by J. William Hebel, K. Tillotson and B. H. Newdigate. That and a two-volume edition of Drayton&#x27;s poems published at Harvard in 1953, edited by John Buxton, are the only 20th-century editions of his poems recorded by the Library of Congress.

<text>&quot;MUSIC/SP (Multi-User System for Interactive Computing/System Product&quot;; originally McGill University System for Interactive Computing) was developed at McGill University in the 1970s from an early IBM time-sharing system called RAX (Remote Access Computing System).

The system ran on IBM S/360, S/370, and 4300-series mainframe hardware, and offered then-novel features such as file access control and data compression. It was designed to allow academics and students to create and run their programs interactively on terminals, in an era when most mainframe computing was still being done from punched cards. Over the years, development continued and the system evolved to embrace email, the Internet and eventually the World Wide Web. At its peak in the late 1980s, there were over 200 universities, colleges and high school districts that used the system in North and South America, Europe and Asia.

&quot;MUSIC&quot; was originally designed as a stand-alone operating system but with the advent of IBM&#x27;s virtual machine facility, VM/370, it became more common to deploy &quot;MUSIC&quot; as a guest operating system running under VM/370.

==History==
* 1966 – IBM Remote Access Computing System (RAX) released.
* 1972 – McGill&#x27;s RAX modifications accepted by IBM for distribution as &quot;Installed User Program&quot; under the name of &quot;McGill University System for Interactive Computing&quot; (MUSIC).
* 1978 – MUSIC 4.0 Major change to file system providing longer file names and advanced access control.
* 1981 – MUSIC 5.0 Support for IBM 4300 series CPUs and FBA disks.
* 1985 – MUSIC/SP 1.0 Adopted by IBM as &quot;System Product&quot;. Support for virtual memory.
* 1990 – MUSIC/SP 2.2, described by &quot;IBM&quot; as having &quot;significant enhancements.&quot;
* 1991 – MUSIC/SP 2.3 Internet support and tree-structured file system.

Over the years the following people contributed to the MUSIC and MUSIC/SP systems.
Roy Miller, Alan Greenberg, Wilf Mandel, Dave Edwards, Nelson Nguyen, 
Kevin McNamee, Don Farnsworth (IBM), Dean Daniele (IBM), Glen Matthews, Linda Chernabrow, 
Frank Pettinicchio, Earl Lindberg, Pierre Goyette, Kathy Wilmot, 
Simon Fulleringer, David Thorpe, Gerald Ratzer, Harry Williams (Marist College), 
Dave Juraschek (Northern Virginia Community Colleges), Christian Robert (Ecole Polytechnique), 
Simone Spiller, Silvino Mezzari, and Mike Short.

==Features==

===File system===
The MUSIC/SP file system was unique in a number of respects. There was a single system-wide file index. The owner&#x27;s userid and the file name were hashed to locate the file in this index, so any file on the system could be located with a single I/O operation. However, this presented a flat file system to the user. It lacked the directory structure commonly offered by DOS, Microsoft Windows and Unix systems. In 1990 a &quot;tree-structured&quot; directory view of the file system was overlaid on this, bringing the system more in line with the file systems that were then available. By default the information stored in the files was compressed. This offered considerable saving in disk space. The file system had a fairly sophisticated access control scheme allowing the owner to control who could read, write, append to and execute the file. It also had the concept of a &quot;public&quot; file which was visible to all users and a &quot;private&quot; file which was only visible to the owner.

===Virtual memory===
The initial versions of the system provided no support for virtual memory and address translation. Only one active user could reside in core memory at any time. Swapping (to disk) was used to time-share between different users, and a variable-length timeslice was used. Virtual memory support was introduced in 1985. This allowed multiple users to be in core memory at the same time, removed many of the restrictions in the size of the programs that could be run and provided a significant performance improvement. System performance was also improved by pre-loading commonly used modules into virtual memory at startup time where they could be available to all users simultaneously.

===Programming languages===
The system was designed to support academic computing and the teaching of computer science, so a rich suite of programming languages was available. The system nucleus was written in IBM/370 assembler but most of the native applications were written in FORTRAN. The system supported the Waterloo WATFIV and WATBOL compilers and also provided compilers for Pascal, C, PL/I, BASIC, APL, ALGOL, RPG, and GPSS. The system was missing a command scripting language until REXX was ported from CMS in 1984. Later, in 1986, a complete user interface was written entirely in REXX.

===E-mail and the Internet===
E-mail was one of the major applications on MUSIC/SP. The e-mail interface initially provided access to local e-mail. As the networks developed, this was expanded to provide access to BITNET and Internet based e-mail. MUSIC/SP did not have direct access to the Internet until 1990, when the University of Wisconsin WiscNet TCP/IP code was ported to the system, allowing the system to provide access to all Internet services.

===Compatibility with other IBM systems===
A major feature of the system was its ability to run programs that were designed to run on IBM&#x27;s mainstream operating system (MVS). This was accomplished using an MVS emulator that intercepted system calls at the Supervisor Call instruction (SVC) level. Most third-party applications ran in this mode. Rather than write their own version of an application, the MUSIC/SP developers would usually start from the MVS version and rebuild it to run in MVS emulation mode. Since the MVS emulation was a small subset of the real thing, the applications generally ran more efficiently on MUSIC/SP.

===Other features===
One major advantage the system had in educational environments was that through the use of special lines called &quot;control cards&quot; at the top of a file, source files for any supported language could be automatically directed to the appropriate compiler (Fortran being the default), compiled, linked, and executed, (with compilation, linkage, and execution options also specified in control cards) simply by entering the filename on a command line.

A wide variety of terminals were supported as of 1980, including both EBCDIC-based units using IBM-proprietary protocols, and asynchronous ASCII-based units. Since terminals were connected through various types of front-end processors (as per common IBM timesharing practice both then and now), and could therefore function without CPU attention for a considerable amount of time, MUSIC used variable-length time slices, which could, on compute-bound processing, reach a maximum of several seconds per time slice; conversely, if a user filled the output buffer or reached a conversational read, the timeslice would end immediately.

==Emulation==
The &quot;Sim390&quot; emulator contains a demonstration system of MUSIC/SP. It is freely available and runs on Microsoft Windows. The demonstration system will also run under Hercules.

<text>Dollis Hill is a London Underground station at Dollis Hill near to Willesden and Gladstone Park in the London Borough of Brent. It is on the Jubilee line between Neasden and Willesden Green stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 3. Metropolitan line trains pass through the station without stopping.

==Gallery==
==History==

The station opened on 1 October 1909 as part of the Metropolitan Railway.

The current art deco style platform buildings were built in 1938, and were designed by architect Stanley Heaps

From 20 November 1939, it was on the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line and was transferred to the Jubilee line in 1979. It has two exits, north to Chapter Road and south to Burnley Road.

In 1995 four sets of enamel panels designed by Amanda Duncan were installed in the subway between the north and south exits. The panels show maps of the Dollis Hill area at different dates from the 16th to the 20th century, juxtaposed with interpretations of classical star maps.

The station was refurbished in 2007 with the addition of new lighting, tiling and additional security cameras. The station was also repainted.

==Services==
Dollis Hill station is on the Jubilee line between Neasden to the north and Willesden Green to the south. Train frequencies vary throughout the day but generally operate every 3–6 minutes between 05:56 and 00:30 in both directions.


==Connections==
London Bus routes 6, 52, 98, 226, 260, 266, 297, 302 and 460, and night route N98 serve the station. Furthermore, routes 6, 52, 266 and 297 are 24-hour services.

<doc id="197824" wikidata="Q23828" url="?curid=197824" title="Immutable object">
<text>In object-oriented (OO) and functional programming, an immutable object (unchangeable object) is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created. In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change, but the object&#x27;s state appears unchanging from an external point of view. For example, an object that uses to cache the results of expensive computations could still be considered an immutable object.

Strings and other concrete objects are typically expressed as immutable objects to improve readability and runtime efficiency in object-oriented programming. Immutable objects are also useful because they are inherently thread-safe. Other benefits are that they are simpler to understand and reason about and offer higher security than mutable objects.

== Concepts ==

=== Immutable variables ===
In imperative programming, values held in program variables whose content never changes are known as &quot;constants&quot; to differentiate them from variables that could be altered during execution. Examples include conversion factors from meters to feet, or the value of pi to several decimal places.

Read-only fields may be calculated when the program runs (unlike constants, which are known beforehand), but never change after they are initialized.

=== Weak vs strong immutability ===
Sometimes, one talks of certain &quot;fields&quot; of an object being immutable. This means that there is no way to change those parts of the object state, even though other parts of the object may be changeable (&quot;weakly immutable&quot;). If all fields are immutable, then the object is immutable. If the whole object cannot be extended by another class, the object is called &quot;strongly immutable&quot;. This might, for example, help to explicitly enforce certain invariants about certain data in the object staying the same through the lifetime of the object. In some languages, this is done with a keyword (e.g. codice_1 in C++, codice_2 in Java) that designates the field as immutable. Some languages reverse it: in OCaml, fields of an object or record are by default immutable, and must be explicitly marked with codice_3 to be so.

=== References to objects ===
In most object-oriented languages, objects can be referred to using references. Some examples of such languages are Java, C++, C#, VB.NET, and many scripting languages, such as Perl, Python, and Ruby. In this case, it matters whether the state of an object can vary when objects are shared via references.

=== Referencing vs copying objects ===
If an object is known to be immutable, it is preferred to create a reference of it instead of copying the entire object. This is done to conserve memory by preventing data duplication and avoid calls to constructors and destructors; it also results in a potential boost in execution speed.

The reference copying technique is much more difficult to use for mutable objects, because if any user of a mutable object reference changes it, all other users of that reference see the change. If this is not the intended effect, it can be difficult to notify the other users to have them respond correctly. In these situations, defensive copying of the entire object rather than the reference is usually an easy but costly solution. The observer pattern is an alternative technique for handling changes to mutable objects.

=== Copy-on-write ===
A technique that blends the advantages of mutable and immutable objects, and is supported directly in almost all modern hardware, is copy-on-write (COW). Using this technique, when a user asks the system to copy an object, it instead merely creates a new reference that still points to the same object. As soon as a user attempts to modify the object through a particular reference, the system makes a real copy, applies the modification to that, and sets the reference to refer to the new copy. The other users are unaffected, because they still refer to the original object. Therefore, under COW, all users appear to have a mutable version of their objects, although in the case that users do not modify their objects, the space-saving and speed advantages of immutable objects are preserved. Copy-on-write is popular in virtual memory systems because it allows them to save memory space while still correctly handling anything an application program might do.

=== Interning ===
The practice of always using references in place of copies of equal objects is known as &quot;interning&quot;. If interning is used, two objects are considered equal if and only if their references, typically represented as pointers or integers, are equal. Some languages do this automatically: for example, Python automatically interns short strings. If the algorithm that implements interning is guaranteed to do so in every case that it is possible, then comparing objects for equality is reduced to comparing their pointers – a substantial gain in speed in most applications. (Even if the algorithm is not guaranteed to be comprehensive, there still exists the possibility of a fast path case improvement when the objects are equal and use the same reference.) Interning is generally only useful for immutable objects.

=== Thread safety ===
Immutable objects can be useful in multi-threaded applications. Multiple threads can act on data represented by immutable objects without concern of the data being changed by other threads. Immutable objects are therefore considered more &quot;thread-safe&quot; than mutable objects.

=== Violating immutability ===
Immutability does not imply that the object as stored in the computer&#x27;s memory is unwriteable. Rather, immutability is a compile-time construct that indicates what a programmer can do through the normal interface of the object, not necessarily what they can absolutely do (for instance, by circumventing the type system or violating const correctness in C or C++).

== Language-specific details ==
In Python, Java and the .NET Framework, strings are immutable objects. Both Java and the .NET Framework have mutable versions of string. In Java these are codice_4 and codice_5 (mutable versions of Java ) and in .NET this is codice_6 (mutable version of .Net codice_7). Python 3 has a mutable string (bytes) variant, named codice_8.

Additionally, all of the primitive wrapper classes in Java are immutable.

Similar patterns are the Immutable Interface and Immutable Wrapper.

In pure functional programming languages it is not possible to create mutable objects without extending the language (e.g. via a mutable references library or a foreign function interface), so all objects are immutable.

=== Ada ===
In Ada, any object is declared either &quot;variable&quot; (i.e. mutable; typically the implicit default), or codice_9 (i.e. immutable) via the codice_9 keyword.

 type Some_type is new Integer; -- could be anything more complicated
 x: constant Some_type:= 1; -- immutable
 y: Some_type; -- mutable

Subprogram parameters are immutable in the &quot;in&quot; mode, and mutable in the &quot;in out&quot; and &quot;out&quot; modes.

 procedure Do_it(a: in Integer; b: in out Integer; c: out Integer) is
 begin
 -- a is immutable
 b:= b + a;
 c:= a;
 end Do_it;
=== C# ===
In C# you can enforce immutability of the fields of a class with the codice_11 statement.
By enforcing all the fields as immutable, you obtain an immutable type.
class AnImmutableType
 public readonly double _value;
 public AnImmutableType(double x) 
 _value = x; 
 public AnImmutableType Square() 
 return new AnImmutableType(_value * _value); 
}
C# have records which are immutable.

record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
=== C++ ===
In C++, a const-correct implementation of codice_12 would allow the user to create instances of the class and then use them as either codice_1 (immutable) or mutable, as desired, by providing two different versions of the codice_14 method. (Notice that in C++ it is not necessary — and in fact impossible — to provide a specialized constructor for codice_1 instances.)
class Cart {
 public:
 Cart(std::vector&lt;Item&gt; items): items_(items) {}

 std::vector&lt;Item&gt;&amp; items() { return items_; }
 const std::vector&lt;Item&gt;&amp; items() const { return items_; }

 int ComputeTotalCost() const { /* return sum of the prices */ }

 private:
 std::vector&lt;Item&gt; items_;


Note that, when there is a data member that is a pointer or reference to another object, then it is possible to mutate the object pointed to or referenced only within a non-const method.

C++ also provides abstract (as opposed to bitwise) immutability via the codice_3 keyword, which lets a member variable be changed from within a codice_1 method.
class Cart {
 public:
 Cart(std::vector&lt;Item&gt; items): items_(items) {}

 const std::vector&lt;Item&gt;&amp; items() const { return items_; }

 int ComputeTotalCost() const {
 if (total_cost_) {
 return *total_cost_;

 int total_cost = 0;
 for (const auto&amp; item : items_) {
 total_cost += item.Cost();
 total_cost_ = total_cost;
 return total_cost;

 private:
 std::vector&lt;Item&gt; items_;
 mutable std::optional&lt;int&gt; total_cost_;


=== D ===

In D, there exist two type qualifiers, codice_1 and codice_19, for variables that cannot be changed. Unlike C++&#x27;s codice_1, Java&#x27;s codice_2, and C#&#x27;s codice_11, they are transitive and recursively apply to anything reachable through references of such a variable. The difference between codice_1 and codice_19 is what they apply to: codice_1 is a property of the variable: there might legally exist mutable references to referred value, i.e. the value can actually change. In contrast, codice_19 is a property of the referred value: the value and anything transitively reachable from it cannot change (without breaking the type system, leading to undefined behavior). Any reference of that value must be marked codice_1 or codice_19. Basically for any unqualified type codice_29, codice_30 is the disjoint union of codice_29 (mutable) and codice_32.
class C {
 /*mutable*/ Object mField;
 const Object cField;
 immutable Object iField;

For a mutable codice_33 object, its codice_34 can be written to. For a codice_35 object, codice_34 cannot be modified, it inherits codice_1; codice_38 is still immutable as it is the stronger guarantee. For an codice_39, all fields are immutable.

In a function like this:
void func(C m, const C c, immutable C i)
{ /* inside the braces */ }
Inside the braces, codice_40 might refer to the same object as codice_41, so mutations to codice_41 could indirectly change codice_40 as well. Also, 
codice_40 might refer to the same object as codice_45, but since the value then is immutable, there are no changes. However, codice_41 and codice_45 cannot legally refer to the same object.

In the language of guarantees, mutable has no guarantees (the function might change the object), codice_1 is an outward-only guarantee that the function will not change anything, and 
codice_19 is a bidirectional guarantee (the function will not change the value and the caller must not change it).

Values that are codice_1 or codice_19 must be initialized by direct assignment at the point of declaration or by a constructor.

Because codice_1 parameters forget if the value was mutable or not, a similar construct, codice_53, acts, in a sense, as a variable for mutability information.
A function of type codice_54 returns codice_55 typed values for mutable, const and immutable arguments. In contrast, a function of type codice_56 returns codice_57 for mutable codice_29 arguments, codice_55 for codice_30 values, and codice_61 for codice_32 values.

Casting immutable values to mutable inflicts undefined behavior upon change, even if the original value comes from a mutable origin. Casting mutable values to immutable can be legal when there remain no mutable references afterward. &quot;An expression may be converted from mutable (...) to immutable if the expression is unique and all expressions it transitively refers to are either unique or immutable.&quot; If the compiler cannot prove uniqueness, the casting can be done explicitly and it is up to the programmer to ensure that no mutable references exist.

The type codice_63 is an alias for codice_64, i.e. a typed slice of memory of immutable characters. Making substrings is cheap, as it just copies and modifies a pointer and a length filed, and safe, as the underlying data cannot be changed. Objects of type codice_65 can refer to strings, but also to mutable buffers.

Making a shallow copy of a const or immutable value removes the outer layer of immutability: Copying an immutable string (codice_66) returns a string (codice_64). The immutable pointer and length are being copied and the copies are mutable. The referred data has not been copied and keeps its qualifier, in the example codice_19. It can be stripped by making a depper copy, e.g. using the codice_69 function.

=== Java ===
A classic example of an immutable object is an instance of the Java codice_7 class
String s = &quot;ABC&quot;;
s.toLowerCase(); // This accomplishes nothing!
The method codice_71 does not change the data &quot;ABC&quot; that codice_72 contains. Instead, a new String object is instantiated and given the data &quot;abc&quot; during its construction. A reference to this String object is returned by the codice_71 method. To make the String codice_72 contain the data &quot;abc&quot;, a different approach is needed:
s = s.toLowerCase();
Now the String codice_72 references a new String object that contains &quot;abc&quot;. There is nothing in the syntax of the &quot;declaration&quot; of the class String that enforces it as immutable; rather, none of the String class&#x27;s methods ever affect the data that a String object contains, thus making it immutable.

The keyword codice_2 (detailed article) is used in implementing immutable primitive types and object references, but it cannot, by itself, make &quot;the objects themselves&quot; immutable. See below examples:

Primitive type variables (codice_77, codice_78, codice_79, etc.) can be reassigned after being defined. This can be prevented by using codice_2.
int i = 42; //int is a primitive type
i = 43; // OK

final int j = 42;
j = 43; // does not compile. j is final so can&#x27;t be reassigned 

Reference types cannot be made immutable just by using the codice_2 keyword. codice_2 only prevents reassignment.
final MyObject m = new MyObject(); //m is of reference type
m.data = 100; // OK. We can change state of object m (m is mutable and final doesn&#x27;t change this fact)
m = new MyObject(); // does not compile. m is final so can&#x27;t be reassigned 

Primitive wrappers (codice_83, codice_84, codice_85, codice_86, codice_87, codice_88, codice_89, codice_90) are also all immutable. Immutable classes can be implemented by following a few simple guidelines.

=== JavaScript ===
In JavaScript, all primitive types (Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, Symbol) are immutable, but custom objects are generally mutable.
function doSomething(x) { /* does changing x here change the original? */ };
var str = &#x27;a string&#x27;;
var obj = { an: &#x27;object&#x27; };
doSomething(str); // strings, numbers and bool types are immutable, function gets a copy
doSomething(obj); // objects are passed in by reference and are mutable inside function
doAnotherThing(str, obj); // `str` has not changed, but `obj` may have.
To simulate immutability in an object, one may define properties as read-only (writable: false).
var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, &#x27;foo&#x27;, { value: &#x27;bar&#x27;, writable: false });
obj.foo = &#x27;bar2&#x27;; // silently ignored
However, the approach above still lets new properties be added. Alternatively, one may use Object.freeze to make existing objects immutable.
var obj = { foo: &#x27;bar&#x27; };
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.foo = &#x27;bars&#x27;; // cannot edit property, silently ignored
obj.foo2 = &#x27;bar2&#x27;; // cannot add property, silently ignored
With the implementation of ECMA262, JavaScript has the ability to create immutable references that cannot be reassigned. However, using a codice_1 declaration doesn&#x27;t mean that value of the read-only reference is immutable, just that the name cannot be assigned to a new value.
const ALWAYS_IMMUTABLE = true;

try {
 ALWAYS_IMMUTABLE = false;
} catch (err) {
 console.log(&quot;Can&#x27;t reassign an immutable reference.&quot;);

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
The use of immutable state has become a rising trend in JavaScript since the introduction of React, which favours Flux-like state management patterns such as Redux.

=== Perl ===
In Perl, one can create an immutable class with the Moo library by simply declaring all the attributes read only:

package Immutable;
use Moo;

has value =&gt; (
 is =&gt; &#x27;ro&#x27;, # read only
 default =&gt; &#x27;data&#x27;, # can be overridden by supplying the constructor with
 # a value: Immutable-&gt;new(value =&gt; &#x27;something else&#x27;);

1;

Creating an immutable class used to require two steps: first, creating accessors (either automatically or manually) that prevent modification of object attributes, and secondly, preventing direct modification of the instance data of instances of that class (this was usually stored in a hash reference, and could be locked with Hash::Util&#x27;s lock_hash function):

package Immutable;
use strict;
use warnings;
use base qw(Class::Accessor);
# create read-only accessors
__PACKAGE__-&gt;mk_ro_accessors(qw(value));
use Hash::Util &#x27;lock_hash&#x27;;

sub new {
 my $class = shift;
 return $class if ref($class);
 die &quot;Arguments to new must be key =&gt; value pairs\n&quot;
 unless (@_ % 2 == 0);
 my %defaults = (
 value =&gt; &#x27;data&#x27;,
 my $obj = {
 %defaults,
 @_,
 bless $obj, $class;
 # prevent modification of the object data
 lock_hash %$obj;
1;

Or, with a manually written accessor:

package Immutable;
use strict;
use warnings;
use Hash::Util &#x27;lock_hash&#x27;;

sub new {
 my $class = shift;
 return $class if ref($class);
 die &quot;Arguments to new must be key =&gt; value pairs\n&quot;
 unless (@_ % 2 == 0);
 my %defaults = (
 value =&gt; &#x27;data&#x27;,
 my $obj = {
 %defaults,
 @_,
 bless $obj, $class;
 # prevent modification of the object data
 lock_hash %$obj;

# read-only accessor
sub value {
 my $self = shift;
 if (my $new_value = shift) {
 # trying to set a new value
 die &quot;This object cannot be modified\n&quot;;
 } else {
 return $self-&gt;{value}
}
1;
=== PHP ===
In PHP have readonly properties since version 8.1 and readonly classes since version 8.2.
readonly class BlogData
 public string $title;

 public Status $status;

 public function __construct(string $title, Status $status)
 $this-&gt;title = $title;
 $this-&gt;status = $status;
}
=== Python ===
In Python, some built-in types (numbers, Booleans, strings, tuples, frozensets) are immutable, but custom classes are generally mutable. To simulate immutability in a class, one could override attribute setting and deletion to raise exceptions:
class ImmutablePoint:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;An immutable class with two attributes &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27;.&quot;&quot;&quot;

 __slots__ = [&#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;]

 def __setattr__(self, *args):
 raise TypeError(&quot;Can not modify immutable instance.&quot;)

 __delattr__ = __setattr__

 def __init__(self, x, y):
 # We can no longer use self.value = value to store the instance data
 # so we must explicitly call the superclass
 super().__setattr__(&#x27;x&#x27;, x)
 super().__setattr__(&#x27;y&#x27;, y)
The standard library helpers codice_92 and codice_93, available from Python 3.6 onward, create simple immutable classes. The following example is roughly equivalent to the above, plus some tuple-like features:
from typing import NamedTuple
import collections

Point = collections.namedtuple(&#x27;Point&#x27;, [&#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;])

# the following creates a similar namedtuple to the above
class Point(NamedTuple):
 x: int
 y: int
Introduced in Python 3.7, codice_94 allow developers to emulate immutability with frozen instances. If a frozen dataclass is built, codice_94 will override codice_96 and codice_97 to raise codice_98 if invoked.
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Point:
 x: int
 y: int
=== Racket ===
Racket substantially diverges from other Scheme implementations by making its core pair type (&quot;cons cells&quot;) immutable. Instead, it provides a parallel mutable pair type, via codice_99, codice_100, codice_101 etc. In addition, many immutable types are supported, for example, immutable strings and vectors, and these are used extensively. New structs are immutable by default, unless a field is specifically declared mutable, or the whole struct:

(struct foo1 (x y)) ; all fields immutable
(struct foo2 (x [y #:mutable])) ; one mutable field
(struct foo3 (x y) #:mutable) ; all fields mutable

The language also supports immutable hash tables, implemented functionally, and immutable dictionaries.

=== Rust ===
Rust&#x27;s ownership system allows developers to declare immutable variables, and pass immutable references. By default, all variables and references are immutable. Mutable variables and references are explicitly created with the codice_102 keyword.

Constant items in Rust are always immutable. 
// constant items are always immutable
const ALWAYS_IMMUTABLE: bool = true;

struct Object {
 x: usize,
 y: usize,

fn main() {
 // explicitly declare a mutable variable
 let mut mutable_obj = Object { x: 1, y: 2 };
 mutable_obj.x = 3; // okay

 let mutable_ref = &amp;mut mutable_obj;
 mutable_ref.x = 1; // okay

 let immutable_ref = &amp;mutable_obj;
 immutable_ref.x = 3; // error E0594

 // by default, variables are immutable
 let immutable_obj = Object { x: 4, y: 5 };
 immutable_obj.x = 6; // error E0596

 let mutable_ref2 = 
 &amp;mut immutable_obj; // error E0596

 let immutable_ref2 = &amp;immutable_obj;
 immutable_ref2.x = 6; // error E0594
}
=== Scala ===
In Scala, any entity (narrowly, a binding) can be defined as mutable or immutable: in the declaration, one can use codice_103 (value) for immutable entities and codice_104 (variable) for mutable ones. Note that even though an immutable binding can not be reassigned, it may still refer to a mutable object and it is still possible to call mutating methods on that object: the &quot;binding&quot; is immutable, but the underlying &quot;object&quot; may be mutable.

For example, the following code snippet:

val maxValue = 100
var currentValue = 1

defines an immutable entity codice_105 (the integer type is inferred at compile-time) and a mutable entity named codice_106.

By default, collection classes such as codice_107 and codice_108 are immutable, so update-methods return a new instance rather than mutating an existing one. While this may sound inefficient, the implementation of these classes and their guarantees of immutability mean that the new instance can re-use existing nodes, which, especially in the case of creating copies, is very efficient.

<text>PmWiki is a wiki-based content management system designed for a collaborative creation and maintenance of websites.

It is free software written in PHP, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

TV Tropes is a well-known example of a website that uses PmWiki, but it runs on a heavily modified fork of it.

==Design focus==
The PmWiki philosophy prioritizes writers over readers, aiming to facilitate easy document authoring despite limitations in document types. It supports collaborative website maintenance with built-in tools for access control, delegation, monitoring, review, and edit reversion. Ease of maintenance is a key design goal, and PmWiki is configurable and extensible, allowing independent updates to the core while maintaining compatibility with local customizations.

In addition to standard collaborative features like content management and knowledge bases, PmWiki is utilized by companies and groups as an internal communication platform offering tools for task management and meeting archives. It is also employed by university and research teams.

The PmWiki wiki markup includes unique features not found in other wiki engines. The PmWiki markup engine is customizable, and markup rules can be added, replaced or removed, and it can support other markup languages. As an example, the Creole specifications can be enabled. The edit form, since version 2.3.0, can have syntax highlighting enabled for its own wiki markup dialect.

==Features==

===Content storage===
PmWiki uses regular text files to store content. Each page of the wiki is stored in its own file on the web server. By default pages are stored in 8-bit or UTF-8 encoding, with page text, metadata, and revision history in the same file. According to the author, &quot;For the standard operations (view, edit, page revisions), holding the information in flat files is clearly faster than accessing them in a database...&quot;

The storage class is extensible, allowing add-ons to enable other storage systems and formats. For example, with add-ons, a website can use SQLite or MySQL databases, or XML files for storage.

PmWiki supports &quot;attachments&quot; (uploads: images or other files) to its wiki pages. The attachments can be versioned. There are PmWiki add-ons allowing easier management of the uploaded files, e.g. deletion or thumbnail/gallery creation.

===Wiki structure===
Wiki pages are contained within namespaces, called &quot;wiki groups&quot;. Multiple namespaces can be used, and each namespace can have its own configuration options, add-ons, access control, skin, styles, sidebar (menu), the language of the content, and interface.

Hierarchically, every page is contained in a namespace. It is possible to display and navigate through pages in a tree-like structure with a &quot;wiki trail&quot;. Through recipes, it is possible to have a flat structure (no wiki groups), multiple nested groups, or sub-pages.

Special namespaces are &quot;PmWiki&quot;, Site, SiteAdmin, and Category which contain the documentation and some configuration templates.

=== Markup ===
The PmWiki markup shares similarities with MediaWiki. Here is a sample of commonly used markup rules.

Links are usually wrapped in double brackets, optionally with link text:

It is possible to enable internal links for CamelCase words without brackets, and add-ons can enable other link markups like codice_1.

Headings are preceded with exclamation marks:
It is possible to enable an automated table of contents coming with the PmWiki core, or install one among several Table of contents add-ons.

Lists are prefixed by &quot;*&quot; (bulleted) and &quot;#&quot; (numbered) and can be nested:
Directives for listing pages and attachments, and including pages and templates:
Other page directives allow setting the page title, description, and keywords, disabling layout sections like sidebars or footers, creating tables, or defining page text variables. Add-ons allow for extra functionality.

Inline markup:
Other markup rules can be enabled through recipes (add-ons).

HTML is not available for the edit form out of the box, but it is possible to enable selected tags through add-ons.

===Skin templates===
PmWiki offers a skin template scheme that makes it possible to change the look and feel of the wiki or website with a high degree of flexibility in both functionality and appearance.

Since version 2.3.30, the core responsive skin can have a dark theme enabled. The dark mode functions are available for reuse by custom skins.

===Access control===
PmWiki permits users and administrators to establish password protection for individual pages, groups of pages, or the entire site. For example, defined zones may be established to enable collaborative work by certain groups, such as in a company intranet.

Password protection can be applied to reading, editing, uploading to, and changing passwords for the restricted zone. The out-of-the-box installation uses &quot;shared passwords&quot; rather than login names, but a built-in option can enable a sophisticated user/group-based access control system on pages, groups of pages or the whole wiki.

PmWiki can use passwords from config files, special wiki pages, and .htpasswd/.htgroup files. There are also user-based authorization possibilities and authentication via various external sources (e.g. LDAP, forum databases, etc.).

===Customization===
PmWiki follows a design philosophy with the main objectives of ease of installation, maintainability, and keeping non-required features out of the core distribution of the software. This design encourages customization with a wide selection of custom extensions, known as &quot;recipes&quot; available from the PmWiki Cookbook. Creating and maintaining extensions and custom installations is easy thanks to a number of well documented hooks in the wiki engine.

==System requirements==
Recent PmWiki releases require a web server that can run PHP version 5.4 or more recent. PmWiki can be deployed to standard hosting providers, or locally. There is a &quot;recipe&quot; to allow running PmWiki &quot;Standalone&quot;, with the PHP built-in webserver, for example from a USB flash drive.

<doc id="197828" wikidata="Q954735" url="?curid=197828" title="Samuel Daniel">
<text>Samuel Daniel (1562–1619) was an English poet, playwright and historian in the late-Elizabethan and early-Jacobean eras. He was an innovator in a wide range of literary genres. His best-known works are the sonnet cycle &quot;Delia&quot;, the epic poem &quot;The Civil Wars Between the Houses of Lancaster and York&quot;, the dialogue in verse &quot;Musophilus&quot;, and the essay on English poetry &quot;A Defence of Rhyme&quot;. He was considered one of the preeminent authors of his time and his works had a significant influence on contemporary writers, including William Shakespeare. Daniel&#x27;s writings continued to influence authors for centuries after his death, especially the Romantic poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. C. S. Lewis called Daniel &quot;the most interesting man of letters&quot; whom the sixteenth century produced in England.

==Life and literary career==
===Early life, education, and relationship with John Florio===
Little is known about Samuel Daniel&#x27;s early life. Biographer Thomas Fuller in &quot;Histories of the Worthies of England&quot; (1662) states that he &quot;was born not far from Taunton&quot; in Somerset. The earliest evidence providing definitive details of his life is an entry in the signature book of Oxford University documenting his matriculation at Magdalen Hall (now Hertford College) on &quot;17 Nov., 1581, aged 19&quot;. Daniel did not complete his degree at Oxford; Anthony à Wood in &quot;Athenae Oxonienses&quot; (1691) states that he &quot;was more prone to easier and smoother studies, than in pecking and hewing at logic&quot;.
While at Oxford, Daniel met the author and translator John Florio, who was teaching Italian at the university at the time. In 1582, Daniel contributed a Latin verse to Florio&#x27;s &quot;Giardino di Recreatione&quot;. Daniel maintained a relationship with Florio for years thereafter. He wrote a dedicatory poem that was included in Florio&#x27;s translation of Michel de Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; in 1603. The second edition of Florio&#x27;s Montaigne, published in 1613, included a revised version of Daniel&#x27;s dedication in which the poet referred to Florio as &quot;my dear friend and brother&quot;. This has led to the inference that either Florio had married Daniel&#x27;s sister or Daniel had married Florio&#x27;s sister, an inference that has never been proven.

===1585–1591: First published work and patronage of Sir Edward Dymoke===
Daniel&#x27;s first published work was &quot;The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius&quot;, a translation of an Italian treatise on impresa or emblems by historian Paolo Giovio. This emblem book was published in 1585 by Simon Waterson, who would remain Daniel&#x27;s friend and principal publisher for the rest of his life. The &quot;Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius&quot; was dedicated to Sir Edward Dymoke, the Queen&#x27;s Champion. Daniel&#x27;s association with Dymoke was the first of a series of close relationships with noble patrons that came to characterise the author&#x27;s literary career.

Dymoke wrote a letter of introduction on Daniel&#x27;s behalf which allowed the young student to live in the English embassy in France between 1585 and 1586 as he advanced his studies. Between 1590 and 1591, he returned to the continent, travelling part of the time accompanied by Dymoke. Daniel and Dymoke met the poet Giovanni Battista Guarini in Italy and defended English as a language worthy of poetry and great writers.

===1591–1593: Patronage of Mary Sidney, &quot;Delia&quot;, &quot;Rosamond&quot;, and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;===

Daniel&#x27;s literary career was effectively launched in late 1591 with the unauthorized inclusion of some of his &quot;Delia&quot; sonnets in the posthumous first edition of Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot;. Sidney&#x27;s sister, Mary Sidney, the Countess of Pembroke, objected to the surreptitious publication of her brother&#x27;s work, and the edition was recalled by the Stationers Company. In 1592, Daniel published the first authorized edition of his own poetic works, the sonnet cycle &quot;Delia&quot;, and the historical poem &quot;The Complaint of Rosamond&quot;. Daniel dedicated &quot;Delia&quot; to Mary Sidney and begged her forgiveness for the inclusion of his poems in the unauthorized edition of her brother&#x27;s work, claiming that he had been &quot;betrayed by the indiscretions of a greedy printer.&quot; Soon after the publication of &quot;Delia&quot; and &quot;Rosamond&quot;, Daniel was invited to join the Pembroke household, serving the family in some capacity, perhaps as tutor to the twelve-year-old William Herbert. He also joined a group of writers encouraged by Mary Sidney that has come to be referred to as the Wilton Circle, a group that included Edmund Spenser, Michael Drayton, Sir John Davies, and Abraham Fraunce.

Immediately upon the publication of &quot;Delia&quot; and &quot;Rosamond&quot;, Daniel began receiving praise from English poets and scholars, including Thomas Nashe, Thomas Churchyard, and Gabriel Harvey. Edmund Spenser, at the time England&#x27;s most highly regarded living author, endorsed Daniel in &quot;Colin Clouts Come Home Again&quot; (1595), stating that &quot;there is a new shepherd late upsprung, / The which doth all afore him far surpass&quot; and imploring his fellow poet to &quot;rouse thy feathers quickly, Daniel, / And to what course thou please thyself advance&quot;.

From 1592 to 1593, under the patronage of Mary Sidney, Daniel completed &quot;The Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot;, which was published in 1594. The play was written at the request of Sidney as a sequel to Robert Garnier&#x27;s French tragedy &quot;Marc-Antoine&quot;, a play she had translated into English as &quot;The Tragedy of Antony&quot; and published in 1592. Both plays were written in the style of classical closet drama, plays more intended to be read than performed. During the early to mid-twentieth century literary critics postulated that the plays were part of Mary Sidney&#x27;s effort to reform English theater, returning it to classical standards espoused by her brother, Philip Sidney, in his &quot;Defence of Poesy&quot;. This view of Mary Sidney&#x27;s work was advanced by T. S. Eliot in his 1932 essay, &quot;Apology for the Countess of Pembroke&quot;. Subsequent literary criticism, however, has suggested that Sidney&#x27;s literary efforts were not part of a campaign against English drama, but rather were efforts to adapt continental works on history for an English audience and use them for contemporary political commentary.

===1594–1601: Mountjoy, &quot;Civil Wars&quot;, &quot;Poetical Essays&quot;, and &quot;Works&quot;===
After the publication of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, Daniel parted ways with Mary Sidney and experienced financial difficulties. He was taken in by Charles Blount, Baron Mountjoy, as described in the first edition of Daniel&#x27;s epic poem about the Wars of the Roses, &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars Between the Two Houses of Lancaster and York&quot;, published in 1595. The poem included complimentary references to Mountjoy and a section praising him and his close friend Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex. Daniel had worked at Essex&#x27;s estate, Wanstead, as he wrote the initial version of his poem.

Between 1595 and 1599, Daniel added a fifth book to &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; and included the expanded poem in &quot;The Poetical Essays of Samuel Daniel&quot;, a collection of his works dedicated to Mountjoy and published in 1599. The collection included revised versions of &quot;Delia&quot;, &quot;Rosamond&quot;, and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, as well as two new works, &quot;Musophilus&quot; and &quot;A Letter From Octavia to Marcus Antonius&quot;. &quot;Musophilus&quot; was dedicated to Daniel&#x27;s friend and fellow poet Fulke Greville, whose discussions with Daniel had inspired the dialogue in verse, a debate between a poet and a courtier on the value of writing poetry relative to more worldly pursuits. &quot;A Letter from Octavia&quot; was dedicated to Margaret Clifford, the Countess of Cumberland, whose relationship with her philandering husband inspired Daniel&#x27;s sympathetic portrayal of Mark Antony&#x27;s wife, Octavia. The use of the word &quot;Essays&quot; in the title of the collection may have been inspired by Montaigne&#x27;s French work that had used the same word in its title. Like Montaigne&#x27;s writings, Daniel&#x27;s collection included works that debated topics in a contemplative, self-reflective style.
During the late 1590s to first years of the 1600s, Daniel took on the role of tutor to the young Anne Clifford, daughter of the Countess of Cumberland, the woman to whom he had dedicated &quot;A Letter to Octavia&quot;. Anne Clifford maintained a sense of gratitude and affection toward Daniel through the rest of her life. She included his portrait and volumes of his works in the family triptych she commissioned that has come to be known as &quot;The Great Picture&quot;.

In 1601, a new collection of Daniel&#x27;s writings was published titled &quot;The Works of Samuel Daniel, Newly Augmented&quot;. Once again, the collection contained revised editions of his earlier works, including an expanded version of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; that now extended to a sixth book. &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; was newly dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, likely reflecting Daniel&#x27;s elevated stature as one of the leading poets of the day, regarded by some as the successor to Edmund Spenser, who had died in 1599.

===1603–1607: Royal patronage, &quot;Philotas&quot;, and the death of Mountjoy===

After Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s death and King James&#x27;s accession in 1603, Daniel quickly became associated with the new court. Through the support of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, he presented his &quot;Panegyrick Congratulatory to the King&#x27;s Most Excellent Majesty&quot; to the new king in April of that year. A revised version of the poem was published later in 1603, along with Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot; addressed to various members of the nobility and his essay &quot;A Defence of Rhyme&quot;.

Daniel became closely associated with King James&#x27;s queen, Anne (or Anna) of Denmark, who commissioned him to write a masque, &quot;The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses&quot;, which was performed at Hampton Court in January 1604. In February of that year, Daniel was appointed the licenser of plays for the Children of the Queen&#x27;s Revels, giving him the responsibility of reviewing the plays presented to the court. This appointment ultimately led to the only known significant difficulty and embarrassment that Daniel encountered in his literary career. Two controversial plays &quot;The Dutch Courtesan&quot; and &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; were both performed by the Children of the Queen&#x27;s Revels after having been approved by Daniel. More disturbingly for Daniel, his own play, &quot;The Tragedy of Philotas&quot;, performed before King James in January 1605, was believed to include political commentary on the seditious end of the Earl of Essex, who had been executed in 1601. Daniel was called before the Privy Council to defend himself. Although he was acquitted of any charges, the incident caused him great embarrassment, resulting in written apologies to his longtime friend Charles Blount (formerly Baron Mountjoy, then the &quot;Earl of Devonshire&quot;), whom he had inadvertently pulled into the affair, and to Robert Cecil, King James&#x27;s advisor and Secretary of State. In an epistle to Prince Henry, that accompanied the 1605 printed version of &quot;Philotas&quot;, Daniel reflected his new world-weary perspective, stating that &quot;years hath done this wrong, / To make me write too much, and live too long.&quot;

If the controversy surrounding &quot;Philotas&quot; damaged Daniel&#x27;s reputation with King James, the damage was short-lived. In 1605, the play was included in the published collection of his works, &quot;Certain Small Poems&quot;, and in August his pastoral tragicomedy &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; was performed before Queen Anne and Prince Henry at Christ Church in Oxford.

In April 1606, Daniel&#x27;s friend and patron, Charles Blount, died. Daniel wrote a funeral poem to his longtime supporter that was printed as &quot;A Funeral Poem Upon the Death of the Noble Earl of Devonshire&quot; and included in the 1607 edition of Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Certain Small Works&quot;. The title page of that collection of Daniel&#x27;s works was the first to refer to him as &quot;one of the Grooms of the Queen&#x27;s Majesty&#x27;s Privy Chamber&quot;, an elevated status that he shared with his friend John Florio. &quot;Certain Small Works&quot; included a substantially revised edition of &quot;The Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot;, one that has been thought to be more performable on stage than the original closet drama version. Recent scholarship has identified a painting of a noblewoman dressed as Cleopatra as being a portrait of Anne Clifford dressed as the Egyptian queen, perhaps associated with a staged performance of the 1607 version of Daniel&#x27;s play.

===1609–1619: Final version of &quot;Civil Wars&quot;, country life, prose &quot;History&quot;, and death===
In 1609, Daniel published his final version of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, a work that now extended to eight books. Daniel dedicated the work to Mary Sidney, the patron who had helped first bring him to prominence. In the dedication to the epic poem, he stated that he had intended to continue the work &quot;unto the glorious union of Henry VII&quot;, meaning the marriage of Henry Tudor (Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s grandfather) to Elizabeth of York in 1486. The final version of the poem, however, only extended through Edward IV&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464. In the dedication, Daniel also stated that he intended to write a prose &quot;History of England, from the Conquest&quot;, introducing the principal project that was to occupy the rest of his literary career and life.
Daniel spent most of the final decade of his life in semi-retirement, living at a country house in the small hamlet of Ridge (now Rudge) in the village of Beckington in Somerset. In 1610, he wrote the masque &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot;, which was performed at Whitehall to celebrate the investiture of King James&#x27;s son, Henry, as Prince of Wales. During the next few years, Daniel conducted research on English history, relying in part on the expertise and collections of his friends, the antiquarians William Camden and Robert Cotton. In 1612, he published the first instalment of his prose history, &quot;The First Part of the History of England&quot;, an edition covering the early years of England&#x27;s history, from the Norman Conquest (1066) through the end of the reign of King Stephen (1154). In 1614, he wrote the pastoral play, &quot;Hymen&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, which was performed to celebrate the wedding of Jean Drummond to Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe at Queen Anne&#x27;s new palace, Somerset House.

Daniel was said to have lost his place as a groom of the privy chamber to Anne of Denmark in 1618 for visiting a disgraced courtier, Robert Lloyd &quot;alias&quot; Flood.

The final version of Daniel&#x27;s prose history, &quot;The Collection of the History of England&quot; was published in 1618. It included material from &quot;The First Part of the History&quot; and continued from the point where that work had left off through the end of the reign of Edward III (1377).

The final work that Daniel wrote was a poem addressed to James Montague, Bishop of Winchester, in 1618. It was intended to console the Bishop who was suffering from jaundice. The work suggests that Daniel may have been suffering from the same illness; he says of &quot;this close vanquishing / And secret wasting sickness&quot; that he had &quot;struggled with it too&quot;.

It is unclear if Daniel was ever married. The burial of a &quot;Mrs. Daniell&quot; is recorded in the Beckington register in March 1619, seven months before Daniel&#x27;s death; however, it is unknown if this was the author&#x27;s wife. Daniel executed his will on 4 September 1619 and died the following month; he was buried on 14 October 1619 at St George&#x27;s Church in Beckington. In the 1650s, Daniel&#x27;s old student, Anne Clifford, had a memorial monument erected to honour him at the church.

==Works==

Many of Samuel Daniel&#x27;s poems and plays were reprinted multiple times in collections of his writings during his lifetime, often in substantially revised editions that represented distinct versions of the works. The following list of Daniel&#x27;s major works demonstrates the breadth of his writing, both in terms of subject and genre. Included in the list is a brief description of the work, the volume and year in which it originally appeared, and the years of significant revisions:

*&quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot; – Masque to celebrate the investiture of James&#x27;s son, Prince Henry, as Prince of Wales, in June 1610. Published in the year of its performance, in &quot;The Order and Solemnity of the Creation of the High and Mighty Prince Henry, Eldest Son to Our Sacred Sovereign, Prince of Wales&quot;. In the preface accompanying the printed edition, Daniel stated that the &quot;art and invention&quot; of the designer of the performance, Inigo Jones, was of &quot;the greatest grace, and is of most importance: ours, the least part and of least note.&quot;
* &quot;Hymen&#x27;s Triumph&quot; – Pastoral play presented at the marriage of Jean Drummond to Robert Ker of Cressford, Lord Roxborough in 1614. Published in 1615.
* &quot;Collection of the History of England&quot; – Prose history of England from its earliest documented days, pre-Norman conquest, through the reign of Edward III. The first portion was published in 1612 as &quot;The First Part of the History of England&quot;. The final version was published in 1618 and represented the last of Daniel&#x27;s works published during his lifetime.

In 1623, the same year as the publication of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio, Samuel Daniel&#x27;s younger brother, John Danyel, a lute player and composer in King James&#x27;s court, oversaw the publication of a collection of his brother&#x27;s poetry in an edition titled &quot;The Whole Works of Samuel Daniel Esquire in Poetry&quot;. The collection was dedicated to King James&#x27;s son, Prince Charles. It included copies of the 1609 edition of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, and newly printed editions of Daniel&#x27;s other verse works, each generally with their own title page dated 1623 but based upon the final versions published during the poet&#x27;s life.

==Daniel and Shakespeare==

Samuel Daniel was born a year or two before William Shakespeare and died three years after him. The literary careers of both started in the 1590s and ended in the 1610s. Both writers enjoyed success and came to be regarded as leading authors of the period, though Shakespeare was more associated with the popular stage and Daniel with courtly poetry and noble patrons. Literary scholars generally accept that many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and poems were influenced by Samuel Daniel&#x27;s works, while the possible influence of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays on Daniel&#x27;s works has been more subject to debate.

Samuel Daniel scholar, John Pitcher, states, &quot;One measure of Daniel&#x27;s quality and importance as a writer is the assiduousness with which Shakespeare followed and drew freely on his every publication. ... But it would be deeply unfair to leave Daniel in Shakespeare&#x27;s wake&quot;.

===Daniel&#x27;s influence on Shakespeare===
Evidence of the influence of Daniel&#x27;s works on Shakespeare includes the following:

* &quot;Rosamond&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; – Literary critics cite Daniel&#x27;s &quot;The Complaint of Rosamond&quot; as one of the principal sources of inspiration for Shakespeare&#x27;s composition of &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. One of the similarities between the two that is often cited is Rosamond&#x27;s description of a seduction scene on an engraved box in &quot;Rosamond&quot; which has close parallels to Lucrece&#x27;s narrative of a similar scene in a tapestry or painting in &quot;Lucrece&quot;. 
* &quot;Delia&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets – Numerous parallels between Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and &quot;Delia&quot; suggest that Daniel&#x27;s sequence served as an inspiration and model for Shakespeare as he composed his poems. Daniel employed the sonnet structure that has come to be called &quot;Shakespearean&quot;, three quatrains and a final couplet, before Shakespeare did. Daniel&#x27;s pairing of a sonnet sequence with a complaint in &quot;Delia and The Complaint of Rosamond&quot;, a structure that has come to be described as &quot;Delian&quot;, may have inspired the pairing of &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; with Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets in the 1609 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. If William Herbert is the &quot;W.H.&quot; in the dedication to the 1609 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and is the &quot;fair youth&quot; of the sonnets, then Daniel, who worked in the Herbert household, may be one of the models for the &quot;rival poet&quot;.
* &quot;Rosamond&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; – Romeo&#x27;s final speech over the lifeless body of Juliet from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (&quot;And lips, O you / The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss&quot;), written between 1593 and 1596, are generally accepted to have been inspired by some of the concluding stanzas of &quot;The Complaint of Rosamond&quot; (&quot;This sorrowing farewell of a dying kiss&quot;), published in 1592. 
* &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; and &quot;Richard II&quot; – Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; includes many elements that the playwright would not have found in his historical sources that appear similarly in &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot;, printed in 1595. These include the representation of Richard&#x27;s queen, Isabel, as a mature woman (rather than the historical child of ten years of age), details of the Bishop of Carlyle&#x27;s defence of Richard before Parliament, Richard and Isabel&#x27;s tearful parting, Richard entering London behind Bolingbroke as his prisoner, and the depiction of Richard in prison philosophically musing on his fallen state. The appearance of the first print edition of Daniel&#x27;s epic poem has been used to establish the earliest possible date for Shakespeare&#x27;s composition of &quot;Richard II&quot; as mid- to late 1595. Recent analysis of an extant early manuscript of Daniel&#x27;s poem, however, suggests that Shakespeare could have used such a manuscript as a source, making an earlier date possible.
* &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; – In &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Shakespeare depicts Prince Hal and Hotspur as being around the same age and makes a rivalry between the two a central part of the play. Historically, Hotspur was as old as Hal&#x27;s father and the prince was only sixteen years old at the Battle of Shrewsbury at which he gained military experience but did not play a significant role. The playwright seems to have been inspired by similar ahistorical elements of the depiction of the prince in Daniel&#x27;s &quot;First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot;.
* &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; – There are close parallels between Henry&#x27;s deathbed scene in Shakespeare&#x27;s play and Daniel&#x27;s description of the king&#x27;s death in his poem.
* &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot; – In &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot;, the ghost of Henry V requests that some poet write the story of his glorious victories, &quot;Whence new immortal Iliads might proceed&quot; (Book IV, stanza 6). Scholars believe that this served as part of Shakespeare&#x27;s inspiration for using a Chorus and what Geoffrey Bullough called &quot;the energy of the epic&quot; in &quot;Henry V&quot;, a play that emphasizes the king&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Agincourt. 
* &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s possible revisions to the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays – If the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were revised by Shakespeare in 1595 or later, as is suggested in &quot;The New Oxford Shakespeare Authorship Companion&quot;, elements of those plays that include parallels to &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; may indicate the influence of Daniel&#x27;s work on Shakespeare&#x27;s revisions.
* &quot;Musophilus&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; – Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; includes echoes of Daniel&#x27;s poem &quot;Musophilus&quot; which was published around the time when the playwright was writing the play. 
* &quot;The Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; – Supplementing his principal source, Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, Shakespeare took inspiration from Daniel&#x27;s Senecan tragedy for his complex characterization of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra, especially for the scenes surrounding her suicide in Act 5 of the play. Daniel&#x27;s poem &quot;A Letter from Octavia&quot; may have also provided material for Shakespeare&#x27;s sympathetic portrayal of Antony&#x27;s wife. 
* &quot;Paulus Jovius&quot; and &quot;Pericles&quot; – The image of a down-turned torch in &quot;Pericles&quot; may have been inspired by an emblem described by Daniel in &quot;The Worthy Tract of Paulus Jovius&quot;. The wording used in the play to describe the device closely mirrors Daniel&#x27;s in his translation of Paolo Giovo. Elements of the image are also used in Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet 73. 
* Daniel&#x27;s masques and &quot;The Tempest&quot; – The masque in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; may have been influenced by Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Vision of the Twelve Goddesses&quot; and &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot;, which included similar Greek deities, such as Ceres and Juno.

===Shakespeare&#x27;s influence on Daniel===
Evidence of Shakespeare&#x27;s possible influence on Daniel&#x27;s works includes the following:

* &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays and &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; – Laurence Michel, in his 1958 critical edition of Samuel Daniel&#x27;s &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, stated, &quot;The likelihood that Daniel knew Shakespeare or any of his works before at least 1604 is small&quot; and therefore &quot;we may assume that Daniel did not know&quot; the versions of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays that were printed in the 1590s. More recent research, however, has suggested that elements of &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; may reflect the influence of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. Those plays had been performed by Pembroke&#x27;s Men, the acting company sponsored by Henry Herbert, the husband of Daniel&#x27;s patron, Mary Sidney, before the 1595 publication of the first edition of Daniel&#x27;s epic poem. Among the strongest evidence of influence is Daniel&#x27;s inclusion of a romantic relationship between Queen Margaret and the Duke of Suffolk, including a woeful parting scene between the two. These elements of the poem are unsupported by his chronicle sources but are emphasized in &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;. If Daniel incorporated elements of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays into &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot;, it may be the first instance of another author reflecting the influence of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in his or her own work.
* &quot;Richard II&quot; and Daniel&#x27;s revisions to &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; – In the 1609 edition of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, Daniel describes Henry IV&#x27;s repudiation of Richard II&#x27;s murderer, Sir Piers of Exton (III.79). This incident is not mentioned in his chronicle sources but is emphasized in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;. 
* &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays and Daniel&#x27;s revisions to &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; – In the 1609 edition of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, Daniel expanded the material formerly included in the third book and broke it into two books, now Books III and IV. The bulk of the added material concerned the reign of King Henry IV and seems to have been influenced by Shakespeare&#x27;s plays on that king&#x27;s reign. 
* &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays and Book VIII of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; (1609) – The eighth book of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, added in the 1609 edition, includes two sections that suggest the influence of &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;: Edward IV&#x27;s wooing of Lady Grey and Henry on the molehill at the Battle of Towton. 
* &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and Daniel&#x27;s revisions to &quot;The Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot; – There is debate surrounding the extent to which Daniel may have been influenced by Shakespeare&#x27;s play in his 1607 revisions to &quot;The Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot;. Daniel incorporated elements that made his play more &quot;theatrical&quot;, yet the revised version remains closer to neoclassical Senecan tragedy than popular theater. The detail of Antony&#x27;s servant, Eros, having been freed by Antony seems to confirm influence. 
* &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Funeral Poem Upon the Death of the Noble Earl of Devonshire&quot; – Elements of Daniel&#x27;s characterization of Charles Blount as a hero-warrior include echoes of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, especially in the section on Blount rallying the English troops at the Siege of Kinsale.

===Personal relationship===
An essay by Albert Harthshorne in 1899 in &quot;The Archaeological Journal&quot; reported that during his retirement, Daniel &quot;received his friends, among them Shakespeare, Chapman, Marlowe of the &#x27;mighty line&#x27;, Drayton, and Jonson&quot;. The facts that Christopher Marlowe had died in 1593, many years before Daniel&#x27;s retirement, and that Daniel had an acrimonious relationship with Jonson, casts doubt on the comment as a whole. There is no direct evidence that Daniel was friendly with Shakespeare or knew him personally, although they likely shared many common acquaintances, including John Florio, Henry Wriothesley, William Herbert, and Ben Jonson.

==Literary reputation and style==
During his lifetime, Daniel was regarded as one of the most important English authors of the period. His writings contributed innovations to a wide range of literary genres, including the sonnet cycle (&quot;Delia&quot;), the complaint (&quot;Complaint of Rosamond&quot;), neo-classical drama (&quot;Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot;), the epic (&quot;The Civil Wars&quot;), the verse colloquy (&quot;Musophilus&quot;), the literary essay (&quot;Defence of Rhyme&quot;), and epistolary verse (&quot;Certain Epistles&quot;). He continued to have admirers for centuries after his death and his works had a significant influence on many other authors. John Milton adapted elements of his works in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Alexander Pope parodied the opening of &quot;The Civil Wars&quot; in &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a particular admirer of Daniel&#x27;s work, referring to him as &quot;one of the golden writers of our golden Elizabethan age ... whose diction bears no mark of time&quot;. Coleridge&#x27;s friend and collaborator William Wordsworth reflected Daniel&#x27;s influence in many of his works and included an extended quotation from Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to the Countess of Cumberland&quot; in his poem &quot;The Excursion&quot;. Henry David Thoreau referred to Daniel to elucidate his own thoughts in &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;.

Although Daniel&#x27;s work fell into obscurity during the 20th century, he continued to have admirers. Many anthologies of early modern literature include excerpts from his &quot;Delia&quot;, &quot;Musophilus&quot;, and &quot;A Defence of Rhyme&quot;. In his 1944 &quot;English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama&quot;, C.S. Lewis said of Daniel that he &quot;actually thinks in verse; thinks deeply, arduously; he can doubt and wrestle ... he is the most interesting man of letters whom that century produced in England.&quot;

One factor that contributes to the diminished recognition of Daniel&#x27;s works in the 20th century, relative to some of his contemporaries, is his calmer, less emotional style. As reflected in C.S. Lewis&#x27;s assessment that Daniel &quot;thinks in verse&quot;, his poetry often employs the more precise language of debate, self-doubt, and deep thought rather than passionate imagery. In &quot;Musophilus&quot;, Daniel described his poetry as &quot;a speaking picture of the mind&quot; (line 170). The conversational, less lyrical nature of his poetry resulted in criticism, even from the time when he wrote. Fellow poet Michael Drayton, a contemporary of Daniel&#x27;s, called him &quot;too much historian in verse&quot; and stated that &quot;His rimes were smooth, his meters well did close, / But yet his manner better fitted prose&quot;. Yet those same qualities of his writing are what helped him appeal to Coleridge and Wordsworth, who in their prelude to &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1802) asserted that &quot;a large portion of the language of every good poem can in no respect differ from that of good prose&quot;. In &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot; (1817), Coleridge praised Daniel&#x27;s poetry for &quot;many and exquisite specimens of that style which, as the &quot;neutral ground&quot; of prose and verse, is common to both.&quot; At the time that Coleridge and Wordsworth were writing, Daniel&#x27;s &quot;prosaic&quot; style seemed more current than that of many other Elizabethan poets. The 18th century literary critic Robert Anderson expressed this in his 1795 anthology &quot;Works of the British Poets&quot;. Anderson wrote of Daniel that there is &quot;in both his poetry and prose such a legitimate rational flow of language, as approaches nearer the style of the 18th than the 16th century&quot;.

Aspects of Daniel&#x27;s writing may also be closer to the 20th and 21st century than to his own time. Much of his work expresses a sympathy for the plight of women who maintain their dignity despite being regarded as the subordinates of undeserving men. He exhibited this attitude in his dedicatory verses to Mary Sidney, his poem &quot;Letter from Octavia&quot;, and especially in his &quot;Epistle to Countess of Cumberland&quot;. The pensive, self-reflective style of much of his poetry is more similar to some modern poetry than the more ornate style of many of his contemporaries. His belief that every culture and era had value to offer in its thought and writing, reflected in &quot;A Defence of Rhyme&quot;, and refusal to accept that poetry and art should be artificially held to classical standards, differed from the attitude of many humanist writers and thinkers of his time. In &quot;Musophilus&quot;, he demonstrated the foresight to see the benefit of writing in English, even though the use of the language was restricted to one small island. He presciently wrote, &quot;who in time knows whither we may vent / The treasure of our tongue ... Or who can tell for what great work in hand / The greatness of our style is now ordained&quot; (lines 947 to 954).

Daniel also had the humility to admit that he, along with all humans, is fallible and is prone to hold strongly to opinions that will come to be regarded as misguided. This humility is demonstrated in the following comment from his &quot;Collection of the History of England&quot;:
In many of his works, Daniel expressed a deep regard for the power of written language (&quot;blessed letters&quot;) to reach across cultures and generations. As he wrote in &quot;Musophilus&quot;:
==Modern editions and recent references to Daniel==
The last time a thorough edition of the works of Daniel appeared in print was in the late nineteenth century, in the five-volume &quot;Complete Works in Verse and Prose&quot; (1885–1896), edited by Alexander Balloch Grosart. Two collections of selected works were published during the twentieth century: &quot;Poems and a Defence of Ryme&quot; (1930), an edition that preserves the original early modern spelling and punctuation, edited by Arthur Colby Sprague, and &quot;Selected Poetry and a Defense of Rhyme&quot; (1998), a modernized edition, edited by Geoffrey G. Hiller and Peter L. Groves. John Pitcher is currently working on a multi-volume critical edition of Daniel&#x27;s complete works to be published by Oxford University Press.

Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of Cleopatra&quot; was staged by the University College London (UCL) Centre for Modern Exchanges in 2013 as part of a project to evaluate if the &quot;closet drama&quot; was performable. A recording of the performance is available on Vimeo and an analysis of it is included in Yasmin Arshad&#x27;s book &quot;Imagining Cleopatra: Performing Gender and Power in Early Modern England&quot;.

Daniel is a significant supporting character in the novel &quot;Imperfect Alchemist&quot;, by Naomi Miller, a fictionalized account of Mary Sidney.

<doc id="197833" wikidata="Q1774915" url="?curid=197833" title="Hashemites">
<text>The Hashemites (), also House of Hashim, are the royal family of Jordan, which they have ruled since 1921, and were the royal family of the kingdoms of Hejaz (1916–1925), Syria (1920), and Iraq (1921–1958). The family had ruled the city of Mecca continuously from the 10th century, frequently as vassals of outside powers, and ruled the thrones of the Hejaz, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan following their World War I alliance with the British Empire.

The family belongs to the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Ḥasanid Sharifs of Mecca, also referred to as Hashemites. Their eponymous ancestor is traditionally considered to be Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Ḥasanid Sharifs of Mecca (from whom the Hashemite royal family is directly descended), including the Hashemites&#x27; ancestor Qatadah ibn Idris, were Zaydī Shīʿas until the late Mamluk or early Ottoman period, when they became followers of the Shāfiʿī school of Sunnī Islam.

The current dynasty was founded by Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, who was appointed as Sharif and Emir of Mecca by the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1908, then in 1916—after concluding a secret agreement with the British Empire—was proclaimed King of Arab countries (but only recognized as King of the Hejaz) after initiating the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. His sons Abdullah and Faisal assumed the thrones of Jordan and Iraq in 1921, and his first son Ali succeeded him in the Hejaz in 1924. This arrangement became known as the &quot;Sharifian solution&quot;. Abdullah was assassinated in 1951, but his descendants continue to rule Jordan today. The other two branches of the dynasty did not survive; Ali was ousted by Ibn Saud after the British withdrew their support from Hussein in 1924–1925, and Faisal&#x27;s grandson Faisal II was executed in the 1958 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état.

== History ==

===Rulers of Mecca===
According to historians Ibn Khaldun and Ibn Hazm, in Ja&#x27;far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani came from Medina and conquered Mecca in the name of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu&#x27;izz, after the latter had conquered Egypt from the Ikhshidids. Jafar was from the wider Banu Hashim clan, albeit a different branch to the modern dynasty. The Banu Hashim claim to trace their ancestry from Hashim ibn Abd Manaf (died c. 497 AD), the great-grandfather of Muhammad, although the definition today mainly refers to the descendants of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatimah. 

Control of Mecca remained with the clan; when the Ottoman Turks took control of Egypt in 1517 AD, Sharif Barakat quickly recognized the change in sovereignty, sending his son Abu Numayy II to the Ottoman sultan Selim I in Cairo, bearing the keys to the holy cities and other gifts. The Ottoman sultan confirmed Barakat and Abu Numayy in their positions as co-rulers of the Hejaz.

=== World War I and the Arab Revolt ===
Before World War I, Hussein bin Ali of the Hashemite Dhawu-&#x27;Awn clan ruled the Hejaz on behalf of the Ottoman sultan. For some time it had been the practice of the Sublime Porte to appoint the Emir of Mecca from among a select group of candidates. In 1908, Hussein bin Ali was appointed to the Sharifate of Mecca. He found himself increasingly at odds with the Young Turks in control at Istanbul, while he strove to secure his family&#x27;s position as hereditary emirs. Hussein bin Ali&#x27;s lineage and destined position as the Sharif of Mecca helped foster the ambition for an independent Arab kingdom and caliphate. These pretensions came to the Ottoman rulers&#x27; attention and caused them to &quot;invite&quot; Hussein to Istanbul as the guest of the sultan in order to keep him under direct supervision. Hussein brought his four sons, Ali, Abdullah, Faisal, and Zeid, with him. It was not until after the Young Turk Revolution that he was able to return to the Hijaz and was officially appointed the Sharif.

Of Hussein&#x27;s four sons, Abdullah was the most politically ambitious and became the planner and driving force behind the Arab revolt. Abdullah received military training in both the Hijaz and Istanbul. He was the deputy for Mecca in the Ottoman Parliament between 1912 and 1914. During this period, Abdullah developed deep interest in Arab nationalism and linked his father&#x27;s interest for autonomous rule in the Hijaz to complete Arab emancipation. In 1914 he met the British high commissioner, Lord Kitchener, in Cairo to discuss the possibility of the British supporting an Arab uprising against the Turks. The possibility of co-operation was raised but no commitment was made by either side. Shortly after Abdullah returned to Mecca, he became his father&#x27;s foreign minister, political advisor, and one of the commanders of the Arab Revolt.

Faisal, Hussein&#x27;s third son, played an active role in the revolt as commander of the Arab army, while the overall leadership was placed in the hands of his father. The idea of an Arab uprising against the Ottoman Empire was first conceived by Abdullah. Only after gradual and persistent nudging did Abdullah convince his father, the conservative Sharif of Mecca, to move from the idea of home rule of a portion of Arabia within the Ottoman Empire to complete and total independence of the entire Empire&#x27;s Arab provinces. Hussein recognized the necessity of breaking away from the Empire in the beginning of 1914 when he realized that he would not be able to complete his political objectives within the framework of the Ottomans. To have any success with the Arab revolt, the backing of another great power was crucial.

Hussein regarded Arab unity as synonymous with his own kingship. He aspired to have the entire Arabian Peninsula, the region of Syria, and Iraq under his – and his descendants&#x27; – rule. After a year of fruitless negotiation, Sir Henry McMahon conveyed the British government&#x27;s agreement to recognize Arab independence over an area that was much more limited than that to which Hussein had aspired. The Arab revolt, an Anglo-Hashemite plot in its essence, broke out in June 1916. Britain financed the revolt and supplied arms, provisions, direct artillery support, and experts in desert warfare including the soon to be famous T. E. Lawrence. The Hashemites promised more than they were able to deliver, and their ambitious plan collapsed. There were only a small number of Syrian and Iraqi nationalists who joined under the Sharifan banner while others remained loyal to the Ottoman sultan.

Sharif Hussein bin Ali rebelled against the rule of the Ottomans during the Arab Revolt of 1916. For Hashemite contribution to the Allied forces effort to bring down the Ottoman Empire, Britain promised its support for Arab independence. However, the McMahon–Hussein correspondence left territorial limits governing this promise obscurely defined leading to a long and bitter disagreement between the two sides.

===Post-War: the Sharifian Solution===


After the war, the British devised a &quot;Sharifian Solution&quot; to &quot;[make] straight all the tangle&quot; of their various wartime commitments. This proposed that three sons of Sharif Hussein would be installed as kings of newly created countries across the Middle East.

Given the need to rein in expenditure and factors outside British control, including France&#x27;s removing of Faisal from Syria in July 1920, and Abdullah&#x27;s entry into Transjordan (which had been the southern part of Faisal&#x27;s Syria) in November 1920, the eventual Sharifian solution was somewhat different, the informal name for a British policy put into effect by Secretary of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill following the 1921 Cairo conference.


Hussein bin Ali had five sons:

* Ali, who briefly succeeded to the throne of Hejaz before its loss to the Saud family in 1925.
* Abdullah, became the emir of Transjordan in 1921 and king of Jordan in 1946, and whose descendants continue to rule the kingdom known ever since as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
* Faisal, briefly proclaimed King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920, became King of Iraq in 1921.
* Prince Zeid bin Hussein, who moved to Jordan when his brother&#x27;s grandson, King Faisal II of Iraq, was overthrown and murdered in a coup in 1958.
* Hassan, died at a young age.

Hussein bin Ali continued to rule an independent Hejaz, of which he proclaimed himself king, between 1916 and 1924, after the collapse of Ottoman power, with the tacit support of the British Foreign Office. His supporters are sometimes referred to as &quot;Sharifians&quot; or the &quot;Sharifian party&quot;. Hussein bin Ali&#x27;s chief rival in the Arabian Peninsula, the king of the Najd (highlands), Ibn Saud, annexed the Hejaz in 1925 and established his own son, Faysal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, as governor. The region was later incorporated into Saudi Arabia.

In Transjordan, the British government granted its independence in 1921 with Abdullah as ruler. The degree of independence that was afforded to the Arab states by colonial powers was an ongoing issue at the time, however in the case of Transjordan, the independence enjoyed was limited; with substantial influence and control reserved by British government in London. In domestic affairs the local ruler was given a considerable amount of power nonetheless; but these powers were exercised in an autocratic manner by the Hashemite family while remaining under the superintendence of the British Resident in Amman, as well as the British high commissioner in Jerusalem. Abdullah was assassinated in 1951, but his descendants continue to rule Jordan today. 

In Iraq, the Hashemites ruled for almost four decades, until Faisal&#x27;s grandson Faisal II was executed in the 1958 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état.

=== Iraqi Hashemites (Descendants of Prince Ra&#x27;ad ibn Zaid) ===
The descendants of Iraqi Hashemite prince Ra&#x27;ad ibn Zaid have been awarded Jordanian citizenship and are addressed in the style of His Royal Highness and Prince in Jordan. Descendants include Prince Zeid bin Ra&#x27;ad, a Jordanian diplomat, who served as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2014 to 2018, and Prince Mired bin Ra&#x27;ad.

=== Non-royals ===
A number of Dhawu Awn clansmen migrated with Emir Abdullah I to Transjordan in the early 1920s. Several of their descendants have gained prominent positions in the Jordanian state, including the positions of Chief of the Royal Court, Prime Minister, and Ambassador. Descendants of the Dhawu Awn clansmen are referred to as &quot;Sharifs&quot; and, other than Zaid ibn Shaker, have not been awarded princely title. Examples include former Prime Ministers and Royal Court Chiefs Sharif Hussein ibn Nasser, Sharif Abdelhamid Sharaf, Queen Zein Al-Sharaf (wife of King Talal and mother of King Hussein) and her brother Sharif Nasser bin Jamil.

Princely title in Jordan is typically restricted only to patrilineal descendants of any of the four sons of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca. 

Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein was the leader of the Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy political party and currently uses the title &quot;Sharif&quot;.

Queen Dina Abdul-Hamid also was a member of the House of Hashim. She was entitled to use the honorific title &quot;sharifa&quot; of Mecca as an agnatic descendant of Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. 

==== Descendants of Prince Zaid ibn Shaker ====
Prince Zaid ibn Shaker, former PM and Commander-in-chief of the Jordanian military, was a member of the Dhawu Awn clan whose father Shaker ibn Zaid migrated to Transjordan with his cousin Abdullah I of Jordan. He was awarded the non-hereditary title of &quot;prince&quot; in 1996. His children, one son and one daughter, are addressed as &quot;Sharifs&quot; – not princes.

==Ja&#x27;alin tribe==
The Ja&#x27;alin are of Arab origin and trace their origins to Ibrahim Ja&#x27;al, an Abbasid noble, whose clan originally hailed from the Hejaz in the Arabian Peninsula and married into the local Nubian population. Ja&#x27;al was a descendant of al-Abbas, an uncle of Muhammad. The Ja&#x27;alin trace their lineage to Abbas, uncle of Muhammad. According to the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland in 1888, the name Ja&#x27;alin does not seem to be derived from any founder of a tribe, but rather from the root Ja&#x27;al, an Arabic word meaning &quot;to put&quot; or &quot;to stay&quot;, and in this sense it is those who settle. Various researchers have suggested that the Ja&#x27;alin are Arabized Nubians. A few 19th-century travellers claimed that Nubian was still spoken among them.

<text>Case roles, according to the work by Charles J. Fillmore (1967), are the semantic roles of noun phrases (NP) in relation to the syntactic structures that contain these noun phrases. The term &quot;case role&quot; is most widely used for purely semantic relations, including theta roles and thematic roles, that can be independent of the morpho-syntax. The concept of case roles is related to the larger notion of &quot;Case&quot; (with a capitalised C), which is defined as a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of semantic or syntactic relationship they bear to their heads. Case traditionally refers to inflectional marking.

The relationships between nouns and their containing structures are of both syntactic and semantic value. The syntactic positional relationships between forms in sentences vary cross-linguistically and allows grammarians to observe semantic values in these nouns by examining their syntactic values. Using these semantic values gives the base for considering case roles in a specific language.

In addition to its inventory of structural cases, case theory includes a series of lexical cases that are assigned at deep structure in conjunction with theta role assignment. In addition to its relation to Case (case based on syntactic structures), these semantic notions of case role are also closely related to morphological case.

==Inventory of case roles==

The following list of case roles is frequently distinguished in literature but is not an exhaustive list, as there is no consensus on the universal inventory of roles, nor a universal agreement as to the correct assignment of constituents to roles.

==Early contributions to case role==

=== Roman Jakobson&#x27;s work on case roles in Russian ===
In his article on the case system of Russian, Roman Jakobson (1958) closely examines case assignment and argues for a feature decomposition of case on the basis of semantic considerations. Jakobson (1958) proposed a three-feature binary case system for Russian case which includes the following: ±marginal, ±quantifying, and ±ascriptive, where the negative value is considered to be unmarked. The term &quot;marginal&quot; distinguishes the direct and non-direct cases; only the -marginal cases may occur in subject and object position. &quot;Quantifying&quot; indicates the relevance of the extent to which the noun is a participant in the event. &quot;Ascriptive&quot; puts emphasis on directionality.

Jakobson considers cases to be bundles of these three features, which can be assigned to morphological cases:

He uses these decomposed case features to account for the case alternations in subject and object position, and argues for how there should be a universal inventory of case roles.

==Multiple case roles==

There is a theory that multiple case roles can be assigned to noun phrases. The reasons for having more than one case role is due to the differences in the sentences’ semantic effects. Bhat (1997) proposed that the speaker of a language would have the option of assigning any single case role out of the multiple case role alternations available in a given context. This is not done by a transformational rule, but due to the deep structure representations (the core semantic relations of the sentence).

 Examples
 (1a) || &quot;John sprayed the wall with paint.&quot;
 (1b) || &quot;John sprayed paint on the wall.&quot;

In comparing sentences (1a) and (1b), it demonstrates that the surface structure representation for each sentence (the structure following the phonological form of the sentence) is different. However, in order to account for the meaning distinctions that exist in (1a) and (1b), it has been demonstrated that these distinctions are due to the differences in the deep structures of each sentence and can be resolved by assigning a &quot;different&quot; case role to the NP. With &#x27;paint&#x27; acting as an instrument, and &#x27;the wall&#x27; being the location, sentence (1a) might infer that all the paint was used, but that not necessarily all the wall was covered. Sentence (1b) might imply that the whole wall is covered, but that John did not use all the paint he had available to him.

=== Fillmore&#x27;s alternative theory ===
Conversely, Fillmore (1968) suggested that in the case of sentences following the structure of the above examples, the noun phrases are not assigned multiple case roles, but instead retain the same case roles in both sentences (instrument for &#x27;paint&#x27;, and location for &#x27;wall&#x27;). The difference in meaning is attributed to a transformation that takes both identical deep structures and chooses the direct object as it appears in the surface form.

=== Examples in Kannada ===
Kannada (a language spoken in India with overt usage of case in its suffixes) affords some good evidence of how multiple case roles can be assigned to NPs in the following two examples: (1) how NPs can be assigned either Object or Location case roles, and (2) how NPs can be assigned either Agent or Experiencer case roles.

Evidence for multiple case roles demonstrated in Kannada: NPs can be assigned either &quot;object&quot; or &quot;location&quot; case roles. Evidence is found from the meaning distinctions of exhaustiveness:

(2a) implies that the cat climbed the tree from the ground itself, whereas (2b) has no such implication. The common feature of these two uses is that whenever an element occurs as the &quot;object&quot; case role, it gets the added meaning of being exhaustively affected by the action denoted by the verb as seen in (2a) (like climbing up the tree completely from the ground upwards). No such additional meaning is observed in sentences in which the element has been used as a &quot;Location&quot; case role (as in 2b).

How NPs can be assigned either &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;experiencer&quot; case roles: Evidence found from the meaning distinctions of volition.

Although both sentences indicate the same event, the meaning difference is due to the fact that in (3a) Raju, as the &quot;agent&quot;, is considered to have acted volitionally (not making any special effort to retain the lesson in his memory), and is hence held responsible for that event, whereas in (3b) he, being an &quot;experiencer&quot;, is involved in that event only non-volitionally, and hence one does not hold him responsible for it.

==Relating case roles to morphological case and structural Case==

===Semantic vs. morphological===

The semantic category of case (specifically case role) is related to morphological case. Morphological case (such as accusative, ergative, dative, genitive, and sometimes also partitive) reflects the ranking of arguments, while semantic case (such as instrumental, comitative, locative, and directional) encodes a semantic relation between the DP and the governing head. Morphological case is typical of complements and is licensed by structural Case. By contrast, semantic case is typical of adjuncts; it is only licensed by the meaning of the head. From the case roles proposed by Fillmore (1968), it was demonstrated that case roles appeared where the morphological cases of dative, genitive or instrumental appeared:

*The experiencer case role (dative in many languages)
*The recipient case role (dative in many languages)
*The possessor case role (genitive in many languages)
*The partitive case role (genitive or partitive in many languages)
*The instrument case role (instrumental or dative in many languages)

The following are observations from Sigurðsson on the &quot;case-semantics&quot; in case-languages demonstrating how morphological case is &quot;not&quot; blind to semantics:

*Agentive subjects are nominative
*Indirect objects are either dative or accusative
*Most benefactive (indirect or direct) objects are dative
*Most malefactive (indirect or direct) objects are accusative
*Instrumental DP-objects are dative
*If a lexical item has a choice between an accusative or a dative complement, then that choice is normally semantically controlled

===Morphological vs. structural===
Morphological case is related to structural Case (based on syntax) in the following ways:

Structural Case is a condition for arguments that originates from a relational head (e.g. verb), while morphological case is a property that depends on the NP or DP complement. The relationship between morphological case and structural case is evident in how morphological case is subject to case agreement whereby the morphological case appearing on a DP must be licensed by the syntactic context of the DP.

In much of the transformational grammar literature, morphological cases are viewed as determined by the syntactic configuration. The accusative case is assigned through a structural relation between the verbal head and its complement. For example, the direct complement of a verb is assigned accusative, irrespective of any other properties that it might have. It must be acknowledged that it is not the accusative alone that is structural, rather the specifier of a NP is in the genitive in many languages, and so is the direct object of a nominalized verb.

==Morphological case==

===Linguistic typology of morphological case===

Case can be further divided into two categories: grammatical cases and semantic cases. Examples of grammatical cases are nominative case, accusative, dative, and ergative. These typically code core grammatical relations which are semantically dependent on the verb, such as subject and object. Semantic (or adverbial) cases are instrumental, comitative, and locative cases. These are semantically richer and less dependent on the verb. There exist cases, such as dative, that have both semantic and grammatical case features.

Eight commonly seen cases (Indo-European case):
Precise description of the above cases vary cross-linguistically.

Ergative case

It has been suggested that the lexical case associated with agents is the ergative (ERG) lexical case: it identifies the noun as a subject of a transitive verb in languages that allow ergative case. The correlation demonstrated between the ergative case and the theta role of the agent is not a perfect correlation: It is as closely correlated as the relationship between the dative case and the theta role goals/ experiencers. There are two types of ergative languages: languages that allow ergative subjects in intransitive clauses and those that prohibit them.

There can be a distinction made between ergative and accusative type languages with respect to the type of subject and object markings they will display. This distinction is characterized by the type of clauses a language allows, such as ergative, absolutive, accusative, and nominative. The distinction made between language type and clause type is illustrated in the table below:

Case assignment

The typological differences among languages have been shown to be the consequence of differences in whether ergative, dative, or other individual case assignment is optional or obligatory in a language (although, the ergative-accusative case pattern appears to be universally blocked).

The class of verbs that mark their subjects with a particular lexical dative case is similar across languages, but the inclusion in this verb class is not completely predictable. Lexical cases such as nominative usually mark predictable theta roles, but there is a substantial amount of characteristic behaviour involved indicating that a verb&#x27;s ability to assign a lexical case to one of its arguments must be specified in that verb&#x27;s lexical entry. Once a verb marks its subject with a given lexical case, such as nominative, that verb cannot assign the structural accusative case to its object.

Morphologically overt case assignment

In languages with case marking of explicit morphology, any nominal that is morphologically capable of showing case morphology is obligated to do so. This observation can be stated explicitly by what is referred to as the Case Filter. Case Filter can be further described as being an abstract Case hypothesis that stipulates all lexical noun phrases are assigned a specific Case regardless if this Case manifests at the surface level: If this lexical NP does not have a Case marking at surface structure, then the sentence that contains it is considered ungrammatical. Case theory includes an inventory of structural Case and a series of lexical cases that are assigned (in all languages) at the level of the deep structure in conjunction with theta role assignment.

Languages such as Russian and Japanese follow a similar mechanism of case assignment as that seen in Latin. Russian is like Latin, in that it does have genitive and dative case that is assigned by the N (noun) and A (adjective or adverb). In Russian for example, most nouns show overt case morphology as does Latin, but there is also a productive class of indeclinable nouns. These indeclinable nouns are not able to receive case morphology. Examples from languages exhibiting morphologically overt case marking indicate that there are rules of case assignment present in the grammar of a language. To account for this, rules can be generated as support. For example, support accounting for accusative cases in Latin-type case-marked languages could be presented as:

Application of these accusative case assignment rules can be seen in the following examples:

For the morphologically rich case language of Latin, there are seven cases for Latin nouns. The following table demonstrates Latin case morphology assignment for a masculine noun &quot;somnus&quot;, meaning &#x27;sleep&#x27;.

Modern German

In modern German, all noun phrases show case forms with case generally being marked on the determiner. However, for the genitive form German marks the noun with a morphologically overt case form (this case form is retained on noun phrases in modern English, surfacing as -&#x27;s). The following table illustrates the masculine case forms of German.

===Case hierarchy===

As discussed in linguistic typology of morphological case, there can be a number of cases found within a single language. In a sample of case systems, they appear in a particular order and a hierarchy emerges. This specific ordering is called the case hierarchy.

Nominative/Absolutive → Accusative/Ergative → Genitive → Dative → Ablative/Instrumental → Other oblique arguments

This hierarchy is to be interpreted as follows: If a language has a case that is listed on the hierarchy, it will usually have at least one case from each position to the left. If a language has a dative case, it will have a genitive (position to the left), an accusative or ergative case or both, and a nominative.

While the case hierarchy holds for many languages, it is not universally valid. Some languages may lack one of the above categories or may collapse categories into one hierarchy position. There are times when none of the cases in one system will correspond with any of the cases in the other system. For example, the dative in Ancient Greek does not correspond closely with the dative of Latin. So when comparing cases across languages, the functions of a particular case need to be considered, rather than the labels the language has assigned.

==== Examples of two case and three case systems within the case hierarchy ====
The hierarchy predicts that it is possible for a language to only have two cases. There are a number of languages that have a two-case system, such as Chemeheuvi, Kabardian, as well as in Iranian languages. Chemeheuvi is a language of the Numic branch of Uto-Aztecan family which has a nominative-oblique system. Yagnobi, an Iranian language, has both an accusative and ergative case.

Semitic languages, Nubian languages, Modern Greek operate with a three-case systems, with a nominative, accusative, and genitive/oblique case.

==Structural Case==

=== Examples of Structural Case in English ===
Morphological Case is the surface Case form which is assigned to either a noun phrase or a pronoun phrase depending on its surface position within a sentence. English case morphology is very sparse or in some instances, non-existent. The distribution of nominals in languages such as English, where there is a lack of case morphology, is governed by the same precise laws that also regulate nominative and accusative case in morphologically overt case-marked languages such as Latin and Russian. For example the distribution of accusative case:
:Accusative case assignment:
::α assigns accusative case to β only if: 
:::iii. α is V or P (not N or A); and
:::iv. β is the complement of α

In English, the object of a noun phrase is assigned a Case by the closest c-commanding V (verb) or P (preposition) head, which is usually the verb or preposition that selects it as a complement. Similarly, the subject of a noun phrase is assigned Case from the finite tense head, T. The subject of a finite clause in English is nominative. As seen in English with sentences in passive form, the finite T is the head that assigns the nominative Case to the noun phrase (subject position); the closest noun phrase that T (tense head) c-commands is attracted to the empty specifier position of the tense phrase. This movement is a local specifier-to-specifier movement, satisfying Case requirements at the deep-structure level. Any sentence in English that surfaces with a noun phrase not containing Case, is a violation of the Case Filter and thus is said to &#x27;crash&#x27; (determined to be ungrammatical).

Although English does not have non-zero case morphology, except with respect to personal pronouns, it satisfies the Case Filter. The phenomenon of phonologically zero case morphology is found in languages where the presence of a rich case system is not in doubt. English has an abstract or non-overt variant of case. For example, accusative case may be assigned to a nominal complement of V (verb) or P (preposition) by either V (verb) or P (preposition), but these complements receiving case show no overt morphology reflecting this process. English lacks formal cases such as vocative case and ablative case (which can be assigned to nominals); complements to the heads assigning case will not receive an abstract marking of case, and will be excluded by the case filter.
Pronouns in English, however, change forms when they change case. These changes are clearly seen with personal pronouns for example: first person, second person, and third person are represented as &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;you&#x27;, and &#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she&#x27;, respectively. Subjects of active voice sentences typically in English take on the nominative Case and objects the accusative Case. 

Personal pronouns in English can be classified into three Case categories:

English has case forms for pronouns for genitive, accusative, and nominative cases. Conversely, English has only genitive case forms for &#x27;full noun phrases&#x27; (or determiner phrases): For example, &quot;John&#x27;s blue cat&quot; is assigned genitive case. Full noun phrases cannot be assigned accusative or nominative case. The possessive marking &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; as a case ending attaches to the end of a noun phrase, not necessarily to the head noun itself.

Example: English Noun Phrase Marked with Genitive Case
: [NP [NP The boy] -&#x27;sposs ball]

It is a question of present-day research, why is it that with pronouns in English, Case marking is preserved? A proposed answer has been that since pronouns are a closed category and don&#x27;t partake in productive morphology, then they are in a way &quot;memorized&quot; by speakers of English. The fact that they may be just memorized forms suggests that there is no significant reason for why members of this category should undergo a drastic change, losing morphologically overt Case marking. Considering this argument, why then do noun phrases receive genitive Case marking in English? The notion of abstract Case marking on all noun phrases can help answer this question: All noun phrases undergo Case marking assignment but this is not always phonetically realized at the surface structure (the exception to surfacing of this morphological case is the possessive form -&#x27;s).

There is a phenomenon in English known as exceptional case-marking (ECM), which makes it evident that accusative case is not necessarily assigned to the complement of the assigner. The following example is intended to demonstrate that case can be assigned as long as there is no barrier that intervenes, and given that there is no nominal closer in proximity to the assigner than the assignee. For example (* indicates an ungrammaticality):

==Debate about case role==
There have been arguments made for case role to be considered a universal in language, for several reasons. In previous studies, primarily during the early 20th century, where case role in languages was considered using Latin or Greek classification, it was found that there were difficulties in approaching other languages such as Aleut or Thai. These methods involved illustrating semantic relationships of given case forms and did not come from a primarily syntactical standpoint. Case role in Latin and Greek classifications tended to neglect nominative case as well, and instead focused on creating different semantic classes for other cases, such as the dative of possession.

Because there have been several such problems analyzing case role cross-linguistically when using one language as a standard, it is not common practice to take traditional Latin or Greek classifications. Instead, the particular languages&#x27; syntactic structure forms the base for analyzing semantic value and case role in that language.

There are still questions regarding case morphology. One approach to defining case morphology is to say that it is the presence of some special morphology, the shape of which has a correlation with a specific syntactic position. Decades of past research support this being a particular cross-linguistic property specific to nominals. When discussing case features, it is commonly stated that they have no associated semantic interpretation, regardless of their syntactic position. An early perspective taken on case was the initial suggestion by French linguist Jean-Roger Vergnaud that the grammar of case is a cross-linguistic feature, central to the syntax of all languages and that it does not just apply to languages with a rich case morphology, such as Latin. Vergnaud stipulated that any nominal that is morphologically able to show case morphology is required and must do so. This observation was explicitly stated above as being the definition of Case Filter. A second perspective on Case is Chomsky&#x27;s Minimalist conjectures. There are many fundamental questions regarding case role, such as the reason why case should even exist, that are not yet accompanied by substantive answers. This indicates that research on case role remains still as a &quot;work in progress&quot;.

<doc id="197845" wikidata="Q1208852" url="?curid=197845" title="Nuclear reprocessing">
<text>Nuclear reprocessing is the chemical separation of fission products and actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Originally, reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons. With commercialization of nuclear power, the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into MOX nuclear fuel for thermal reactors. The reprocessed uranium, also known as the spent fuel material, can in principle also be re-used as fuel, but that is only economical when uranium supply is low and prices are high. Nuclear reprocessing may extend beyond fuel and include the reprocessing of other nuclear reactor material, such as Zircaloy cladding.

The high radioactivity of spent nuclear material means that reprocessing must be highly controlled and carefully executed in advanced facilities by specialized personnel. Numerous processes exist, with the chemical based PUREX process dominating. Alternatives include heating to drive off volatile elements, burning via oxidation, and fluoride volatility (which uses extremely reactive Fluorine). Each process results in some form of refined nuclear product, with radioactive waste as a byproduct. Because this could allow for weapons grade nuclear material, nuclear reprocessing is a concern for nuclear proliferation and is thus tightly regulated.

Relatively high cost is associated with spent fuel reprocessing compared to the once-through fuel cycle, but fuel use can be increased and waste volumes decreased. Nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in Europe, Russia, and Japan. In the United States, the Obama administration stepped back from President Bush&#x27;s plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research. Not all nuclear fuel requires reprocessing; a breeder reactor is not restricted to using recycled plutonium and uranium. It can employ all the actinides, closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by about 60 times.

== Separated components and disposition ==

The potentially useful components dealt with in nuclear reprocessing comprise specific actinides (plutonium, uranium, and some minor actinides). The lighter elements components include fission products, activation products, and cladding.

==History==
The first large-scale nuclear reactors were built during World War II. These reactors were designed for the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. The only reprocessing required, therefore, was the extraction of the plutonium (free of fission-product contamination) from the spent natural uranium fuel. In 1943, several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products. The first method selected, a precipitation process called the bismuth phosphate process, was developed and tested at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the US weapons programs. ORNL produced the first macroscopic quantities (grams) of separated plutonium with these processes.

The bismuth phosphate process was first operated on a large scale at the Hanford Site, in the later part of 1944. It was successful for plutonium separation in the emergency situation existing then, but it had a significant weakness: the inability to recover uranium.

The first successful solvent extraction process for the recovery of pure uranium and plutonium was developed at ORNL in 1949. The PUREX process is the current method of extraction. Separation plants were also constructed at Savannah River Site and a smaller plant at West Valley Reprocessing Plant which closed by 1972 because of its inability to meet new regulatory requirements.

Reprocessing of civilian fuel has long been employed at the COGEMA La Hague site in France, the Sellafield site in the United Kingdom, the Mayak Chemical Combine in Russia, and at sites such as the Tokai plant in Japan, the Tarapur plant in India, and briefly at the West Valley Reprocessing Plant in the United States.

In October 1976, concern of nuclear weapons proliferation (especially after India demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology) led President Gerald Ford to issue a Presidential directive to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the U.S. On 7 April 1977, President Jimmy Carter banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel. The key issue driving this policy was the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle, and to encourage other nations to follow the US lead. After that, only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but did not provide the substantial subsidy that would have been necessary to start up commercial reprocessing.

In March 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reversed its policy and signed a contract with a consortium of Duke Energy, COGEMA, and Stone &amp; Webster (DCS) to design and operate a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility. Site preparation at the Savannah River Site (South Carolina) began in October 2005. In 2011 the New York Times reported &quot;...11 years after the government awarded a construction contract, the cost of the project has soared to nearly $5 billion. The vast concrete and steel structure is a half-finished hulk, and the government has yet to find a single customer, despite offers of lucrative subsidies.&quot; TVA (currently the most likely customer) said in April 2011 that it would delay a decision until it could see how MOX fuel performed in the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi.

==Separation technologies==
===Water and organic solvents===
====PUREX====
PUREX, the current standard method, is an acronym standing for &quot;Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by EXtraction&quot;. The PUREX process is a liquid-liquid extraction method used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, to extract uranium and plutonium, independent of each other, from the fission products. This is the most developed and widely used process in the industry at present.

When used on fuel from commercial power reactors the plutonium extracted typically contains too much Pu-240 to be considered &quot;weapons-grade&quot; plutonium, ideal for use in a nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, highly reliable nuclear weapons can be built at all levels of technical sophistication using reactor-grade plutonium. Moreover, reactors that are capable of refueling frequently can be used to produce weapon-grade plutonium, which can later be recovered using PUREX. Because of this, PUREX chemicals are monitored.
====Modifications of PUREX====
Many of these concepts, particularly those that separate the minor actinides once U and Pu have been extracted, are summarised in the advanced reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. 

=====UREX=====
The PUREX process can be modified to make a UREX (URanium EXtraction) process which could be used to save space inside high level nuclear waste disposal sites, such as the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, by removing the uranium which makes up the vast majority of the mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as reprocessed uranium.

The UREX process is a PUREX process which has been modified to prevent the plutonium from being extracted. This can be done by adding a plutonium reductant before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and &gt;95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides. The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to the extraction and scrub sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the PUREX process.

=====TRUEX=====
Adding a second extraction agent, octyl(phenyl)-N, N-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide (CMPO) in combination with tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process can be turned into the TRUEX (TRansUranic EXtraction) process. TRUEX was invented in the US by Argonne National Laboratory and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. The idea is that by lowering the alpha activity of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.

=====DIAMEX=====
As an alternative to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMide EXtraction) process has the advantage of avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber). The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.

=====SANEX=====
Selective ActiNide EXtraction. As part of the management of minor actinides it has been proposed that the lanthanides and trivalent minor actinides should be removed from the PUREX raffinate by a process such as DIAMEX or TRUEX. To allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel, the lanthanides must be removed. The lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron driven nuclear reaction. To date the extraction system for the SANEX process has not been defined, but currently several different research groups are working towards a process. For instance the French CEA is working on a bis-triazinyl pyridine (BTP) based process.
Other systems such as the dithiophosphinic acids are being worked on by some other workers.

=====UNEX=====
The &quot;UNiversal&quot; EXtraction process was developed in Russia and the Czech Republic; it is designed to completely remove the most troublesome radioisotopes (Sr, Cs and minor actinides) from the raffinate remaining after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. The chemistry is based upon the interaction of caesium and strontium with polyethylene glycol and a cobalt carborane anion (known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide). The actinides are extracted by CMPO, and the diluent is a polar aromatic such as nitrobenzene. Other diluents such as &quot;meta&quot;-nitrobenzotrifluoride and phenyl trifluoromethyl sulfone have been suggested as well.

==== Electrochemical and ion exchange methods ====
An exotic method using electrochemistry and ion exchange in ammonium carbonate has been reported. Other methods for the extraction of uranium using ion exchange in alkaline carbonate and &quot;fumed&quot; lead oxide have also been reported.

====Obsolete methods====
===== Bismuth phosphate =====
The bismuth phosphate process is an obsolete process that adds significant unnecessary material to the final radioactive waste. The bismuth phosphate process has been replaced by solvent extraction processes. The bismuth phosphate process was designed to extract plutonium from aluminium-clad nuclear fuel rods, containing uranium. The fuel was decladded by boiling it in caustic soda. After decladding, the uranium metal was dissolved in nitric acid.

The plutonium at this point is in the +4 oxidation state. It was then precipitated out of the solution by the addition of bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid to form the bismuth phosphate. The plutonium was coprecipitated with this. The supernatant liquid (containing many of the fission products) was separated from the solid. The precipitate was then dissolved in nitric acid before the addition of an oxidant (such as potassium permanganate) to produce PuO22+. The plutonium was maintained in the +6 oxidation state by addition of a dichromate salt.

The bismuth phosphate was next re-precipitated, leaving the plutonium in solution, and an iron(II) salt (such as ferrous sulfate) was added. The plutonium was again re-precipitated using a bismuth phosphate carrier and a combination of lanthanum salts and fluoride added, forming a solid lanthanum fluoride carrier for the plutonium. Addition of an alkali produced an oxide. The combined lanthanum plutonium oxide was collected and extracted with nitric acid to form plutonium nitrate.

===== Hexone or REDOX =====
This is a liquid-liquid extraction process which uses methyl isobutyl ketone codenamed hexone as the extractant. The extraction is by a &quot;solvation&quot; mechanism. This process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. This process was used in 1952-1956 on the Hanford S plant (REDOX plant) and has been replaced by the PUREX process.

===== Butex, β,β&#x27;-dibutyoxydiethyl ether =====
A process based on a solvation extraction process using the triether extractant named above. This process has the disadvantage of requiring the use of a salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio. This process was used at Windscale in 1951-1964. This process has been replaced by PUREX, which was shown to be a superior technology for larger scale reprocessing.

===== Sodium acetate =====
The sodium uranyl acetate process was used by the early Soviet nuclear industry to recover plutonium from irradiated fuel. It was never used in the West; the idea is to dissolve the fuel in nitric acid, alter the oxidation state of the plutonium, and then add acetic acid and base. This would convert the uranium and plutonium into a solid acetate salt.

Explosion of the crystallized acetates-nitrates in a non-cooled waste tank caused the Kyshtym disaster in 1957.

==Alternatives to PUREX==
As there are some downsides to the PUREX process, there have been efforts to develop alternatives to the process, some of them compatible with PUREX (i.e. the residue from one process could be used as feedstock for the other) and others wholly incompatible. None of these have (as of the 2020s) reached widespread commercial use, but some have seen large scale tests or firm commitments towards their future larger scale implementation.

=== Pyroprocessing ===
Pyroprocessing is a generic term for high-temperature methods. Solvents are molten salts (e.g. LiCl + KCl or LiF + CaF2) and molten metals (e.g. cadmium, bismuth, magnesium) rather than water and organic compounds. Electrorefining, distillation, and solvent-solvent extraction are common steps.

These processes are not currently in significant use worldwide, but they have been pioneered at Argonne National Laboratory with current research also being developed in Russia, as well, taking place at CRIEPI in Japan, the Nuclear Research Institute of Řež in Czech Republic, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research in India and KAERI in South Korea.

====Advantages of pyroprocessing====
* The principles behind it are well understood, and no significant technical barriers exist to their adoption.
* Readily applied to high-burnup spent fuel and requires little cooling time, since the operating temperatures are high already.
* Does not use solvents containing hydrogen and carbon, which are neutron moderators creating risk of criticality accidents and can absorb the fission product tritium and the activation product carbon-14 in dilute solutions that cannot be separated later.
**Alternatively, voloxidation (see below) can remove 99% of the tritium from used fuel and recover it in the form of a strong solution suitable for use as a supply of tritium.
* More compact than aqueous methods, allowing on-site reprocessing at the reactor site, which avoids transportation of spent fuel and its security issues, instead storing a much smaller volume of fission products on site as high-level waste until decommissioning. For example, the Integral Fast Reactor and Molten Salt Reactor fuel cycles are based on on-site pyroprocessing.
* It can separate many or even all actinides at once and produce highly radioactive fuel which is harder to manipulate for theft or making nuclear weapons. (However, the difficulty has been questioned.) In contrast the PUREX process was designed to separate plutonium only for weapons, and it also leaves the minor actinides (americium and curium) behind, producing waste with more long-lived radioactivity.
* Most of the radioactivity in roughly 102 to 105 years after the use of the nuclear fuel is produced by the actinides, since there are no fission products with half-lives in this range. These actinides can fuel fast reactors, so extracting and reusing (fissioning) them increases energy production per kg of fuel, as well as reducing the long-term radioactivity of the wastes.
* Fluoride volatility (see below) produces salts that can readily be used in molten salt reprocessing such as pyroprocessing
* The ability to process &quot;fresh&quot; spent fuel reduces the needs for spent fuel pools (even if the recovered short lived radionuclides are &quot;only&quot; sent to storage, that still requires less space as the bulk of the mass, uranium, can be stored separately from them). Uranium – even higher specific activity reprocessed uranium – does not need cooling for safe storage.
* Short lived radionuclides can be recovered from &quot;fresh&quot; spent fuel allowing either their direct use in industry science or medicine or the recovery of their decay products without contamination by other isotopes (for example: ruthenium in spent fuel decays to rhodium all isotopes of which other than further decay to stable isotopes of palladium. Palladium derived from the decay of fission ruthenium and rhodium will be nonradioactive, but fission Palladium contains significant contamination with long-lived . Ruthenium-107 and rhodium-107 both have half lives on the order of minutes and decay to palladium-107 before reprocessing under most circumstances)
* Possible fuels for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) that are mostly decayed in spent fuel, that has significantly aged, can be recovered in sufficient quantities to make their use worthwhile. Examples include materials with half lives around two years such as , , . While those would perhaps not be suitable for lengthy space missions, they can be used to replace diesel generators in off-grid locations where refueling is possible once a year. Antimony would be particularly interesting because it forms a stable alloy with lead and can thus be transformed relatively easily into a partially self-shielding and chemically inert form. Shorter lived RTG fuels present the further benefit of reducing the risk of orphan sources as the activity will decline relatively quickly if no refueling is undertaken.

====Disadvantages of pyroprocessing====
* Reprocessing as a whole is not currently (2005) in favor, and places that do reprocess already have PUREX plants constructed. Consequently, there is little demand for new pyrometallurgical systems, although there could be if the Generation IV reactor programs become reality.
* The used salt from pyroprocessing is less suitable for conversion into glass than the waste materials produced by the PUREX process.
* If the goal is to reduce the longevity of spent nuclear fuel in burner reactors, then better recovery rates of the minor actinides need to be achieved.
* Working with &quot;fresh&quot; spent fuel requires more shielding and better ways to deal with heat production than working with &quot;aged&quot; spent fuel does. If the facilities are built in such a way as to &quot;require&quot; high specific activity material, they cannot handle older &quot;legacy waste&quot; except blended with fresh spent fuel

===Electrolysis===
The electrolysis methods are based on the difference in the standard potentials of uranium, plutonium and minor actinides in a molten salt. The standard potential of uranium is the lowest, therefore when a potential is applied, the uranium will be reduced at the cathode out of the molten salt solution before the other elements.

====PYRO-A and -B for IFR====
These processes were developed by Argonne National Laboratory and used in the Integral Fast Reactor project.

PYRO-A is a means of separating actinides (elements within the actinide family, generally heavier than U-235) from non-actinides. The spent fuel is placed in an anode basket which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte. An electric current is applied, causing the uranium metal (or sometimes oxide, depending on the spent fuel) to plate out on a solid metal cathode while the other actinides (and the rare earths) can be absorbed into a liquid cadmium cathode. Many of the fission products (such as caesium, zirconium and strontium) remain in the salt. As alternatives to the molten cadmium electrode it is possible to use a molten bismuth cathode, or a solid aluminium cathode.

As an alternative to electrowinning, the wanted metal can be isolated by using a molten alloy of an electropositive metal and a less reactive metal.

Since the majority of the long term radioactivity, and volume, of spent fuel comes from actinides, removing the actinides produces waste that is more compact, and not nearly as dangerous over the long term. The radioactivity of this waste will then drop to the level of various naturally occurring minerals and ores within a few hundred, rather than thousands of, years.

The mixed actinides produced by pyrometallic processing can be used again as nuclear fuel, as they are virtually all either fissile, or fertile, though many of these materials would require a fast breeder reactor to be burned efficiently. In a thermal neutron spectrum, the concentrations of several heavy actinides (curium-242 and plutonium-240) can become quite high, creating fuel that is substantially different from the usual uranium or mixed uranium-plutonium oxides (MOX) that most current reactors were designed to use.

Another pyrochemical process, the PYRO-B process, has been developed for the processing and recycling of fuel from a transmuter reactor ( a fast breeder reactor designed to convert transuranic nuclear waste into fission products ). A typical transmuter fuel is free from uranium and contains recovered transuranics in an inert matrix such as metallic zirconium. In the PYRO-B processing of such fuel, an electrorefining step is used to separate the residual transuranic elements from the fission products and recycle the transuranics to the reactor for fissioning. Newly generated technetium and iodine are extracted for incorporation into transmutation targets, and the other fission products are sent to waste.

===Voloxidation===
Voloxidation (for &quot;volumetric oxidation&quot;) involves heating oxide fuel with oxygen, sometimes with alternating oxidation and reduction, or alternating oxidation by ozone to uranium trioxide with decomposition by heating back to triuranium octoxide. A major purpose is to capture tritium as tritiated water vapor before further processing where it would be difficult to retain the tritium. Tritium is a difficult contaminant to remove from aqueous solution, as it cannot be separated from water except by isotope separation. However, tritium is also a valuable product used in industry science and nuclear weapons, so recovery of a stream of hydrogen or water with a high tritium content can make targeted recovery economically worthwhile. Other volatile elements leave the fuel and must be recovered, especially iodine, technetium, and carbon-14. Voloxidation also breaks up the fuel or increases its surface area to enhance penetration of reagents in following reprocessing steps.

==== Advantages ====
* The process is simple and requires no complex machinery or chemicals above and beyond that required in all reprocessing (hot cells, remote handling equipment)
* Products such as krypton-85 or tritium, as well as xenon (whose isotope are either stable, very nearly stable, or quickly decay), can be recovered and sold for use in industry, science or medicine 
* Driving off volatile fission products allows for safer storage in interim storage or deep geological repository
* Nuclear proliferation risks are low as no separation of plutonium occurs
* Radioactive material is not chemically mobilized beyond what should be accounted for in long-term storage anyway. Substances that are inert as native elements or oxides remain so
* The product can be used as fuel in a CANDU reactor or even downblended with similarly treated spent CANDU fuel if too much fissile material is left in the spent fuel.
* The resulting product can be further processed by any of the other processes mentioned above and below. Removal of volatile fission products means that transportation becomes slightly easier compared to spent fuel with damaged or removed cladding
* All volatile products of concern (while helium will be present in the spent fuel, there won&#x27;t be any radioactive isotopes of helium) can in principle be recovered in a cold trap cooled by liquid nitrogen (temperature: or lower). However, this requires significant amounts of cooling to counteract the effect of decay heat from radioactive volatiles like krypton-85. Tritium will be present in the form of tritiated water, which is a solid at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.
* Technetium heptoxide can be removed as a gas by heating above its boiling point of which reduces the issues presented by Technetium contamination in processes like fluoride volatility or PUREX; ruthenium tetroxide (gaseous above ) can likewise be removed from the spent fuel and recovered for sale or disposal

====Disadvantages====
* Further processing is needed if the resulting product is to be used for re-enrichment or fabrication of MOX-fuel
* If volatile fission products escape to the environment this presents a radiation hazard, mostly due to , Tritium and . Their safe recovery and storage requires further equipment.
* An oxidizing agent / reducing agent has to be used for reduction/oxidation steps whose recovery can be difficult, energy consuming or both

===Volatilization in isolation===
Simply heating spent oxide fuel in an inert atmosphere or vacuum at a temperature between and as a first reprocessing step can remove several volatile elements, including caesium whose isotope caesium-137 emits about half of the heat produced by the spent fuel over the following 100 years of cooling (however, most of the other half is from strontium-90, which has a similar half-life).
The estimated overall mass balance for 20,000 g of processed fuel with 2,000 g of cladding is:

====Advantages====
* Requires no chemical processes at all
* Can in theory be done &quot;self heating&quot; via the decay heat of sufficiently &quot;fresh&quot; spent fuel
* Caesium-137 has uses in food irradiation and can be used to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators. However, its contamination with stable and long lived reduces efficiency of such uses while contamination with in relatively fresh spent fuel makes the curve of overall radiation and heat output much steeper until most of the has decayed
* Can potentially recover elements like ruthenium whose ruthenate ion is particularly troublesome in PUREX and which has no isotopes significantly longer lived than a year, allowing possible recovery of the metal for use
* A &quot;third phase recovery&quot; can be added to the process if substances that melt but don&#x27;t vaporize at the temperatures involved are drained to a container for liquid effluents and allowed to re-solidify. To avoid contamination with low-boiling products which melt at low temperatures, a melt plug could be used to open the container for liquid effluents only once a certain temperature is reached by the liquid phase.
* Strontium, which is present in the form of the particularly troublesome mid-lived fission product is liquid above . However, Strontium oxide remains solid below and if strontium oxide is to be recovered with other liquid effluents, it has to be reduced to the native metal before the heating step. Both Strontium and Strontium oxide form soluble Strontium hydroxide and hydrogen upon contact with water, which can be used to separate them from non-soluble parts of the spent fuel.
* As there are little to no chemical changes in the spent fuel, any chemical reprocessing methods can be used following this process

====Disadvantages====
* At temperatures above the native metal form of several actinides, including neptunium (melting point: ) and plutonium (melting point: ), are molten. This could be used to recover a liquid phase, raising proliferation concerns, given that uranium metal remains a solid until . While neptunium and plutonium cannot be easily separated from each other by different melting points, their differing solubility in water can be used to separate them.
* If &quot;nuclear self heating&quot; is employed, the spent fuel with have much higher specific activity, heat production and radiation release. If an external heat source is used, significant amounts of external power are needed, which mostly go to heat the uranium.
* Heating and cooling the vacuum chamber and/or the piping and vessels to collect volatile effluents induces thermal stress. This combines with radiation damage to material and possibly neutron embrittlement if neutron sources such as californium-252 are present to a significant extent.
* In the commonly used oxide fuel, some elements will be present both as oxides and as native elements. Depending on their chemical state, they may end up in either the volatalized stream or in the residue stream. If an element is present in both states to a significant degree, separation of that element may be impossible without converting it all to one chemical state or the other
* The temperatures involved are much higher than the melting point of lead () which can present issues with radiation shielding if lead is employed as a shielding material
* If filters are used to recover volatile fission products, those become low- to intermediate level waste.

=== Fluoride volatility ===
In the fluoride volatility process, fluorine is reacted with the fuel. Fluorine is so much more reactive than even oxygen that small particles of ground oxide fuel will burst into flame when dropped into a chamber full of fluorine. This is known as flame fluorination; the heat produced helps the reaction proceed. Most of the uranium, which makes up the bulk of the fuel, is converted to uranium hexafluoride, the form of uranium used in uranium enrichment, which has a very low boiling point. Technetium, the main long-lived fission product, is also efficiently converted to its volatile hexafluoride. A few other elements also form similarly volatile hexafluorides, pentafluorides, or heptafluorides. The volatile fluorides can be separated from excess fluorine by condensation, then separated from each other by fractional distillation or selective reduction. Uranium hexafluoride and technetium hexafluoride have very similar boiling points and vapor pressures, which makes complete separation more difficult.

Many of the fission products volatilized are the same ones volatilized in non-fluorinated, higher-temperature volatilization, such as iodine, tellurium and molybdenum; notable differences are that technetium is volatilized, but caesium is not.

Some transuranium elements such as plutonium, neptunium and americium can form volatile fluorides, but these compounds are not stable when the fluorine partial pressure is decreased. Most of the plutonium and some of the uranium will initially remain in ash which drops to the bottom of the flame fluorinator. The plutonium-uranium ratio in the ash may even approximate the composition needed for fast neutron reactor fuel. Further fluorination of the ash can remove all the uranium, neptunium, and plutonium as volatile fluorides; however, some other minor actinides may not form volatile fluorides and instead remain with the alkaline fission products. Some noble metals may not form fluorides at all, but remain in metallic form; however ruthenium hexafluoride is relatively stable and volatile.

Distillation of the residue at higher temperatures can separate lower-boiling transition metal fluorides and alkali metal (Cs, Rb) fluorides from higher-boiling lanthanide and alkaline earth metal (Sr, Ba) and yttrium fluorides. The temperatures involved are much higher, but can be lowered somewhat by distilling in a vacuum. If a carrier salt like lithium fluoride or sodium fluoride is being used as a solvent, high-temperature distillation is a way to separate the carrier salt for reuse.

Molten salt reactor designs carry out fluoride volatility reprocessing continuously or at frequent intervals. The goal is to return actinides to the molten fuel mixture for eventual fission, while removing fission products that are neutron poisons, or that can be more securely stored outside the reactor core while awaiting eventual transfer to permanent storage.

====Chloride volatility and solubility====
Many of the elements that form volatile high-valence fluorides will also form volatile high-valence chlorides. Chlorination and distillation is another possible method for separation. The sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides; for example, zirconium tetrachloride and tin tetrachloride have relatively low boiling points of and . Chlorination has even been proposed as a method for removing zirconium fuel cladding, instead of mechanical decladding.

Chlorides are likely to be easier than fluorides to later convert back to other compounds, such as oxides.

Chlorides remaining after volatilization may also be separated by solubility in water. Chlorides of alkaline elements like americium, curium, lanthanides, strontium, caesium are more soluble than those of uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and zirconium.

====Advantages of halogen volatility====
* Chlorine (and to a lesser extent fluorine) is a readily available industrial chemical that is produced in mass quantity
* Fractional distillation allows many elements to be separated from each other in a single step or iterative repetition of the same step
* Uranium will be produced directly as Uranium hexafluoride, the form used in enrichment
* Many volatile fluorides and chlorides are volatile at relatively moderate temperatures reducing thermal stress. This is especially important as the boiling point of uranium hexafluoride is below that of water, allowing to conserve energy in the separation of high boiling fission products (or their fluorides) from one another as this can take place in the absence of uranium, which makes up the bulk of the mass
* Some fluorides and chlorides melt at relatively low temperatures allowing a &quot;liquid phase separation&quot; if desired. Those low melting salts could be further processed by molten salt electrolysis.
* Fluorides and chlorides differ in water solubility depending on the cation. This can be used to separate them by aqueous solution. However, some fluorides violently react with water, which has to be taken into account.

====Disadvantages of halogen volatility====
* Many compounds of fluorine or chlorine as well as the native elements themselves are toxic, corrosive and react violently with air, water or both
* Uranium hexafluoride and Technetium hexafluoride have very similar boiling points ( and respectively), making it hard to completely separate them from one another by distillation.
* Fractional distillation as used in petroleum refining requires large facilities and huge amounts of energy. To process thousands of tons of uranium would require smaller facilities than processing billions of tons of petroleum however, unlike petroleum refineries, the entire process would have to take place inside radiation shielding and there would have to be provisions made to prevent leaks of volatile, poisonous and radioactive fluorides.
* Plutonium hexafluoride boils at this means that any facility capable of separating uranium hexafluoride from Technetium hexafluoride is capable of separating plutonium hexafluoride from either, raising proliferation concerns
* The presence of alpha emitters induces some (α,n) reactions in fluorine, producing both radioactive and neutrons. This effect can be reduced by separating alpha emitters and fluorine as fast as feasible. Interactions between chlorine&#x27;s two stable isotopes and on the one hand and alpha particles on the other are of lesser concern as they do not have as high a cross section and do not produce neutrons or long lived radionuclides.
* If carbon is present in the spent fuel it&#x27;ll form halogenated hydrocarbons which are extremely potent greenhouse gases, and hard to chemically decompose. Some of those are toxic as well.

===Radioanalytical separations===
To determine the distribution of radioactive metals for analytical purposes, Solvent Impregnated Resins (SIRs) can be used. SIRs are porous particles, which contain an extractant inside their pores. This approach avoids the liquid-liquid separation step required in conventional liquid-liquid extraction. For the preparation of SIRs for radioanalytical separations, organic Amberlite XAD-4 or XAD-7 can be used. Possible extractants are e.g. trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride(CYPHOS IL-101) or N,N0-dialkyl-N,N0-diphenylpyridine-2,6-dicarboxyamides
(R-PDA; R = butyl, octy I, decyl, dodecyl).

== Economics ==
The relative economics of reprocessing-waste disposal and interim storage-direct disposal was the focus of much debate over the first decade of the 2000s. Studies
have modeled the total fuel cycle costs of a reprocessing-recycling system based on one-time recycling of plutonium in existing thermal reactors (as opposed to the proposed breeder reactor cycle) and compare this to the total costs of an open fuel cycle with direct disposal. The range of results produced by these studies is very wide, but all agreed that under then-current economic conditions the reprocessing-recycle option is the more costly one. While the uranium market - particularly its short term fluctuations - has only a minor impact on the cost of electricity from nuclear power, long-term trends in the uranium market &quot;do&quot; significantly affect the economics of nuclear reprocessing. If uranium prices were to rise and remain consistently high, &quot;stretching the fuel supply&quot; via MOX fuel, breeder reactors or even the thorium fuel cycle could become more attractive. However, if uranium prices remain low, reprocessing will remain less attractive.

If reprocessing is undertaken only to reduce the radioactivity level of spent fuel it should be taken into account that spent nuclear fuel becomes less radioactive over time. After 40 years its radioactivity drops by 99.9%, though it still takes over a thousand years for the level of radioactivity to approach that of natural uranium. However the level of transuranic elements, including plutonium-239, remains high for over 100,000 years, so if not reused as nuclear fuel, then those elements need secure disposal because of nuclear proliferation reasons as well as radiation hazard.

On 25 October 2011 a commission of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission revealed during a meeting calculations about the costs of recycling nuclear fuel for power generation. These costs could be twice the costs of direct geological disposal of spent fuel: the cost of extracting plutonium and handling spent fuel was estimated at 1.98 to 2.14 yen per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Discarding the spent fuel as waste would cost only 1 to 1.35 yen per kilowatt-hour.

In July 2004 Japanese newspapers reported that the Japanese Government had estimated the costs of disposing radioactive waste, contradicting claims four months earlier that no such estimates had been made. The cost of non-reprocessing options was estimated to be between a quarter and a third ($5.5–7.9 billion) of the cost of reprocessing ($24.7 billion). At the end of the year 2011 it became clear that Masaya Yasui, who had been director of the Nuclear Power Policy Planning Division in 2004, had instructed his subordinate in April 2004 to conceal the data. The fact that the data were deliberately concealed obliged the ministry to re-investigate the case and to reconsider whether to punish the officials involved.

<text>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program&#x27;s state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing &quot;how&quot; a program operates step by step (generally order of the steps being determined in source code by the placement of statements one below the other), rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected results.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on &quot;what&quot; the program should accomplish without specifying all the details of &quot;how&quot; the program should achieve the result.

==Procedural programming==
Procedural programming is a type of imperative programming in which the program is built from one or more procedures (also termed subroutines or functions). The terms are often used as synonyms, but the use of procedures has a dramatic effect on how imperative programs appear and how they are constructed. Heavy procedural programming, in which state changes are localized to procedures or restricted to explicit arguments and returns from procedures, is a form of structured programming. Since the 1960s, structured programming and modular programming in general have been promoted as techniques to improve the maintainability and overall quality of imperative programs. The concepts behind object-oriented programming attempt to extend this approach.

Procedural programming could be considered a step toward declarative programming. A programmer can often tell, simply by looking at the names, arguments, and return types of procedures (and related comments), what a particular procedure is supposed to do, without necessarily looking at the details of how it achieves its result. At the same time, a complete program is still imperative since it &quot;fixes&quot; the statements to be executed and their order of execution to a large extent.

==Rationale and foundations of imperative programming==
The programming paradigm used to build programs for almost all computers typically follows an imperative model. Digital computer hardware is designed to execute machine code, which is native to the computer and is usually written in the imperative style, although low-level compilers and interpreters using other paradigms exist for some architectures such as lisp machines.

From this low-level perspective, the program state is defined by the contents of memory, and the statements are instructions in the native machine language of the computer. Higher-level imperative languages use variables and more complex statements, but still follow the same paradigm. Recipes and process checklists, while not computer programs, are also familiar concepts that are similar in style to imperative programming; each step is an instruction, and the physical world holds the state. Since the basic ideas of imperative programming are both conceptually familiar and directly embodied in the hardware, most computer languages are in the imperative style.

Assignment statements, in imperative paradigm, perform an operation on information located in memory and store the results in memory for later use. High-level imperative languages, in addition, permit the evaluation of complex expressions, which may consist of a combination of arithmetic operations and function evaluations, and the assignment of the resulting value to memory. Looping statements (as in while loops, do while loops, and for loops) allow a sequence of statements to be executed multiple times. Loops can either execute the statements they contain a predefined number of times, or they can execute them repeatedly until some condition is met. Conditional branching statements allow a sequence of statements to be executed only if some condition is met. Otherwise, the statements are skipped and the execution sequence continues from the statement following them. Unconditional branching statements allow an execution sequence to be transferred to another part of a program. These include the jump (called &quot;goto&quot; in many languages), switch, and the subprogram, subroutine, or procedure call (which usually returns to the next statement after the call).

Early in the development of high-level programming languages, the introduction of the block enabled the construction of programs in which a group of statements and declarations could be treated as if they were one statement. This, alongside the introduction of subroutines, enabled complex structures to be expressed by hierarchical decomposition into simpler procedural structures.

Many imperative programming languages (such as Fortran, BASIC, and C) are abstractions of assembly language.

==History of imperative and object-oriented languages==
The earliest imperative languages were the machine languages of the original computers. In these languages, instructions were very simple, which made hardware implementation easier but hindered the creation of complex programs. FORTRAN, developed by John Backus at International Business Machines (IBM) starting in 1954, was the first major programming language to remove the obstacles presented by machine code in the creation of complex programs. FORTRAN was a compiled language that allowed named variables, complex expressions, subprograms, and many other features now common in imperative languages. The next two decades saw the development of many other major high-level imperative programming languages. In the late 1950s and 1960s, ALGOL was developed in order to allow mathematical algorithms to be more easily expressed and even served as the operating system&#x27;s target language for some computers. MUMPS (1966) carried the imperative paradigm to a logical extreme, by not having any statements at all, relying purely on commands, even to the extent of making the IF and ELSE commands independent of each other, connected only by an intrinsic variable named $TEST. COBOL (1960) and BASIC (1964) were both attempts to make programming syntax look more like English. In the 1970s, Pascal was developed by Niklaus Wirth, and C was created by Dennis Ritchie while he was working at Bell Laboratories. Wirth went on to design Modula-2 and Oberon. For the needs of the United States Department of Defense, Jean Ichbiah and a team at Honeywell began designing Ada in 1978, after a 4-year project to define the requirements for the language. The specification was first published in 1983, with revisions in 1995, 2005, and 2012.

The 1980s saw a rapid growth in interest in object-oriented programming. These languages were imperative in style, but added features to support objects. The last two decades of the 20th century saw the development of many such languages. Smalltalk-80, originally conceived by Alan Kay in 1969, was released in 1980, by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Drawing from concepts in another object-oriented language—Simula (which is considered the world&#x27;s first object-oriented programming language, developed in the 1960s)—Bjarne Stroustrup designed C++, an object-oriented language based on C. Design of C++ began in 1979 and the first implementation was completed in 1983. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the notable imperative languages drawing on object-oriented concepts were Perl, released by Larry Wall in 1987; Python, released by Guido van Rossum in 1990; Visual Basic and Visual C++ (which included Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) 2.0), released by Microsoft in 1991 and 1993 respectively; PHP, released by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; Java, by James Gosling (Sun Microsystems) in 1995, JavaScript, by Brendan Eich (Netscape), and Ruby, by Yukihiro &quot;Matz&quot; Matsumoto, both released in 1995. Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework (2002) is imperative at its core, as are its main target languages, VB.NET and C# that run on it; however Microsoft&#x27;s F#, a functional language, also runs on it.

==Examples==

===Fortran===
FORTRAN (1958) was unveiled as &quot;The IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANslating system.&quot; It was designed for scientific calculations, without string handling facilities. Along with declarations, expressions, and statements, it supported:
* arrays
* subroutines 
* &quot;do&quot; loops

It succeeded because:
* programming and debugging costs were below computer running costs
* it was supported by IBM
* applications at the time were scientific.

However, non IBM vendors also wrote Fortran compilers, but with a syntax that would likely fail IBM&#x27;s compiler. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed the first Fortran standard in 1966. In 1978, Fortran 77 became the standard until 1991. Fortran 90 supports:
* records
* pointers to arrays

===COBOL===
COBOL (1959) stands for &quot;COmmon Business Oriented Language.&quot; Fortran manipulated symbols. It was soon realized that symbols did not need to be numbers, so strings were introduced. The US Department of Defense influenced COBOL&#x27;s development, with Grace Hopper being a major contributor. The statements were English-like and verbose. The goal was to design a language so managers could read the programs. However, the lack of structured statements hindered this goal.

COBOL&#x27;s development was tightly controlled, so dialects did not emerge to require ANSI standards. As a consequence, it was not changed for 15 years until 1974. The 1990s version did make consequential changes, like object-oriented programming.

===Algol===
ALGOL (1960) stands for &quot;ALGOrithmic Language.&quot; It had a profound influence on programming language design. Emerging from a committee of European and American programming language experts, it used standard mathematical notation and had a readable structured design. Algol was first to define its syntax using the Backus–Naur form. This led to syntax-directed compilers. It added features like:
* block structure, where variables were local to their block
* arrays with variable bounds
* &quot;for&quot; loops
* functions
* recursion

Algol&#x27;s direct descendants include Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, Delphi and Oberon on one branch. On another branch there&#x27;s C, C++ and Java.

===Basic===
BASIC (1964) stands for &quot;Beginner&#x27;s All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.&quot; It was developed at Dartmouth College for all of their students to learn. If a student did not go on to a more powerful language, the student would still remember Basic. A Basic interpreter was installed in the microcomputers manufactured in the late 1970s. As the microcomputer industry grew, so did the language.

Basic pioneered the interactive session. It offered operating system commands within its environment:
* The &#x27;new&#x27; command created an empty slate
* Statements evaluated immediately
* Statements could be programmed by preceding them with a line number
* The &#x27;list&#x27; command displayed the program
* The &#x27;run&#x27; command executed the program

However, the Basic syntax was too simple for large programs. Recent dialects added structure and object-oriented extensions. Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic is still widely used and produces a graphical user interface.

===C===
C programming language (1973) got its name because the language BCPL was replaced with B, and AT&amp;T Bell Labs called the next version &quot;C.&quot; Its purpose was to write the UNIX operating system. C is a relatively small language -- making it easy to write compilers. Its growth mirrored the hardware growth in the 1980s. Its growth also was because it has the facilities of assembly language, but uses a high-level syntax. It added advanced features like:
* inline assembler
* arithmetic on pointers
* pointers to functions
* bit operations
* freely combining complex operators
&quot;C&quot; allows the programmer to control in which region of memory data is to be stored. &quot;Global variables&quot; and &quot;static variables&quot; require the fewest clock cycles to store. The stack is automatically used for the standard variable declarations. Heap memory is returned to a pointer variable from the codice_1 function.

* The &quot;global and static data&quot; region is located just above the &quot;program&quot; region. (The program region is technically called the &quot;text&quot; region. It&#x27;s where machine instructions are stored.)
:* The global and static data region is technically two regions. One region is called the &quot;initialized data segment&quot;, where variables declared with default values are stored. The other region is called the &quot;block started by segment&quot;, where variables declared without default values are stored.
:* Variables stored in the &quot;global and static data&quot; region have their addresses set at compile-time. They retain their values throughout the life of the process.

:* The global and static region stores the &quot;global variables&quot; that are declared on top of (outside) the codice_2 function. Global variables are visible to codice_2 and every other function in the source code.

: On the other hand, variable declarations inside of codice_2, other functions, or within codice_5 codice_6 block delimiters are &quot;local variables&quot;. Local variables also include &quot;formal parameter variables&quot;. Parameter variables are enclosed within the parenthesis of function definitions. They provide an interface to the function.

:* &quot;Local variables&quot; declared using the codice_7 prefix are also stored in the &quot;global and static data&quot; region. Unlike global variables, static variables are only visible within the function or block. Static variables always retain their value. An example usage would be the function codice_8

* The stack region is a contiguous block of memory located near the top memory address. Variables placed in the stack are populated from top to bottom. A stack pointer is a special-purpose register that keeps track of the last memory address populated. Variables are placed into the stack via the &quot;assembly language&quot; PUSH instruction. Therefore, the addresses of these variables are set during runtime. The method for stack variables to lose their scope is via the POP instruction.

:* &quot;Local variables&quot; declared without the codice_7 prefix, including formal parameter variables, are called &quot;automatic variables&quot; and are stored in the stack. They are visible inside the function or block and lose their scope upon exiting the function or block.

* The heap region is located below the stack. It is populated from the bottom to the top. The operating system manages the heap using a &quot;heap pointer&quot; and a list of allocated memory blocks. Like the stack, the addresses of heap variables are set during runtime. An out of memory error occurs when the heap pointer and the stack pointer meet.

:* &quot;C&quot; provides the codice_1 library function to allocate heap memory. Populating the heap with data is an additional copy function. Variables stored in the heap are economically passed to functions using pointers. Without pointers, the entire block of data would have to be passed to the function via the stack.

===C++===
In the 1970s, software engineers needed language support to break large projects down into modules. One obvious feature was to decompose large projects &quot;physically&quot; into separate files. A less obvious feature was to decompose large projects &quot;logically&quot; into abstract datatypes. At the time, languages supported concrete (scalar) datatypes like integer numbers, floating-point numbers, and strings of characters. Concrete datatypes have their representation as part of their name. Abstract datatypes are structures of concrete datatypes — with a new name assigned. For example, a list of integers could be called codice_11.

In object-oriented jargon, abstract datatypes are called classes. However, a &quot;class&quot; is only a definition; no memory is allocated. When memory is allocated to a class, it&#x27;s called an object.

&quot;Object-oriented imperative languages&quot; developed by combining the need for classes and the need for safe functional programming. A function, in an object-oriented language, is assigned to a class. An assigned function is then referred to as a method, member function, or &quot;operation&quot;. &quot;Object-oriented programming&quot; is executing &quot;operations&quot; on &quot;objects&quot;.

&quot;Object-oriented languages&quot; support a syntax to model subset/superset relationships. In set theory, an element of a subset inherits all the attributes contained in the superset. For example, a student is a person. Therefore, the set of students is a subset of the set of persons. As a result, students inherit all the attributes common to all persons. Additionally, students have unique attributes that other persons don&#x27;t have. &quot;Object-oriented languages&quot; model &quot;subset/superset&quot; relationships using inheritance. &quot;Object-oriented programming&quot; became the dominant language paradigm by the late 1990s.

C++ (1985) was originally called &quot;C with Classes.&quot; It was designed to expand C&#x27;s capabilities by adding the object-oriented facilities of the language Simula.

An object-oriented module is composed of two files. The definitions file is called the header file. Here is a C++ &quot;header file&quot; for the &quot;GRADE class&quot; in a simple school application:
// grade.h

// Used to allow multiple source files to include
// this header file without duplication errors.
// See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard
#ifndef GRADE_H
#define GRADE_H

class GRADE {
public:
 // This is the constructor operation.
 GRADE ( const char letter );

 // This is a class variable.
 char letter;

 // This is a member operation.
 int grade_numeric( const char letter );

 // This is a class variable.
 int numeric;
#endif
A constructor operation is a function with the same name as the class name. It is executed when the calling operation executes the codice_12 statement.

A module&#x27;s other file is the &quot;source file&quot;. Here is a C++ source file for the &quot;GRADE class&quot; in a simple school application:
// grade.cpp
#include &quot;grade.h&quot;

GRADE::GRADE( const char letter )
 // Reference the object using the keyword &#x27;this&#x27;.
 this-&gt;letter = letter;

 // This is Temporal Cohesion
 this-&gt;numeric = grade_numeric( letter );

int GRADE::grade_numeric( const char letter )
 if ( ( letter == &#x27;A&#x27; || letter == &#x27;a&#x27; ) )
 return 4;
 else
 if ( ( letter == &#x27;B&#x27; || letter == &#x27;b&#x27; ) )
 return 3;
 else
 if ( ( letter == &#x27;C&#x27; || letter == &#x27;c&#x27; ) )
 return 2;
 else
 if ( ( letter == &#x27;D&#x27; || letter == &#x27;d&#x27; ) )
 return 1;
 else
 if ( ( letter == &#x27;F&#x27; || letter == &#x27;f&#x27; ) )
 return 0;
 else
 return -1;


Here is a C++ &quot;header file&quot; for the &quot;PERSON class&quot; in a simple school application:
// person.h
#ifndef PERSON_H
#define PERSON_H

class PERSON {
public:
 PERSON ( const char *name );
 const char *name;
#endif
Here is a C++ &quot;source file&quot; for the &quot;PERSON class&quot; in a simple school application:
// person.cpp
#include &quot;person.h&quot;

PERSON::PERSON ( const char *name )
 this-&gt;name = name;


Here is a C++ &quot;header file&quot; for the &quot;STUDENT class&quot; in a simple school application:
// student.h
#ifndef STUDENT_H
#define STUDENT_H

#include &quot;person.h&quot;
#include &quot;grade.h&quot;

// A STUDENT is a subset of PERSON.
class STUDENT : public PERSON{
public:
 STUDENT ( const char *name );
 ~STUDENT();
 GRADE *grade;
#endif
Here is a C++ &quot;source file&quot; for the &quot;STUDENT class&quot; in a simple school application:
// student.cpp
#include &quot;student.h&quot;
#include &quot;person.h&quot;

STUDENT::STUDENT ( const char *name ):
 // Execute the constructor of the PERSON superclass.
 PERSON( name )
 // Nothing else to do.
}

STUDENT::~STUDENT() 
 // deallocate grade&#x27;s memory
 // to avoid memory leaks.
 delete this-&gt;grade;


Here is a driver program for demonstration:
// student_dvr.cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;student.h&quot;

int main( void )
 STUDENT *student = new STUDENT( &quot;The Student&quot; );
 student-&gt;grade = new GRADE( &#x27;a&#x27; );

 std::cout 
 // Notice student inherits PERSON&#x27;s name
 « student-&gt;name
 « &quot;: Numeric grade = &quot;
 « student-&gt;grade-&gt;numeric
 « &quot;\n&quot;;

 // deallocate student&#x27;s memory
 // to avoid memory leaks.
 delete student;

 return 0;


Here is a makefile to compile everything:
# makefile
all: student_dvr

clean:
 rm student_dvr *.o

student_dvr: student_dvr.cpp grade.o student.o person.o
 c++ student_dvr.cpp grade.o student.o person.o -o student_dvr

grade.o: grade.cpp grade.h
 c++ -c grade.cpp

student.o: student.cpp student.h

<text>&quot;Eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot; – which can be spelled a number of ways – is a children&#x27;s counting-out rhyme, used to select a person in games such as tag, or for selecting various other things. It is one of a large group of similar rhymes in which the child who is pointed to by the chanter on the last syllable is chosen. The rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820 and is common in many languages using similar-sounding nonsense syllables. Some versions use a racial slur, which has made the rhyme controversial at times.

Since many similar counting-out rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to know its exact origin.

== Current version ==
A common modern version is:
The scholars Iona and Peter Opie noted that many variants have been recorded, some with additional words, such as &quot;O. U. T. spells out, And out goes she, In the middle of the deep blue sea&quot; or &quot;My mother [told me/says to] pick the very best one, and that is Y-O-U/you are [not] it&quot;; while another source cites &quot;Out goes Y-O-U.&quot; &quot;Tigger&quot; is also used instead of &quot;tiger&quot; in some versions of the rhyme.

== Origins ==

The first record of a similar rhyme, called the &quot;Hana, man,&quot; is from about 1815, when children in New York City are said to have repeated the rhyme:
Mario Arellano de Santiago discovered that this version was in the US, Ireland and Scotland in the 1880s but was unknown in England until later in the century. Bolton also found a similar rhyme in German:
Variations of this rhyme with the nonsense/counting first line have been collected since the 1820s. This is one of many variants of &quot;counting out rhymes&quot; collected by Bolton in 1888:
A Cornish version collected in 1882 runs:

There are many theories about the origins of the rhyme. They include:

* It is descended from Old English or Welsh counting, similar to the old shepherd&#x27;s count &quot;Yan Tan Tethera&quot; or the Cornish &quot;Eena, mena, mona, mite&quot;.

* British colonials returning from India introduced a doggerel version of an Indian children&#x27;s rhyme used in the game of carom billiards:
*It comes from a Swahili poem brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans: &quot;Iino ya mmiini maiini mo&quot;.

* It comes from a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon, divination rhyme, argued for in 1957 by the Dutch philologists Jan Naarding and Klaas Heeroma of the (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen. The rhyme was recorded in 1904 by Nynke van Hichtum in Goor in the eastern Netherlands.
== American and British versions ==
Some versions of this rhyme used the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot; instead of &quot;tiger&quot;. Iona and Peter Opie in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&quot; (1951), remark that the word &quot;nigger&quot; was common in American folklore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb. They quote the following version:
This version was similar to that reported by Henry Carrington Bolton as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888. It was used in the chorus of Bert Fitzgibbon&#x27;s 1906 song &quot;Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo&quot;:

It was also used by Rudyard Kipling in his &quot;A Counting-Out Song&quot;, from &quot;Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides&quot;, published in 1935. This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.

== Variations ==

There are considerable variations in the words of the rhyme, including from the early twentieth century in the United States of America:

During the Second World War, an AP dispatch from Atlanta, Georgia reported that Atlanta children were heard reciting this version:

Distinct versions of the rhyme in the United Kingdom, collected in the 1950s &amp; 1960s, include:

In Australia, children sang:

== Controversies ==
* In 1993, a high school teacher in Mequon, Wisconsin, provoked a student walkout when she said, in reference to poor test performance, &quot;What did you do? Just go eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a nigger by the toe?&quot; The school&#x27;s district superintendent recommended the teacher &quot;lose three days of pay, undergo racial sensitivity training, and have a memorandum detailing the incident placed in her personnel file&quot;.
* A jocular use of a form of the rhyme by a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, encouraging passengers to sit down so the plane could take off, led to a 2003 lawsuit charging the airline with intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Two versions of the rhyme were attested in court; both &quot;Eeny meeny miny mo, Please sit down it&#x27;s time to go&quot; and &quot;Pick a seat, it&#x27;s time to go&quot;. The passengers in question were African American and stated that they were humiliated because of what they called the &quot;racist history&quot; of the rhyme. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Southwest and the plaintiffs&#x27; appeal was denied.
* In May 2014, an unbroadcast outtake of BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; showed presenter Jeremy Clarkson reciting the rhyme and deliberately mumbling a line which some took to be &quot;catch a nigger by his toe&quot;. In response to accusations of racism, Clarkson apologised to viewers that his attempts to obscure the line &quot;weren&#x27;t quite good enough&quot;.
* In 2017, the retailer Primark removed from its UK stores a T-shirt that featured the first line of the rhyme as spoken by &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; character Negan, overlaid with an image of his baseball bat. A customer, minister Ian Lucraft, complained the T-shirt was &quot;fantastically offensive&quot; and claimed the imagery &quot;relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America&quot;.

== Cultural significance ==

There are many scenes in books, films, plays, cartoons and video games in which a variant of &quot;Eeny meeny ...&quot; is used by a character who is making a choice, either for serious or comic effect. Notably, the rhyme has been used by killers to choose victims in the 1994 films &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, the 2003 film &quot;Elephant&quot;, and the 100th issue of the comic book series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, which was adapted for the sixth-season finale of the television series.

=== Music ===

The lyrics to &quot;Loose Booty&quot;, the sole a-side single from Funkadelic&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; (1972), opens with this verse: 
The vinyl release of Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997) uses the words &quot;eeny meeny miny moe&quot; (rather than letter or numbers) on the labels of Sides A, B, C and D respectively.

&quot;Iniminimanimo&quot; is a 1999 song by Kim Kay.

=== Literature ===
The title of Chester Himes&#x27;s novel &quot;If He Hollers Let Him Go&quot; (1945) refers to the rhyme.

Rex Stout wrote a 1962 Nero Wolfe novella titled &quot;Eeny Meeny Murder Mo&quot;.

In Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Last Sigh&quot; (1995), the leading character and his three sisters are nicknamed Ina, Minnie, Mynah and Moor.

=== Film and television ===

In the 1930s, animation producer Walter Lantz introduced the cartoon characters Meany, Miny, and Moe (later Meeny, Miney and Mo), first appearing in Oswald Rabbit cartoons, then in their own series.

The 1933 Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;Bosko&#x27;s Picture Show&quot; parodies MGM as &quot;TNT pictures&quot;, whose logo is a roaring and burping lion with the motto &quot;Eenie Meanie Minie Moe&quot; in the place of MGM&#x27;s &quot;Ars Gratia Artis&quot;.

The rhyme appears towards the end of 1949 British black comedy &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;. The use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; was censored for the American market, being replaced by &quot;sailor&quot;. The uncensored word was restored for the Criterion Collection edition of the film.

<doc id="197851" wikidata="Q660251" url="?curid=197851" title="Jerzy Różycki">
<text>Jerzy Witold Różycki (; 24 July 1909 – 9 January 1942) was a Polish mathematician and cryptologist who worked at breaking German Enigma-machine ciphers before and during World War II.

==Life==
Różycki was born in what is now Ukraine, the fourth and youngest child of Zygmunt Różycki, a pharmacist and graduate of Saint Petersburg University, and Wanda, née Benita. He attended a Polish school in Kyiv before moving with his family to Poland in 1918. In 1926 he completed secondary school at Wyszków on eastern Poland&#x27;s Bug River.

Różycki studied mathematics from 1927 to 1932 in western Poland, at Poznań University&#x27;s Mathematics Institute, graduating with a master&#x27;s degree on February 19, 1932. He would later earn a second master&#x27;s degree from Poznań University, in geography, on December 13, 1937.

In 1929, while still a student, Różycki, proficient in German, was one of twenty-odd Poznań University mathematics students who accepted an invitation to attend a secret cryptology course organized at a nearby military installation by the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau, headquartered in Warsaw.

From September 1932 Różycki served as a civilian cryptologist with the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau, housed till 1937 in Warsaw&#x27;s Saxon Palace. He worked there together with fellow Poznań University mathematics alumni and Cipher Bureau cryptology-course graduates Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski.

After Rejewski had reconstructed the German military Enigma machine in December 1932, Różycki and Zygalski likewise worked at ongoing development of methods and equipment to exploit Enigma decryption as a source of intelligence. Różycki invented the &quot;clock&quot; method, which sometimes made it possible to determine which of the machine&#x27;s rotors was at the far right, that is, in the position where the rotor always revolved at every depression of a key.
On 9 January 1942 Różycki perished in the Mediterranean Sea while returning to the Cadix center, near Uzès in Vichy France, from a stint at Cadix&#x27;s branch office at the Château Couba on the outskirts of Algiers. His passenger ship, the &quot;SS Lamoricière&quot;, sank in unclear circumstances near the Balearic Islands. Fellow victims of the disaster, among the 222 passengers killed, included Piotr Smoleński and Captain Jan Graliński, of the prewar Polish Cipher Bureau&#x27;s Russian section, and a French officer accompanying the three Poles, Captain François Lane. 

Różycki has a cenotaph (symbolic grave) in the National Pantheon at the Saints Peter and Paul Church in Kraków, Poland.

==Family==
In 1938, aged 29, Różycki married Maria Barbara Mayka. Their son, Janusz Różycki, born May 10, 1939, completed his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw and went on to be a member of the Polish fencing team that won a silver medal at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

==Recognition==

In 1980 Różycki and his two mathematician colleagues were among the heroes of &quot;Sekret Enigmy&quot; (The Enigma Secret), a Polish thriller film about their solution of the German Enigma cipher. Late 1980 also saw a similarly-themed Polish TV series, &quot;Tajemnice Enigmy&quot; (The Secrets of Enigma).

On 21 February 2000, Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski posthumously awarded Różycki the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding contributions to his homeland. 

In 2007 a three-sided memorial was unveiled before the Imperial Castle in Poznań, commemorating the three mathematician-cryptologists (Rejewski, Różycki and Zygalski), alumni of the University of Poznań, who reconstructed the German Enigma machine and developed methods of breaking Enigma ciphers, thus contributing to subsequent Allied victory in World War II.

In 2009 the Polish Post issued a series of four commemorative stamps, one of which pictured Różycki and fellow mathematician-cryptologists Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski. 

In 2014 Różycki, Rejewski, and Zygalski were posthumously awarded the prestigious IEEE Milestone Award by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in recognition of achievements that have changed the world. On 5 August 2014 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) honored Rejewski, Różycki, and Zygalski with its prestigious Milestone Award, which recognizes achievements that have changed the world. Milestones was given for &quot;First Breaking of Enigma Code by the Team of Polish Cipher Bureau, 1932-1939&quot;, they built the ‘bomba’ – the first cryptanalytic machine to break codes. Their work was a foundation of British code breaking efforts which, with later American assistance, helped end World War II.
In 2014 a commemorative plaque in Polish and English, dedicated to Różycki and his two colleagues, was unveiled before the Polish Academy of Sciences Mathematics Institute in Warsaw.

In 2018 a bench commemorating Różycki was unveiled in a park in the town of Wyszków, where Różycki had attended secondary school.

In 2021 the Enigma Cipher Centre, an educational and scientific institution dedicated to the Polish mathematicians who broke the Enigma cipher, including Jerzy Różycki, opened in Poznań.

<doc id="197861" wikidata="Q588362" url="?curid=197861" title="Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)">
<text>The Kadam school () of Tibetan Buddhism, or Kadampa was an 11th century Buddhist tradition founded by the great Bengali master Atiśa (982–1054) and his students including Dromtön (1005–1064), a Tibetan Buddhist lay master. The Kadampa stressed compassion, pure discipline and study. By the 15th century, Tsongkapa is credited with synthesizing and folding Kadampa lineages into the Gelug school.

The most evident teachings of that tradition were the graduated teachings on the Mahayana path. These special presentations became known as lojong (mind training) and lamrim (stages of the path). Kadam masters like Atiśa also promoted the study of madhyamaka philosophy. According to Ronald M. Davidson, &quot;Atiśa&#x27;s coming to Tibet in 1042 was the threshold moment in the efflorescence of Buddhism and provided a stable foundation for monastic scholarship for the next thousand years.&quot; 

With the rise of new Tibetan Buddhist schools like Sakya and Gelug, Kadam ceased to exist as an independent school, and its monasteries, lineages and traditions were absorbed into all major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Because of this, Kadampa lineages remained strong long after the school disappeared.

==History of the Kadam tradition==
The most important founding figure of the Kadam tradition is Atiśa Dīpankara Śrījñāna (982–1054), a Bengali Indian Buddhist master who was known as a great teacher at Vikramaśīla and traveled to Tibet in 1037 on the invitation of a princeling named Jangchub O. Atiśa&#x27;s poem, the &quot;Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment&quot; (&quot;Bodhipathapradīpa; Tib. Byang chub lam sgron&quot;) was an influential text which laid out the stages of the path to Buddhahood. He also helped translate some texts into Tibetan, taught Buddhism and wrote on Vajrayana practice. Atiśa&#x27;s main teaching focus was on presenting a comprehensive Buddhist Mahayana system, and his numerous works explain basic topics such as bodhicitta, the six perfections, the two truths, dependent origination, karma, and Madhyamaka philosophy. 

Over time he drew several students around him, including the influential Dromtönpa Gyelwé Jungné, who convinced Atiśa to stay in Tibet indefinitely. This Buddhist circle was part of the &quot;later diffusion&quot; of Buddhism in Tibet. The tradition became known as Kadampa over time. The name means those who teach the Buddhist scriptures (&quot;bka&quot;) through personal instructions (&quot;gdams&quot;).

After the death of Atiśa in 1054, his main disciple Dromtön was the main leader of the Kadam tradition. He founded Radreng Monastery in 1056. Another important student was Ngog Legpai Sherab, he founded Sangpu Neutog in 1071. According to Sam Van Schaik, &quot;both monasteries followed Atiśa&#x27;s principle of combining tantric meditation practice with a firm adherence to the monastic code and with rigorous scholarship.&quot; Reting Monastery was located in Reting Tsangpo valley north of Lhasa. The nearby Phenpo Chu and Gyama Valleys were also home to many large Kadampa monasteries.

Dromtön&#x27;s three main students were Po to ba Rin chen gsal (Potowa), Spyan mnga’ ba Tshul khrims ’bar (Chen Ngawa), and Bu chung ba Gzhon nu rgyal mtshan (Bu chungwa). From these three come the main teaching lineages of Kadam: (1) the authoritative treatises (gzhung) lineage, (2) the essential instruction (gdams ngag) lineage, and (3) the oral instruction (man ngag) lineage, respectively. These &quot;three brothers&quot; as they became known, traveled Central Tibet teaching and promoting the Kadampa order.

During the 11th and 12th centuries especially, the monastery at Sangpu became the dominant Kadampa institution, known for its scholarship. According to Van Schaik, &quot;Sangpu became the centre of the renaissance in Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism.&quot; It maintained a curriculum which covered &quot;Prajñāpāramita&quot;, pramāṇa, vinaya and abhidharma. Another influential Kadam monastery for Buddhist scholarship was Narthang Monastery, which was established in 1153 by Tumtön Lodrö Drak (ca. 1106-66). According to Thupten Jinpa, these two scholastic centers &quot;came to dominate the study of classical Indian Buddhist learning, especially in epistemology, abhidharma psychology and phenomenology, the scholastic inquiry into the perfection of wisdom literature, and the Middle Way philosophy of emptiness.&quot;

Due to influence and prominence of other Tibetan Buddhist schools like Sakya, Gelug and Kagyu, the Kadampa ceased to exist as an independent tradition by the end of the 16th century and their monasteries and lineages were absorbed into the other schools.

== Teachings and study ==

=== Authoritative Treatises Lineage ===
The Authoritative Treatises lineage of Putowa Rinchensél (1031–1106) emphasized the close study of six classic Indian Buddhist texts:
#Asaṅga&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot;, a section of his &quot;Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra&quot;
#Maitreya-nātha&#x27;s &quot;Mahāyāna-sūtrālamkāra-kārikā&quot;, a Yogacara work
#Shantideva&#x27;s &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya&quot;
#Shantideva&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot;
#The &quot;Jātakamālā&quot; of Aryaśura
#The &quot;Udānavarga&quot;
Furthermore, according to Thupten Jinpa, &quot;the studies of these treatises are complemented with further Indian Buddhist classics like Nagarjuna’s (second century) &quot;Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way&quot;, his &quot;Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness&quot;, and Atisa’s &quot;Entry into the Two Truths&quot; and &quot;An Instruction on the Middle Way&quot;.&quot;

=== Scholarship ===
Atiśa was a follower of the Madhyamaka school and he introduced the complementary study of the works of Candrakīrti and Bhāviveka. Atiśa’s Madhyamaka philosophy was a synthesis which drew on the works of Bhāviveka and Candrakīrti. Atiśa taught Madhyamaka by using Bhāviveka&#x27;s &quot;Tarkajvālā&quot; and &quot;Madhyamakaratnapradīpa&quot; as an introduction and then taught advanced students Candrakīrti’s &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;.

Later Kadampas (especially at Sangpu) continued the scholastic study of Indian Buddhist philosophy. At Sangpu, Kadampas also studied Indian Buddhist pramāṇavāda philosophers like Dharmakirti. However, unlike Dharmakirti and other Tibetan Buddhists who followed the Yogacara-Madhyamaka of Śāntarakṣita (725–788), the Kadampas (following Candrakirti) instead defended a form of realism regarding conventional truth. Thus they accepted the existence of external objects conventionally. 

Kadam madhyamika philosopher-translators from Sangpu, like Ngog Loden Sherab (1059–1109) and Chaba Chokyi Senge (1109–1169) translated and produced works on madhyamaka and on epistemology (&quot;pramāṇa&quot;). These philosophical works were influential on later Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. Their work had a lasting impact on Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism and by the 12th century, their study curriculum had become part of mainstream Buddhist study in Central Tibet. It was also at Sangpu that Sonam Tsemo (1142–1182), one of the founders of the Sakya tradition, studied under Chapa Chokyi Senge. 

Another important commentator on madhyamaka, Patsab Nyima Drakpa (1055-1145?), was also a Sangpu monastery monk who had studied in Kashmir as well. Patsab&#x27;s commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; seems to be the first Tibetan commentary on this work. His interpretation was based on Chandrakirti&#x27;s method (which Patsab labeled &quot;thal &#x27;gyur ba&quot; i.e. &quot;prāsaṅgika&quot;) and this differed from that of Ngog and Chaba&#x27;s &quot;rang rgyud pa&quot; or &quot;svātantrika&quot;. One of Patsab&#x27;s students, Mabja Changchub Tsöndrü, became known for his influential commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mulamadhyamakakarika&quot;. 

=== Oral transmissions and essential instructions ===
Two other important early Kadampa lineages were the Kadam oral transmissions (&quot;man ngag&quot;) lineage entrusted to Phu-chungwa Shönu Gyaltsen (1031–1106) and the Kadam essential instructions (&quot;gdams ngag&quot;) lineage obtained by Chengawa Tsültrim Bar (1033–1103). According to Jinpa &quot;Chengawa’s Kadam lineage of essential instructions emphasizes an approach whereby Atisa&#x27;s essential instructions, rather than classical treatises, are the key basis for practice. These instructions include the guide on the four truths as transmitted through Chengawa, the guide on the two truths as transmitted through Naljorpa, and the guide on dependent origination as transmitted through Phuchungwa.&quot; 

Phu-chungwa&#x27;s oral transmission lineage focused on studying the teachings found in &quot;The Book of Kadam&quot;. 

These instructions were passed down only to one student in each generation in a single transmission until the secrecy was lifted at the time of Narthang Shönu Lodrö. Later these teachings were incorporated into the Karma Kamtsang Kagyu lineage by Pal Tsuglak Trengwa and into the Gelug lineage by the 1st Dalai Lama.

=== Lamrim ===
The Kadam school was also known for their gradual step by step schema to the Mahayana Buddhist path, which are recorded in texts known as “steps of the path” (&quot;lam rim&quot;) or “stages of the doctrine” (&quot;bstan rim&quot;). They typically divided Buddhist practitioners into three types, culminating with tantra and Buddhahood. Atiśa’s &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot; is the locus classicus for this genre, other works include the “Short Treatises of Atiśa” (&quot;Jo bo’i chos chung&quot;). Many later Kadampas composed various works on the graduated path. These works usually begin with contemplations on the rarity of a human rebirth, impermanence, and karma. 

This genre was extremely influential in Tibet, and all schools of Tibetan Buddhism eventually developed their own &quot;Lamrim&quot; texts based on Atiśa’s &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa,&quot; such as Gampopa&#x27;s &quot;Jewel Ornament of Liberation&quot; and Tsongkhapa&#x27;s three Lamrim works. 

===Lojong lineage===

The Kadampa lineage was also known for an oral tradition called lojong (&quot;mind training&quot;) which focused on developing bodhicitta through various contemplations and mental techniques, such as contemplatively taking all beings&#x27; suffering and giving them all of one&#x27;s happiness (a meditation known as &quot;Tonglen&quot;). One of the earliest examples of a lojong text is Atiśa&#x27;s &quot;Bodhisattva’s Jewel Garland.&quot; 

Lojong teachings are also known as &quot;The Instructions for Training the Mind in the Mahayana Tradition&quot; (). According to Gendun Druppa, Atiśa had received three lines of Lojong transmission, but there are conflicting accounts of from whom. It is agreed that he received teachings in Sumatra from Dharmakīrtiśrī (), and sometimes as Dharmarakṣita. In the former case, Dharmarakṣita is identified as a scholar at the monastic university of Odantapuri. He is also known as the author of the &quot;Wheel of Sharp Weapons&quot; (Tib. &quot;blo-sbyong mtshon-cha &#x27;khor-lo&quot;), another one of the earliest lojong works. The final main Lojong teacher was the Indian master Maitriyogi. Atiśa secretly transmitted them to his main disciple, Dromtön, who passed them on to figures like Potowa, who in turn transmitted the lineage to Sharawa (1070–1141).

During the time of the Three Noble Kadampa Brothers (Dromtön&#x27;s main students), many of these oral teachings were collected together and compiled into the Lamrim. Yet at the time the lineages from Suvarṇadvipi Dharmakīrti were still kept secret. When the time was sufficiently mature, the Lojong Teachings were publicly revealed. Kadam Lojong texts include Kham Lungpa&#x27;s &quot;Eight Sessions for Training the Mind&quot; (), Langri Tangpa&#x27;s (1054–1123) &quot;Eight Verses for Training the Mind&quot; (), Sangye Gompa&#x27;s &quot;A Public Explanation&quot; () and Chekawa Yeshe Dorje&#x27;s (1102–1176) &quot;Seven Points for Training the Mind&quot; ().

From Khamlungpa, Langri Tangpa and Chekawa Yeshe Dorje onwards they became public and later they were integrated into all four Tibetan Buddhist Schools. (These Kadampa-Lojong texts were brought together into the anthology &quot;A Hundred Texts on Training the Mind&quot; ().

=== Tantric practice ===
The Kadam practiced Vajrayana Buddhism and thus included tantric practices in their tradition, which were considered as an advanced practice for those of higher aptitude. The Kadampa&#x27;s higher yoga tantra practice was based on Guhyasamaja and Chakrasamvara. Meanwhile, Tibetan sources mention that Atiśa’s main meditation deities were Śākyamuni, Avalokiteśvara, Acala, and Tārā. The Kadam school also seems to have created their own tantric system called the “sixteen spheres” (thig le bcu drug), based on thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara as the central deity. This system is still practiced at Reting monastery.

=== Popular Buddhism ===

According to Ronald M. Davidson, the Kadampa masters pioneered popular strategies for integrating the Tibetan laity into daily Buddhist activities. These included the promotion of popular teaching methods, the development of the cults featuring loving Buddhist divinities (especially Avalokitesvara and Tara), the spread of artistic representations teaching these ideals at sites available to all, and the generation of easily memorized verses set to song.Davidson further adds that the Kadampas promoted a more egalitarian ideal to counter &quot;the elite bias of most forms of Buddhism spread throughout Tibet at the time&quot;. According to Davidson:In their literature, they retain a teaching attributed to Atisa, that monks &quot;from this day forward, pay no attention to names, pay no attention to clans, but with compassion and loving kindness always meditate on the thought of awakening (bodhicitta)&quot;. This ideal was widespread throughout Indian Buddhism and given lip service in eleventh-century Tibet, but its implementation meant a fundamental change of pedagogical method, for monks would have to deliver Buddhist ideas to the populace. Eventually the change was effected by Chennga and Potoba, who devised a style of teaching that included popular images and anecdotes in their presentations.Potoba (Putowa) in particular was known for being attentive to popular expressions and made use of stories and illustrative examples in his teaching which appealed to a mass audience. Several hundred stories and anecdotes were collected in Potoba&#x27;s &quot;Teaching by Examples. A Profusion of Gems&quot; (&quot;dPe chos rin chen spungs pa&quot;). Many of these examples remain in use today by Tibetan teachers.

Popular fasting programs (&quot;smyung gnas&quot;) based on Avalokitesvara was also introduced by Kadampas.

==The Gelug school, the &quot;New Kadampa&quot;==

Je Tsongkhapa, a Tibetan reformer, collected all the three Kadam lineages and integrated them, along with Sakya, Kagyu and other teachings into a new synthesis. The Kadampas that followed him were known as &quot;New Kadampas&quot; or, more commonly, as Gandenpas or &quot;Gelugpas&quot;.

The three other Tibetan Buddhist schools (Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu) also integrated the Lojong () teachings into their lineages. Gampopa (), who studied for six years within the Kadam Tradition and became later the main disciple of Milarepa (), included the Lojong and Lamrim teachings in his lineage, the Karma Kagyu ().

Nowadays the Gelug tradition keeps and transmits the Kadam lineage of the &quot;Scriptural Traditions of the Six Canonical Texts&quot;. Together with Dagpo Kagyu Tradition they keep and transmit &quot;The Pith Instructions of the Sixteen Essences&quot;, and the Dagpo Kagyu Tradition keeps and transmits the &quot;Key Instructions of the Four Noble Truths&quot;.

One of the most important sayings of the Kadam masters is said to be
==The modern &quot;New Kadampa Tradition&quot; ==
In 1991, Kelsang Gyatso founded the &quot;controversial&quot; new religious movement he named the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT). 

Centuries earlier, Je Tsongkhapa referred to his monastic order as &quot;the New Kadam&quot; before the term Gelug came into use, after his death. 

The modern NKT-IKBU explains that they are independent of other contemporary Tibetan Buddhist centers and Tibetan politics although they claim they are in the &#x27;same tradition&#x27; as the Gelug. According to the NKT&#x27;s own publicist, the purpose of using the term &quot;New Kadampa Buddhism&quot; to refer to their teachings is not to introduce confusion about their origins but to encourage students to emulate the purity and sincerity of the original Kadam school.

<doc id="197864" wikidata="Q22716" url="?curid=197864" title="Imperative mood">
<text>The imperative mood is a grammatical mood that forms a command or request.

The imperative mood is used to demand or require that an action be performed. It is usually found only in the present tense, second person. They are sometimes called &quot;directives&quot;, as they include a feature that encodes directive force, and another feature that encodes modality of unrealized interpretation.

An example of a verb used in the imperative mood is the English phrase &quot;Go.&quot; Such imperatives imply a second-person subject (&quot;you&quot;), but some other languages also have first- and third-person imperatives, with the meaning of &quot;let&#x27;s (do something)&quot; or &quot;let them (do something)&quot; (the forms may alternatively be called cohortative and jussive).

Imperative mood can be denoted by the glossing abbreviation . It is one of the irrealis moods.

== Formation ==
Imperative mood is often expressed using special conjugated verb forms. Like other finite verb forms, imperatives often inflect for person and number. Second-person imperatives (used for ordering or requesting performance directly from the person being addressed) are most common, but some languages also have imperative forms for the first and third persons (alternatively called cohortative and jussive respectively).

In English, the imperative is formed using the bare infinitive form of the verb (see English verbs for more details). This is usually also the same as the second-person present indicative form, except in the case of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, where the imperative is &quot;be&quot; while the indicative is &quot;are&quot;. (The present subjunctive always has the same form as the imperative, although it is negated differently – the imperative is negated using &quot;do not&quot;, as in &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me!&quot;; see &quot;do&quot;-support. Occasionally &quot;do&quot; is not used: &quot;Dare not touch me!&quot;) The imperative form is understood as being in the second person (the subject pronoun &quot;you&quot; is usually omitted, although it can be included for emphasis), with no explicit indication of singular or plural. First and third person imperatives are expressed periphrastically, using a construction with the imperative of the verb &quot;let&quot;:
* Let me (Let&#x27;s) see. (internal monologue equivalent to a first person singular imperative)
* Let us (Let&#x27;s) go. (equivalent to a first person plural imperative)
* Let us be heard. (royal we in an equivalent to a first person passive imperative; also constructions like &quot;We are to be heard&quot;)
* Let him/her/it/them run. (equivalent to a third person imperative; constructions with &quot;may&quot; are also used)
* Let him/her/it/them be counted. (equivalent to a third person passive imperative)

== Other languages==

Other languages such as Latin, French and German have a greater variety of inflected imperative forms, marked for person and number, their formation often depending on a verb&#x27;s conjugation pattern. Examples can be found in the specific language sections below. In languages that make a T–V distinction ( vs. , vs. , vs. , vs. , etc.) the use of particular forms of the second person imperative may also be dependent on the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, as with other verb forms.

The second person singular imperative often consists of just the stem of the verb, without any ending.

For example, Te Reo Māori has the imperative , which in addition to being put in front of sentences to command (e.g. ; &quot;(you must) wash your hands&quot;), is used to assert the imperative mood in sentences that would be translated as &quot;let&#x27;s (let us)&quot; in English. An example of this is , which translates to &quot;let us (you and me) go&quot;, but the &quot;us&quot; component goes last.

== Syntax and negation ==
Imperative sentences sometimes use different syntax than declarative or other types of clauses. There may also be differences of syntax between affirmative and negative imperative sentences. In some cases the imperative form of the verb is itself different when negated. A distinct negative imperative form is sometimes said to be in prohibitive mood (abbreviated ).

Negative imperatives tell the subject to not do something. They usually begin with the verb &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; or the negative form of a verb. e.g., example, &quot;Don&#x27;t be like that.&quot;

Many languages, even not normally null-subject languages, omit the subject pronoun in imperative sentences, as usually occurs in English (see below). Details of the syntax of imperative sentences in certain other languages, and of differences between affirmative and negative imperatives, can be found in some of the other specific language sections below.

In writing, imperative phrases and sentences may terminate in an exclamation mark (!).

== Usage ==
Imperatives are used principally for ordering, requesting or advising the listener to do (or not to do) something: &quot;Put down the gun!&quot;, &quot;Pass me the sauce&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t go too near the tiger.&quot; They are also often used for giving instructions as to how to perform a task: &quot;Install the file, then restart your computer&quot;. They can sometimes be seen on signs giving orders or warnings &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Give way&quot;, &quot;Do not enter&quot;.

The use of the imperative mood may be seen as impolite, inappropriate or even offensive in certain circumstances. In polite speech, orders or requests are often phrased instead as questions or statements, rather than as imperatives:
* Could you come here for a moment? (more polite than &quot;Come here!&quot;)
* It would be great if you made us a drink. (for &quot;Make us a drink!&quot;)
* I have to ask you to stop. (for &quot;Stop!&quot;)

Politeness strategies (for instance, indirect speech acts) can seem more appropriate in order not to threaten a conversational partner in their needs of self-determination and territory: the partner&#x27;s &quot;negative face&quot; should not appear threatened. As well as the replacement of imperatives with other sentence types as discussed above, there also often exist methods of phrasing an imperative in a more polite manner, such as the addition of a word like &quot;please&quot;; or a phrase like &quot;if you could&quot;; or substituting one &quot;directive&quot; for another, as in the change from &quot;will&quot; to &quot;may&quot; e.g, &quot;you will do that&quot; becomes &quot;you may / can do that&quot;.

Imperatives are also used for speech acts whose function is not primarily to make an order or request, but to give an invitation, give permission, express a wish, make an apology, et cetera: 
* Come to the party tomorrow! (invitation)
* Eat the apple if you want. (permission)
* Have a nice trip! (wish)
* Pardon me. (apology)

When written, imperative sentences are often, but not always, terminated with an exclamation mark.

First person plural imperatives (cohortatives) are used mainly for suggesting an action to be performed together by the speaker and the addressee (and possibly other people): &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Barbados this year&quot;, &quot;Let us pray&quot;. Third person imperatives (jussives) are used to suggest or order that a third party or parties be permitted or made to do something: &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;, &quot;Let him be executed&quot;.

There is an additional imperative form that is used for general prohibitions, consisting of the word &quot;no&quot; followed by the gerund form. The best known examples are &quot;No Smoking&quot; and &quot;No Parking&quot;. This form does not have a positive form; that is, &quot;Parking&quot; by itself has no meaning unless used as a noun when it tells that parking is permitted.

The following sentences demonstrate several different forms of the imperative mood.

* In the second person without personal pronouns: &quot;Go to your cubicle!&quot;
* With reflexive pronouns: &quot;Give yourself a break.&quot;
* With a direct object: &quot;Hit the ball.&quot;
* Referring to third-person objects of the main verb: &quot;Okay. The test is over now. They win. Let them go back to the recovery annex. For their cake.&quot;
* As an affirmative imperative (also called positive imperative form): &quot;Go for it!&quot;
* As a negative imperative (also called a negative command): &quot;Don&#x27;t do that!&quot;
* Expressing wishes: &quot;Let&#x27;s go team-name!&quot;
* In future tense: &quot;You will behave yourself.&quot;

==In particular languages==
For more details on imperatives in the languages listed below, and in languages that are not listed, see the articles on the grammar of the specific languages.

===Latin===

Latin regular imperatives include:

The negative imperative is formed with the infinitive of the verb, preceded by the imperative of (to not want):

For third-person imperatives, the subjunctive mood is used instead.

In Latin there is a peculiar tense in the imperative, which is the future tense that is used when you want the mandate to be fulfilled in the future. This tense is used mainly in laws, wills, precepts, etc. However, it is conjugated only with the third and second person singular and plural which carries as a gramme or ending for the second and third person singular, for the second person plural and for the third person plural. On the other hand, in other languages of the world there is a distinctive imperative, which also has a future value, but with a previous meaning and this is the so-called past imperative that appears in the French and Greek languages as a point of reference. See Latin conjugation.

Sentence examples of the future imperative:

* (You will do my father&#x27;s will.)
* (They will not swear falsely.)
* (You will not kill your brother.)
* (You will do what I tell you.)
* (You will listen to what I say.)

===Germanic languages===

==== English ====
English usually omits the subject pronoun in imperative sentences:
*You work hard. (indicative)
*Work hard! (imperative; subject pronoun &quot;you&quot; omitted)
However, it is possible to include the &quot;you&quot; in imperative sentences for emphasis.

English imperatives are negated using &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; (as in &quot;Don&#x27;t work!&quot;) This is a case of &quot;do&quot;-support as found in indicative clauses; however in the imperative it applies even in the case of the verb &quot;be&quot; (which does not use &quot;do&quot;-support in the indicative):
*You are not late. (indicative)
*Don&#x27;t be late! (imperative)
It is also possible to use &quot;do&quot;-support in affirmative imperatives, for emphasis or (sometimes) politeness: &quot;Do be quiet!&quot;, &quot;Do help yourself!&quot;.

The subject &quot;you&quot; may be included for emphasis in negated imperatives as well, following &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t you dare do that again!&quot;

====Dutch====
A peculiar feature of Dutch is that it can form an imperative mood in the pluperfect tense. Its use is fairly common:
* (You should have called!, &quot;If only&quot; you had called)
* (You should have come!, &quot;If only&quot; you had come)

====German====
German verbs have a singular and a plural imperative. The singular imperative is equivalent to the bare stem or the bare stem + . (In most verbs, both ways are correct.) The plural imperative is the same as the second-person plural of the present tense.

* or: – said to one person: &quot;Sing!&quot;
* – said to a group of persons: &quot;Sing!&quot;

In order to emphasize their addressee, German imperatives can be followed by the nominative personal pronouns (&quot;thou; you &quot;) or (&quot;you &quot;), respectively. For example: &quot; – &quot; (&quot;Go away!&quot; – &quot;Why, you go away!&quot;).

German has T/V distinction, which means that the pronouns and are used chiefly towards persons with whom one is privately acquainted, which holds true for the corresponding imperatives. (For details see German grammar.) Otherwise, the social-distance pronoun (you) is used for both singular and plural. Since there exists no actual imperative corresponding to , the form is paraphrased with the third-person plural of the present subjunctive followed by the pronoun:

* – said to one or more persons: &quot;Sing!&quot;
* – said to one or more persons: &quot;Be quiet!&quot;

Occasionally, the infinitive (&quot;Infinitiv&quot; or &quot;Infinitiv als Imperativ&quot;) may be used as a mild or polite imperative, in order to avoid directly addressing the person or to simplify the sentence&#x27;s construction. Although sometimes used in spoken language, this form is most commonly used in general instructions and recipes. Examples include:

* – &quot;No smoking!&quot;
* - &quot;Cook the pasta &quot;al dente&quot; and drain.&quot;
* - &quot;Please do not touch!&quot;

Like English, German features many constructions that express commands, wishes, etc. They are thus semantically related to imperatives without being imperatives grammatically:
* (Let&#x27;s sing!)
* (You may sing!)
* (You should sing!)

Examples of regular imperatives in French are (), () and (, &quot;let&#x27;s eat&quot;), from (to eat) – these are similar or identical to the corresponding present indicative forms, although there are some irregular imperatives that resemble the present subjunctives, such as , and , from (to be). A third person imperative can be formed using a subjunctive clause with the conjunction , as in (let them eat cake).

French uses different word order for affirmative and negative imperative sentences:
* (Give it to them.)
* (Don&#x27;t give it to them.)

The negative imperative (prohibitive) has the same word order as the indicative. See for detail.
Like in English, imperative sentences often end with an exclamation mark, e.g. to emphasize an order.

In French there is a very distinctive imperative which is the imperative mood of preterite tense also called (past imperative or imperative of future perfect), expresses a given order with previous future value which must be executed or fulfilled in a future not immediate, as if it were an action to come, but earlier in relation to another that will also happen in the future. However, this type of imperative is peculiar to French which has only one purpose: to order that something be done before the date or time, therefore, this will always be accompanied by a circumstantial complement of time. However, this imperative is formed with the auxiliary verb of the compound tenses and with the auxiliary verb that is also used to form the tenses composed of the pronominal verbs and some of the intransitive verbs, this means that the structure of the verb imperative in its entirety is composed.

* (Get up tomorrow before eight o&#x27;clock.) [With the auxiliary ]
* (Finish the work before it gets dark.) [With the auxiliary and optional expletive ]
* (Write the book tomorrow.) [With the auxiliary ]
* (Leave at noon.) [With the auxiliary ]
* (Let us complete homework at 6 o&#x27;clock.) [With the auxiliary ]

In English there is no equivalent grammatical structure to form this tense of the imperative mood; it is translated in imperative mood of present with previous value.

====Spanish====
In Spanish, imperatives for the familiar singular second person (&quot;tú&quot;) are usually identical to indicative forms for the singular third person. However, there are irregular verbs for which unique imperative forms for &quot;tú&quot; exist. &quot;vos&quot; (alternative to &quot;tú&quot;) usually takes the same forms as &quot;tú&quot; (usually with slightly different emphasis) but unique forms exist for it as well. &quot;vosotros&quot; (plural familiar second person) also takes unique forms for the imperative.
If an imperative takes a pronoun as an object, it is appended to the verb; for example, (Tell me). Pronouns can be stacked like they can in indicative clauses:

* (You tell me it or You tell it to me, can also mean You tell me as usually is not translated)
* (Tell me it, Tell it to me, Tell me)

Imperatives can be formed for (singular formal second person), (plural second person), and (plural first person) from the respective present subjunctive form. Negative imperatives for these pronouns (as well as , , and ) are also formed this way, but are negated by (e.g. , &quot;Don&#x27;t sing&quot;).

====Portuguese====
In Portuguese, affirmative imperatives for singular and plural second person () derive from their respective present indicative conjugations, after having their final dropped. On the other hand, their negative imperatives are formed by their respective subjunctive forms, as well as both affirmative and negative imperatives for treatment pronouns () and plural first person ().


If a verb takes a pronoun, it should be appended to the verb:
* (Tell me) Portugal/Brazil
* (Tell me) Brazil (spoken)
* (Tell me it, Tell it to me)

===Celtic languages===
====Welsh====

In spoken Welsh most verbs can form two imperatives, both in the second person: one for singular and one for plural/polite singular. The singular imperative is formed by adding &quot;–a&quot; to the verbal-stem ( → &#x27;see!&#x27;) while the plural/polite form takes &quot;–wch&quot;: &#x27;see!&#x27;. In informal writing, the plural/polite form is often used to translate &#x27;please&#x27; as in &#x27;(please) pay here&#x27; ( is the plural/polite imperative form of &#x27;to pay&#x27;).

In literary Welsh there are imperatives for all persons and numbers, except for the first-person singular. These must often be translated using phrases in English: &#x27;let us see&#x27;; &#x27;let them see&#x27;; &#x27;let him/her/it see&#x27;; &#x27;let it be seen, it is to be seen&#x27;. In the literary language the second person singular suffix &quot;–a&quot; is often not used: (spoken), but (literary); (spoken), but (literary).

The five irregular Welsh verbs ( and ) also have irregular imperative forms which also differ between the spoken and literary languages.


====Irish====
Irish has imperative forms in all three persons and both numbers, although the first person singular is most commonly found in the negative (e.g. &quot;let me not hear that again&quot;).

===Indic Languages===

====Hindi-Urdu====
In Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) the imperatives are conjugated by adding suffixes to the root verb. The negative and positive imperatives are not constructed differently in Hindustani. There are three negations that be used to form negative imperatives. They are:

* Imperative negation - mat (used with verbs in imperative mood)
* Indicative negation - nahī̃ (used with verbs in indicative and presumptive mood)
* Subjunctive negation - nā (used with verbs in subjunctive and contrafactual mood)

Often to soften down the tone of the imperatives, the subjunctive and indicative negation are used to form negative imperatives. Imperatives can also be formed using subjunctives to give indirect commands to the third person and to formal second person. A peculiar feature of Hindi-Urdu is that it has imperatives in two tenses; present and the future tense. The present tense imperative gives command in the present and future imperative gives command for the future. Hindi-Urdu explicitly marks grammatical aspects and any verb can be put into the simple, habitual, perfective, and progressive aspects. Each aspect in turn can be conjugated into five different grammatical moods, imperative mood being one of them.

====Sanskrit====
In Sanskrit, is used with the verb to form the imperative mood. To form the negative, or (when the verb is in passive or active voice respectively) is placed before the verb in the imperative mood.

====Bengali====
Standard modern Bengali uses the negative postposition /nā/ after a future imperative formed using the fusional suffix (in addition, umlaut vowel changes in the verb root might take place).

===Other Indo-European languages===

====Greek====
Ancient Greek has imperative forms for present, aorist, and perfect tenses for the active, middle, and passive voices. Within these tenses, forms exist for second and third persons, for singular, dual, and plural subjects. Subjunctive forms with μή are used for negative imperatives in the aorist.

In ancient Greek, the general order (with the idea of duration or repetition) is expressed using the present imperative and the punctual order (without the idea of duration or repetition) using the aorist imperative.

====Russian====
The commanding form in Russian language is formed from the base of the present tense. The most common form of the second person singular or plural. The form of the second person singular in the imperative mood is formed as follows:
* A verb with a present stem ending in the form of the second person singular of the imperative mood is equal to the base: .

===Non-Indo-European languages===

====Finnish====
In Finnish, there are two ways of forming a first-person plural imperative. A standard version exists, but it is typically replaced colloquially by the impersonal tense.

Forms also exist for second and third person. Only first person singular does not have an imperative.

====Hebrew====
In classical Hebrew, there is a form for positive imperative. It exists for singular and plural, masculine and feminine second-person. The imperative conjugations look like shortages of the future ones. However, in modern Hebrew, the future tense is often used in its place in colloquial speech, and the proper imperative form is considered formal or of higher register.

The negative imperative in those languages is more complicated. In modern Hebrew, for instance, it contains a synonym of the word &quot;no&quot;, that is used only in negative imperative (), and is followed by the future tense.



==== Japanese ====
Japanese uses separate verb forms as shown below.

See also the suffixes (&quot;–nasai&quot;) and (&quot;–kudasai&quot;).

==== Korean ====
Korean has six levels of honorific, all of which have their own imperative endings. Auxiliary verbs and are used for negative indicative and prohibitive, respectively.

==== Mandarin ====
Standard Chinese uses different words of negation for the indicative and the prohibitive moods.

==== Turkish ====
For the imperative form, the second-person singular, Turkish uses the bare verb stem without the infinitive ending . Other imperative forms use various suffixes. The second-person plural, which can also be used to express formality (See T–V distinction), uses the suffixes . The second person double-plural, reserved for super formal contexts (usually public notifications), uses the suffixes . Third-person singular uses . Third-person plural uses (There is no third person double-plural in Turkish). First-person pronouns do not have imperative forms. All Turkish imperative suffixes change depending on the verb stem according to the rules of vowel harmony.

Turkish also has a separate optative mood. Conjugations of the optative mood for the first-person pronouns are sometimes incorrectly said to be first-person imperatives. Conjugations of the optative mood for second and third-person pronouns exist, but are rarely used in practice.

Negative imperative forms are made in the same way, but using a negated verb as the base. For example, the second person singular imperative of (not to drink) is (don&#x27;t drink). Other Turkic languages construct imperative forms similarly to Turkish.

<text>(NTT) (Corporate Number: 7010001065142) is a Japanese telecommunications holding company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Ranked 55th in &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500, NTT is the fourth largest telecommunications company in the world in terms of revenue, although it was the world&#x27;s largest telecommunications company from 1996 to 2006, then it returned to being one of the world&#x27;s largest telecommunications companies in 2012 and 2013, as well as the third largest publicly traded company in Japan after Toyota and Sony, as of June 2022. In 2023, the company was ranked 56th in the Forbes Global 2000. NTT was also one of the world&#x27;s largest companies by market capitalization from its initial public offering in 1987 until the Japanese economic bubble burst in 1991.

The company is incorporated pursuant to the NTT Law (). The purpose of the company defined by the law is to own all the shares issued by (NTT East) and (NTT West) and to ensure proper and stable provision of telecommunications services all over Japan including remote rural areas by these companies as well as to conduct research relating to the telecommunications technologies that will form the foundation for telecommunications.

On 1 July 2019, NTT Corporation launched NTT Ltd., an $11 billion de facto holding company business consisting of 28 brands from across NTT Security, NTT Communications and Dimension Data.

While NTT is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the OTC Markets Group&#x27;s Pink (and formerly in the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker code &quot;NTT&quot; and in the London Stock Exchange under the ticker code &quot;NPN&quot;), the Japanese government still owns roughly one-third of NTT&#x27;s shares, regulated by the NTT Law.

== History ==


Established as a state monopoly in August 1952 to take over the Japanese telecommunications system operated by AT&amp;T during the Occupation of Japan, was privatized in 1985 to encourage competition in the country&#x27;s telecom market, making Japan the first Asian country and only the second in the world (after the United States) to deregulate its telecom market. In 1987, NTT made the largest stock offering to date, at US$36.8 billion.

Because NTT owns most of Japan&#x27;s last mile infrastructure (incl. broadband fibre connections), it enjoys oligopolistic control over landlines in Japan. In order to weaken NTT, the company was divided into a holding company (NTT) and three telecom companies (, , and NTT Communications) in 1999. The NTT Law regulating NTT East and West requires them to serve only short-distance communications and obligates them to maintain fixed-line telephone service all over the country. They are also obligated to lease their unused optical fiber (dark fiber) to other carriers at regulated rates. NTT Communications is not regulated by the NTT Law.

In July 2010, NTT and South African IT company Dimension Data Holdings announced an agreement of a cash offer from NTT for Dimension Data&#x27;s entire issued share capital, in £2.12bn ($3.24bn) deal.

In late 2010, NTT&#x27;s Japan-to-US transpacific network reached 400 Gbit/s. In August 2011, its network capacity was expanded to 500 Gbit/s.

In 2021, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Tel issued green bonds worth about 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion). The bonds include three tranches with maturities of 3, 5 and 10 years. The proceeds will be used for environmentally friendly projects (renewable energy, energy-efficient broadband infrastructure, etc.).

<text>Atiśa (c. 982–1054) was a Buddhist religious teacher and leader. He is generally associated with his body of work authored at Vikramaśīla Monastery in Bihar, India. He was a major figures in the spread of 11th-century Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism in Asia and traveled to Sumatra and Tibet. Atiśa, along with this chief disciple Dromtön, is regarded as the founder of the Kadam school, one of the New Translation schools of Tibetan Buddhism. In the 14th century, the Kadam school was supplanted by the Gelug tradition, which adopted its teachings and absorbed its monasteries. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Atiśa was born as Candragarbha in c. 982 CE as the second of three sons to a ruling family in Bengal in the city of Vikrampura. His father was a king known as Kalyānaśrī and his mother was Prabhavati Sri. The early part of his life was typical of Indian noblemen of the period and he was trained in various fields including art. 

===Studies===
As a young man, he began to study tantra in what is now Rajgir where he was tutored by a monk named Rāhulaguhyavajra. Under Rāhulaguhyavajra, Atiśa was initiated into Hevajra and taught specific meditations. He then studied for seven years under a master named Avadhūtipā where he focused on yoga and engaged in tantric feasts known as Ganachakra.

According to Tibetan sources, Atiśa was ordained into the Mahāsāṃghika lineage at the age of twenty-eight by the Abbot Śīlarakṣita in Bodh Gaya and studied almost all Buddhist and non-Buddhist schools of his time, including teachings from Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Tantric Hinduism and other practices. He also studied the sixty-four kinds of art, the art of music and the art of logic and accomplished these studies until the age of twenty-two. Among the many Buddhist lineages he studied, practised and transmitted the three main lineages were the &quot;Lineage of the Profound Action&quot; transmitted by Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, the &quot;Lineage of Profound View&quot; transmitted by Nagarjuna and Candrakīrti, and the &quot;Lineage of Profound Experience&quot; transmitted by Tilopa and Naropa. Atiśa engaged with many notable teachers during this period including Ratnākaraśānti, Naropa and Jitari. He also studied Dharmarakṣita at the monastery of Odantapuri.
===Vikramaśīla===
Atisa rose to become a senior scholar at the monastery of Vikramaśīla at a time when it had no more than one hundred ordained monks present. Tibetan hagiographies on his life have a tendency to portray him as one of the greatest scholars to stay at Vikramaśīla who would be noted for his strict adherence to the ethics of Mahayana Buddhism. It was during this period that the King of the Tibetan polity of Guge, Lha bla ma Ye shes ’od began to send missions to Vikramaśīla to invite scholars to visit Guge so that they could teach the &quot;pure form of Buddhism&quot;.

Atiśa finally departed Vikramaśīla in 1040 CE. The then abbot of Vikramaśīla, Ratnakara, gave his permission for Atiśa to leave but on the condition that he return in three years.
===Teachings in Sumatra and Tibet===

Tibetan sources record that Atiśa spent 12 years in Sumatra of the Srivijaya empire and he returned to India in 1025 CE which was also the same year when Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty invaded Sumatra.

Upon his return, he received much attention for his teachings and skills in debate and philosophy. On three separate occasions, Atiśa was acclaimed for defeating non-Buddhist extremists in debate. When he came into contact with what he perceived to be a misled or deteriorating form of Buddhism he would quickly and effectively implement reforms. Soon enough he was appointed to the position of steward, or abbot, at Vikramaśīla which was established by Emperor Dharmapala. He is also said to have &quot;nourished&quot; Odantapuri.

Atiśa&#x27;s return from Suvarnabhumi, where he had been studying with Dharmakīrtiśrī, and his rise to prominence in India coincided with a flourishing of Buddhist culture and the practice of Buddhism in the region, and in many ways Atiśa&#x27;s influence contributed to these developments. According to the &quot;Blue Annals&quot;, a new king of Guge by the name of Yeshe-Ö sent his academic followers to learn and translate some of the Sanskrit Buddhist texts. Among these academics was Naktso, who was eventually sent to Vikramaśīla to study Sanskrit and plead with Atiśa to come teach the Dharma in his homeland.

Travelling with Naktso and Gya Lōtsawa, Atiśa journeyed through Nepal on his way to Tolung, the capital of the Purang Kingdom. (Gya Lōtsawa died before reaching Tolung.) On his way, he is said to have met Marpa Lōtsawa. He spent three years in Tolung and compiled his teachings into his most influential scholarly work, &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot;, or &quot;Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment&quot;. This short text in sixty-seven verses lays out the entire Buddhist path in terms of the three vehicles: Hīnayāna, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna, and became the model for subsequent texts in the genre of Lamrim, or the &quot;Stages of the Path,&quot; and was specifically the basis for Tsongkhapa&#x27;s Lamrim writings. Here Atiśa met Dromtön, or Dromtonpa, who would become his primary disciple, regarded as both an enforcer of later propagation ethical standards and a holder of Atiśa&#x27;s tantric lineage.

According to Jamgon Kongtrul, when Atiśa discovered the store of Sanskrit texts at Pekar Kordzoling, the library of Samye, &quot;he said that the degree to which the Vajrayana had spread in Tibet was unparalleled, even in India. After saying this, he reverently folded his hands and praised the great dharma kings, translators, and panditas of the previous centuries.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2004, Atiśa was ranked 18th in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the greatest Bengalis of all time.

<text>The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is a stock exchange based in London, England. the total market value of all companies trading on the LSE stood at $3.42 trillion. Its current premises are situated in Paternoster Square close to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Since 2007, it has been part of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG, which the exchange also lists (ticker symbol LSEG)). Despite a post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London Stock Exchange, the LSE was the most valued stock exchange in Europe as of 2023. According to the 2020 Office for National Statistics report, approximately 12% of UK-resident individuals reported having investments in stocks and shares. According to a 2020 Financial Conduct Authority report, approximately 15% of British adults reported having investments in stocks and shares.

==History==

===Coffee House===

The Royal Exchange had been founded by English financier Thomas Gresham and Sir Richard Clough on the model of the Antwerp Bourse. It was opened by Elizabeth I of England in 1571.

During the 17th century, stockbrokers were not allowed in the Royal Exchange due to their perceived rude manners. They had to operate from other establishments in the vicinity, notably Jonathan&#x27;s Coffee-House. At that coffee house, a broker named John Castaing started listing the prices of a few commodities including salt, coal, paper, and exchange rates in 1698. Originally, this was not a daily list and was only published a few days of the week.

This list and activity was later moved to Garraway&#x27;s coffee house. Public auctions during this period were conducted for the duration that a length of tallow candle could burn; these were known as &quot;by inch of candle&quot; auctions. As stocks grew, with new companies joining to raise capital, the royal court also raised some monies. These are the earliest evidence of organised trading in marketable securities in London.

===Royal Exchange===
After Gresham&#x27;s Royal Exchange building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, it was rebuilt and re-established in 1669. This was a move away from coffee houses and a step towards the modern model of stock exchange.

The Royal Exchange housed not only brokers but also merchants and merchandise. This was the birth of a regulated stock market, which had teething problems in the shape of unlicensed brokers. In order to regulate these, Parliament passed an Act in 1697 that levied heavy penalties, both financial and physical, on those brokering without a licence. It also set a fixed number of brokers (at 100), but this was later increased as the size of the trade grew. This limit led to several problems, one of which was that traders began leaving the Royal Exchange, either by their own decision or through expulsion, and started dealing in the streets of London. The street in which they were now dealing was known as &#x27;Exchange Alley&#x27;, or &#x27;Change Alley&#x27;; it was suitably placed close to the Bank of England. Parliament tried to regulate this and ban the unofficial traders from the Change streets.

Traders became weary of &quot;bubbles&quot; when companies rose quickly and fell, so they persuaded Parliament to pass a clause preventing &quot;unchartered&quot; companies from forming.

After the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), trade at Jonathan&#x27;s Coffee House boomed again. In 1773, Jonathan, together with 150 other brokers, formed a club and opened a new and more formal &quot;Stock Exchange&quot; in Sweeting&#x27;s Alley. This now had a set entrance fee, by which traders could enter the stock room and trade securities. It was, however, not an exclusive location for trading, as trading also occurred in the Rotunda of the Bank of England. Fraud was also rife during these times and in order to deter such dealings, it was suggested that users of the stock room pay an increased fee. This was not met well and ultimately, the solution came in the form of annual fees and turning the Exchange into a Subscription room.

The Subscription room created in 1801 was the first regulated exchange in London, but the transformation was not welcomed by all parties. On the first day of trading, non-members had to be expelled by a constable. In spite of the disorder, a new and bigger building was planned, at Capel Court.

William Hammond laid the first foundation stone for the new building on 18 May. It was finished on 30 December when &quot;The Stock Exchange&quot; was incised on the entrance.

===First Rule Book===

In the Exchange&#x27;s first operating years, on several occasions there was no clear set of regulations or fundamental laws for the Capel Court trading. In February 1812, the General Purpose Committee confirmed a set of recommendations, which later became the foundation of the first codified rule book of the Exchange. Even though the document was not a complex one, topics such as settlement and default were, in fact, quite comprehensive.

With its new governmental commandments and increasing trading volume, the Exchange was progressively becoming an accepted part of the financial life in the city. In spite of continuous criticism from newspapers and the public, the government used the Exchange&#x27;s organised market (and would most likely not have managed without it) to raise the enormous amount of money required for the wars against Napoleon.

===Foreign and regional exchanges===
After the war and facing a booming world economy, foreign lending to countries such as Brazil, Peru and Chile was a growing market. Notably, the Foreign Market at the Exchange allowed for merchants and traders to participate, and the Royal Exchange hosted all transactions where foreign parties were involved. The constant increase in overseas business eventually meant that dealing in foreign securities had to be allowed within all of the Exchange&#x27;s premises.

Just as London enjoyed growth through international trade, the rest of Great Britain also benefited from the economic boom. Two other cities in particular showed great business development: Liverpool and Manchester. Consequently, in 1836 both the Manchester and Liverpool stock exchanges were opened. Some stock prices sometimes rose by 10%, 20% or even 30% in a week. These were times when stockbroking was considered a real business profession, and such attracted many entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, with booms came busts, and in 1835 the &quot;Spanish panic&quot; hit the markets, followed by a second one two years later.

===The Exchange before the World Wars===

By June 1853, both participating members and brokers were taking up so much space that the Exchange was now uncomfortably crowded, and continual expansion plans were taking place. Having already been extended west, east, and northwards, it was then decided the Exchange needed an entire new establishment. Thomas Allason was appointed as the main architect, and in March 1854, the new brick building inspired from the Great Exhibition stood ready. This was a huge improvement in both surroundings and space, with twice the floor space available.

By the late 1800s, the telephone, ticker tape, and the telegraph had been invented. Those new technologies led to a revolution in the work of the Exchange.

===First World War===

As the financial centre of the world, both the City and the Stock Exchange were hit hard by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Due to fears that borrowed money was to be called in and that foreign banks would demand their loans or raise interest, prices surged at first. The decision to close the Exchange for improved breathing space and to extend the August Bank Holiday to prohibit a run on banks, was hurried through by the committee and Parliament, respectively. The Stock Exchange ended up being closed from the end of July until the New Year, causing street business to be introduced again, as well as the &quot;challenge system&quot;.

The Exchange was set to open again on 4 January 1915 under tedious restrictions: transactions were to be in cash only. Due to the limitations and challenges on trading brought by the war, almost a thousand members quit the Exchange between 1914 and 1918. When peace returned in November 1918, the mood on the trading floor was generally cowed. In 1923, the Exchange received its own coat of arms, with the motto &quot;Dictum Meum Pactum&quot;, My Word is My Bond.

===Second World War===
In 1937, officials at the Exchange used their experiences from World War I to draw up plans for how to handle a new war. The main concerns included air raids and the subsequent bombing of the Exchange&#x27;s perimeters, and one suggestion was a move to Denham, Buckinghamshire. This however never took place. On the first day of September 1939, the Exchange closed its doors &quot;until further notice&quot; and two days later World War II was declared. Unlike in the prior war, the Exchange opened its doors again six days later, on 7 September.

As the war escalated into its second year, the concerns for air raids were greater than ever. Eventually, on the night of 29 December 1940, one of the greatest fires in London&#x27;s history took place. The Exchange&#x27;s floor was hit by a clutch of incendiary bombs, which were extinguished quickly. Trading on the floor was now drastically low and most was done over the phone to reduce the possibility of injuries.

The Exchange was only closed for one more day during wartime, in 1945 due to damage from a V-2 rocket. Nonetheless, trading continued in the house&#x27;s basement.

===Post-war===
After decades of uncertain if not turbulent times, stock market business boomed in the late 1950s. This spurred multiple officials to find new, more suitable accommodation. The work on the new Stock Exchange Tower began in 1967. The Exchange&#x27;s new high building had 26 storeys with council and administration at the top, and middle floors let out to affiliate companies. Queen Elizabeth II opened the building on 8 November 1972; it was a new City landmark, with its trading floor.
1973 marked a year of changes for the Stock Exchange. First, two trading prohibitions were abolished. A report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended the admittance of both women and foreign-born members on the floor. Second, in March the London Stock Exchange formally merged with the eleven British and Irish regional exchanges, including the Scottish Stock Exchange. This expansion led to the creation of a new position of chief executive officer; after an extensive search this post was given to Robert Fell. There were more governance changes in 1991, when the governing Council of the Exchange was replaced by a board of directors drawn from the Exchange&#x27;s executive, customer, and user base; and the trading name became &quot;The London Stock Exchange&quot;.

The FTSE 100 Index (pronounced &quot;Footsie 100&quot;) was launched by a partnership of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and the Stock Exchange on 3 January 1984. This turned out to be one of the most useful indices of all, and tracked the movements of the 100 leading companies listed on the Exchange.

===IRA bombing===

On 20 July 1990, a bomb planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) exploded in the men&#x27;s toilets behind the visitors&#x27; gallery. The area had already been evacuated and nobody was injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49 a.m., a man who said he was a member of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange and was about to explode. Police officials said that if there had been no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-storey building in Threadneedle Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long-term trend towards electronic trading platforms reduced the Exchange&#x27;s attraction to visitors, and although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.

===&quot;Big Bang&quot;===
The biggest event of the 1980s was the sudden de-regulation of the financial markets in the UK in 1986. The phrase &quot;Big Bang&quot; was coined to describe measures, including abolition of fixed commission charges and of the distinction between stockjobbers and stockbrokers on the London Stock Exchange, as well as the change from an open outcry to electronic, screen-based trading.

In 1995, the Exchange launched the Alternative Investment Market, the AIM, to allow growing companies to expand into international markets. Two years later, the Electronic Trading Service (SETS) was launched, bringing greater speed and efficiency to the market. Next, the CREST settlement service was launched.

===21st century===
In 2000, the LSE&#x27;s shareholders voted to become a public limited company, London Stock Exchange plc. The LSE also transferred its role as the United Kingdom&#x27;s listing authority to the Financial Services Authority.

EDX London, an international equity derivatives business, was created in 2003 in partnership with OM Group. The Exchange also acquired Proquote Limited, a new generation supplier of real-time market data and trading systems.


The old Stock Exchange Tower became largely redundant with Big Bang, which deregulated many of the LSE&#x27;s activities: computerised systems and dealing rooms replaced face-to-face trading. In 2004, the LSE moved to a brand-new headquarters in Paternoster Square, close to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In 2007, the LSE merged with Borsa Italiana, creating London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The Group&#x27;s headquarters are in Paternoster Square.

Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters of Occupy London on 15 October 2011. Attempts to occupy the square were thwarted by police. Police sealed off the entrance to the square as it is private property, a High Court injunction having previously been granted against public access to the square. The protesters moved nearby to occupy the space in front of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The protests were part of the global Occupy movement.

On 25 April 2019, the final day of the Extinction Rebellion disruption in London, 13 activists glued themselves together in a chain, blocking the entrances of the LSE. The protesters were all later arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. Extinction Rebellion had said its protesters would target the financial industry &quot;and the corrosive impacts of the ... sector on the world we live in&quot; and activists also blocked entrances to HM Treasury and the Goldman Sachs office on Fleet Street.

On 3 March 2022 the LSE declared it would suspend trading in GDR securities for Russian firms, subsequent to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Activities==
===Primary markets===
There are two main markets on which companies trade on the LSE: the main market and the alternative investment market.

====Main Market====
The main market is home to over 1,300 large companies from 60 countries. The FTSE 100 Index (&quot;footsie&quot;) is the main share index of the 100 most highly capitalised British companies listed on the Main Market.

====Alternative Investment Market====
The Alternative Investment Market is LSE&#x27;s international market for smaller companies. A wide range of businesses including early-stage, venture capital-backed, as well as more-established companies join AIM seeking access to growth capital. The AIM is classified as a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) under the 2004 MiFID directive, and as such it is a flexible market with a simpler admission process for companies wanting to be publicly listed.

===Secondary markets===
The securities available for trading on LSE:

* Common stock
* Bonds, including retail bonds§
* Derivatives
* Exchange-traded funds
* Debt securities
* Exchange-traded commodities
* Structured products
* Covered warrants
* Global depositary receipts (GDRs)
* Gilt-edged securities

==Post trade==
Through the Exchange&#x27;s Italian arm, Borsa Italiana, the London Stock Exchange Group as a whole offers clearing and settlement services for trades through Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (CC&amp;G) and Monte Titoli. is the Groups Central Counterparty and covers multiple asset classes throughout the Italian equity, derivatives and bond markets. CC&amp;G also clears Turquoise derivatives. &quot;Monte Titoli&quot; is the pre-settlement, settlement, custody and asset services provider of the Group. Monte Titoli operates both on-exchange and OTC trades with over 400 banks and brokers.

==Technology==
The LSE&#x27;s trading platform is its own Linux-based edition named Millennium Exchange.

Their previous trading platform TradElect was based on Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework, and was developed by Microsoft and Accenture.

Despite TradElect only being in use for about two years, after suffering multiple periods of extended downtime and unreliability the LSE announced in 2009 that it was planning to switch to Linux in 2010. The main market migration to MillenniumIT technology was successfully completed in February 2011.

The previous system, SETS, was introduced in October 1997 and used until 2007.

The London Market Information Link, a COBOL application running on a HP Tandem server was used to disseminate market data to terminals before being replaced by Infolect.

The LSE facilitates stock listings in a currency other than its &quot;home currency&quot;. Most stocks are quoted in GBP but some are quoted in EUR while others are quoted in USD..

The LSE hosts numerous Israeli tech companies, which, according to the UK-Israel Tech Hub, have been instrumental in boosting its growth and fostering bilateral economic ties. LSE CEO Julia Hoggett has commended the Israeli tech sector, highlighting the importance of high tech companies trading on the LSE.

==Mergers and acquisitions==
On 3 May 2000, it was announced that the LSE would merge with the Deutsche Börse; however this fell through.

On 23 June 2007, the LSE announced that it had agreed on the terms of a recommended offer to the shareholders of the Borsa Italiana S.p.A. The merger of the two companies created a leading diversified exchange group in Europe. The combined group was named the London Stock Exchange Group, but still remained two separate legal and regulatory entities. One of the long-term strategies of the joint company is to expand Borsa Italiana&#x27;s efficient clearing services to other European markets.

In 2007, after Borsa Italiana announced that it was exercising its call option to acquire full control of MBE Holdings; thus the combined Group would now control Mercato dei Titoli di Stato, or MTS. This merger of Borsa Italiana and MTS with LSE&#x27;s existing bond-listing business enhanced the range of covered European fixed income markets.

London Stock Exchange Group acquired Turquoise, a Pan-European MTF, in 2009.

On 9 October 2020, the LSE agreed to sell the Borsa Italiana (including Borsa&#x27;s bond trading platform MTS) to Euronext for €4.3 billion (£3.9 billion) in cash. Euronext completed the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on 29 April 2021 for a final price of €4,444 million.

On 12 December 2022, Microsoft bought a nearly 4% stake in London Stock Exchange Group as part of a ten-year cloud deal.

===NASDAQ bids===
In December 2005, the LSE rejected a £1.6 billion takeover offer from Macquarie Bank. It described the offer as &quot;derisory&quot;, a sentiment echoed by shareholders in the Exchange. Shortly after Macquarie withdrew its offer, the LSE received an unsolicited approach from NASDAQ valuing the company at £2.4 billion. This too it rejected. NASDAQ later pulled its bid, and less than two weeks later on 11 April 2006, struck a deal with LSE&#x27;s largest shareholder, Ameriprise Financial&#x27;s Threadneedle Asset Management unit, to acquire all of that firm&#x27;s stake, consisting of 35.4 million shares, at £11.75 per share. NASDAQ also purchased 2.69 million additional shares, resulting in a total stake of 15%. While the seller of those shares was undisclosed, it occurred simultaneously with a sale by Scottish Widows of 2.69 million shares. The move was seen as an effort to force LSE to the negotiating table, as well as to limit the Exchange&#x27;s strategic flexibility.

Subsequent purchases increased NASDAQ&#x27;s stake to 25.1%, holding off competing bids for several months. United Kingdom financial rules required that NASDAQ wait for a period of time before renewing its effort. On 20 November 2006, within a month or two of the expiration of this period, NASDAQ increased its stake to 28.75% and launched a hostile offer at the minimum permitted bid of £12.43 per share, which was the highest NASDAQ had paid on the open market for its existing shares. The LSE immediately rejected this bid, stating that it &quot;substantially undervalues&quot; the company.

NASDAQ revised its offer (characterized as an &quot;unsolicited&quot; bid, rather than a &quot;hostile takeover attempt&quot;) on 12 December 2006, indicating that it would be able to complete the deal with 50% (plus one share) of LSE&#x27;s stock, rather than the 90% it had been seeking. The U.S. exchange did not, however, raise its bid. Many hedge funds had accumulated large positions within the LSE, and many managers of those funds, as well as Furse, indicated that the bid was still not satisfactory. NASDAQ&#x27;s bid was made more difficult because it had described its offer as &quot;final&quot;, which, under British bidding rules, restricted their ability to raise its offer except under certain circumstances.

In the end, NASDAQ&#x27;s offer was roundly rejected by LSE shareholders. Having received acceptances of only 0.41% of rest of the register by the deadline on 10 February 2007, Nasdaq&#x27;s offer duly lapsed.

On 20 August 2007, NASDAQ announced that it was abandoning its plan to take over the LSE and subsequently look for options to divest its 31% (61.3 million shares) shareholding in the company in light of its failed takeover attempt. In September 2007, NASDAQ agreed to sell the majority of its shares to Borse Dubai, leaving the United Arab Emirates-based exchange with 28% of the LSE.

===Proposed merger with TMX Group===
On 9 February 2011, London Stock Exchange Group announced it had agreed to merge with the Toronto-based TMX Group, the owners of the Toronto Stock Exchange, creating a combined entity with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to £3.7 trillion. Xavier Rolet, CEO of the LSE Group at the time, would have headed the new enlarged company, while TMX Chief Executive Thomas Kloet would have become the new firm president. The LSE Group however announced it was terminating the merger with TMX on 29 June 2011 citing that &quot;LSEG and TMX Group believe that the merger is highly unlikely to achieve the required two-thirds majority approval at the TMX Group shareholder meeting&quot;. Even though LSEG obtained the necessary support from its shareholders, it failed to obtain the required support from TMX&#x27;s shareholders.

==Opening times==
Normal trading sessions on the main orderbook (SETS) are from 08:00 to 16:30 local time every day of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the exchange in advance. The detailed schedule is as follows:

<text>The World Book Encyclopedia is an American encyclopedia. &quot;World Book&quot; was first published in 1917. Since 1925, a new edition of the encyclopedia has been published annually. Although published online in digital form for a number of years, &quot;World Book&quot; is currently the only American encyclopedia which also still provides a print edition. The encyclopedia is designed to cover major areas of knowledge uniformly, but it shows particular strength in scientific, technical, historical and medical subjects. 

World Book, Inc. is based in Chicago, Illinois. According to the company, the latest edition, &quot;World Book Encyclopedia 2024&quot;, contains more than 14,000 pages distributed along 22 volumes and also contains over 25,000 photographs.

World Book also publishes children&#x27;s non-fiction and picture books under the Bright Connections Media imprint, and educational development and supplemental instructional resources through Incentive Publications by &quot;World Book&quot;.

== History ==
World Book was founded in Chicago by publishers J. H. Hansen and John Bellow, who realized that existing encyclopedias were off-putting to readers. In 1915, they enlisted the help of Michael Vincent O&#x27;Shea, a professor of education at the University of Wisconsin.

The first edition of &quot;The World Book Encyclopedia&quot; was published (as simply &quot;The World Book&quot;) in 1917, by the Hanson-Roach-Fowler Company. &quot;As a rule,&quot; wrote O&#x27;Shea, the founding editor, in the preface of that 1st edition, &quot;encyclopedias are apt to be quite formal and technical. A faithful effort has been made in the World Book to avoid this common defect.&quot; The encyclopedia&#x27;s name would later be shortened to its current name &quot;World Book&quot;.

In 1919, &quot;World Book&quot; became the property of W.F. Quarrie &amp; Company. The new owners created an editorial board to help make sure the entries were aligned with what students studied, from kindergarten to high school.

In 1933, World Book exhibited at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago.

In 1945, &quot;World Book&quot; became the property of Field Enterprises.

In 1952, World Book moved its office into the Merchandise Mart in Chicago.

In 1962, World Book published its first hardcover edition of &quot;Year Book&quot;, replacing the previous paperback yearbooks that go as far back as the 1920s.

In 1963, the &quot;World Book Dictionary&quot; based on the works of Clarence Barnhart, was published as a companion to the encyclopedia.

In 1977, staff members of World Book visited President Jimmy Carter in the White House.

In 1978, World Book was purchased by Scott Fetzer Company, an Ohio conglomerate that left the encyclopedia company in Chicago. That year, the company had a sales force of 60,000 and vastly outsold &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

In 1985, the Scott Fetzer Company was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway. In the late 1980s, while the World Book sales force had declined, it still had 45,000 door-to-door representatives. For the year 1990, Berkshire Hathaway reported that the business of producing the encyclopedia had generated profits of $32 million. But as sales plunged in the 1990s, &quot;World Book&quot;&#x27;s results were no longer broken out in Berkshire Hathaway financial reports.

In 2009, Funk &amp; Wagnalls was acquired by &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;; the company&#x27;s &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Encyclopedia&quot; had ceased publication in 1997. Starting in the 2000s, the popularity of &quot;World Book&quot; declined, which caused the company to focus on its digital content and sales to academic institutions alongside children&#x27;s trade publications.

As of 2022, the only official sales outlet for the &quot;World Book&quot; &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is the company&#x27;s website; the official list price is $1,199. A company representative said in 2018 that &quot;thousands&quot; of print sets are still ordered annually, mostly by schools who use them as teaching tools for library research skills; public libraries and homeschooling families are also frequent purchasers.

== Production ==
The first edition of &quot;World Book&quot; (1917) contained eight volumes. New editions have since appeared every year except 1920, 1924, and 1932, with major revisions in 1929 (13 volumes), 1947 (19 volumes), 1960 (20 volumes), 1971 (22 volumes), and 1988 (new typeface and page design, and some 10,000 new editorial features). In 1972, a Research Guide and Index were added to &quot;World Book&quot;. In 2000, &quot;World Book&quot; published its Millennium Edition.

Unlike the way most other encyclopedias were printed, &quot;World Book&quot; has traditionally been published in variously sized volumes, depending on the letter of the alphabet. Although most volumes cover exactly one letter completely, the letters with exceptionally numerous entries (&quot;C&quot; and &quot;S&quot;) are divided between two volumes, while adjacent letters with relatively few entries (&quot;J&quot;–&quot;K&quot;, &quot;N&quot;–&quot;O&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;–&quot;R&quot;, &quot;U&quot;–&quot;V&quot;, and &quot;W&quot;–&quot;Z&quot;) share a volume.

&quot;World Book&quot; editors lay out major articles distinctly, often starting them on a page of their own, perhaps with a two-column heading. Materials are reviewed and authored by experts. They recognize that one of the primary uses of general-purpose encyclopedias is students&#x27; work on school reports. For instance, every article for a U.S. state has a box giving information about such things as the official state bird and tree; each President of the United States gets a very distinctive look with an oversized portrait, a timeline and significant historical events that occurred during that president&#x27;s administration.

== Alternative editions ==
In 1937, &quot;World Book&quot; published its first international edition.

In 1962, &quot;World Book&quot; produced a braille edition, which filled 145 volumes and nearly 40,000 pages. It was the first encyclopedia in braille. The project was mainly an effort in goodwill, for the company did not see its way clear to selling enough copies of the set to cover production costs. Eventually, all sets of the braille edition were donated to several institutions for the blind. In 1964, the company also published a large-print edition.

In 1990, &quot;World Book&quot; first became available electronically through text-only CD-ROMs. In 1995, the &quot;World Book Multimedia Information Finder&quot; CD-ROMs were released, which include more than 150,000 index entries, 1,700 tables, 60,000 cross references, 17,000 articles, and 225,000 dictionary entries with hyperlinks to more than 5,000 pictures and 260 maps. The &quot;Multimedia Information Finder&quot; also features animations, videos, and a graphical timeline.

In 1998, &quot;World Book&quot; launched its first website. Subsequently, &quot;World Book&quot; released several digital products while continuing to publish its print edition. The online version includes 23 subscription databases with all of the articles contained in the print set, as well as several thousand additional articles and the contents of every yearbook &quot;World Book&quot; has published since 1922. Articles are also available in the Spanish language. The online version contains links to current web sites and magazine articles, a news section, and video samples. 

In 2008, &quot;World Book Student&quot; was launched for students and teachers online.

== Digital multimedia encyclopedia ==
&quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; was also published in electronic form for Microsoft Windows and Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X. Electronic editions contained the entire text of the 22-volume &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;, plus illustrations, video clips, 3D panoramic views, and sounds. The articles bring together a complete story, multimedia content, an article outline, research aids and links to related information. Online updates to articles and a &quot;Month in Brief&quot; time browser are available by subscription.

In 2002, Apple included a bundled copy of the Mac OS X Edition of &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; when they made OS X the default operating system for all new computers. This edition had some Mac-only features, including a more intuitive user interface, Sticky Notes sharing via Bonjour technology, a &quot;Trivia Challenge&quot; game, a collection of editor-approved webcams, Notepad, speech capabilities and &quot;This Day in History&quot;, &quot;Media Showcase&quot; and &quot;Librarian&quot; widgets.

Since November 2007, both the Windows and Mac electronic editions of &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; have been developed and published by Software MacKiev.

<doc id="197870" wikidata="Q127864" url="?curid=197870" title="Chūgoku region">
<text>The , also known as the region, is the westernmost region of Honshū, the largest island of Japan. It consists of the prefectures of Hiroshima, Okayama, Shimane, Tottori and Yamaguchi. As of the 2020 census, it has a population of 7,328,339.

==History==
&quot;Chūgoku&quot; literally means &quot;middle country&quot;, but the origin of the name is unclear. Historically, Japan was divided into a number of provinces called &quot;koku&quot;, which were in turn classified according to both their power and their distances from the administrative center in Kansai. Under the latter classification, most provinces are divided into , , and . Therefore, one explanation is that &quot;Chūgoku&quot; was originally used to refer to the collection of &quot;middle countries&quot; to the west of the capital. However, only five (fewer than half) of the provinces normally considered part of Chūgoku region were in fact classified as middle countries, and the term never applied to the many middle countries to the east of Kansai. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that &quot;Chūgoku&quot; referred to provinces between Kansai and Kyūshū, which was historically important as the link between Japan and mainland Asia.

Historically, &quot;Chūgoku&quot; referred to the 16 provinces of and , which led to the region&#x27;s alternative name described below. However, because some of the easternmost provinces were later subsumed into prefectures based primarily in Kansai, those areas are, strictly speaking, not part of the Chūgoku region in modern usage.

In Japanese, the characters and the reading &quot;Chūgoku&quot; began to be used to mean &quot;China&quot; after the founding of the Republic of China. The same characters are used in Chinese to refer to China, but pronounced &quot;Zhōngguó&quot; in Mandarin, lit. &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; or &quot;Middle Country&quot; (Wade Giles: &quot;Chung1-kuo2&quot;). It is similar to the use of the West Country in English for a region of England. However, before the end of the WW2, China was more commonly called in order to avoid confusing the Chūgoku region. Due to the extensive use of this word during the Sino-Japanese War, the term &quot;shina&quot; has become an offensive word and was abandoned thereafter, and &quot;Chūgoku&quot; has since then been used instead of &quot;shina&quot;. In modern times, primarily in the tourism industry, for the same purpose, the Chūgoku region is also called the &quot;San&#x27;in‐San&#x27;yō region&quot;. San&#x27;in (&quot;yin of the mountains&quot;) is the northern part facing the Sea of Japan. San&#x27;yō (&quot;yang of the mountains&quot;) is the southern part facing the Seto Inland Sea. These names were created using the &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;‐based place‐naming scheme.

The city of Hiroshima, the &quot;capital&quot; of the Chūgoku region, was rebuilt after being destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945, and is now an industrial metropolis of more than one million people.

Overfishing and pollution reduced the productivity of the Inland Sea fishing grounds; and San&#x27;yo is an area concentrated on heavy industry. In contrast, San&#x27;in is less industrialized with an agricultural economy.

==Geography==
The Chūgoku region consists of the following prefectures: Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Shimane, and Tottori. Okayama is also included, although only Bitchū Province was considered a &quot;middle country&quot; (中国); Mimasaka Province and Bizen Province, the other two components of modern-day Okayama, were considered &quot;near countries&quot; (近国). Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Kansai neighbor the Chūgoku region.

The Chūgoku region is characterized by irregular rolling hills and limited plain areas and is divided into two distinct parts by mountains running east and west through its center.

== Demographics ==
The two largest metropolitan areas in Chūgoku region are Hiroshima and Okayama whose total population of the two metropolitan areas amount to 2.808 million as of 2020.
Their Urban Employment Area amounts to around 3 million people for the Chūgoku region. The rest of Chūgoku region is sparsely populated and very rural.

Per Japanese census data, the Chūgoku region as a whole has experienced a steady population decline since 1992, with some prefectures within the region experiencing declines since 1985. The region reached a peak population of roughly 7.8 million in 1991.

<text>A crash test dummy, or simply dummy, is a full-scale anthropomorphic test device (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body during a traffic collision. Dummies are used by researchers, automobile and aircraft manufacturers to predict the injuries a person might sustain in a crash. Modern dummies are usually instrumented to record data such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision.

Prior to the development of crash test dummies, automobile companies tested using human cadavers, animals and live volunteers. Cadavers have been used to modify different parts of a car, such as the seatbelt. This type of testing may provide more realistic test results than using a dummy, but it raises ethical dilemmas because human cadavers and animals are not able to consent to research studies. Animal testing is not prevalent today. Computational models of the human body are increasingly being used in the industry and research to complement the use of dummies as virtual tools.

There is a constant need for new testing because each new vehicle has a different design, and as technology changes ATDs must be developed to accurately test safety and efficacy.

== History ==

On August 31, 1869, Mary Ward became the first recorded victim of an automobile accident; the car involved was steam-powered (Karl Benz did not invent the gasoline-powered automobile until 1886). Ward, of Parsonstown, Ireland, was thrown out of a motor vehicle and killed. Thirty years later, on September 13, 1899, Henry Bliss became North America&#x27;s first motor vehicle fatality when hit while stepping off a New York City trolley. 
The need for a means of analyzing and mitigating the effects of motor vehicle accidents on humans was felt soon after commercial production of automobiles began in the late 1890s, and by the 1930s, when the automobile became a common part of daily life and the number of motor vehicle deaths were rising. Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles continue to climb. (Currently, according to the CDC, each year approximately 1.35 million people are killed on roadways around the world.).

In 1930 cars had dashboards of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against the interior of the automobile or through the windshield. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, car manufacturers were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.

===Cadaver testing===

Detroit&#x27;s Wayne State University was the first to begin serious work on collecting data on the effects of high-speed collisions on the human body. In the late 1930s there was no reliable data on how the human body responds to the sudden, violent forces acting on it in an automobile accident. Furthermore, no effective tools existed to measure such responses.
Biomechanics was a field barely in its infancy. It was therefore necessary to employ two types of test subjects in order to develop initial data sets.

The first test subjects were human cadavers. They were used to obtain fundamental information about the human body&#x27;s ability to withstand the crushing and tearing forces typically experienced in a high-speed accident. To such an end, steel ball bearings were dropped on skulls, and bodies were dumped down unused elevator shafts onto steel plates. Cadavers fitted with crude accelerometers were strapped into automobiles and subjected to head-on collisions and vehicle rollovers.

Albert King&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Journal of Trauma&quot; article, &quot;Humanitarian Benefits of Cadaver Research on Injury Prevention&quot;, clearly states the value in human lives saved as a result of cadaver research. King&#x27;s calculations indicate that as a result of design changes implemented up to 1987, cadaver research since saved 8,500 lives annually. He notes that for every cadaver used, each year 61 people survive due to wearing seat belts, 147 live due to air bags, and 68 survive windshield impact.

However, work with cadavers presented almost as many problems as it resolved. Not only were there the moral and ethical issues related to working with the dead, but there were also research concerns. The majority of cadavers available were older adult males who had died non-violent deaths; they did not represent a demographic cross-section of accident victims. Deceased accident victims could not be employed because any data that might be collected from such experimental subjects would be compromised by the cadaver&#x27;s previous injuries. Since no two cadavers are the same, and since any specific part of a cadaver could only be used once, it was extremely difficult to achieve reliable comparison data. In addition, child cadavers were not only difficult to obtain, but both legal and public opinion made them effectively unusable. Moreover, as crash testing became more routine, suitable cadavers became increasingly scarce. As a result, biometric data were limited in extent and skewed toward the older males.

Very little attention has been paid to obesity and car crash studies, and it is hard to obtain an obese dummy for the experiment. Instead, human cadavers were used. Body weight is a vital factor when it comes to automobile accidents, and body mass is distributed differently in an obese person versus a non-obese person. At the University of Michigan, obese cadavers were tested and compared to non-obese cadavers, and they found that the obese cadavers had more injuries in their lower extremities. The researchers also suggested that an obese person could be protected by their fat almost causing a &quot;cushioning effect.&quot;

The use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were implemented inside cadavers&#x27; brains to focus on the impact and separation of the brain and skull. NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers to look at a specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation. It also helped to establish and develop the Finite Element model, initially developed to measure neck injuries for three-year-olds. A real child&#x27;s neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model. FE models of the human head have become increasingly more important to the study of head injury.

=== Volunteer testing ===

Some researchers took it upon themselves to serve as crash test dummies. In 1954, USAF Colonel John Paul Stapp was propelled to over 1000 km/h on a rocket sled and stopped in 1.4 seconds. Lawrence Patrick, then a professor at Wayne State University, endured some 400 rides on a rocket sled in order to test the effects of rapid deceleration on the human body. He and his students allowed themselves to be hit in the chest with heavy metal pendulums, impacted in the face by pneumatically driven rotary hammers, and sprayed with shattered glass to simulate window implosion. While admitting that it made him &quot;a little sore&quot;, Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing mathematical models against which further research could be compared. While data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests that exceeded a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of test subject.

=== Animal testing ===
By the mid-1950s, the bulk of the information cadaver testing could provide had been collected. It was also necessary to collect data on accident survivability, research for which cadavers were woefully inadequate. In concert with the shortage of cadavers, this need forced researchers to seek other models. A description by Mary Roach of the &quot;Eighth Stapp Car Crash and Field Demonstration Conference&quot; shows the direction in which research had begun to move. &quot;We saw chimpanzees riding rocket sleds, a bear on an impact swing...We observed a pig, anesthetized and placed in a sitting position on the swing in the harness, crashed into a deep-dish steering wheel at about 10 mph.&quot;

One important research objective that could not be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the steering column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column reduced the risk of steering-wheel death by fifty percent.

Pigs were used for steering wheel impacts and other cabin collisions because they have an internal structure similar to humans, and can be easily placed correctly via sitting upright in the vehicle. The ability to sit upright was an important requirement for test animals so that another common fatal injury among human victims, decapitation, could be studied. Additionally, it was important for researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a dashboard with too little padding or padding that was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, it was essential to determine which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. Rear-view mirror impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision: How should a mirror be built so that it is rigid enough to perform its task, yet of low injury risk if struck?

While work with cadavers had aroused some opposition, primarily from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and the indignity of their situations was directly related to easing the pain of the living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver&#x27;s family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.

Although animal test data were still more easily obtained than cadaver data, the anatomical differences between animals and people and the difficulty of employing adequate internal instrumentation limited their usefulness. Animal testing is no longer practiced by any of the major automobile makers; General Motors discontinued live testing in 1993 and other manufacturers followed suit shortly thereafter.

In 1980, animals such as bears and pigs were tested in car crash simulations. This led to moral dilemmas and was not the first time that animals were used in car crashes. In 1978, The University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute used baboons as a substitute for human test subjects in car crashes. Although there was the objection of animal cruelty that arose, there was also the controversy of how they are similar to humans and can be used as a sufficient testing substitution for us. The researchers did not end up stopping the use of baboons because of moral objections, but instead stopped because they had collected sufficient data. The moral inputs from other people and organizations were inconsistent, which caused implications when deciding to ban healthy animals from research testing. The animals were put under anesthesia, so there was no pain put upon them, but the aftereffects cannot justify this. General Motors used animals for testing, and also suggested that they put the animals under anesthesia and then would kill the animals after completing the testing.

Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was suggested that this is not the reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan&#x27;s mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data are needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later, animal testing ceased and instead an instrumented dummy was created as a replacement. In 1978, animals were their only subjects that could be a reliable substitution for the human being. The disadvantage, though, to using an instrumented dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as a live animal. By 1991, the use of animals in vehicle collision tests was in decline because of advances in computers and technology. It is difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families of the deceased. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is mentally competent and comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.

==Dummy evolution==

There are a growing number of specialized dummies used to gather data not only for men but for women, children, the elderly and the obese; and data for rib impacts, and spinal impacts. THOR is a very advanced dummy because it uses sensors and has a humanlike spine, pelvis, and can capture neck data in 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) motion. Special classes of dummies called Hybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. Hybrid IIIs use dummies that directed towards a specific age, for example, a typical ten-year-old, six-year-old, three-year-old, and a grown man. The equipment that is put on, or in, dummies to gather data is also evolving and the most up-to-date equipment is embedded inside the ATD to create a more biofidelic response for more accurate data.

===Sierra Sam and VIP-50===

The information gleaned from cadaver research and animal studies had already been put to some use in the construction of human simulacra as early as 1949, when &quot;Sierra Sam&quot; was created by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) and Sierra Engineering Co. to test aircraft ejection seats, aviation helmets and pilot restraint harnesses. This testing involved the use of high acceleration to rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate. In the early 1950s, Alderson and Grumman produced a dummy which was used to conduct crash tests in both motor vehicles and aircraft. The original &quot;Sierra Sam&quot; was a 95th percentile male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).

Alderson went on to produce what it called the VIP-50 series, built specifically for General Motors and Ford, but which was also adopted by the National Bureau of Standards. Sierra followed up with a competitor dummy, a model it called &quot;Sierra Stan&quot;.

===Hybrid I and II===
General Motors, who had taken over the impetus in developing a reliable and durable dummy, found neither Sierra model satisfied its needs. GM engineers decided to combine the best features of the VIP series and Sierra Stan, and so in 1971 Hybrid I was born.
Hybrid I was what is known as a &quot;50th percentile male&quot; dummy. That is to say, it modeled an average male in height, mass, and proportion. In cooperation with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), GM shared this design with its competitors.

Since then, considerable work has gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy to comply with the American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) undertook an agreement with General Motors to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II&#x27;s performance in a number of specific areas.

Though a great improvement over cadavers for standardized testing purposes, Hybrid I and Hybrid II were still very crude, and their use was limited to developing and testing seat belt designs. A dummy was needed which would allow researchers to explore injury-reduction strategies. It was this need that pushed GM researchers to develop the current Hybrid line, the Hybrid III family of crash test dummies.

===Hybrid III family===
Hybrid III, the 50th percentile male dummy which made its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, and he is now a family man. If he could stand upright, he would be tall and would have a mass of . He occupies the driver&#x27;s seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a &quot;big brother&quot;, the 95th percentile Hybrid III, at and . Ms. Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive tall and . The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, six-year-old, and a three-year-old. The child models are very recent additions to the crash test dummy family; because so little hard data are available on the effects of accidents on children and such data are very difficult to obtain, these models are based in large part on estimates and approximations. The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.

The Hybrid III dummy for three-, six- and ten-year-olds has its limitations, and does not provide the same physical outcome a human would encounter with a frontal crash. It was found that when testing the three-year-old Hybrid III dummy, it showed that frontal crashes would most likely cause cervical spine injuries. When using data from the real world, the results did not match up to the Hybrid III stimulation injuries. To get around this, THUMS was created which stands for Total Human Model of Safety. The model can be easily relatable to the human body anatomically especially focusing on the human spine upon impact. Clinical testing and experiments are more accurate than a dummy and more reliable case studies can be implemented with this model. The model is based on a male only, and mimics human tissues and organs. This model is accurate for males in the 50th percentile, and it can not easily relate to three-year-olds when dealing with neck and head injuries, which are responsible for 57 percent of car crash fatalities. Instead, the FE model can be appropriately implemented for these criteria.

There are certain testing procedures for Hybrid IIIs to ensure that they obtain a correct humanlike neck flexure, and to ensure that they would react to a crash in a similar way that human bodies would. 

=== Test device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) ===
==== THOR-50M mid-size male ====

THOR is an advanced crash test dummy designed to expand the Hybrid-III test dummy capabilities in assessing frontal impacts. THOR-50M, the mid-size male, was created to improve human-like anthropometry and increase the instrumentation for mitigating injury.

Although development started in the 1990s, with the latest design update by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in contract with Humanetics, the first new prototypes were delivered in 2013. Since then, Europe&#x27;s New Car Assessment Program became the first agency to adopt THOR into testing protocols, replacing the Hybrid III mid-sized male in the driver&#x27;s seat.

====THOR-5F small female====
The small female version of THOR is based on the technology of the male version, but has more female-like anthropometry to represent females in frontal impact testing. 

The female THOR and the lack of female test dummies has received new interest as gender equity issues have emerged citing the lack of female crash test dummies and availability of new technology in regulation testing. A Center for Applied Biomechanics, University of Virginia, paper published in 2019 citing the increased risk of injury in female automobile occupants which started a fresh examination into female impact testing and protection.

The THOR dummies can accommodate 150+ channels of data collection throughout their bodies.

=== Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan) ===
WIAMan is a blast test dummy designed to assess potential skeletal injuries of soldiers exposed to under-body blast (UBB). Designed jointly by the U.S. Army and Diversified Technical Systems (DTS), the project includes an anthropomorphic test device and in-dummy data acquisition and sensor solution. Since the project started in February 2015, two generations of WIAMan prototypes have undergone a series of lab tests and blast events in the field.

With the prototype&#x27;s delivery in 2018, WIAMan evaluates the effects of under-body blasts involving vehicles, and assess the risk to soldiers in ground vehicle systems. The goal of the WIAMan project is to acquire data that will improve the design of military vehicles and personal protective equipment. WIAMan and the platform created to simulate an IED explosion are undergoing continued testing.

Test dummies of the past were intended for the auto industry and lacked the same response a human would have to explosions. A challenge for the Army has been to develop a crash test dummy that moves enough like a human body to get an accurate result. The Army is working to make the mannequin &quot;biofidelic,&quot; meaning it can match human movement. At 5-feet-11-inches tall and 185 lbs., WIAMan is based on the size and movement of an average soldier.

U.S. Army Research Laboratory and its partners at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab completed biofidelity testing in 2017. The purpose of the testing was to develop a dummy capable of predicting specific injury risk to occupants in a vehicle during live-fire tests, based on human response data.

The manikin supports up to 156 channels of data acquisition, measuring different variables a soldier may experience in a vehicle blast. WIAMan includes self-contained internal power and the world&#x27;s smallest data acquisition system called SLICE6, based on SLICE NANO architecture, eliminating the huge mass of sensor cables normally exiting dummies. The data measured within WIAMan includes forces, moments, accelerations and angular velocity. The DEVCOM Analysis Center (DAC) processes WIAMan data via a software analysis tool called the Analysis of Manikin Data, or AMANDA. On Feb. 2, 2022, AMANDA was accredited by the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command for use in live fire test and evaluation.

=== Female crash test dummies ===
Crash test dummies have been commonly based on males, even though women make up 62% of all car buyers in the USA. This leads to oversights in automotive safety and ergonomics for this demographic. In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) introduced the female Hybrid III into collision testing. This dummy was a scaled-down version of its male counterpart, representing the 5th percentile of women based on mid-1970s standards.

In 2002, Volvo pioneered the development of a virtual crash test dummy representing a midsized pregnant female. Collaborating with Chalmers University of Technology, they also crafted a computer model of an average-sized female to advance their whiplash protection system. Other car companies have also adopted computer models in their safety testing to simulate crashes.

In May 2023, the world&#x27;s first female crash test dummy was used in a crash test at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute in Linköping, Sweden. Dr. Astrid Linder led the team of researchers to develop the female crash test dummy which represented the height and weight of women at the 50th and 25th percentiles. The model was created after crash statistics showed that female bodies are more prone to other injuries than male, such as whiplash. The female dummy was developed with the help of an EU project.

==Testing procedure==

Every Hybrid III undergoes calibration prior to a crash test. Its head is removed and then dropped from to calibrate the head instrumentation. Then the head and neck are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear chamois leather skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the ribs bend and flex as they should.

When the dummy has been determined to be ready for testing, calibration marks are fastened to the side of the head to aid researchers when slow-motion films are reviewed later. The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30,000 and 35,000 data items in a typical 100–150 millisecond crash. These data are recorded in a temporary data repository in the dummy&#x27;s chest and then downloaded to a computer once the test is complete.

Because the Hybrid is a standardized data collection device, any part of a particular Hybrid type is interchangeable with any other. Not only can one dummy be tested several times, but if a part should fail, it can be replaced with a new part. A fully instrumented dummy is worth about €150,000.

=== Positioning and restraints ===

Children in the three-year-old age group are more likely to have a fatality because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year-olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child&#x27;s criteria including age, weight and height.

===Specialized dummies===
Hybrid IIIs are designed to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects of other types of impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. After head-on collisions, the most common severe injury accident is the side impact.

*The SID (Side Impact Dummy) family of test dummies is designed to measure rib, spine, and internal organ effects in side collisions. It also assesses spine and rib deceleration and compression of the chest cavity. SID is the United States government testing standard, EuroSID is used in Europe to ensure compliance with safety standards, and SID II(s) represents a 5th-percentile female. BioSID is a more sophisticated version of SID and EuroSID, but is not used in a regulatory capacity. The WorldSID is a project to develop a new generation of dummy under the International Organization for Standardization.
*BioRID is a dummy designed to assess the effects of a rear impact. Its primary purpose is to research whiplash, and to aid designers in developing effective head and neck restraints. BioRID is more sophisticated in its spinal construction than Hybrid; 24 vertebra simulators allow BioRID to assume a much more natural seating posture, and to demonstrate the neck movement and configuration seen in rear-end collisions.

*CRABI is a child dummy used to evaluate the effectiveness of child restraint devices, including seat belts and air bags. There are three models of the CRABI, representing 18-month, 12-month, and 6-month-old children.
*FGOA is a first generation obese anthropometric test device which can be used to study the automotive safety challenges for obese occupants, who are believed to have higher risk of mortality in automobile collisions comparing to non-obese occupants.

*THOR is currently the most advanced dummy on the market. The successor of Hybrid III, THOR has a more human-like spine and pelvis, and its face contains a number of sensors which allow analysis of facial impacts to an accuracy currently unobtainable with other dummies. THOR&#x27;s range of sensors is also greater in quantity and sensitivity than those of Hybrid III. THOR&#x27;s original manufacturer, GESAC Inc., ceased production after the slowdown of the auto industry in the late 2000s. THOR was being further developed, and two other companies were working on similar dummies; NHTSA&#x27;s ultimate goal for this government-funded project was the development of a single THOR dummy, but THOR dummy development stopped. FTSS, bought by Humanetics, and DentonATD both continued to produce the THOR LX and THOR FLX.
*Linda is a virtual pregnant crash dummy developed by Volvo engineer Laura Thackray in 2002. Linda is modelled in her 36th week of pregnancy to analyze the effects of high-speed impact on the womb, placenta, and fetus.
*Animal models have been used to test the safety of dog harnesses and crates in crash conditions.

==Regulation==
For the purpose of U.S. regulation and Global Technical Regulations and for clear communication in safety and seating design, dummies carry specifically designated reference points, such as the H-point; these are also used, for example, in automotive design.

== Popular culture ==
* In 1986, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a division of the United States Department of Transportation, launched a series of public service announcements in magazines and on television featuring two talking crash dummies named Vince (voiced by Jack Burns) (played by Tony Reitano) and Larry (voiced by Lorenzo Music) (played by Tom Harrison, later replaced by Whitney Rydbeck) who modelled seat belt safety practices through their slapstick antics, with the slogan &quot;You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy&quot;. By the time the campaign was retired in 1999, seat belt usage had risen from 21% to 67%. Since then crash dummy characters have continued to be used in seat belt safety campaigns, especially those aimed at children.
* In the early 1990s, Tyco Toys created a line of action figures called &quot;The Incredible Crash Dummies&quot; based on the characters from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart at the touch of a button on their abdomens. Vehicles that could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a half-hour television special, &quot;The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies&quot;. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and other gaming consoles were produced.
* In 2004, a series of &quot;Crash Dummies&quot; animated shorts were commissioned for the FOX network. Related toys from Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels brand were produced.
* The television series &quot;MythBusters&quot; employed a Hybrid II model crash test dummy, &quot;Buster&quot;, for dangerous experiments. Additionally, the show utilized a number of simulaids in addition to using the hosts themselves as the test subjects if the experiment was safe enough.
* In Discovery Kids children&#x27;s educational series &quot;Crash Test Danny&quot;, the title character is a living crash test dummy, played by Ben Langley, who gets crushed, blown up, and pulled apart in the name of science.
* In 2014, Secret Exit Ltd. released Turbo Dismount, a game where the player puts a crash test dummy in different vehicles to send them off into crashes.
* In 2020, actor Aamir Khan played a crash test dummy in a series of advertisements for Indian tire manufacturer CEAT Tyres.

<text>The Hughes H-4 Hercules (commonly known as the Spruce Goose; registration NX37602) is a prototype strategic airlift flying boat designed and built by the Hughes Aircraft Company. Intended as a transatlantic flight transport for use during World War II, it was not completed in time to be used in the war. The aircraft made only one brief flight, on November 2, 1947, and the project never advanced beyond the prototype.

Built from wood (Duramold process) because of wartime restrictions on the use of aluminum and concerns about weight, the aircraft was nicknamed the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; by critics, although it was made almost entirely of birch. The &quot;Birch Bitch&quot; was a more accurate but less socially acceptable moniker that was allegedly used by the mechanics who worked on the plane. The Hercules is the largest flying boat ever built, and it had the largest wingspan of any aircraft ever flown until the twin-fuselaged Scaled Composites Stratolaunch first flew on April 13, 2019. The aircraft remains in good condition. After having been displayed to the public in Long Beach, California, from 1980 to 1992, it was moved to display at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2024.

==Design and development==
In 1942, the U.S. War Department needed to transport war materiel and personnel to Britain. Allied shipping in the Atlantic Ocean was suffering heavy losses to German U-boats, so a requirement was issued for an aircraft that could cross the Atlantic with a large payload. Wartime priorities meant the aircraft could not be made of strategic materials (e.g., aluminum).

The aircraft was the brainchild of Henry J. Kaiser, a leading Liberty ship builder and manufacturer. Kaiser teamed with aircraft designer Howard Hughes to create what would become the largest aircraft yet built. It was designed to carry , 750 fully equipped troops or two 30-ton M4 Sherman tanks. The original designation &quot;HK-1&quot; reflected the Hughes and Kaiser collaboration.

The HK-1 aircraft contract was issued in 1942 as a development contract and called for three aircraft to be constructed in two years for the war effort. Seven configurations were considered, including twin-hull and single-hull designs with combinations of four, six, and eight wing-mounted engines. The final design chosen was a behemoth, eclipsing any large transport then built. It would be built mostly of wood to conserve metal (its elevators and rudder were fabric-covered), and was nicknamed the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; (a name Hughes disliked) or the &quot;Flying Lumberyard&quot;.

While Kaiser had originated the &quot;flying cargo ship&quot; concept, he did not have an aeronautical background and deferred to Hughes and his designer, Glenn Odekirk. Development dragged on, which frustrated Kaiser, who blamed delays partly on restrictions placed for the acquisition of strategic materials such as aluminum, and partly on Hughes&#x27; insistence on &quot;perfection.&quot; Construction of the first HK-1 took place 16 months after the receipt of the development contract. Kaiser then withdrew from the project.

Hughes continued the program on his own under the designation &quot;H-4 Hercules&quot;, signing a new government contract that now limited production to one example. Work proceeded slowly, and the H-4 was not completed until well after the war was over. The plane was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company at Hughes Airport, location of present-day Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California, employing the plywood-and-resin &quot;Duramold&quot; process – a form of composite technology – for the laminated wood construction, which was considered a technological &quot;tour de force&quot;. The specialized wood veneer was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin. Hamilton Roddis had teams of young women ironing the (unusually thin) strong birch wood veneer before shipping to California.

A house moving company transported the airplane on streets to Pier E (now Pier T) in Long Beach, California. They moved it in three large sections: the fuselage, each wing—and a fourth, smaller shipment with tail assembly parts and other smaller assemblies. After Hughes Aircraft completed final assembly, they erected a hangar around the flying boat, with a ramp to launch the H-4 into the harbor.

Howard Hughes was called to testify before the Senate War Investigating Committee in 1947 over the use of government funds for the aircraft. During a Senate hearing on August 6, 1947 (the first of a series of appearances), Hughes said:

The Hercules was a monumental undertaking. It is the largest aircraft ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That&#x27;s more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing. I have my reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it&#x27;s a failure, I&#x27;ll probably leave this country and never come back. And I mean it.

In all, development cost for the plane reached $23 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars).

==Operational history==
Hughes returned to California during a break in the Senate hearings to run taxi tests on the H-4. On November 2, 1947, the taxi tests began with Hughes at the controls. His crew included Dave Grant as copilot, two flight engineers, Don Smith and Joe Petrali, 16 mechanics, and two other flight crew. The H-4 also carried seven invited guests from the press corps and an additional seven industry representatives. In total, thirty-six people were on board.

Four reporters left to file stories after the first two taxi runs while the remaining press stayed for the final test run of the day. After picking up speed on the channel facing Cabrillo Beach, the Hercules lifted off, remaining airborne for 26 seconds at off the water at a speed of for about one mile (1.6 km). At this altitude, the aircraft still experienced ground effect. To Hughes, these tests demonstrated that the (now-unneeded) plane was flight-worthy, and thus worth the use of government funds.

The H-4 never flew again. Its lifting capacity and ceiling were never tested. Afterwards a full-time crew of 300 workers, all sworn to secrecy, maintained the aircraft in flying condition in a climate-controlled hangar. The company reduced the crew to 50 workers in 1962 and then disbanded it after Hughes&#x27; death in 1976.

==Display==
Ownership of the H-4 was disputed by the U.S. government, which had contracted for its construction. In the mid-1970s, an agreement was reached whereby the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum would receive the Hughes H-1 Racer and section of the H-4&#x27;s wing, the Summa Corporation would pay $700,000 and receive ownership of the H-4, the U.S. government would cede any rights, and the aircraft would be protected &quot;from commercial exploitation.&quot;

In 1980, the H-4 was acquired by the Aero Club of Southern California, which later put the aircraft on display in a very large geodesic dome next to the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; ship exhibit in Long Beach, California. The large dome facility became known as the Spruce Goose Dome. The very large enclosed indoor dome area around the H-4 consisted of meeting and special event space, elaborate audio-visual displays about Howard Hughes and the aircraft itself, and dining areas for tourists. Many convention groups held large dinners, sales meetings, and even concerts under the wings of the aircraft at night when the Spruce Goose Dome was closed to tourists. In 1986, a secondary simulator-style attraction named Time Voyager was constructed next to the H-4, at a cost of $2.5 million (~$ in ). In 1988, The Walt Disney Company acquired both Long Beach attractions and the associated Long Beach real estate by Pier J. In 1991, Disney informed the Aero Club of Southern California that it no longer wished to display the Hercules aircraft after its highly ambitious Port Disney plan was scrapped.

After a long search for a suitable host, the Aero Club of Southern California arranged for the Hughes Hercules flying boat to be given to Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum in exchange for payments and a percentage of the museum&#x27;s profits. The aircraft was transported by barge, train, and truck to its current home in McMinnville, Oregon (about southwest of Portland), where it was reassembled by Contractors Cargo Company and is currently on display. The aircraft arrived in McMinnville on February 27, 1993, after a 138-day, trip from Long Beach. The Spruce Goose geodesic dome is now used by Carnival Cruise Lines as its Long Beach terminal.

By the mid-1990s, the former Hughes Aircraft hangars at Hughes Airport, including the one that held the Hercules, were converted into sound stages. Scenes from movies such as &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;What Women Want&quot; and &quot;End of Days&quot; have been filmed in the aircraft hangar where Howard Hughes created the flying boat. The hangar will be preserved as a structure eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in what is today the large light industry and housing development in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles. It has since been converted to office and event space by Google.

<text>Programming style, also known as coding style, refers to the conventions and patterns used in writing source code, resulting in a consistent and readable codebase. These conventions often encompass aspects such as indentation, naming conventions, capitalization, and comments. Consistent programming style is generally considered beneficial for code readability and maintainability, particularly in collaborative environments.

Maintaining a consistent style across a codebase can improve readability and ease of software maintenance. It allows developers to quickly understand code written by others and reduces the likelihood of errors during modifications. Adhering to standardized coding guidelines ensures that teams follow a uniform approach, making the codebase easier to manage and scale. Many organizations and open-source projects adopt specific coding standards to facilitate collaboration and reduce cognitive load.

Style guidelines can be formalized in documents known as coding conventions, which dictate specific formatting and naming rules. These conventions may be prescribed by official standards for a programming language or developed internally within a team or project. For example, Python&#x27;s PEP 8 is a widely recognized style guide that outlines best practices for writing Python code. In contrast, languages like C or Java may have industry standards that are either formally documented or adhered to by convention.

== Automation ==
Adherence to coding style can be enforced through automated tools, which format code according to predefined guidelines. These tools reduce the manual effort required to maintain style consistency, allowing programmers to focus on logic and functionality. For instance, tools such as codice_1 for Python and codice_2 for C++ automatically reformat code to comply with specified coding standards.

== Style guidelines ==
Common elements of coding style include:
* &quot;Indentation and whitespace character use&quot; – Ensures consistent block structures and improves readability.
* &quot;Naming conventions&quot; – Standardizes how variables, functions, and classes are named, typically adhering to camelCase, snake case, or PascalCase, depending on the language.
* &quot;Capitalization&quot; – Dictates whether keywords and identifiers are capitalized or lowercase, in line with language syntax.
* &quot;Comment use&quot; – Provides context and explanations within code without affecting its execution.

=== Indentation ===
Indentation style can assist a reader in various way including: identifying control flow and blocks of code. In some programming languages, indentation is used to delimit blocks of code and therefore is not matter of style. In languages that ignore whitespace, indentation can affect readability.

For example, formatted in a commonly-used style:
if (hours &lt; 24 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt; 60 &amp;&amp; seconds &lt; 60) {
 return true;
} else {
 return false;


Arguably, poorly formatted:

if ( hours &lt; 24
 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt; 60
 &amp;&amp; seconds &lt; 60
{return true
;} else
{return false


==== Notable indenting styles ====
===== ModuLiq =====
The ModuLiq Zero Indentation Style groups by empty line rather than indenting.

Example:
if (hours &lt; 24 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt; 60 &amp;&amp; seconds &lt; 60)
return true;

else
return false;
===== Lua =====
Lua does not use the traditional curly braces or parentheses; rather, the expression in a conditional statement must be followed by codice_3, and the block must be closed with codice_4.

if hours &lt; 24 and minutes &lt; 60 and seconds &lt; 60 then
 return true
else
 return false
end
Indenting is optional in Lua. codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7 function as logical operators.

===== Python =====
Python relies on the &quot;off-side rule&quot;, using indenting to indicate and implement control structure, thus eliminating the need for bracketing (i.e., codice_8 and codice_9). However, copying and pasting indented code can cause problems, because the indent level of the pasted code may not be the same as the indent level of the target line. Such reformatting by hand is tedious and error prone, but some text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) have features to do it automatically. There are also problems when indented code is rendered unusable when posted on a forum or web page that removes whitespace, though this problem can be avoided where it is possible to enclose code in whitespace-preserving tags such as &quot;&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;&quot; (for HTML), &quot;[code]&quot; ... &quot;[/code]&quot; (for bbcode), etc.
if hours &lt; 24 and minutes &lt; 60 and seconds &lt; 60:
 return True
else:
 return False
Python starts a block with a colon (codice_10).

Python programmers tend to follow a commonly agreed style guide known as PEP8. There are tools designed to automate PEP8 compliance.

===== Haskell =====
Haskell, like Python, has the &quot;off-side rule&quot;. It has a two-dimension syntax where indenting is meaningful to define blocks (although, an alternate syntax uses curly braces and semicolons).

Haskell is a declarative language, there are statements, but declarations within a Haskell script.

Example:
let c_1 = 1
 c_2 = 2
in
 f x y = c_1 * x + c_2 * y

may be written in one line as:

let {c_1=1;c_2=2} 
in f x y = c_1 * x + c_2 * y

Haskell encourages the use of literate programming, where extended text explains the genesis of the code. In literate Haskell scripts (named with the codice_11 extension), everything is a comment except blocks marked as code. The program can be written in LaTeX, in such case the codice_12 environment marks what is code. Also, each active code paragraph can be marked by preceding and ending it with an empty line, and starting each line of code with a greater than sign and a space. Here an example using LaTeX markup:

The function \verb+isValidDate+ test if date is valid
\begin{code}
isValidDate :: Date -&gt; Bool
isValidDate date = hh&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; mm&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; ss&gt;=0
 &amp;&amp; hh&lt;24 &amp;&amp; mm&lt;60 &amp;&amp; ss&lt;60
 where (hh,mm,ss) = fromDate date
\end{code}
observe that in this case the overloaded function is \verb+fromDate :: Date -&gt; (Int,Int,Int)+.
And an example using plain text:

The function isValidDate test if date is valid

&gt; isValidDate :: Date -&gt; Bool
&gt; isValidDate date = hh&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; mm&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; ss&gt;=0
&gt; &amp;&amp; hh&lt;24 &amp;&amp; mm&lt;60 &amp;&amp; ss&lt;60
&gt; where (hh,mm,ss) = fromDate date

observe that in this case the overloaded function is fromDate :: Date -&gt; (Int,Int,Int).
=== Vertical alignment ===
Some programmers consider it valuable to align similar elements vertically (as tabular, in columns), citing that it can make typo-generated bugs more obvious.

For example, unaligned:
$search = array(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;);
$replacement = array(&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;quux&#x27;);

$value = 0;
$anothervalue = 1;
$yetanothervalue = 2;
aligned:
$search = array(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;);
$replacement = array(&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;quux&#x27;);

$value = 0;
$anothervalue = 1;
$yetanothervalue = 2;
Unlike the unaligned code, the aligned code implies that the search and replace values are related since they have corresponding elements. As there is one more value for search than replacement, if this is a bug, it is more likely to be spotted via visual inspection.

Cited disadvantages of vertical alignment include:

* Dependencies across lines which leads to maintenance load. For example, if a long column value is added that requires a wider column, then all lines of the table must be modified (to maintain the tabular form) which is a larger change which leads to more effort to review and to understand the change at a later date
* Brittleness: if a programmer does not correctly format the table when making a change, the result is a visual mess that is harder to read than unaligned code. Simple refactoring operations, such as renaming, can break the formatting.
* More effort to maintain which may discourage a programmer from making a beneficial change, such as improving the name of an identifier, because doing so would require significant formatting effort
* Requirement to use a fixed-width fonts; not proportional fonts

Maintaining alignment can be alleviated by a tool that provides support (i.e. for elastic tabstops), although that creates a reliance on such tools.

As an example, simple refactoring operations to rename &quot;$replacement&quot; to &quot;$r&quot; and &quot;$anothervalue&quot; to &quot;$a&quot; results in:
$search = array(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;);
$r = array(&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;quux&#x27;);

$value = 0;
$a = 1;
$yetanothervalue = 2;
With unaligned formatting, these changes do not have such a dramatic, inconsistent or undesirable effect:
$search = array(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;d&#x27;, &#x27;e&#x27;);
$r = array(&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;baz&#x27;, &#x27;quux&#x27;);

$value = 0;
$a = 1;
$yetanothervalue = 2;
=== Whitespace ===
A free-format language ignores whitespace characters: spaces, tabs and new lines so the programmer is free to style the code in different ways without affecting the meaning of the code. Generally, the programmer uses style that is considered to enhance readability.

The two code snippets below are the same logically, but differ in whitespace.
int i;
for(i=0;i&lt;10;++i){
 printf(&quot;%d&quot;,i*i+i);

versus 

int i;
for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
 printf(&quot;%d&quot;, i * i + i);


The use of tabs for whitespace is debatable. Alignment issues arise due to differing tab stops in different environments and mixed use of tabs and spaces.

As an example, one programmer prefers tab stops of four and has their toolset configured this way, and uses these to format their code.
int ix; // Index to scan array
long sum; // Accumulator for sum
Another programmer prefers tab stops of eight, and their toolset is configured this way. When someone else examines the original person&#x27;s code, they may well find it difficult to read.
int ix; // Index to scan array
long sum; // Accumulator for sum
One widely used solution to this issue may involve forbidding the use of tabs for alignment or rules on how tab stops must be set. Note that tabs work fine provided they are used consistently, restricted to logical indentation, and not used for alignment:
class MyClass {
 int foobar(
 int qux, // first parameter
 int quux); // second parameter
 int foobar2(
 int qux, // first parameter
 int quux, // second parameter
 int quuux); // third parameter

<doc id="197889" wikidata="Q692603" url="?curid=197889" title="Felix the Cat">
<text>Felix the Cat is a cartoon character created in 1919 by Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer during the silent film era. An anthropomorphic young black cat with white eyes, a black body, and a giant grin, he is often considered one of the most recognized cartoon characters in history. Felix was the first fully realized recurring animal character in the history of American film animation.

Felix originated from the studio of Australian cartoonist-film entrepreneur Pat Sullivan. Either Sullivan himself or his lead animator, American Otto Messmer, created the character. What is certain is that Felix emerged from Sullivan&#x27;s studio, and cartoons featuring the character became well known in popular culture. Aside from the animated shorts, Felix starred in a comic strip (drawn by Sullivan, Messmer and later Joe Oriolo) beginning in 1923, and his image soon adorned merchandise such as ceramics, toys, and postcards. Several manufacturers made stuffed Felix toys. Jazz bands such as Paul Whiteman&#x27;s played songs about him (1923&#x27;s &quot;Felix Kept on Walking&quot; and others). 

By the late 1920s, with the arrival of sound cartoons, Felix&#x27;s success was fading. The new Disney shorts of Mickey Mouse made the silent offerings of Sullivan and Messmer, who were then unwilling to move to sound production, seem outdated. In 1929, Sullivan decided to make the transition and began distributing Felix sound cartoons through Copley Pictures. The sound Felix shorts proved to be a failure and the operation ended in 1932. Felix saw a brief three-cartoon resurrection in 1936 by the Van Beuren Studios.

Felix cartoons began airing on American television in 1953. Joe Oriolo introduced a redesigned, &quot;long-legged&quot; Felix, with longer legs, a much smaller body, and a larger, rounder head with no whiskers and no teeth. Oriolo also added new characters and gave Felix a &quot;Magic Bag of Tricks&quot; that could assume an infinite variety of shapes at Felix&#x27;s behest. The cat has since starred in other television programs and in two feature films. As of the 2010s, Felix is featured on a variety of merchandise from clothing to toys. Joe&#x27;s son Don Oriolo later assumed creative control of Felix.

Early versions of Felix the Cat entered the public domain in 1994 under the Copyright Act of 1976.

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Felix the Cat number 28 on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list.

In 2014, Don Oriolo sold the trademark and remaining copyrights to the character to DreamWorks Animation via DreamWorks Classics, which is now part of Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal division via Universal Pictures.

==History==
===Creation===


On November 9, 1919, Master Tom, a prototype of Felix, debuted in a Paramount Pictures short titled &quot;Feline Follies&quot;. Produced by the Manhattan-based animation studio owned by Pat Sullivan, the cartoon was directed by cartoonist and animator Otto Messmer. It was a success, and the Sullivan studio quickly set to work on producing another film featuring Master Tom, in &quot;Musical Mews&quot; (released on November 16, 1919). It too proved to be successful with audiences. Messmer claimed that John King of &quot;Paramount Magazine&quot; suggested the name &quot;Felix&quot;, as in &quot;feline&quot;, and for contrast of the felicity traditionally associated with a black cat. The name was first used for the third film starring the character, &quot;The Adventures of Felix&quot; (released on December 14, 1919). Sullivan claimed he named Felix after Australia Felix from Australian history and literature. In 1924, animator Bill Nolan redesigned the character, making him both rounder and &quot;cuter&quot;. Felix&#x27;s new looks, coupled with Messmer&#x27;s character animation, brought Felix to a higher profile.

====Authorship====
The question of who created Felix remains a matter of dispute. Sullivan stated in numerous newspaper interviews that he created Felix and did the key drawings for the character. On a visit to Australia in 1925, Sullivan told &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper that &quot;[t]he idea was given to me by the sight of a cat which my wife brought to the studio one day&quot;. On other occasions, he claimed that Felix had been inspired by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Cat that Walked by Himself&quot; or by his wife&#x27;s love for strays. Members of the Australian Cartoonist Association have claimed that lettering used in &quot;Feline Follies&quot; matches Sullivan&#x27;s handwriting and that Sullivan lettered within his drawings. In addition, at roughly the 4:00 mark in &quot;Feline Follies&quot;, the words &#x27;Lo Mum&#x27; are used in a speech bubble by one of the kittens; this was a term for one&#x27;s mother not used by Americans, but certainly by Australians. Yet Messmer claimed to have single-handedly drawn &quot;Feline Follies&quot; from home, raising questions as to why an American would use the term &#x27;Mum&#x27; in a cartoon he solely drew himself. Sullivan&#x27;s supporters also say the case is supported by his March 18, 1917, release of a cartoon short titled &quot;The Tail of Thomas Kat&quot; more than two years prior to &quot;Feline Follies&quot;. Both an Australian ABC-TV documentary screened in 2004 and the curators of an exhibition at the State Library of New South Wales in 2005 suggested that Thomas Kat was a prototype or precursor of Felix. Few details of Thomas have survived. His fur color has not been definitively established, and the surviving copyright synopsis for the short suggests significant differences between Thomas and the later Felix. For example, whereas the later Felix magically transforms his tail into tools and other objects, Thomas is a non-anthropomorphized cat who loses his tail in a fight with a rooster, never to recover it.

Sullivan was the studio proprietor and—as is the case with almost all film entrepreneurs—he owned the copyright to any creative work by his employees. In common with many animators at the time, Messmer was not credited. After Sullivan&#x27;s death in 1933, his estate in Australia took ownership of the character; although Messmer told Harry Kopp that Sullivan promised him the rights to Felix in his will, no such will existed by the time he died. Kopp and the estate got the rights in 1934 from King Features Syndicate after numerous conferences with him.

It was not until after Sullivan&#x27;s death that Sullivan staffers such as Hal Walker, Al Eugster, Gerry Geronimi, Rudy Zamora, George Cannata, and Sullivan&#x27;s own lawyer, Harry Kopp, credited Messmer with Felix&#x27;s creation. They claimed that Felix was based on an animated Charlie Chaplin that Messmer had animated for Sullivan&#x27;s studio earlier on. The down-and-out personality and movements of the cat in &quot;Feline Follies&quot; reflect key attributes of Chaplin&#x27;s, and, although blockier than the later Felix, the familiar black body is already there (Messmer found solid shapes easier to animate). Messmer himself recalled his version of the cat&#x27;s creation in an interview with animation historian John Canemaker:
Further, Messmer told Canemaker that both he and Sullivan drew Felix based on models from the minstrel show tradition and the pickaninny caricature:

The tropes of minstrelsy were useful for creating a cartoon animal because they cued the audience to expect a lively, amusing and rebellious character.

Animation historians back Messmer&#x27;s claims. Among them are Michael Barrier, Jerry Beck, Colin and Timothy Cowles, Donald Crafton, David Gerstein, Milt Gray, Mark Kausler, Leonard Maltin, and Charles Solomon.

Sullivan marketed the cat relentlessly while Messmer continued to produce a prodigious volume of Felix cartoons. Messmer did the animation on white paper with inkers tracing the drawings directly. The animators drew backgrounds onto pieces of celluloid, which were then laid atop the drawings to be photographed. Any perspective work had to be animated by hand, as the studio cameras were unable to perform pans or trucks.

===Popularity and distribution===
Paramount Pictures distributed the earliest films from 1919 to 1921. Margaret J. Winkler distributed the shorts from 1922 to 1925, the year when Educational Pictures took over the distribution of the shorts. Sullivan promised them one new &quot;Felix&quot; short every two weeks. The combination of solid animation, skillful promotion, and widespread distribution brought Felix&#x27;s popularity to new heights.

References to alcoholism and Prohibition were also commonplace in many of the Felix shorts, particularly &quot;Felix Finds Out&quot; (1924), &quot;Whys and Other Whys&quot; (1927), and &quot;Felix Woos Whoopee&quot; (1930), to name a few. In &quot;Felix Dopes It Out&quot; (1924), Felix tries to help a suicidal man who is plagued with a red nose. By the end of the short, the cat finds the cure for the condition: &quot;Keep drinking, and it&#x27;ll turn blue&quot;.

Felix&#x27;s great success also spawned a host of imitators. The appearances and personalities of other 1920s feline stars such as Julius of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice Comedies&quot;, Waffles of Paul Terry&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot;, and especially Bill Nolan&#x27;s 1925 adaptation of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; (distributed by the eschewed Winkler) all seem to have been directly patterned after Felix. This influence also extended outside the United States, serving as inspiration for Suihō Tagawa in the creation of his character Norakuro, a dog with black fur.

Felix&#x27;s cartoons were also popular among critics. They have been cited as imaginative examples of surrealism in filmmaking. Felix has been said to represent a child&#x27;s sense of wonder, creating the fantastic when it is not there, and taking it in stride when it is. His famous pace—hands behind his back, head down, deep in thought—became a trademark that has been analyzed by critics around the world. Felix&#x27;s expressive tail, which could be a shovel one moment, an exclamation mark or pencil the next, serves to emphasize that anything can happen in his world. Aldous Huxley wrote that the &quot;Felix&quot; shorts proved that &quot;[w]hat the cinema can do better than literature or the spoken drama is to be fantastic&quot;.

By 1923, the character was at the peak of his film career. &quot;Felix in Hollywood&quot;, a short released during that year, plays upon Felix&#x27;s popularity, as he becomes acquainted with such fellow celebrities as Douglas Fairbanks, Cecil B. DeMille, Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, and even censor Will H. Hays. His image could be seen on clocks (not to be confused with the Kit-Cat Klock) and Christmas ornaments. Felix also became the subject of several popular songs of the day, such as &quot;Felix Kept Walking&quot; by Paul Whiteman. Sullivan made an estimated $100,000 a year from toy licensing alone. With the character&#x27;s success also emerged a handful of new costars. These included Felix&#x27;s master Willie Jones, a mouse named Skiddoo, Felix&#x27;s nephews Inky, Dinky, and Winky, and his girlfriend Kitty. Felix the Cat sheet music, with music by Pete Wendling and Max Kortlander and featuring lyrics by Alfred Bryan, was published in 1928 by Sam Fox Publishing Company. The cover art of Felix playing a banjo was done by Otto Messmer.

Most of the early Felix cartoons mirrored American attitudes of the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;. Ethnic stereotypes appeared in such shorts as &quot;Felix Goes Hungry&quot; (1924). Recent events such as the Russian Civil War were depicted in shorts like &quot;Felix All Puzzled&quot; (1924). Flappers were caricatured in &quot;Felix Strikes It Rich&quot; (1923). He also became involved in union organizing with &quot;Felix Revolts&quot; (also 1923). In some shorts, Felix even performed a rendition of the Charleston.

In 1928, Educational ceased releasing the Felix cartoons, and several were reissued by First National Pictures. Copley Pictures distributed them from 1929 to 1930. There was a brief three-cartoon resurrection in 1936 by the Van Beuren Studios (&quot;The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg&quot;, &quot;Neptune Nonsense&quot;, and &quot;Bold King Cole&quot;), which are all directed by Disney alumni Burt Gillett, who was suffering from bipolar disorder at the time. Sullivan did most of the marketing for the character in the 1920s. In these Van Beuren shorts, Felix spoke and sang in a high-pitched, childlike voice provided by then-21-year-old Walter Tetley, who was a popular radio actor in the 1930s, 1940s and even 1950s (Julius on &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;, and Leroy on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;), but later best known in the 1960s as the voice of Sherman on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;″s Mister Peabody segments.

====Felix as mascot and pop culture icon====

Given the character&#x27;s unprecedented popularity and the fact that his name was partially derived from the Latin word for &quot;happy&quot;, some rather notable individuals and organizations adopted Felix as a mascot. The first of these was a Los Angeles Chevrolet dealer and friend of Pat Sullivan named Winslow B. Felix, who first opened his showroom in 1921. The three-sided neon sign of Felix Chevrolet, with its giant, smiling images of the character, is today one of LA&#x27;s better-known landmarks, standing watch over both Figueroa Street and the Harbor Freeway. Others who adopted Felix included the 1922 New York Yankees and pilot and actress Ruth Elder, who took a Felix doll with her in an attempt to become the first woman to duplicate Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic crossing to Paris.

This popularity persisted. In the late 1920s, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bombing Squadron Two (VB-2B) adopted a unit insignia consisting of Felix happily carrying a bomb with a burning fuse. They retained the insignia through the 1930s, when they became a fighter squadron under the designations VF-6B and, later, VF-3, whose members Edward O&#x27;Hare and John Thach became famous naval aviators in World War II. After the war, a U.S. Navy fighter squadron currently designated VFA-31 replaced its winged meat-cleaver logo with the same insignia after the original Felix squadron had been disbanded. The carrier-based night-fighter squadron, nicknamed the &quot;Tomcatters&quot;, remained active under various designations continuing to the present day, and Felix still appears on both the squadron&#x27;s cloth jacket patches and aircraft, carrying his bomb with its fuse burning.

Felix&#x27;s iconic walk was acknowleged in stage acts and song. &quot;Felix keeps on walking&quot; was briefly a minor catchphrase of the 1920s, inspired by Felix&#x27;s iconic pacing in circles, head down, hand behind his back, when pondering some situation, as seen in his cartoons (and on the cover of the song&#x27;s sheet music). The 1923 song &quot;Felix Kept On Walking&quot; became popular in London music halls. Other songs included &quot;Here He Is Again! (Being More Adventures Of Felix)&quot; and &quot;Fido Followed Felix&quot;, both in reference to the cat&#x27;s adventures. 

Felix is also the oldest high school mascot in the state of Indiana, chosen in 1926 after a Logansport High School player brought his plush Felix to a basketball game. When the team came from behind and won that night, Felix became the mascot of all the Logansport High School sports teams.

When television was in the experimental stages in 1928, the very first image to ever be seen was a toy Felix the Cat mounted to a revolving phonograph turntable. It remained on screen for hours while engineers used it as a test pattern.

Over a century after his debut on screen in 1919, he still makes occasional appearances in pop culture. The pop punk band The Queers also use Felix as a mascot, often drawn to reflect punk sensibilities and attributes such as scowling, smoking, or playing the guitar. Felix adorns the covers of both the &quot;Surf Goddess&quot; EP and the &quot;Move Back Home&quot; album. Felix also appears in the music video for the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot;. Besides appearing on the covers and liner notes of various albums, the iconic cat also appears in merchandise such as T-shirts and buttons. In an interview with bassist B-Face, he asserts that Lookout! Records is responsible for the use of Felix as a mascot. Felix was planned to make a cameo in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; in a sequence set at Marvin Acme&#x27;s funeral, which was cut for pacing reasons at the storyboard stage. In the final film, his face appears as the comedy and tragedy masks above the entrance of the tunnel that leads to ToonTown. He also appeared as a giant puppet at the 2015 Treefort Music Fest. In 1972, while Stephen Bissette was getting tickets to Fritz the Cat, a confused mother with her two children confused Fritz with Felix, but the ticket venue employee wouldn&#x27;t sell the tickets to the confused mother. Also, in a news article featuring a screening called &quot;Homage to Otto Messmer&quot; in 1984, the news article erroneously refers to the films as &quot;early Fritz the Cat classics&quot;.

For Felix the Cat&#x27;s 100th anniversary, Universal Pictures dubbed November 9 &quot;Felix the Cat Day&quot; and released new merchandise, including a Pop! figure, Skechers brand shoes, clocks, a PEZ dispenser, shirts, bags, pillows, and pomade. Also for the anniversary, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA) released an article detailing Felix the Cat&#x27;s history with frames and clips from early animations.

====Comics====
Pat Sullivan began a syndicated comic strip on August 19, 1923, distributed by King Features Syndicate. In 1927 Messmer took over drawing duties of the strip. (The first &quot;The Felix Annual&quot; from 1924 issued in Great Britain shows the last two stories are not the usual Otto Messmer style, so a difference in Pat Sullivan-drawn cartoons can be noted.)

Messmer himself pursued the Sunday Felix comic strips until their discontinuance in 1943, when he began eleven years of writing and drawing Felix comic books for Dell Comics that were released every other month. Jack Mendelsohn was the ghostwriter of the Felix strip from 1948 to 1952. In 1954, Messmer retired from the Felix daily newspaper strips, and his assistant Joe Oriolo (the creator of Casper the Friendly Ghost) took over. The strip concluded in 1966.

Felix co-starred with Betty Boop in the &quot;Betty Boop and Felix&quot; comic strip (1984–1988).

After 35 years of not being in any comics, Source Point Press announced that Felix the Cat would get a new comic book series, with the permission by DreamWorks Animation to use the character, following a decade of owning the character and using him as a fashion brand. The comic is written by Mark Federali, illustrated by Tracy Yardley, and was due to be released sometime in 2022. Yardley later said in February 2022 that production has been delayed and Source Point Press is no longer publishing the books. Later in September, Yardley said that the comic was not cancelled, and that it will be published by Rocketship Entertainment. A month later, Rocketship announced that artists and writers, inciuding Mike Federali, would be attending New York Comic Con. Federali signed copies of the comic. On November 15, Rocketship announced through its new imprint Bottlerocket, that the comic would release in the spring of 2023, but the release dated switched to Fall of 2023 which was released on November 7, 2023.

===From silent to sound===

With the advent of synchronized sound in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in 1927, Educational Pictures, who distributed the Felix shorts at the time, urged Pat Sullivan to make the leap to &quot;talkie&quot; cartoons, but Sullivan refused. Further disputes led to a break between Educational and Sullivan. Only after competing studios released the first synchronized-sound animated films, such as Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;, Van Beuren&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Time&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, did Sullivan see the possibilities of sound. He managed to secure a contract with First National Pictures in 1928, but for reasons unknown, this did not last, so Sullivan sought out Jacques Kopfstein and Copley Pictures to distribute his new sound Felix cartoons. On October 16, 1929, an advertisement appeared in &quot;Film Daily&quot; with Felix announcing, Jolson-like, &quot;You ain&#x27;t heard nothin&#x27; yet!&quot;

Felix&#x27;s transition to sound was not a smooth one. Sullivan did not carefully prepare for Felix&#x27;s transition to sound and added sound effects into the sound cartoons as a post-animation process. The results were disastrous. More than ever, it seemed as though Disney&#x27;s mouse was drawing audiences away from Sullivan&#x27;s silent star. Not even entries such as the Fleischer-style off-beat &quot;Woos Whoopee&quot; or the Silly Symphony-esque &quot;April Maze&quot; (both 1930) could regain the franchise&#x27;s audience. Kopfstein finally canceled Sullivan&#x27;s contract. Subsequently, he announced plans to start a new studio in California, but such ideas never materialized. Things went from bad to worse when Sullivan&#x27;s wife, Marjorie, died in March 1932. After this, Sullivan completely fell apart. He slumped into an alcoholic depression, his health rapidly declined, and his memory began to fade. He could not even cash checks to Messmer because his signature was reduced to a mere scribble. He died in 1933. Messmer recalled: &quot;He left everything a mess, no books, no nothing. So when he died the place had to close down, at the height of popularity, when everybody, RKO and all of them, for years they tried to get hold of Felix... I didn&#x27;t have that permission [to continue the character] &#x27;cause I didn&#x27;t have legal ownership of it&quot;.

In 1935, Amadee J. Van Beuren of the Van Beuren Studios called Messmer and asked him if he could return Felix to the screen. Van Beuren even stated that Messmer would be provided with a full staff and all of the necessary utilities, but Messmer declined his offer and instead recommended Burt Gillett, a former Sullivan staffer who was now heading the Van Beuren staff. In 1936, Van Beuren obtained approval from Sullivan&#x27;s brother to license Felix to his studio with the intention of producing new shorts both in color and with sound. With Gillett at the helm, now with a heavy Disney influence, he did away with Felix&#x27;s established personality, rendering him a stock talking animal character of the type popular in the day. The new shorts were unsuccessful, and after only three outings Van Beuren discontinued the series, leaving a fourth in the storyboard stages.

===Revival===

In 1953, Official Films purchased the Sullivan–Messmer shorts, added soundtracks to them, and distributed them to the home movie and television markets.

Otto Messmer&#x27;s assistant Joe Oriolo, who had taken over the Felix comic strip, struck a deal with Felix&#x27;s new owner, Pat Sullivan&#x27;s nephew, to begin a new series of Felix cartoons on television. Oriolo went on to star Felix in 260 television cartoons produced by Famous Studios which was renamed to Paramount Cartoon Studios, and distributed by Trans-Lux beginning in 1958. Like the Van Beuren studio before, Oriolo gave Felix a more domesticated and pedestrian personality geared more toward children and introduced now-familiar elements such as Felix&#x27;s Magic Bag of Tricks, a satchel that could assume the shape and characteristics of anything Felix wanted. The show did away with Felix&#x27;s previous supporting cast and introduced many new characters, all of which were performed by voice actor Jack Mercer.

Oriolo&#x27;s plots revolve around the unsuccessful attempts of the antagonists to steal Felix&#x27;s Magic Bag, though in an unusual twist, these antagonists are occasionally depicted as Felix&#x27;s friends as well. The cartoons proved popular, but critics have dismissed them as paling in comparison to the earlier Sullivan–Messmer works, especially since Oriolo aimed the cartoons at children. Limited animation (required due to budgetary restraints) and simplistic storylines did nothing to diminish the series&#x27; popularity.

In 1970, Oriolo gained complete control of the Felix character and Don Oriolo continues to promote the character to this day, even though the rights are now owned by DreamWorks Animation.

In 1975 until 1977, Oriolo presented a live-action series called &quot;Felix the Cat Live&quot;.

In the late 1980s, after his father&#x27;s death, Don Oriolo teamed up with European animators to work on the character&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Felix the Cat: The Movie&quot;. In the film, Felix visits an alternate reality along with the Professor and Poindexter. New World Pictures planned a 1987 Thanksgiving release for U.S. theaters, which did not happen; the movie went direct-to-video in August 1991, which was widely panned upon its release before being completely abandoned in the US during the 21st century. In 1994, Felix appeared on television again, to replace the popular Fido Dido bumpers on CBS, and then one year later in the series &quot;The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat&quot;. &quot;Baby Felix&quot; followed in 2000 for the Japanese market, and also the direct-to-video &quot;Felix the Cat Saves Christmas&quot; released in 2004. Oriolo also brought about a new wave of Felix merchandising, including Wendy&#x27;s Kids Meal toys and a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Felix was voted in 2004 among the 100 Greatest Cartoons in a poll conducted by the British television channel Channel 4, ranking at No. 89.

According to Don Oriolo&#x27;s Felix the Cat blog, as of September 2008 there were plans in development for a new television series. Oriolo&#x27;s biography page also mentions a 52-episode cartoon series then in the works titled &quot;The Felix the Cat Show&quot;, which was slated to use computer graphics. Oriolo has not produced or directed any cartoons or feature films featuring Felix the Cat since the mid-2000s.

==Home video==
DVD releases include &quot;Presenting Felix the Cat&quot; from Bosko Video; &quot;Felix!&quot; from Lumivision; &quot;Felix the Cat: The Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; from Delta Entertainment; and &quot;Before Walt&quot; from Inkwell Images Ink. Some of the TV series cartoons (from 1958 to 1959) were released on DVD by Classic Media. Some of the 1990s series has also been released.

<text>The Troggs (originally called the ) are an English beat music band formed in Andover, Hampshire in May 1964. Their most famous songs include the US chart-topper &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, &quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, all of which sold over 1 million copies and were awarded gold discs. &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is ranked No. 257 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and was an influence on garage rock and punk rock.

==History==
Reg Presley (lead vocals) and Ronnie Bond (drums) were childhood friends and in the early 1960s formed an R&amp;B band in their home town of Andover. In 1964 they were joined by Pete Staples (bass) and Chris Britton (guitar) and became the Troggs. They were signed by Larry Page, manager of the Kinks, in February1966. They recorded on Page&#x27;s Page One Records, and Page also leased them to CBS for the debut single &quot;Lost Girl&quot;. Their most famous hit was the single &quot;Wild Thing&quot; which, with the help of television exposure on &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, reached number 2 in the UK (Reg Presley&#x27;s song &quot;From Home&quot; was the B-side) and number 1 in the United States in July 1966. Its combination of a simple heavy guitar riff and flirtatious lyrics helped it to quickly become a garage rock standard (the recording also contains an ocarina solo). The band&#x27;s success in the U.S. was also limited by the band not touring there until 1968.

They also had a number of other hits, including &quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; (a UK number 1 in July 1966, US number 29), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Control Myself&quot; (a UK number 2 in September 1966; their first UK single release on the Page One label, POF 001; this was also their second and final dual-label release in the US, with Fontana retaining the rights to all subsequent releases), &quot;Any Way That You Want Me&quot; (UK number 8 in December 1966), all at Olympic Studios, &quot;Give It to Me&quot; (UK No.12 1967), &quot;Night of the Long Grass&quot; (UK number 17 in May 1967), &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; (UK number 5 in November 1967 and US number 7 in May 1968) plus &quot;Hi Hi Hazel&quot; (UK No.42, 1967). The band&#x27;s popularity completely waned the following year. Former Plastic Penny bassist Tony Murray replaced Pete Staples in 1969. Richard Moore filled in for Britton on their 1972–1973 tour. In 1974, after a spell on Pye Records, in an attempt to re-create their 1960s successes, the Troggs re-united with Larry Page, now running Penny Farthing Records. The resulting cover version of the Beach Boys hit &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; failed to chart. A reggae version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; also failed. Richard Moore and Colin Fletcher substituted for Britton, who temporarily quit music to manage a night club in Spain, for the recording of &quot;The Troggs Tapes&quot; album released in 1976. The band found a sympathetic ear at French label New Rose in the 1980s, releasing the &quot;Black Bottom&quot; LP (1982) and &quot;AU&quot; (1990). Original drummer Ronnie Bond left in 1988.

In 1991, they recorded &quot;Athens Andover&quot;, an 11-song collaboration between themselves and three members of R.E.M. It was recorded in the American band&#x27;s hometown of Athens, Georgia, and was released in March 1992. The band attempted to capitalise on this new exposure with two collaborations on new versions of &quot;Wild Thing&quot;. A 1992 recording with actor Oliver Reed and snooker player Alex Higgins failed to chart, but another version the following year featuring Wolf from the TV show &quot;Gladiators&quot; reached number 69 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1994, Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s cover of &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; was No. 1 in the UK for 15 weeks, resulting in substantial royalties for Presley.

Guitarist Dave Wright (born 21 January 1944, Winchester) died at Royal Hampshire County Hospital on 10 October 2008.

Ronnie Bond died on 13 November 1992. In January 2012, Reg Presley retired after being diagnosed with lung cancer. The band carried on with new lead singer Chris Allen (born 3 October 1952, Rossendale), who was hired in June 2012. Presley died on 4 February 2013.

Guitarist Richard Moore (born 3 June 1949, Canada) died in San Francisco on 30 April 2016.

The last original member, Chris Britton, left the band in 2017 and was replaced by John W. Doyle. Britton now makes rare guest appearances. Dave Maggs (born 22 September 1950), drummer for over thirty years, left in 2018.

Bass guitarist and backing vocalist Pete Lucas retired from the band in 2022, after almost 40 years in the group. Soon after, he was diagnosed with cancer and died on 16 December 2023, his 73rd birthday. Since his retirement, the band didn&#x27;t hire an official bassist for two years, but Fortunes bassist Eddie Mooney sometimes appears on stage, but isn&#x27;t an official member, when Mooney didn&#x27;t attend a gig, Chris Allen played bass. Dave Peters was added as a full time bassist in December 2024.

The current Troggs lineup is Chris Allen (lead vocals), Martin Shorrock (drums), Stu Clark (guitar) and Dave Peters (bass).

==Legacy and influence==
The Troggs are widely seen as a highly influential band whose sound was an inspiration for garage rock and punk rock. Influential American critic Lester Bangs &quot;called the band the progenitors of punk&quot;, according to NPR. For example, the Troggs influenced artists such as Iggy Pop, and the early version of British pop-punk pioneers Buzzcocks featured &quot;I Can&#x27;t Control Myself&quot; in their live repertoire. The Ramones are also among the punk bands who cited the Troggs as an influence. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Control Myself&quot; is perhaps the most enduring favourite of critics; it continues to be championed for its originality and lasting influence by radio hosts such as &quot;Little&quot; Steven Van Zandt.

A specially tailored version of &quot;Give It to Me&quot; featured in the &quot;Sadie&#x27;s Daydream&quot; sequence of Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Blowup&quot;. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Control Myself&quot; appears at the climax of &quot;The Little Chaos&quot;, the 1967 short film by German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder and in the &quot;1967&quot; episode of the 1996 British television serial &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;.

&quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; is featured uncut in a school dance scene from the 1991 Nicole Kidman/Noah Taylor movie &quot;Flirting&quot;. It also is featured in &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;The Good Night&quot; and &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;. &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is prominent in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Something Wild&quot;. A modified version of &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), performed by actor Bill Nighy. The Troggs was the name of the high school gang in the movie &quot;Bang Bang, You&#x27;re Dead&quot; that persuade the main character to join them in attacking their high school. The point-and-click adventure game &quot;Hopkins FBI&quot; features &quot;I Can&#x27;t Control Myself&quot; and &quot;Lost Girl&quot;. Trogg is the name of one of Bane&#x27;s three henchmen in Dennis O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s &quot;Batman: Knightfall&quot; comic arc. The other henchmen are Bird and Zombie, named after two other popular 1960s rock bands: the Byrds and the Zombies.

The Jimi Hendrix Experience famously covered &quot;Wild Thing&quot; during their appearance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, introducing it as the British/American joint &quot;national anthem&quot;, and climaxing with Hendrix burning his guitar. MC5 covered &quot;I Want You&quot; at their live shows and recorded the song for the album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, although they renamed it &quot;I Want You Right Now&quot;. In 1990, the first hit for (and first single by) the band Spiritualized was a cover of &quot;Anyway That You Want Me&quot;. This cover later was used in the movie &quot;Me and You and Everyone We Know&quot;. In 1991, &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; was covered by R.E.M. during live performances and was released later that year as a B-side on their &quot;Radio Song&quot; single. They also performed an acoustic version of the song on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. In 1994, Scottish band Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s version of &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; spent 15 weeks at number one in the UK after its inclusion in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. The authorship royalties enabled Reg Presley&#x27;s 1990s research and publication on extraterrestrials and other paranormal phenomena. In 2012, Norwegian band Ulver covered the song &quot;66-5-4-3-2-1&quot; for their covers album &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;. &quot;Wild Thing&quot; was covered by an ensemble featuring Queen guitarist Brian May to open the Wildlife Rocks&#x27; event at Guildford Cathedral in May 2014.

An in-studio tape of Reg Presley&#x27;s running commentary on a recording session, filled with in-fighting and swearing (known as &quot;The Troggs Tapes&quot;), was widely circulated in the music underground, and was included in the &quot;Archaeology&quot; box set, as well as the compilation album, &quot;The Rhino Brothers Present the World&#x27;s Worst Records&quot;. The group infighting is believed to be the inspiration for a scene in the comedy film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, where the band members are arguing. Some of this dialogue was sampled by the California punk band the Dwarves on their recording of a cover version of the Troggs song &quot;Strange Movies&quot;.

<text>The English fifty shilling coin, worth 50/-, was only ever minted once, in the year 1656. It was a milled gold coin weighing and with a diameter of . Only eleven examples are known to survive. One extremely fine specimen was recorded to have been sold for £15,250 in May 1989.

A lustrous example was sold in London in January 2021 for £471,200 ($643,597 U.S.) including the 24 percent buyer’s commission, setting a new record price for a Cromwellian coin.

The obverse of the coin depicts Oliver Cromwell as a Roman Emperor, with the inscription — &quot;Oliver, by the grace of God, of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, Ireland, etc. Protector&quot;. The reverse depicts a crowned shield bearing the Commonwealth arms, with the inscription — &quot;Peace is sought through war&quot;, and the date 1656, while there is also an edge inscription — &quot;A protector of the letters, the letters are a garland and a safeguard to the coinage&quot;.

<text>The Broad was an English coin worth 20 shillings (20/-) issued by the Commonwealth of England in 1656. It was a milled gold coin weighing 9.0–9.1 grams, with a diameter of 29 or 30 millimetres, designed by Thomas Simon (also called Symonds).

The obverse of the coin depicts the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell as a laureated Roman emperor, with the Latin inscription [Olivarius Dei Gratia Res Publicae Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae etc. Protector] — &quot;Oliver, by the Grace of God, of the Republic of England, Scotland, Ireland etc., Protector&quot;, while the reverse shows a crowned shield depicting the arms of the Commonwealth with the inscription -- &quot;Peace is sought through war&quot;.

The current value of the coin in &quot;very fine&quot; to &quot;extremely fine&quot; condition is £27,000 to £54,000.

A piedfort version of the coin with an edge inscription is known as a Fifty shilling piece. This is extremely rare, and there are very few examples as it is probably a pattern.

<text>Nimrod (stylized as nimrod.) is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on October 14, 1997, by Reprise Records. The band began work on the album in the wake of the cancellation of a European tour after the release of their previous album, &quot;Insomniac&quot;. Recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, the album was written with the intent of creating a set of standalone songs as opposed to a cohesive album. Retrospectively, &quot;Nimrod&quot; is noted for its musical diversity and experimentation, containing elements of folk, hardcore, surf rock, and ska. Lyrical themes discussed include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.

The album peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; U.S. charts and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record was also certified triple platinum in Australia and double platinum in Canada. Upon release, &quot;Nimrod&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the singer Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s songwriting. The album yielded the acoustic single &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot;, which appeared in numerous popular culture events, including the penultimate episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. To promote the album, Green Day embarked on an extensive touring schedule. The album was also reissued on vinyl on June 16, 2009, as well as for anniversary and deluxe edition releases in 2012, 2017, and 2023. The songs &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;, &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot;, and &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; are featured in the video game &quot;Green Day: Rock Band&quot;.

==Background==
In 1995, Green Day released &quot;Insomniac&quot;, which did not perform as well commercially as the band&#x27;s breakthrough major-label debut &quot;Dookie&quot;. Speaking of &quot;Insomniac&quot;, the singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, &quot;It did a lot better than I thought it was going to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn&#x27;t going to sell as much as &quot;Dookie&quot;.&quot; The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote &quot;Insomniac&quot; in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, &quot;We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. It was beginning to be not fun anymore.&quot;

Green Day also became homesick because touring forced the members to leave behind their families. The band eventually decided to cancel the late 1996 European leg of the &quot;Insomniac&quot; tour to take time off to spend at home. During this time, the band continued to write, and eventually completed over three dozen new songs by the beginning of 1997. Although the group&#x27;s last effort with the producer Rob Cavallo was considered a disappointment, the band did not contemplate choosing anyone else to work with on &quot;Nimrod&quot;, because the members viewed Cavallo as a &quot;mentor&quot;.

==Recording and production==

The album was recorded at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and the band stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. &quot;Nimrod&quot; took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending &quot;a little too much time&quot; playing pool and foosball during the sessions. The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to two in the morning every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. The bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, &quot;One night one of us was walking down the halls knocking on people&#x27;s doors while naked.&quot; Another incident involved the drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. Armstrong noted, &quot;There was a lot of glass. You have to live that arrogant lifestyle every now and then.&quot; To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father, Pat Magnarella, to supervise and manage the group.

While working on &quot;Nimrod&quot;, Green Day explained to Cavallo their desire to create a more experimental album because the band had grown tired of its traditional three chord song structure. Armstrong drew inspiration from the Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot;, and referred to &quot;Nimrod&quot; as &quot;the record I&#x27;ve wanted to make since the band started.&quot; The album was intended to break the constraints of typical punk rock music. To preserve the quality of his songwriting, Armstrong began by writing each song on an acoustic guitar, to which the rest of the band would later add heavier instrumentation and faster tempos. Green Day recorded around 30 songs for &quot;Nimrod&quot; and picked 18 of them for the record. Dirnt explained that the recording was much more loosely structured than previous albums, and that creating songs was the focus as opposed to making a cohesive record. He observed, &quot;We&#x27;ve always screwed around with different types of music during our jams, but we&#x27;d say, &#x27;OK let&#x27;s stop and get back to the album.&#x27; This time we just let them come up.&quot;

The Reprise Records president Howie Klein spent a lot of time in the studio with the band during recording, and recalled that, &quot;What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn&#x27;t just more of the same. There was so much growth in the band.&quot; The musical maturation displayed on &quot;Nimrod&quot; was partially inspired by Bikini Kill&#x27;s &quot;Reject All American&quot; (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance &quot;rough punk rock songs&quot; and &quot;delicate pretty songs&quot;. Armstrong wrote &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; in 1993 and showed the song to his bandmates during the &quot;Dookie&quot; recording sessions. During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on &quot;Dookie&quot;, and Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording. When the time came to record &quot;Nimrod&quot;, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took &quot;like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most.&quot; Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings &quot;I knew we had done the right thing. I knew it was a hit the second I heard it.&quot;

In addition to the strings on &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot;, the music of &quot;Nimrod&quot; contains a variety of other instruments that were not featured on previous Green Day albums. &quot;Walking Alone&quot; features Armstrong playing the harmonica, despite the fact that he &quot;did not know how to play it at all&quot;. &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot; opens with a Middle Eastern-inspired violin performed by Petra Haden of That Dog. The band invited Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley of No Doubt&#x27;s horn section to play on the ska-influenced &quot;King for a Day&quot;.

==Composition==
===Music===

&quot;Nimrod&quot; is more musically diverse than previous Green Day albums. Armstrong noted that with the album, Green Day went down &quot;different avenues,&quot; adding: &quot;Each song has its own character and identity so we wanted to be able to bring that out as much as possible.&quot; &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot; has been considered a song that &quot;eases the transition&quot; from &quot;Insomniac&quot; to &quot;Nimrod&quot;. Sandy Masuo of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; likened &quot;Worry Rock&quot; to the music of Elvis Costello. &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; has been referred to as a &quot;pop-punk campfire singalong ballad&quot;. After opening with Haden&#x27;s violin solo, &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot; evolves into a bass-driven rock and roll song with a &quot;Stray Cats vibe&quot;. Cool referred to &quot;Take Back&quot; (considered upfront hardcore punk, both musically and vocally) and &quot;Platypus (I Hate You)&quot; as &quot;some of the most punk songs we&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. &quot;Last Ride In&quot; is a surf rock-influenced instrumental, and &quot;King for a Day&quot; is a song featuring a horn section. Armstrong compared the song to the Oi! genre, and noted, &quot;It would be funny for a bunch of macho fraternity guys to be singing along and, little do they know, the song&#x27;s about being in drag.&quot; The &quot;chiming&quot; guitar riffs of &quot;Redundant&quot; have been compared to those of the Byrds. Overall, &quot;Nimrod&quot; is considered a punk rock, pop-punk, and alternative rock album.

===Lyrics===
Lyrically, &quot;Nimrod&quot; touches upon more reflective themes not present on earlier Green Day albums. Much of the album illustrates Armstrong&#x27;s sentiments on growing up and his role as a husband and father. &quot;The Grouch&quot; centers on Armstrong&#x27;s fears of &quot;wasting away, getting fat, becoming impotent, and losing his ideals.&quot; On &quot;Walking Alone&quot;, he reflects on old friends from his childhood, and notes that he is &quot;too drunk to figure out they&#x27;re fading away.&quot; Armstrong discusses the struggle to stay sober on &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot;. &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; was inspired by Armstrong&#x27;s failed relationship with a woman that ended when she joined the Peace Corps in 1993. The same woman is also the subject of &quot;She&quot; from &quot;Dookie&quot;, &quot;Whatsername&quot; from &quot;American Idiot&quot; (2004) and &quot;Amanda&quot; from &quot;¡Tré!&quot;. &quot;Redundant&quot; focuses on Armstrong&#x27;s relationship with his wife and how &quot;things sometime get repetitive and you have to make an effort to recapture the early spontaneity&quot;, whilst &quot;Worry Rock&quot; deals with the &quot;vicious fights&quot; between them.

However, other songs contain subject matter and themes more typical of Green Day&#x27;s previous work. Armstrong wrote &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot; about the band&#x27;s interactions with the band&#x27;s lawyers and managers and how &quot;everybody thinks they know what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; &quot;Jinx&quot; contains self-deprecating lyrics characteristic of many of the band&#x27;s songs, while &quot;Prosthetic Head&quot; has been referred to as a &quot;typical ticked-off kiss-off&quot;. Armstrong described &quot;Platypus (I Hate You)&quot; as &quot;a vicious song about wanting to strangle someone I have deep animosity for, and the pleasure of watching this person die.&quot; Likewise, &quot;Take Back&quot; is about &quot;revenge and hurting someone when they least expect it.&quot; &quot;King for a Day&quot; tells the story of a cross-dresser. &quot;Uptight&quot; is about depression, and contains repeated mentions of suicide; Armstrong explained, &quot;I think the word &#x27;suicide&#x27; just sounded really good. And the line, &#x27;I&#x27;m a son of a gun&#x27;. It made sense, but I can&#x27;t really explain why it made sense. It just sort of does.&quot; &quot;Reject&quot;, which takes it name from the Bikini Kill song &quot;Reject All American&quot;, addresses questions towards Green Day&#x27;s credibility within the punk rock scene, &quot;and how we&#x27;ve moved on and are telling everyone who worries about such shit to fuck off.&quot;

==Album title and artwork==
The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Nimrod&quot;, is the name of a character from the Bible that was a hunter. In American English, it became a term for a stupid or dimwitted person as the usage is often said to have been popularized by the Looney Tunes cartoon character Bugs Bunny sarcastically referring to the hunter Elmer Fudd as &quot;nimrod&quot;. After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician&#x27;s poster had his face removed. He felt the image was &quot;striking&quot; and seemed to fit the band by featuring &quot;a typical middle-age male, corporate politician American kind of guy, and someone had completely taken his identity away through vandalism.&quot; Following that line of thought, Bilheimer took an encyclopedia picture of men in suits and ties and put colored circles reading &quot;nimrod.&quot; on their faces, &quot;using that to take away the people&#x27;s identity&quot;. The back cover had the same being done to a yearbook Bilheimer found in a Los Angeles bookstore, &quot;from the era of the &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; 1950s idyllic America&quot;, with the label &quot;break[ing] down that image of people’s perceptions of a happy polite idyllic society.&quot; The booklet features the lyrics presented as if they were a secret document that had been redacted with black ink, &quot;so they seemed like they were part of something else&quot;.

Two versions of the cover were made: one version with the circles yellow and one with the circles orange (used for the Australian edition).

The portraits covered on the album cover are Frederick Banting and Charles Best, two American-Canadian medical scientists most well known for co-discovering insulin.

==Release and promotion==

The &quot;Nimrod&quot; promotional tour began that fall and opened with a performance and in-store record signing on November 11, 1997, at a Tower Records in Manhattan. The band was upset upon reading reviews that suggested the band had lost its punk edge, and despite the several security staff present both inside and outside of the building, started a riot during its scheduled eight-song set at the store. Armstrong then wrote the words &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;nimrod&quot; in black spray paint on the storefront windows, and proceeded to moon the audience of approximately 1,400 people. After the riot settled down, Cool threw his bass drum into the crowd while Armstrong attempted the same with a monitor, which was wrestled away from him by a store manager. No charges were filed and no injuries were reported, but the store was closed for the day to repair damages caused.

On the tour in promotion of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists to play for the new songs. Armstrong commented, &quot;Right now we&#x27;re refraining from pulling out a lot of that &#x27;Nimrod&#x27; stuff. We want to make things small. We don&#x27;t want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A lot of people want to hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us.&quot; The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to &quot;go to a place like the Fillmore and the Warfield and know it&#x27;s actually going to sell out&quot; instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The &quot;Nimrod&quot; tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, &quot;I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it&#x27;s not just about the singer. It&#x27;s not just about the band.&quot;

While performing at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, the Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and &quot;bear-hugged&quot; Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar was taken away by security. After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. Salazar and the band&#x27;s management soon released a statement: &quot;I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply had too much to drink and made a very bad decision. If I had been in Mike&#x27;s place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly.&quot;

&quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; appeared in numerous events of popular culture, including a scene involving the death of a cancer patient on the medical drama &quot;ER,&quot; the series finale of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in 1998, and an X-Men blooper reel during the credits sequence of the 2024 MCU film Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.

=== 25th Anniversary Edition ===
On October 13, 2022, the band announced they would be releasing an expanded version of &quot;Nimrod&quot; for its 25th anniversary, and released a demo of the song &quot;You Irritate Me&quot;, which was cut from the original release. The expanded version includes over 30 bonus tracks on 2 discs, including other demos and live versions of some of their singles, and also includes remastered versions of the original album&#x27;s songs. Prior to the January 27, 2023, release, the band also released a second demo; a cover of Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Alison&quot; on January 13, 2023. Upon release of the anniversary edition, many critics and fans noted that the demo &quot;Black Eyeliner&quot; was repurposed by Armstrong for two different songs later in his career. The pre-chorus was used for &quot;Church on Sunday&quot; on Green Day&#x27;s next album, &quot;Warning&quot;, while the chord progression and lyrical construction were used for &quot;Kill Your Friends&quot;, a song by Armstrong&#x27;s 2018 side project, the Longshot.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

The album received generally positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave &quot;Nimrod&quot; three and a half stars out of five, calling it an &quot;invigorating, if occasionally frustrating listen&quot;, and although he praised Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies&quot;, he noted that &quot;the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed.&quot; Greg Kot from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; enjoyed the album&#x27;s melodic nature as well as the &quot;measure of sincerity&quot; present in Armstrong&#x27;s vocals. Kot appreciated the return of the band&#x27;s &quot;juvenile sense of humor&quot; that he felt was lacking on &quot;Insomniac&quot;, and praised the musical diversity on the record, remarking, &quot;This music is a long way from Green Day&#x27;s apprenticeship at the Gilman Street punk clubs, in Berkeley, Calif. But now that the band has seen the world, it&#x27;s only fitting that Green Day should finally make an album that sounds as if it has.&quot;

A group of editors writing for &quot;People&quot; also praised the record&#x27;s &quot;fresh and original&quot; melodies and &quot;quick-tempoed cool&quot;, adding, &quot;Kudos to Green Day, young punk&#x27;s reigning purists, for sticking with what they know best.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Sandy Masuo enjoyed the &quot;mature songwriting that really makes this album tick&quot;, noting that &quot;Naturally, a couple of thrash &#x27;n&#x27; bash hard-core paeans are included, but they&#x27;re surrounded by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and grounded in a pop aesthetic that evokes a gaggle of great tunesmiths.&quot; Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;If Green Day still has a loyal following, its fans are bound to find something to like on &quot;Nimrod&quot;; for all the attempts at diversity, the record is packed with mile-wide hooks and sing-along anthems.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Nimrod&quot; debuted at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 81,000 copies in its first week of release, and remained on the chart for 70 weeks. On March 16, 2000, &quot;Nimrod&quot; was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over two million copies. In Canada, the album peaked at number four, remaining on the chart for four weeks. On July 6, 1998, the record was certified double platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 200,000 copies. In Australia, the album debuted at number twelve and later peaked at number three on the country&#x27;s chart. The record was later certified triple platinum in Australia.

<doc id="197906" wikidata="Q213694" url="?curid=197906" title="Warning (Green Day album)">
<text>Warning is the sixth studio album by the American rock band Green Day, released on October 3, 2000, by Reprise Records. Building upon its predecessor &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1997), it eschewed the band&#x27;s trademark punk rock sound and incorporated acoustic elements and pop and folk styles. Lyrically, the album contains more optimistic and inspirational themes in comparison to the band&#x27;s earlier releases. &quot;Warning&quot; was also Green Day&#x27;s first album since &quot;Kerplunk&quot; (1991) that was not produced by Rob Cavallo, although he did have a hand in its production and was credited as executive producer.

Despite mixed criticism towards the band&#x27;s stylistic change, the album received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s songwriting. Although it peaked at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Warning&quot; represented the lowest commercial slump in Green Day&#x27;s career, being their first album since signing to a major label not to achieve multi-platinum status. However, the album being leaked onto Napster three weeks before its release may have been a contributing factor to its low sales. The album has nonetheless been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over 1.2 million copies as of 2012. Worldwide it has sold 3.5 million copies.

==Background==
After taking a break from touring in promotion of the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Insomniac&quot; (1995), Green Day recorded the more experimental &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1997). The record, which delved into a wider variety of genres including punk, folk, power pop, hardcore punk, ska, and surf, featured the unprecedented acoustic hit &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot;. Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong recalled that the song&#x27;s stylistic departure from the group&#x27;s earlier work made him anxious about the song&#x27;s release: &quot;I was scared for that song to come out...because it was such a vulnerable song, to put that song out and it was like which way will it end up going? It was really exciting and it kind of sparked more in us as songwriters to expand on that.&quot;

The band embarked on the &quot;Nimrod&quot; promotional tour, which largely featured more intimate shows with audiences of 1,500 to 3,000 people. By the end of the tour, the band noted that its audience had evolved. 924 Gilman Street, the punk club in the band&#x27;s hometown that had once banned Green Day after the group signed with a major label, booked bassist Mike Dirnt&#x27;s side project the Frustrators for a show. Dirnt described the experience as &quot;a wonderful piece of closure&quot;. Punk rock music was no longer popular in the mainstream because nu metal acts such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock were experiencing success. According to Studio 880 owner John Lucasey, the band was &quot;definitely at a very big crossroads.&quot;

==Recording==

For &quot;Warning&quot;, Green Day initially opted to work with a producer other than Rob Cavallo, who had handled the production of the band&#x27;s previous three albums. The group selected Scott Litt, who had previously worked with Nirvana and R.E.M. However, the band had disagreements with Litt over the album&#x27;s musical direction; vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong recalled that &quot;It just didn&#x27;t work out. He was really cool, but for that particular project, it just wasn&#x27;t the right chemistry.&quot; The group subsequently brought Cavallo back in, but this time the band handled most of the production duties, with Cavallo instead serving as &quot;executive producer&quot;. During the album&#x27;s writing and early recording sessions, Armstrong repeatedly listened to Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1965 record &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, which had a major influence over both &quot;Warning&quot;&#x27;s musical experimentation and socially conscious lyrics.

The band began work on the album two years before entering the studio to record on April 1, 2000. During this period, the group members met five days a week to write new songs and rehearse old ones, with Tre Cool observing, &quot;We&#x27;ve been practicing and writing songs and playing them and playing them and writing new songs and playing them and playing them... People think we&#x27;re off in Hawaii kicking back and shit, but we&#x27;re in Oakland playing our jams.&quot; The album was recorded at Studio 880 in Oakland. Cool noted of the band&#x27;s work ethic in the studio, &quot;We&#x27;re not really sprinting. We&#x27;re working at the same pace, but it&#x27;s a pretty fast pace for recording. We&#x27;re faster than every other band, pretty much. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told.&quot; With the record, the band aimed to construct a solid list of tracks where &quot;each song could be its own album&quot;. The group also made sure to make each song &quot;well thought out and well placed&quot; with regard to the album&#x27;s tracklisting.

==Music and lyrics==

With &quot;Warning&quot;, the band experimented with more acoustic guitars, and strove for a &quot;not sappy acoustic... more aggressive, percussive acoustic&quot; sound. Cool and bassist Mike Dirnt also emphasized &quot;deeper&quot; grooves on the record. The title track, a &quot;densely produced blast of layered vocals [and] strummed acoustic guitars&quot;, features a &quot;circling bass riff&quot; similar to that of &quot;Picture Book&quot; by the Kinks. &quot;Waiting&quot;, which has been categorized as a &quot;retro-pop lament&quot;, is based on the riff from Petula Clark&#x27;s 1964 song &quot;Downtown&quot;. Its melody has also been stylistically compared to the Mamas &amp; the Papas and Kiss. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;Misery&quot; is &quot;probably Billie Joe&#x27;s idea of a Brecht-Weill pop operetta.&quot; It features &quot;mariachi brass&quot; instrumentation, as well as strings, accordions, and acoustic guitar. The song&#x27;s five-minute length has been called &quot;an epic by Green Day standards&quot;. The use of a harmonica on &quot;Hold On&quot; has been compared to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better.&quot; &quot;Macy&#x27;s Day Parade&quot; contains elements of folk and pop.

The album features more positive and uplifting lyrics in comparison with Green Day&#x27;s earlier work. Cool noted that, &quot;It&#x27;s got the sarcasm, it&#x27;s got the snottiness, but it&#x27;s got a little light at the end of the tunnel.&quot; &quot;Warning&quot; also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as &quot;Minority&quot;. This was inspired by Armstrong&#x27;s fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that &quot;someone really conservative&quot; would take office. He recalled, &quot;We&#x27;ve always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what&#x27;s going on...that&#x27;s one reason why I was really taking my time writing songs to really [make an impact]. Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction.&quot; According to Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, the lyrics of &quot;Minority&quot; serve as &quot;a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day&#x27;s early work&quot;. &quot;Misery&quot; tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a &quot;lot lizard&quot;, a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. &quot;Blood, Sex and Booze&quot; explores the subject of sadomasochism. &quot;Church On Sunday&quot; features lyrics in its pre-chorus that were originally written for the &quot;Nimrod&quot; demo &quot;Black Eyeliner,&quot; which didn&#x27;t see an official release until 2023.

According to some publications, such as &quot;LA Times&quot;, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;, &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;, and &quot;Music Box Magazine&quot; Green Day departs from their punk rock sound with this album. Despite this, some other publications label the album as punk rock. In addition, the album has also been cited as pop-punk, power pop, folk punk, pop rock, and alternative rock.

==Release==
===Commercial performance===
&quot;Warning&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, remaining on the chart for 25 weeks and it sold 156,000 copies on its first week according to Billboard. On December 1, 2000, the record was certified gold by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of over 500,000 copies. In Canada, the record reached the number two position and stayed on the chart for five weeks. On August 1, 2001, the album was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 100,000 units. &quot;Warning&quot; also reached the top ten in multiple countries outside of North America, including Australia, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The album was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of over 70,000 copies. As of December 20, 2012, &quot;Warning&quot; has sold 1.2 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Warning&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 19 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker perceived a maturity in the album&#x27;s lyrical content and called its music &quot;as peppy as any Green Day have recorded&quot;. Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters commended Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s lyrics and noted the band for embracing &quot;the pop bent that has always been a part of their sound&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Stephen Thompson stated &quot;Green Day has never made a record so slick and musically mature&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Natalie Nichols wrote that the album &quot;reveal[s] them shaking off the transitional aspects of 1997&#x27;s ″&quot;Nimrod&quot;″ to craft a more coherent, less aggressive but still rebellious collection that also draws on the even older pop traditions of Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Who&quot;. &quot;Metal&quot; Mike Saunders of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; viewed &quot;Warning&quot; as the band&#x27;s best work and compared its music to that of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965). In his consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A− rating, indicating &quot;the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction. Anyone open to its aesthetic will enjoy more than half its tracks&quot;. Christgau noted &quot;professionalism, craft, artistic growth&quot; rather than maturity in Armstrong&#x27;s songwriting and elaborated on his change in musical direction, stating:

By contrast, &quot;NME&quot;″s Andy Capper was ambivalent towards the band&#x27;s &quot;less electric, more organic sound&quot; and stated &quot;Older. More Mature. ″&quot;Warning&quot;″ is the sound of a band losing its way&quot;. Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Armstrong &quot;can&#x27;t muster the same excitement for his more mature themes&quot; and stated &quot;Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core&#x27;s biggest-selling band?&quot;. Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic gave it three out of five stars and commented that it &quot;consists of instant classics like Minority and Macy&#x27;s Day Parade, but it also is filled with garbage songs as well&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; writer Jesse Berrett stated &quot;these maturity moves buoy muzzy be-yourselfism ... Nor does everything in the stylistic grab bag fit&quot;, but concluded by complimenting Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;earnestly good-hearted&quot; lyrics and wrote that &quot;this album is after... evidence that even the snottiest deserve grace and the chance to age into warmth&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; gave the album three out of five stars and described it as &quot;Hugely likeable, terribly noisy and cute, as well as being jammed with proper pop songs&quot;. Neal Weiss of Yahoo! Music called the album &quot;crafty pop-rock&quot; and stated &quot;Some might wish Green Day never decided to grow up like this, but others might consider it a starting point to take the band seriously&quot;. Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani perceived elements of folk and &quot;pop sensibilities&quot;, writing that the album &quot;displays just how well Green Day can construct pop songs&quot;.

===Retrospect===
Writing in 2009 with regard to &quot;Warning&quot;&#x27;s lackluster commercial performance, James Montgomery of MTV News called the record &quot;unjustly overlooked&quot; and applauded Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;super strong&quot; songwriting on the album. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Nick Catucci gave the album four out of five stars and wrote that the band &quot;fully focus on the textures that have always differentiated their sturdy grooves and simple melodies&quot;. Catucci called the songs &quot;speedy, neatly packaged reinterpretations of pop-rock history, from the Beatles to Creedence Clearwater Revival to the Ramones themselves&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it &quot;gleeful, unabashed fun&quot; and complimented Green Day for &quot;embracing their fondness for pop and making the best damn album they&#x27;d ever made&quot;. Erlewine expressed that the band displays &quot;melodic ingenuity and imaginative arrangements&quot; and elaborated on its musical significance, stating &quot;&quot;Warning&quot; may not be an innovative record per se, but it&#x27;s tremendously satisfying; it finds the band at a peak of songcraft and performance, doing it all without a trace of self-consciousness. It&#x27;s the first great pure pop album of the new millennium&quot;. Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine cited it as &quot;the most influential album on the British pop landscape since 1996 (&quot;Spice&quot;, naturally)&quot;, noting it as a significant influence on &quot;the two biggest bands in the UK at the moment, and indeed for the past few years, Busted and McFly&quot;. Passantino called &quot;Warning&quot; &quot;a great album&quot; and viewed that Green Day &quot;seemed to be bored with their genre-medium, but simultaneously knowledgeable that any attempt to boundary-hop will end with them falling on their face&quot;.

==Promotion==

While Green Day was nearing completion of &quot;Warning&quot;, the band announced it would be performing on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour during the summer before the album&#x27;s October release. Although the group had been invited to perform on the tour before, they were unable to because of scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day&#x27;s new stylistic change displayed on &quot;Warning&quot;, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong&#x27;s side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add &quot;more power&quot; to the group&#x27;s sound; White observed that &quot;Even I was like, &#x27;Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?&#x27;&quot;. Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, &quot;They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn&#x27;t by far. Green Day weren&#x27;t super popular at that time. I think they did the Warped tour because they &quot;wanted&quot; to get popular again.&quot; He also went on to call &quot;Warning&quot; &quot;probably their worst album, I think. It&#x27;s what happens, the ups and downs.&quot; However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; outsold &quot;Warning&quot;, opined that &quot;I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized them so much that it didn&#x27;t matter. We thought &quot;Warning&quot; was one of their best records.&quot;

In January 2001, Colin Merry of the English rock band Other Garden filed a breach of copyright lawsuit against Green Day, claiming that the album&#x27;s title track is a &quot;reworked&quot; version of his band&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Never Got the Chance&quot;. Merry noted that despite both songs&#x27; similarity to the riff of &quot;Picture Book&quot; by the Kinks, the similarity between &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Never Got the Chance&quot; was more &quot;striking&quot;. Green Day denied the accusations, and although Merry requested to halt all royalties from &quot;Warning&quot;, the lawsuit was later dropped.

Green Day also co-headlined a &quot;shared bill&quot; with fellow Californian pop-punk band Blink-182 on the Pop Disaster Tour from April to June 2002. The two bands traded off headlining positions throughout the tour, because Blink-182 was experiencing higher record sales at the time, while Green Day had experienced mainstream success for a longer period of time. Armstrong explained Green Day&#x27;s desire to perform on the tour by stating, &quot;We really wanted to be part of an event. We figured putting the two biggest pop punk bands on the planet together was definitely going to be an event.&quot; In his book &quot;Nobody Likes You: Inside the Turbulent Life, Times and Music of Green Day&quot;, author Marc Spitz likened Blink-182 headlining a tour with Green Day to &quot;Frank Sinatra, Jr. headlining over Frank Sinatra.&quot;

<doc id="197909" wikidata="Q1349854" url="?curid=197909" title="Shenanigans (album)">
<text>Shenanigans is the second compilation album by American rock band Green Day. It was released on July 2, 2002, by Reprise Records. The album contains B-sides, rarities, covers, and the previously unreleased track &quot;Ha Ha You&#x27;re Dead&quot;. &quot;Espionage&quot;, a spy-themed instrumental, was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;, their cover of the Kinks song of the same name, was featured on the soundtrack for the 1997 film &quot;Private Parts&quot;.

&quot;Shenanigans&quot; peaked at number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 upon its release and has sold 280,000 units as of September 2010. Even though the original cover does not feature a title, several retailers fixed confusion over it by designing a sticker which was plastered on the front. In a September 2009 interview by &quot;Fuse on Demand&quot;, when asked who designed the cover for the group&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot; (2009), Billie Joe Armstrong said that Chris Bilheimer designed it as well as the last four album covers.

The album was supposed to include a track titled &quot;D.U.I.&quot; (written and sung by Tré Cool), but was removed. It was only available on unmastered copies of the album.

<doc id="197913" wikidata="Q8564001" url="?curid=197913" title="Florin (English coin)">
<text>The English florin, sometimes known as the double leopard, was an attempt in 1344 by Edward III to produce gold coinage suitable for use in Europe as well as in England. It was authorised on 27 January 1344, and struck from 108 grains (6.99829 grams) of nominal pure (&#x27;fine&#x27;) gold and had a value of six shillings (equivalent to 30 modern pence).

The continental florin, based on a French coin and ultimately on coins issued in Florence in 1252, was a standard coin (3.50 g fine gold) widely used internationally. The newly-introduced English florin at twice this nominal weight was ultimately found to be wrongly tariffed, resulting in it being unacceptable to merchants. It was almost immediately withdrawn from circulation and in August 1344, after only a few months, it was replaced by the more successful gold noble (7.80g gold, valued at 6s 8d).

==Description==

The obverse of the coin shows the king enthroned beneath a canopy, with two leopards&#x27; heads at the sides; the legend is (&quot;Edward, by the Grace of God King of England and France, Lord of Ireland&quot;). The reverse shows the royal cross within a quatrefoil, a leopard in each spandrel; the legend is (&quot;But Jesus passing through their midst went his way&quot;, from Luke 4:30).

== Surviving coins ==
Only three examples of the coin are known. Two were discovered together on the banks of the River Tyne in 1857, and are now held by the British Museum. Another was discovered at an undisclosed location in the south of England in 2006 and was sold at auction for £460,000, then a record price for a British coin. The coin was subsequently loaned to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, before changing hands in 2016 for an undisclosed seven-figure sum to a private collector in the United States.

A 2013 list included the coin as one of the most expensive in the world.

<doc id="197916" wikidata="Q5641669" url="?curid=197916" title="Half florin">
<text>The half florin (also known as a leopard) was an attempt by English King Edward III to produce a gold coinage suitable for use in Europe as well as in England. The half florin was largely based on contemporary European gold coins, with a value of three shillings. The gold used to strike the coins was overvalued, resulting in the coins being unacceptable to the public, and the coins were withdrawn after only a few months in circulation. In August 1344 they were melted down to produce the more popular noble. Few specimens have survived of what is often regarded as one of the most beautiful medieval English coins ever produced.

The obverse of the coin shows a leopard with a cloak of the royal arms; the legend is (&quot;Edward, by the Grace of God King of England and France, Lord of Ireland&quot;).
The reverse of the coin shows the Royal cross within a quatrefoil, a leopard in each quarter; the legend is (&quot;O Lord, rebuke me not in Thy anger&quot;, from Psalm 6).

Only five examples are known to survive. In 2019, experts announced the discovery of an example from Reepham, Norfolk. This same coin was announced for auction in March 2022. It sold for £140,000.

<text>The quarter florin or helm was an attempt by English King Edward III to produce a gold coinage suitable for use in Europe as well as in England (see also double leopard and leopard). The Helm, based on contemporary European gold coins had a value of one shilling and sixpence. However, the gold used to strike the coins was overvalued, resulting in the coins being unacceptable to the public, and the coins were withdrawn after only seven months in circulation, and eventually demonetised in August 1344, to be melted down to produce the more popular gold Noble.

The obverse of the coin shows the royal helmet surmounted by a lion and cap; the legend is (Edward King of England and France Lord of Ireland).
The reverse of the coin shows a floriated cross with a quatrefoil in the centre; the legend is (&quot;He shall be exalted in glory&quot;, Psalm 112:9).

In 2015, an example was found in Colyton, Devon. It was sold for £50,000.

<doc id="197924" wikidata="Q777192" url="?curid=197924" title="Talking with the Taxman About Poetry">
<text>Talking with the Taxman About Poetry is the third album by Billy Bragg, released in September 1986. With production by John Porter and Kenny Jones, &quot;Talking with the Taxman About Poetry&quot; featured more musicians than Bragg&#x27;s previous works, which were generally little more than Bragg himself and a guitar.

There were two singles released from the album. While &quot;Levi Stubbs&#x27; Tears&quot; peaked at No. 29 in the UK, the follow-up &quot;Greetings to the New Brunette&quot; fell short, only managing No. 58 a few months later.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s title is also the title of a Vladimir Mayakovsky poem, which appears as part of the liner notes.

The song &quot;There Is Power in a Union&quot; is based on the song &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot;.

&quot;Levi Stubbs&#x27; Tears&quot; refers to songwriter Barrett Strong, producer Norman Whitfield, the members of the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting and production team as well as Levi Stubbs and the Four Tops.

The original album cover has the subtitle &quot;The Difficult Third Album&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Talking with the Taxman About Poetry&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Handelman called the album &quot;a winning mesh, by turns as political as the Clash, as clever as Elvis Costello, as melodic as Ray Davies and as rocking as Chuck Berry.&quot; Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; praised it as &quot;a great leap forward, the deft application of understated instrumental accompaniment on some of Bragg&#x27;s best-ever songs.&quot;

&quot;Talking with the Taxman About Poetry&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="197927" wikidata="Q631282" url="?curid=197927" title="Prince William Sound">
<text>Prince William Sound (Sugpiaq: &quot;Suungaaciq&quot;) is a sound off the Gulf of Alaska on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is located on the east side of the Kenai Peninsula. Its largest port is Valdez, at the southern terminus of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Other settlements on the sound, which contains numerous small islands, include Cordova and Whittier plus the Alaska native villages of Chenega and Tatitlek.

==History==
James Cook entered Prince William Sound in 1778 and initially named it Sandwich Sound, after his patron the Earl of Sandwich. Later that year, the Sound was named to honour George III&#x27;s third son Prince William Henry, then aged 13 and serving as a midshipman in the Royal Navy.

In 1790, the Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo entered the sound, naming many of its features. Some places in the sound still bear the names given by Fidalgo, as Port Valdez, Port Gravina or Cordova. The explorer landed on the actual site of Cordova and took possession of the land in the name of the king of Spain.

In 1793, Alexander Andreyevich Baranov founded port Voskresenskii, modern-day Seward, on the south edge of the Sound, which he called Chugach Bay. The three-masted ship, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, was built there, the first ship built by the Russians in America. 
Annie Montague Alexander led an expedition through the Sound in 1908.

A tsunami on March 27, 1964, a result of the Good Friday earthquake, killed a number of Chugach villagers in the coastal village of Chenega and destroyed the town of Valdez. Lasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake recorded in North American history, and the third most powerful earthquake recorded in world history. In Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Two types of tsunamis were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).

On March 24, 1989, the oil tanker &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; ran aground on Bligh Reef after leaving Valdez, causing a large oil spill, which resulted in massive damage to the environment, including the killing of around 250,000 seabirds, nearly 3,000 sea otters, 300 harbour seals, 250 bald eagles and up to 22 killer whales. It is considered to be one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters. The Valdez spill is the second largest in US waters, after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in terms of volume released. The oil, originally extracted at the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, eventually impacted 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of coastline, of which 200 miles (320 km) were heavily or moderately oiled with an obvious impact. Chemical dispersant, a surfactant and solvent mixture, was applied to the slick by a private company on March 24 with a helicopter. But the helicopter missed the target area. Scientific data on its toxicity were either thin or incomplete. In addition, public acceptance of a new, widespread chemical treatment was lacking. Landowners, fishing groups, and conservation organizations questioned the use of chemicals on hundreds of miles of shoreline when other alternatives may have been available. Because Prince William Sound contained many rocky coves where the oil collected, the decision was made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil. At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the Exxon Valdez spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered.

In May 2020, a team of researchers announced that a certain mile-long slope on the Barry Arm fjord in Prince William Sound would likely trigger a catastrophic tsunami within the next two decades, or possibly even within the next twelve months. The researchers cautioned their analysis had not yet been peer-reviewed. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources subsequently issued a warning that &quot;an increasingly likely landslide could generate a wave with devastating effects on fishermen and recreationalists&quot;.

==Geography==
Most of the land surrounding Prince William Sound is part of the Chugach National Forest, the second largest national forest in the U.S. Prince William Sound is ringed by the steep and glaciated Chugach Mountains. The coastline is convoluted, with many islands and fjords, several of which contain tidewater glaciers. The principal barrier islands forming the sound are Montague Island, Hinchinbrook Island, and Hawkins Island.
