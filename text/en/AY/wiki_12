<text>Arc is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp, developed by Paul Graham and Robert Morris. It is free and open-source software released under the Artistic License 2.0.

== History ==
In 2001, Paul Graham announced that he was working on a new dialect of Lisp named &quot;Arc&quot;. Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Graham&#x27;s startup business incubator named Y Combinator have been written in Arc, most notably the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program. Arc is written in Racket.

==Motives==
In the essay &quot;Being Popular&quot; Graham describes a few of his goals for the language. While many of the goals are very general (&quot;Arc should be hackable&quot;, &quot;there should be good libraries&quot;), he did give some specifics. For example, he believes it is important for a language to be terse:
He also stated that it is better for a language to only implement a small number of &quot;axioms&quot;, even when that means the language may not have features that large organizations want, such as object-orientation (OO). Further, Graham thinks that OO is not useful as its methods and patterns are just &quot;good design&quot;, and he views the language features used to implement OO as partly mistaken. At Arc&#x27;s introduction in 2008, Graham stated one of its benefits was its brevity.

A controversy among Lisp programmers is whether, and how much, the s-expressions of the language should be complemented by other forms of syntax. Graham thinks that added syntax should be used in situations where pure s-expressions would be overly verbose, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax into Lisp.&quot; Graham also thinks that efficiency problems should be solved by giving the programmer a good profiler.

=== Reception ===
When released in 2008, Arc generated mixed reactions, with some calling it simply an extension to Lisp or Scheme and not a programming language in its own right. Others applauded Arc for stripping Lisp down to bare essentials. Shortly after its release, Arc was ported to JavaScript, and was being supported by &quot;Schemescript&quot;, an integrated development environment (IDE) based on Eclipse.

== Examples ==
Hello world in Arc :

 (prn &quot;Hello, World&quot;)
To illustrate Arc&#x27;s terseness, Graham uses a brief program. It produces a form with one field at the url &quot;/said&quot;. When the form is submitted, it leads to a page with a link that says &quot;click here&quot;, which then leads to a page with the value of the original input field. 

(defop said req
 (aform [onlink &quot;click here&quot; (pr &quot;you said: &quot; (arg _ &quot;foo&quot;))]
 (input &quot;foo&quot;) 
 (submit)))
==Versions==

===Official version===
The first publicly released version of Arc was made available on 29 January 2008, implemented on Racket (named PLT-Scheme then). The release comes in the form of a .tar archive, containing the Racket source code for Arc. A tutorial and a discussion forum are also available. The forum uses the same program that Hacker News does, and is written in Arc.

=== Unofficial versions ===
Due to lack of updates in the official Arc branch, some members of the Arc community started their own repositories with unofficial modifications, extensions, and libraries. One version, &quot;Anarki&quot;, permitted anyone to submit changes to the project and has a community managed wiki.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; is an implementation of Arc in Java.

&quot;Arcadia&quot; is an implementation of Arc in C.

&quot;Arc++&quot; is an implementation of Arc in C++.

<doc id="188197" wikidata="Q171401" url="?curid=188197" title="Futsal">
<text>Futsal is an association football-based sport played on a hardcourt like a basketball court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It has similarities to five-a-side football and indoor football.

Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, it is played on a hard court surface marked by lines; walls or boards are not used. It is played with a smaller, harder, lower-bounce ball than association football. The surface, ball and rules favour ball control and passing in small spaces. The game also emphasizes improvisation, creativity and technique.

== Name ==

&quot;Futsal&quot; comes from the Portuguese &quot;futebol de salão&quot; and from the Spanish &quot;fútbol sala&quot; or &quot;fútbol de salón&quot; (all translatable as &quot;indoor football&quot;). During its second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name &quot;fútbol sala&quot; was used. The World Futsal Association registered the name &quot;futsal&quot; in 1985, following a dispute with FIFA over the name &quot;fútbol&quot;. Since then, &quot;futsal&quot; has become the officially and internationally accepted name, and FIFA has also started using the term.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Futsal started in 1930 when Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier, a teacher in Montevideo, Uruguay, created a version of indoor football for YMCAs.

Originally developed for basketball courts, a rule book for the new sport was published in September 1933. Association football was already highly popular in the country, and after Uruguay won the 1930 World Cup and gold medals in the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, it attracted even more practitioners. Ceriani&#x27;s goal was to create a team game similar to football that could be played indoors or outdoors.

While writing the rule book, Ceriani combined the principles of association football—where the ball may be touched with every part of the body except the hands or upper part of the arms—with rules from other sports: from basketball, the number of players (five per team) and the game&#x27;s duration (40 active minutes); from water polo, the goalkeeping rules; and from team handball, the field and goal sizes.

The YMCA spread the game quickly throughout South America. It was easily played by everyone, everywhere, and in any weather condition, helping players of other sports stay in shape all year round. These reasons convinced João Lotufo, a Brazilian, to bring the game to his country and adapt it to the needs of physical education.

Initially, the rules were not uniform. In 1956, the rules were modified by Habib Maphuz and Luiz Gonzaga de Oliveira Fernandes within the YMCA of São Paulo, Brazil, to allow seniors to compete. Luiz de Oliveira wrote the &quot;Book of Rules of Futsal&quot; in 1956, then adopted also at the international level.

In 1965, the Confederación Sudamericana de Futsal (South American Futsal Confederation) was created, consisting of Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Argentina.

Shortly after, a tournament was organized. It attracted some interest in South American media, which regularly began to follow futsal. In particular, it was the Brazilian journalist José Antônio Inglêz who passionately contributed to the rapid spread of the game, as well as being credited as the man who coined the name &quot;futsal&quot;.

The most attended futsal match in history was played on 7 September 2014 on Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brazil&#x27;s capital Brasília between Brazil and Argentina in front of 56,483 spectators.

=== Futsal today ===
Today, futsal is a very popular global sport, with one source estimating 12 million players across the world. Due to its easy setup, enhanced accessibility, and lower physical requirements, futsal has become an essential resource for coaches aiming to develop players.

== Governing bodies ==
The two most important governing bodies of futsal are the Asociación Mundial de Fútsal (AMF) and Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). AMF is the successor organization to the original governing body. FIFA later took an interest in futsal, but talks between FIFA and AMF to reconcile governance were not successful. FIFA organizes its own separate competitions.

The International Futsal Alliance (IFA) is a partnership of countries formed to offer high quality futsal tournaments throughout the world. It sees itself as ancillary rather than competing with FIFA. Its membership spans countries from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Several tournaments have been organized under the auspices of IFA, including a world cup for men held in 2019 and one for women held in 2017.

== Rules ==

There are currently two governing bodies: Asociación Mundial de Fútsal (AMF) and Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) which are responsible for maintaining and regulating the official rules of their respective versions of futsal.

FIFA publishes its futsal rules as the &#x27;Laws of the Game&#x27;, in which each of the 17 &#x27;laws&#x27; is a thematically related collection of individual regulations. The laws define all aspects of the game, including which may be changed to suit local competitions and leagues.

Many of the laws are similar or identical to those found in association football, or reference association football in their absence (such as a section noting that there is no offside infraction in futsal). These rules are subjective and differ from tournament to tournament.

===Summary of rules===
;Length of the field
:minimum , maximum .
;Ball
:Ages 13 and up: Size 4, circumference , weight between at the start of the game. 
:Ages 9–13: Size 3, circumference , weight between at the start of the game.
:Dropped from a height of , the first rebound must not be lower than or more than .
:The ideal futsal ball should weigh 390–490 grams.
;Time
:There are two periods of 20 minutes with time stopping at every dead ball. Between the two periods there is a break of 15 minutes. Each team may use one time-out per half, which lasts one minute. Some leagues and tournaments use 25 minute periods with running time.
;Number of players
:There are five players for each team in the field, one of them as goalkeeper, and a maximum number of 12 players that can be used each match. Substitutions are unlimited and on-the-fly.
;Fouls
:All direct free kicks count as accumulated fouls. A direct free kick is awarded for kicking, jumping, pushing, striking, holding, spitting, and deliberate handling. Indirect free kicks, such as playing dangerously and impeding, do not count as accumulated fouls. A team is warned by the referee when they commit five accumulated fouls in a half. All accumulated fouls after the warning result in a direct kick from the second penalty mark. 
;Cards
:A caution can be shown for unsporting behavior, dissent, failure to respect the distance on a restart, excessive delay of a restart, persistent infringement, or incorrectly entering/leaving the field of play. A player or substitute can be sent off for serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, illegally denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, abusive language, and receiving a second caution. Sent-off players are ejected from the game and their team must play short for two minutes or until the other team scores a goal.
;Free kicks
:Taken from the spot of the infringement or on the line of the penalty area nearest the infringement (indirect only). All opponents must be at least away from the ball. The kick must be taken within four seconds or an indirect kick is awarded to the other team.
;Kick from the second penalty mark
:Awarded when a team commits 6 or more accumulated fouls in a half. Second penalty mark is from the goal, opponents must be behind the ball, goalkeeper must be at least away.
;Penalty kick
: from the center of the goal for fouls inside the goal keeper&#x27;s area.
;Goalkeeper
:When in possession of the ball, the goalkeeper has 4 seconds to get rid of the ball. If the ball is kept too long, the referee will give an indirect kick to the other team. The goalkeeper may play freely when in the opponent&#x27;s half.
;Goalkeeper pass-back restriction
:Once the goalkeeper has released the ball either by kicking or throwing, the goalkeeper may not touch it again until the ball goes out of play or is touched by an opponent. The sanction for violation is an indirect free kick. The goalkeeper may receive the ball freely when on the opponent&#x27;s half.
;Kick-in
:A kick-in is used instead of a throw-in. The player must place the ball on the touchline or outside but not more than from the place the ball went out of play. The ball must be stationary, and the kick-in must be taken within 4 seconds from the time the player is ready. During kick-in, opponents must stand at least from the ball. If four seconds elapses or an illegal kick is taken, the referee will award a kick-in to the other team. It is not allowed to score directly from a kick-in: the goal is valid only if someone else touches the ball before it enters in goal.
;Goal clearance
:A goal clearance is used instead of a goal kick. The goalkeeper must throw the ball with their hands, and it must leave the penalty area within four seconds. If goal clearance is taken illegally the goalkeeper may retry, but the referee will not reset the count. If four seconds elapses, the other team gets an indirect kick on the penalty area line.
;Corner kick
:The ball must be placed inside the arc nearest to the point where the ball crossed the goal line and the opponent must stand on field at least from the corner arch until the ball is in play. The corner kick must be taken within 4 seconds of being ready or else a goal clearance will be awarded to the other team. The ball is in play when it is kicked and moves.
;Referees
:For international matches, there must be two referees: one (first referee) is positioned on the touchline near the timekeeper table and communicates with the timekeeper, while the other (second referee) is in the opposite side of the field. At the timekeeper table there is a timekeeper and a third referee, who controls the teams&#x27; benches. In minor events, the third referees and the timekeeper are not used.

=== Players, equipment and officials ===

There are five players on the field on each team, one of whom is the goalkeeper. The maximum number of substitutes allowed is nine (FIFA change 2012), with unlimited substitutions during the match. Substitutes can come on even when the ball is in play but the player coming off must leave the field before the substitute can enter the playing field. If a team has or is reduced to fewer than three players remaining, the match is abandoned and counted as a loss for the team with the lack of players.

The kit is made up of a jersey or shirt with sleeves, shorts, socks, shinguards made out of metal, plastic or foam, and shoes with rubber soles. The goalkeeper is allowed to wear long trousers and a different coloured kit to distinguish themself from the other players on the team and the referee. The goalkeeper is also allowed to wear elbow pads because the surface is about as hard as a tennis court or basketball court. Jewellery is not allowed, nor are other items that could be dangerous to the player wearing the item or to other active participants.

The match is controlled by the referee, who enforces the Laws of the Game, and the first referee is the only one who can legally abandon the match because of interference from outside the field. This referee is assisted by a second referee who typically watches over the goal lines or assists the primary referee with calls on fouls or plays. The decisions made by the referees are final and can only be changed if the referees think it is necessary and play has not restarted. There is also a third referee and a timekeeper who are provided with equipment to keep a record of fouls in the match. In the event of injury to the second referee, the third referee will replace the second referee.

=== The Pitch ===

The futsal pitch is made up of wood or artificial material, or similar surface, although any flat, smooth and non-abrasive material may be used. The length of the field is in the range of , and the width is in the range of in international matches. For other matches, it can be in length, while the width can be , as long as the length of the longer boundary lines (touchlines) are greater than the shorter boundaries where the goals are placed (goal lines) (Basketball courts of can be used). The &quot;standard&quot; size court for an international is (the size of a handball field). The ceiling must be at least high.

A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be above the ground. Nets made of hemp, jute or nylon are attached to the back of the goalposts and crossbar. The lower part of the nets is attached to curved tubing or another suitable means of support. The depth of the goal is at the top and at the bottom.
In front of each goal is an area known as the penalty area. This area is created by drawing quarter-circles with a radius from the goal line, centered on the goalposts. The upper part of each quarter-circle is then joined by a line running parallel to the goal line between the goalposts. The line marking the edge of the penalty area is known as the penalty area line. The penalty area marks where the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball with hands. The penalty mark is six metres from the goal line when it reaches the middle of the goalposts. The second penalty mark is from the goal line when it reaches the middle of the goalposts. A penalty kick from the penalty spot is awarded if a player commits a foul inside the penalty area. The second penalty spot is used if a player commits their team&#x27;s sixth foul in the opposing team&#x27;s half or in their own half in the area bordered by the halfway line and an imaginary line parallel to the halfway line passing through the second penalty mark; the free kick is taken from the second penalty mark.

Any standard team handball field can be used for futsal, including goals and floor markings.

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===
A standard match consists of two equal periods of 20 minutes. The length of either half is extended to allow penalty kicks to be taken or a direct free kick to be taken against a team that has committed more than five fouls. The interval between the two halves cannot exceed 15 minutes.

In some competitions, the game cannot end in a draw, so away goals, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark are the three methods for determining the winner after a match has been drawn. Away goals mean that if the team&#x27;s score is level after playing one home and one away game, the team which has scored more away goals wins. Extra time consists of two periods of five minutes. If no winner is produced after these methods, three kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored the most wins. If it is not decided after three kicks from the penalty mark, it continues to go on with one extra kick from the penalty mark to each team at a time until one of them has scored more goals than the other. Unlike extra time, the goals scored in a shoot-out do not count towards the goals scored throughout the match.

=== The start and restart of play ===
At the beginning of the match, a coin toss is used to decide who will start the match. A kick-off is used to signal the start of play and is used at the start of the second half and any periods of extra time. It is also used after a goal has been scored, with the other team starting the play. After a temporary stoppage for any reason not mentioned in the Laws of the Game, the referee will drop the ball where the play was stopped, provided that, before the stoppage, the ball was in play and had not crossed either the touch lines or goal lines.

If the ball goes over the goal line or touchline, hits the ceiling, or the play is stopped by the referee, the ball is out of play. If it hits the ceiling of an indoor arena, play is restarted with a kick-in to the opponents of the team that last touched the ball, under the place where it hit the ceiling.

=== Lack of offside rule ===
Unlike association football, there is no offside in futsal. Under the Futsal Laws of the Game, Law 11 references offside as it does in association football, but only says that there is no offside in futsal.

=== Misconduct ===
A direct free kick can be awarded to the opposing team if a player succeeds or attempts to kick or trip an opponent, jumps, charges or pushes an opponent, or strikes or attempts to strike an opponent. Holding, touching or spitting at an opponent are offenses that are worthy of a direct free kick, as are sliding in to play the ball while an opponent is playing it or carrying, striking or throwing the ball (except the goalkeeper).

These are all accumulated fouls. After five accumulated fouls in a half, the sixth accumulated foul and beyond result in a direct kick from the penalty mark where members of both teams may not make a wall prior to the kick.

The direct free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, unless it is awarded to the defending team in their penalty area, in which case the free kick may be taken from anywhere inside the penalty area. A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits one of the fouls that are worthy of a direct free kick inside their own penalty area. The position of the ball does not matter as long as it is in play but for a penalty kick, the ball must be on the outer line, perpendicular to the center of the net.

An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a goalkeeper clears the ball but then touches it with their hands before anyone else, if the goalkeeper controls the ball with hands when it has been kicked to them by a teammate, or if they touch or control the ball with hands or feet in their own half for more than four seconds.

An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team if a player plays in a dangerous manner, deliberately obstructs an opponent, prevents the goalkeeper from throwing the ball with hands or anything else for which play is stopped to caution or dismiss a player. The indirect free kick is taken from the place where the infringement occurred.

Yellow and red cards are used in futsal. The yellow card is to caution players over their actions. If they get two, they are given a red card, which means they are sent off the field. A yellow card is shown if a player shows unsporting behavior, dissent, persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game, delaying the restart of play, failing to respect the distance of the player from the ball when play is being restarted, infringement of substitution procedure or entering, re-entering and leaving the field without the referee&#x27;s permission. A player is shown the red card and sent off if they engage in serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting at another person, or denying the opposing team a goal by handling the ball (except the goalkeeper inside their penalty area). Also punishable with a red card is denying an opponent moving towards the player&#x27;s goal a goal scoring opportunity by committing an offense punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick and using offensive, insulting or abusive language or gestures. A player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field.

A substitute player is permitted to come on two minutes after a teammate has been sent off, unless a goal is scored before the end of the two minutes. If a team with more players scores against a team with fewer players, another player can be added to the team with an inferior number of players. If the teams are equal when the goal is scored or if the team with fewer players scores, both teams remain with the same number of players.

<doc id="188198" wikidata="Q848021" url="?curid=188198" title="United Kingdom Infrared Telescope">
<text>The United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) is a 3.8 metre (150 inch) infrared reflecting telescope, the second largest dedicated infrared (1 to 30 micrometres) telescope in the world. It is located on Mauna Kea, Hawai&#x27;i as part of Mauna Kea Observatory. Until 2014 it was operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre in Hilo. It was owned by the United Kingdom Science and Technology Facilities Council. UKIRT is currently being funded by NASA and operated under scientific cooperation between Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, the University of Hawaii, and the U. S. Naval Observatory. The telescope is set to be decommissioned after completion of the Thirty Meter Telescope as part of the Mauna Kea Comprehensive Management Plan.

==Design==
Like related telescopes on Tenerife, it is a Cassegrain device with a thin primary mirror, around 2/3 thinner than in other contemporary devices and weighing only 6.5 tonnes. When trying to view distant objects in infra-red local sources of heat must be minimised, to this end a lighter mirror requires lower power motors and control systems creating less heat. The mirror is held in a massive steel &#x27;cell&#x27; of 20 tonnes which is linked to the supports by Serrurier trusses. The mirror&#x27;s accuracy despite its very low weight and thickness was partly achieved by sitting it on concentric circles of aluminum pistons/air cells, 80 in all. Computer control of these pneumatic pistons enabled stresses in the glass to be canceled out effectively modeling the behavior of a much thicker mirror. This novel technique resulted in optical performance considerably better than the procurement specification. The instrument was mounted on an &#x27;English Equatorial mounting&#x27; or yoke which sits on ball-bearings on steel piers, swinging east–west and rotating around north–south. The geometry of the mount limits the telescopes access to objects between +60 and −40 degrees of declination but it is extremely sturdy and free from deformation and so allows very accurate pointing. The entire structure was built on massive ball bearings held rigid by shear pins to afford earthquake protection.
Pointing control of the axis was provided by pairs of printed circuit motors driven in opposition to cancel backlash controlled by a DEC PDP11/40 computer system.

==History==
The telescope was built between 1975 and 1978; the mechanical systems were built by Dunford Hadfields Limited of Sheffield and the optics by Grubb Parsons of Newcastle. Originally known as the Infrared Flux Collector, it began operation in October 1979.

It was built at the same time as the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility; John Jefferies of the Institute for Astronomy, which built the first telescope in the area, said &quot;it has been sometimes a source of embarrassment ... that there are two of them at the same place at the same time. The natural question is asked, Why two? Why don&#x27;t you build one and share it?&quot;.

With the delivery of the wide-field imager WFCAM in 2004, UKIRT began a revolutionary large-scale sky survey (the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, UKIDSS). This project takes some 80% of the available telescope time in wide-field mode. Wide-field takes some 60% of the telescope; the other 40% is devoted to operations with the Cassegrain instrumentation. In December 2008 it was announced that the telescope would be moving to wide-field mode full-time .

Since December 13, 2010 UKIRT has been operated remotely from Hilo in a minimalist operation mode with no observers present. Most of the time is used by the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, but about 60 nights per year are used by Korean institutes.

A UKIRT infrared survey was used to discover a redshift distance record breaking Quasar in 2011. The quasar could not be seen in visible light, but could in the longer wavelengths observed by UKIRT. The UKIDSS observations allowed astronomers to find the most distant quasar in 2011. It took five years to find this item but once found, other telescopes such as the VLT further analyzed it.

== Instrumentation ==

UKIRT has four Cassegrain instruments of which 3 can be on the telescope at the same time and a wide-field imager placed forward of the Cassegrain focus.

* CGS4 is a cooled-grating spectrometer with a 90-arcsecond long slit, at spectral resolutions between about 1,000 and 30,000.
* Michelle is a 320x240 pixel mid-infrared imager/spectrometer operating between 10 and 20 micrometres.
* UFTI is a 1024x1024 pixel imager operating between 0.8 and 2.5 micrometres.
* UIST is a 1024x1024 pixel imager/spectrometer operating between 0.8 and 5 micrometres, and offering an integral field mode 3x6 arcseconds in size.
* WFCAM (at forward Cassegrain) is a wide-field imager with four 2048x2048 arrays, each of which covers a field 13.6 arcminutes on a side, for a total field of view of about 0.2 square degrees.

== Upgrades ==
Though it was built inexpensively, UKIRT has been extensively upgraded. A program of improvements from 1990 to 1998 greatly improved the imaging performance, and in 2001 the telescope delivered median infrared seeing ranging from 0.8 arcseconds at dusk to 0.5 arcseconds in the early morning. Between 1998 and 2003, two major software projects were undertaken – the ORAC project providing a major upgrade to the user interface and automating telescope operations, and the OMP providing a comprehensive observation database and data feedback mechanisms. Since 2003, using these two software enhancements, UKIRT has carried out highly efficient flexible scheduling – tailoring observation execution to the prevailing weather conditions. Observations are selected from the database according to the current seeing, atmospheric water vapor, sky transparency, and a science priority allocated by the telescope time allocation panel.

==Research==
In July 2006, UKIRT released the DR1 data set for the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey.

==Continuing operations==
It was announced on 16 December 2009 that the telescope was &quot;subject to discussions leading to managed withdrawal&quot;. In 2012, its shutdown for end of the 2013 was announced. The possibility of transfer was noted as a possibility. On October 30, 2014 the telescope ownership was transferred to the University of Hawaii. It is now operated under a Scientific Cooperation Agreement among the University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii and Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center (LM-ATC). Funding for operations is currently being provided by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona is responsible for daily operations and scientific productivity. Technical support is provided by the East Asian Observatory, the successor organization operating the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. In addition to NASA mission support, observing time is provided to astronomers and planetary scientists at the University of Hawaii and University of Arizona and researchers at LM-ATC. The UK continues to provide support for data pipelines and archives for the Wide-Field Camera and receives a share of the time for survey projects of joint interest.

<doc id="188206" wikidata="Q378572" url="?curid=188206" title="Charles François Dumouriez">
<text>Charles-François du Périer Dumouriez (; 26 January 1739 – 14 March 1823) was a French military officer, minister of Foreign Affairs, minister of War in a Girondin cabinet and army general during the French Revolutionary War. Dumouriez is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 3.

With General Kellermann he shared the first French victory at Valmy where the Prussian army was forced to draw back. He rapidly advanced north (till Moerdijk); before entering Holland he decided to return to Brussels when the French armies lost territory in the east of Belgium and the Siege of Maastricht (1793). He disagreed with his successor Pache, the radical Convention and Jacobin deputies, like Robespierre and Marat, on the annexation of the wealthy Netherlands and the introduction of assignats. After losing the Battle of Neerwinden (1793), he deserted the Revolutionary Army. Fearing execution, he refused to surrender himself to the recently installed Revolutionary Tribunal and instead defected to the Austrian army.

==Early life==
Dumouriez was born in Cambrai, on the Scheldt River in northern France, to parents of noble rank. His father, Antoine-François du Périer, served as a commissary of the royal army, and educated his son most carefully and widely. He continued his studies in Paris at the &quot;Lycée Louis-le-Grand&quot;, and was then sent to his uncle in Versailles for a year. In 1757 began his military career as a volunteer and served in six campaigns of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In the Battle of Rossbach, he served as a cornet in the &quot;Régiment d&#x27;Escars&quot;. He was stationed in Emden, Münster, Wesel and carried a small library with him. He received a commission for good conduct in action, with distinction (receiving 22 wounds during the battle of Corbach). In 1761 he recovered in the baths at Aachen. After the peace of Hubertusburg he retired at Abbeville as a captain, with a small pension (which was never paid), a love affair with his niece and the cross of St Louis.

Dumouriez then visited Italy, Spain and Corsica, and his memoranda to the duc de Choiseul on Corsican affairs at the time of the Corsican Republic led to his re-employment on the staff of the French expeditionary corps sent to the island, for which he gained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1769 Choiseul gave Dumouriez a military command as deputy quartermaster general to the army under the Marquis de Chauvelin. After two campaigns on the island, he became a member of the Secret du Roi, the secret service under Louis XV, which gave full scope to his diplomatic skills. The fall of Choiseul (1770) brought about Dumouriez&#x27;s recall. In 1770 he undertook a mission into Poland, where, in addition to his political business, he organized a Polish militia for the Bar Confederation. There he met with Jozef Miaczinsky, the commander of a regiment. His Polish soldiers were pushed back by the Russian forces of General Alexander Suvorov in the first clash but Suvorov failed in the second clash. On 21 May 1771, Dumouriez&#x27; Polish soldiers were smashed in the third clash.

In 1772, upon returning to Paris, Dumouriez sought a military position from the marquis de Monteynard, Secretary of State for War, who gave him a staff position with the regiment of Lorraine writing diplomatic and military reports. In 1773, he was arrested in Hamburg found himself imprisoned in the Bastille for six months, apparently for diverting funds intended for the employment of secret agents into the payment of personal debts. During his captivity Dumouriez occupied himself with literary pursuits. He was sent to Caen, where he remained in detention until the accession of Louis XVI in 1774. Dumouriez was then recalled to Paris and assigned to posts in Lille and Boulogne-sur-Mer by the comte de Saint-Germain, the new king&#x27;s minister of war.

Upon his release, Dumouriez married his cousin, a certain &quot;Mademoiselle de Broissy&quot;. In the meantime, Dumouriez had turned his attention to the internal state of his own country, and amongst the very numerous memoranda which he sent to the government was a project on the defence of Normandy and Cherbourg navy port, which procured for him in 1778 the post of commandant of Cherbourg. He administered it with much success for more than ten years. The construction of the fortifications and dikes began in 1779/1782 and extended in 1786. He used a plan by Vauban to create an outer port. The city grew and even the King came to La Manche see it. For his ingenuity in fortifying he became a &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1788. After the Storming of the Bastille he became commander of the National Guard in July 1789, but his ambition was not satisfied. Business and trade dropped in Cherbourg. He proved a neglectful and unfaithful husband, and the couple separated. Madame Dumouriez took refuge in a convent.

==Political career ==

At the outbreak of the Revolution, seeing the opportunity for carving out a new career, he went to Paris, where he joined the Jacobin Club. In 1790, Dumouriez was appointed French military advisor to the newly established United Belgium States and remained dedicated to the cause of an independent Belgian Republic. In 1791 he was sent to the coast. The death of Mirabeau, to whose fortunes he had attached himself, proved a great blow. However, opportunity arose again when, in his capacity as a lieutenant-general and the commandant of Nantes, he offered to march to the assistance of the National Constituent Assembly after the royal family&#x27;s unsuccessful flight to Varennes. Minister of War, Louis Lebègue Duportail, promoted Dumouriez from president of the War Council to major-general in June 1791 and attached him to the Twelfth Division, which was commanded by General Jacques Alexis de Verteuil.

He then attached himself to the Girondist party and, on 15 March 1792, became the French minister of foreign affairs. In March 1792 selected Lebrun-Tondu as his first officer for Belgian and Liégeois affairs. The relationship between the Girondists and Dumouriez was not based on ideology, but rather based on the practical benefit it gave to both parties. Dumouriez needed people in the Legislative Assembly to support him, and the Girondists needed a general to give them legitimacy in the army. He played a major part in the declaration of war against Austria (20 April), and he ordered General Dillon, commander of Lille, to attack Tournai, and the invasion of the Austrian Netherlands. His foreign policy was greatly influenced by Jean-Louis Favier. Favier had called for France to break its ties with Austria.

On the king&#x27;s dismissal of Roland, Clavière and Servan (13 June 1792), he took Servan&#x27;s post of minister of war, but resigned it a few days days later on account of Louis XVI&#x27;s refusal to come to terms with the National Constituent Assembly, concerning his suspensive veto. Within a week he joined the army of the North under Marshal Luckner. After the &quot;émeute&quot; of 10 August 1792 and Lafayette’s flight, he gained appointment to the command of the &quot;Army of the Centre&quot;. At the same moment, France&#x27;s enemies assumed the offensive. Dumouriez acted promptly from Sedan, Ardennes.

On 24 August 1792 Dumouriez wrote to his ally General François Kellermann about the void in military power within France. Within this letter, Dumouriez voices his opinions adamantly that Lafayette was a &quot;traitor&quot; to France after being arrested for mobilizing his army from the borders of France to Paris to protect the Royal family from revolutionaries who were dissatisfied with the monarchy of France at the time. Within this letter, Dumouriez&#x27;s attachment to the Jacobin club is explicitly present as he tells Kellermann that the army was finally &quot;purged of aristocrats&quot;. Dumouriez&#x27;s loyalty to France&#x27;s military which was evident within this letter was instrumental to him ascending to his future position of Foreign Minister of France from March 1792 to June 1792, restoring the natural borders of France. Dumouriez outmaneuvered the invading forces of the Duke of Brunswick in the forest of Argonne.
His subordinate Kellermann repulsed the Prussians at Valmy (20 September 1792). After these military victories, Dumouriez was ready to invade Belgium to spread revolution in the Flanders campaign.

==Army of the North==
Supported by minister Lebrun-Tondu, he declared in the National Convention on 12 October that he would liberate the Belgians and the Liège people. On 27 October 1792, he invaded the Austrian Netherlands. Dumouriez himself severely defeated the Austrians at Jemappes (6 November 1792). He became a military hero for this decisive victory, for which the newspaper &quot;Révolutions de Paris&quot; proclaimed him the liberator of the Belgians. On 14 November he arrived in Brussels. Several times he received a mission of Dutch revolutionary patriots, with whom he agreed on the principles; De Kock, Daendels and his friends settled in Antwerp. Cambon pointed at the empty treasury and the wealthy Dutch. Dumouriez wrote a letter to the Convention scolding it for not supplying his army to his satisfaction and for the Decree of 15 December, which allowed the French armies to loot in the territory they had won, besides the introduction of the inflation-prone assignats in the conquered areas, and to expropriate church property. The Decree insured that any plan concerning Belgium would fail due to a lack of popular support among the Belgians.

===War with the Dutch Republic===

Returning to Paris on 1 January 1793, Dumouriez encountered popular ovation, but he gained less sympathy from the revolutionary government. On 12 January he had a meeting with Lebrun-Tondu; on 23 January he was sent back. The Dutch were willing to pay and an invasion of the Netherlands was postponed. To the more radical elements in Paris, it became clear that Dumouriez was not a true patriot but worked during the trial of Louis XVI to save him from execution. On 29 January Dumouriez lost his negotiating mandate. With the help of the Girondists, Dumouriez ensured that defaulting Pache had to resign at the end of January 1793; at the most critical moment of the war. 

To declare war had always been a prerogative of the king. On 1 February Brissot de Warville declared war against King of Great Britain and the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, not the people. The next day Francisco de Miranda, the only general from Latin America in French service, gave the command of the French forces back to Dumouriez. Although Dumouriez advised the government simply to recognise Belgium&#x27;s independence, the Jacobins sent several agents. On 7 February Dumouriez appreciated the secret proposals of Van de Spiegel and Baron Auckland: in exchange for recognition of French Republic, France would have to refrain from aggression against other countries. On 15 February, Johan Valckenaer addressed Cambon, the president of the Convention, to give not the committee but Dumouriez all powers to depose regents and restore others to power. Lazare Carnot proposed that annexation be undertaken on behalf of French interests whether or not the people to be annexed so wished. On 17 February 1793, the French troops and the Batavian Legion crossed the Dutch border. Miranda, Stengel, Dampierre, Valence, and Eustace went northeast; Dumouriez and Daendels went northwest. Breda, Klundert, and Geertruidenberg were occupied with an army of Sans-Culottes that lacked almost everything. After the French lost Venlo, Aachen, Maastricht and all the supply at Liège in early March, Dumouriez was ordered to return to Brussels rather than further entering Holland. The situation was alarming. Miranda wrote Dumouriez to continue his plan and not return to Belgium. 

On 11 March, Dumouriez addressed the Brussels assembly, apologizing for the actions of the French commissioners and looting soldiers. On 12 March Dumouriez wrote an angry, insolent letter which is considered a &quot;declaration of war on the Convention&quot;. He criticized the interference of officials of the War Ministry which employed many Jacobins. He attacked not only Pache, the former minister of war, but also Marat and Robespierre. Meanwhile Danton initiated the creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal to interrogate the generals at some time. Dumouriez had long been unable to agree with the course of the Convention. He was disenchanted with the radicalization of the revolution and its politics and put an end to the annexation efforts. He was liked by the Belgium population. It seems both Eustace and Miranda disagreed; on 14 March Eustace wrote a letter to Dumouriez. On 18 March 1793, Dumouriez&#x27;s army attacked the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, also the brother of the Austrian emperor, Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld&#x27;s army. A major defeat in the Battle of Neerwinden nearly ended the French invasion. On 20 March Danton and Charles-François Delacroix were sent to Louvain. On 22 March Dumouriez opened negotiations with the Austrian General Mack. He allowed Dumouriez to retreat to Brussels; Dumouriez&#x27; soldiers were deserting in large numbers. The next day Dumouriez promised the Austrians he would leave Belgium (though he had no permission and was without approval of the convention.) On 24 March, Francisco de Miranda, the only general from Latin America in French service, blamed Dumouriez for the defeat in the Battle of Neerwinden (1793). 

Dumouriez prevented the execution of the decrees of 15 and 27 December, according to Robespierre. He did not want the Dutch Republic to come under French authority, or even to be incorporated. It was his army that liberated the south of the Netherlands, and he would not allow it to fall into the hands of commissioners of the Convention. For Robespierre, the army had already more soldiers than it needed. On 25 March Dumouriez asked Karl Mack for his support to march on Paris. There he would negotiate peace, dissolve the convention, restore the French Constitution of 1791, plea for the restoration of a constitutional monarchy, and free Marie-Antoinette and her children. He urged Louis Philippe I Duke of Chartres, though still a teenager, to join his plan. The Jacobin leaders were quite sure that France had come close to a military coup mounted by Dumouriez and supported by Pétion and Brissot.

===Dumouriez&#x27; defection===

On 25 March Robespierre became one of members of the Committee of General Defence, to coordinate the war effort. 
By the end of the month Robespierre called for the removal of Dumouriez, who in his eyes aspired to become a Belgian dictator. A body of four commissioners was sent to question and arrest him. The commissioners Camus, Bancal-des-Issarts, Quinette, and Lamarque were accompanied by the acting Minister of War, Pierre Riel de Beurnonville. Dumouriez sensed a trap and invited them to his headquarters at Saint-Amand-les-Eaux and ordered Miaczinski to arrest them at Orchies. After an hour of deliberations he refused to accept the decree by the convention to go with them to Lille and Paris. Instead Dumouriez arrested the five and sent them over to General Clerfayt on the next day.

Robespierre was convinced Brissot and Dumouriez wanted to overthrow the First French Republic. On 3 April Robespierre declared before the Convention that the whole war was a prepared game between Dumouriez and Brissot to overthrow the First French Republic. The next day Philippe Égalité was arrested.

On 4 April the convention declared Dumouriez a traitor and outlaw and put a price on his head. Davout&#x27;s volunteer battalion tried to arrest Dumouriez. Dumouriez unsuccessfully tried to persuade Davout to his side and made a move to save himself from his radical enemies. He attempted to persuade his troops to march on Paris and overthrow the revolutionary government. The attempt proved unfeasible because many of his soldiers were staunch republicans and several of his officers opposed him. Without escort he rode on horseback to Tournai, along with his chief of staff Pierre Thouvenot, the Duke of Chartres, duc de Montpensier he arrived on 5 April 1793 into the Austrian camp at Maulde. This blow left the Brissotins vulnerable due to their association with Dumouriez. Dumouriez&#x27;s defection changed the course of the events for the Brissotins. On 5 April the Convention substantially expanded the power of the Tribunal révolutionnaire. The Montagnards raised the stakes by sending out a circular from the Jacobin Club in Paris to all the sister Jacobin clubs across France, appealing for petitions demanding the recall – that is, the expulsion from the Convention – of any deputies who had tried to save the life of &quot;the tyrant&quot;. On 6 April the Committee of Public Safety was installed. Suspicion rose against Phillipe Égalité, because of his eldest son who fled with Dumouriez in the Austrian camp. Philippe Égalité was then put under continuous surveillance.

In Brussels Dumouriez met with Metternich and received a passport for Germany. On 10 April Robespierre accused him in a speech: &quot;Dumouriez and his supporters have brought a fatal blow to the public fortune, preventing circulation of assignats in Belgium&quot;. 

The French armies took positions behind the frontier. The &quot;Army of Holland&quot; deployed near Lille, the &quot;Army of the Ardennes&quot; at Maulde, the &quot;Army of the North&quot; at Saint-Amand, and the &quot;Army of Belgium&quot; at Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut and Valenciennes.

==Later life and death==
Following his defection on 5 April 1793, Dumouriez remained in Brussels for a short time, and then travelled to Cologne, seeking a position at the elector&#x27;s court. He soon learned he had become an object of suspicion among his countrymen, the royal houses, aristocracies, and clergy of Europe. In response, Dumouriez wrote and published in Hamburg (1794) a first volume of memoirs in which he offered his version of the previous year&#x27;s events. He became a royalist intriguer during the reign of Napoleon as well as an adviser to the British government. Dumouriez wrote political pamphlets and letters analyzing the coastal defence of England and Ireland.

Dumouriez now wandered from country to country, occupied in ceaseless royalist intrigues, until 1804 when he settled in England, where the British government granted him a pension. He became a valuable adviser to the British War Office, and the Duke of York and Albany in his struggle against Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom, and the British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–05.

In 1808 Castlereagh had been warned by Dumouriez that the best policy England could adopt with respect to colonies in Spanish America was to relinquish all ideas of military conquest by Arthur Wellesley and instead support the emancipation of the territories. Furthermore, Dumouriez suggested that once emancipation was achieved, a constitutional monarchy should be established with the exiled Duke of Orleans as King.

In 1814 and 1815, he endeavoured to procure from Louis XVIII the baton of a marshal of France, but failed to do so. He died at Turville Park, near Henley-on-Thames, on 14 March 1823. An enlarged edition, &quot;La Vie et les mémoires du Général Dumouriez&quot;, appeared at Paris in 1823.

<text>John I of Antioch was Patriarch of Antioch (429 – 441). He led a group of moderate Eastern bishops during the Nestorian controversy. He is sometimes confused with John Chrysostom, who is occasionally also referred to as &quot;John of Antioch&quot;, though &quot;John of Antioch&quot; is indeed mentioned in the Book of the Miracles of the Blessed Virgin Mary. John I gave active support to his friend Nestorius in the latter&#x27;s dispute with Cyril of Alexandria. In the year 431, he arrived too late for the opening meeting of the First Council of Ephesus. Cyril, suspecting John I of using procrastinating tactics to support Nestorius, decided not to wait and convened the council without John I and his supporters, condemning Nestorius. When John I reached Ephesus a few days after the council had begun, he convened a counter-council that condemned Cyril and vindicated Nestorius.

Two years later, in 433 John I reconciled with Cyril based on the &quot;Formula of Reunion&quot;, a theological formula devised as a compromise. In the process, John I lost many of his own supporters within his patriarchate. Some of his letters are extant.

<doc id="188211" wikidata="Q71380" url="?curid=188211" title="Pidgin (software)">
<text>Pidgin (formerly named Gaim) is a free and open-source multi-platform instant messaging client, based on a library named libpurple that has support for many instant messaging protocols, allowing the user to simultaneously log in to various services from a single application, with a single interface for both popular and obsolete protocols (from AIM to Discord), thus avoiding the hassle of having to deal with new software for each device and protocol.

, the number of Pidgin users was estimated to be over three million.

Pidgin is widely used for its Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) plugin, which offers end-to-end encryption. For this reason it is included in the privacy and anonymity focused operating system Tails.

== History ==
The program was originally written by Mark Spencer, an Auburn University sophomore, as an emulation of AOL&#x27;s IM program AOL Instant Messenger on Linux using the GTK+ toolkit. The earliest archived release was on December 31, 1998. It was named GAIM (&quot;GTK+ AOL Instant Messenger&quot;) accordingly. The emulation was not based on reverse engineering, but instead relied on information about the protocol that AOL had published on the web. Development was assisted by some of AOL&#x27;s technical staff. Support for other IM protocols was added soon thereafter.

On 6 July 2015, Pidgin scored seven out of seven points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s secure messaging scorecard. They have received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having communications encrypted with keys the providers don&#x27;t have access to (end-to-end encryption), making it possible for users to independently verify their correspondent&#x27;s identities, having past communications secure if the keys are stolen (forward secrecy), having their code open to independent review (open source), having their security designs well-documented, and having recent independent security audits.

Pidgin 3.0.0 Experimental 1 was announced and subsequently released on December 31, 2024 after many years of slow development. This version was tagged as a 2.90 because developers wished to separate experimental releases from a full proper release in the future. This version brought many API-breaking changes, which is why it was shipped only with one protocol plugin supporting IRC. The development team has stated that other protocols plugins will be available later pending their re-implementation, and that future experimental releases will follow a three-month cadence.

=== Naming dispute ===
In response to pressure from AOL, the program was renamed to the acronymous-but-lowercase gaim. As AOL Instant Messenger gained popularity, AOL trademarked its acronym, &quot;AIM&quot;, leading to a lengthy legal struggle with the creators of GAIM, who kept the matter largely secret.

On April 6, 2007, the project development team announced the results of their settlement with AOL, which included a series of name changes: &quot;Gaim&quot; became &quot;Pidgin&quot;, &quot;libgaim&quot; became &quot;libpurple&quot;, and &quot;gaim-text&quot; (the command-line interface version) became &quot;Finch&quot;. The name Pidgin was chosen in reference to the term &quot;pidgin&quot;, which describes communication between people who do not share a common language. The name &quot;purple&quot; refers to &quot;prpl&quot;, the internal libgaim name for an IM protocol plugin.

Due to the legal issues, version 2.0 of the software was frozen in beta stages. Following the settlement, it was announced that the first official release of Pidgin 2.0.0 was hoped to occur during the two weeks from April 8, 2007. However, Pidgin 2.0 was not released as scheduled; Pidgin developers announced on April 22, 2007, that the delay was due to the preferences directory &quot;codice_1&quot;.

Pidgin 2.0.0 was released on May 3, 2007. Other visual changes were made to the interface in this version, including updated icons.

== Features ==
Pidgin provides a graphical front-end for libpurple using GTK+. Libpurple supports many instant-messaging protocols.

Pidgin supports multiple operating systems, including Windows and many Unix-like systems such as Linux, the BSDs, and AmigaOS. It is included by default in the operating systems Tails, Trisquel and Xubuntu.

=== Pluggability ===

The program is designed to be extended with plugins. Plugins are often written by third-party developers. They can be used to add support for protocols, which is useful for those such as Skype or Discord which have licensing issues (however, the users&#x27; data and interactions are still subject to their policies and eavesdropping). They can also add other significant features. For example, the &quot;Off-the-Record Messaging&quot; (OTR) plugin provides end-to-end encryption.

The TLS encryption system is pluggable, allowing different TLS libraries to be easily substituted. GnuTLS is the default, and NSS is also supported. Some operating systems&#x27; ports, such as OpenBSD&#x27;s, choose to use OpenSSL or LibreSSL by default instead.

=== Contacts ===

Contacts with multiple protocols can be grouped into one single contact instead of managing multiple protocols, and contacts can be given aliases or placed into groups.

To reach users as they log on or a status change occurs (such as moving from &quot;Away&quot; to &quot;Available&quot;), Pidgin supports on-action automated scripts called &quot;Buddy Pounces&quot; to automatically reach the user in customizable ways.

=== File transfer ===

Pidgin supports file transfers for many protocols. Direct, peer-to-peer file transfers are supported over protocols such as XMPP.

=== Voice and video chat ===

As of version 2.6 (released on August 18, 2009), Pidgin supports voice/video calls using Farstream. , calls can only be initiated through the XMPP protocol.

=== Miscellaneous ===

Further features include support for themes, emoticons, spell checking, and notification area integration.

=== Supported protocols ===
The following protocols are officially supported by Pidgin 2.14.12, without any extensions or plugins:
* Gadu-Gadu
* IRC
* Novell GroupWise (to be discontinued in 3.0)
* SIMPLE
* XMPP
* Zephyr (to be discontinued in 3.0)
Some XMPP servers provide transports, which allow users to access networks using non-XMPP protocols without having to install plugins or additional software. Pidgin&#x27;s support for XMPP means that these transports can be used to communicate via otherwise unsupported protocols, including not only instant messaging protocols, but also protocols such as SMS or E-mail.

Additional protocols, supported by third-party plugins, include Discord, Telegram, Microsoft OCS/LCS (extended SIP/SIMPLE), Facebook Messenger, QQ, Skype via skype4pidgin plugin, WhatsApp, and Signal.

=== Plugins ===
Various other features are supported using third-party plugins. Such features include:

* Discord text chat via the purple-discord plugin
* Facebook chat via purple-facebook
* Google Chat via purple-googlechat
* microblogs (GNU social, Twitter)
* Slack (software) via slack-libpurple
* Skype text chat via skype4pidgin, renamed SkypeWeb plugin
* Telegram (software) via tdlib-purple
* End-to-end encryption, through Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR)
* Adding mathematical formulas written in LaTeX to conversations
* Notifications (such as showing &quot;toaster&quot; popups or Snarl notifications, or lighting LEDs on laptops)
* Showing contacts what the user is listening to in various media players
* Watching videos directly into a conversation when receiving a video sharing website link (YouTube, Vimeo)

== Criticisms ==
* As observed by Wired in 2015, the libpurple codebase is &quot;known for its bountiful security bugs&quot;. In 2011, security vulnerabilities were already discovered in popular OTR plugins using libpurple.
* As of version 2.4 and later, the ability to manually resize the text input box of conversations was removed. This led to a fork, Carrier (originally named Funpidgin).
* Passwords are stored in a plaintext file, readable by any person or program that can access the user&#x27;s files. Version 3.0 of Pidgin (no announced release date) will support password storage in system keyrings such as KWallet and the GNOME Keyring for Linux, Keychain for macOS, and winCred API for Windows.
* Pidgin does not currently support pausing or reattempting file transfers.
* Pidgin does not allow disabling the group sorting on the contact list.

== Other notable software based on libpurple ==
* Adium and the discontinued Proteus (both for macOS)
* Meebo (web-based, no longer available)
* Telepathy Haze (a Tube for some of the protocols supported by the Telepathy framework)
* QuteCom (cross-platform, focused on VoIP and video. Discontinued)
* Instantbird (discontinued) (cross-platform, based on Mozilla&#x27;s Gecko engine)

BitlBee and Minbif are IRCd-like gateways to multiple IM networks, and can be compiled with libpurple to increase functionality.

<text>Yahoo (, styled yahoo&quot;!&quot; in its logo) is an American web portal that provides the search engine Yahoo Search and related services including My Yahoo, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports and its advertising platform, Yahoo Native. It is operated by the namesake company Yahoo! Inc., which is 90% owned by Apollo Global Management and 10% by Verizon.

Yahoo was established by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. However, its use declined in the 2010s as some of its services were discontinued, and it lost market share to Facebook and Google.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;yahoo&quot; is a backronym for &quot;Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle&quot; or &quot;Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle&quot;. The term &quot;hierarchical&quot; described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term &quot;oracle&quot; was intended to mean &quot;source of truth and wisdom&quot;, and the term &quot;officious&quot;, rather than being related to the word&#x27;s normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. However, founders Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a &quot;yahoo&quot; (used by college students in David Filo&#x27;s native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): &quot;rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.&quot; This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

==History==

===Founding===

In January 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s guide to the World Wide Web&quot;. The site was a human-edited web directory, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s Guide to the World Wide Web&quot; was renamed &quot;Yahoo!&quot; and became known as the Yahoo Directory. The &quot;yahoo.com&quot; domain was registered on January 18, 1995.

Yahoo was incorporated on March 2, 1995. In 1995, a search engine function, called Yahoo Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo Directory. Yahoo soon became the first popular online directory and search engine on the World Wide Web.

===Expansion===
Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Yahoo became a public company via an initial public offering in April 1996 and its stock price rose 600% within two years. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal, putting it in competition with services including Excite, Lycos, and America Online. By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users, and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine, receiving 95 million page views per day, triple that of rival Excite. It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Yahoo began offering free e-mail from October 1997 after the acquisition of RocketMail, which was then renamed to Yahoo Mail. In 1998, Yahoo replaced AltaVista as the crawler-based search engine underlying the Directory with Inktomi. Yahoo&#x27;s two biggest acquisitions were made in 1999: Geocities for $3.6 billion and Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion.

Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75/share on January 3, 2000. However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.

Yahoo began using Google for search in June 2000. Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004 partly using technology from its $280 million acquisition of Inktomi in 2002. In response to Google&#x27;s Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. In 2008, the company laid off hundreds of people as it struggled from competition.

In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. Yahoo rejected the bid, claiming that it &quot;substantially undervalues&quot; the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. Although Microsoft increased its bid to $47 billion, Yahoo insisted on another 10%+ increase to the offer and Microsoft cancelled the offer in May 2008.

Carol Bartz, who had no previous experience in Internet advertising, replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009. In September 2011, after failing to meet targets, she was fired by chairman Roy J. Bostock; CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company.

In April 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, several key executives resigned, including chief product officer Blake Irving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo!-Inc-Apr-2012-10-K/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced 2,000 layoffs, or about 14% of its 14,100 workers by the end of year, expected to save around $375 million annually. In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. He also completely reorganized the company.

On May 13, 2012, Thompson was fired and was replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo&#x27;s new Media group. Several associates of Third Point Management, including Daniel S. Loeb were nominated to the board of directors. Thompson&#x27;s total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million.

On July 15, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, effective July 17, 2012.

In June 2013, Yahoo acquired blogging site Tumblr for $1.1 billion in cash, with Tumblr&#x27;s CEO and founder David Karp continuing to run the site. In July 2013, Yahoo announced plans to open an office in San Francisco.

On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated.

Data collated by comScore during July 2013 revealed that, during the month, more people in the U.S. visited Yahoo websites than Google; the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr.

Mayer also hired Katie Couric to be the anchor of a new online news operation and started an online food magazine. However, by January 2014, doubts about Mayer&#x27;s progress emerged when Mayer fired her own first major hire, Henrique de Castro.

On December 12, 2014, Yahoo acquired video advertising provider BrightRoll for $583 million.

On November 21, 2014, Yahoo acquired Cooliris.

In August 2023, it was announced Yahoo had acquired the San Francisco-headquartered social investing platform, Commonstock.

In April 2024, it was announced Yahoo had acquired the AI-driven news aggregator app, Artifact.

===Decline, security breaches, and sale===

By December 2015, Mayer was criticized as performance declined. Mayer was ranked as the least likable CEO in tech.

On February 2, 2016, Mayer announced layoffs amounting to 15% of the Yahoo workforce.

On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced the acquisition of Yahoo&#x27;s core Internet business for $4.83 billion. The deal excluded Yahoo&#x27;s 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan.

On February 21, 2017, as a result of the Yahoo data breaches, Verizon lowered its purchase price for Yahoo by $350 million and reached an agreement to share liabilities regarding the data breaches.

On June 13, 2017, Verizon completed the acquisition of Yahoo and Marissa Mayer resigned.

Yahoo, AOL, and HuffPost were to continue operating under their own names, under the umbrella of a new company, Oath Inc., later called Verizon Media.

The parts of the original Yahoo! Inc. which were not purchased by Verizon Communications were renamed Altaba, which was later liquidated, making a final distribution in October 2020.

In September 2021, investment funds managed by Apollo Global Management acquired 90% of Yahoo.

In November 2021, Yahoo announced that it was ending operations in mainland China due to the increasingly challenging business and legal environment. Previously, the company discontinued China Yahoo Mail on August 20, 2013.

In 2023, Yahoo announced that it would cut 20% of its workforce. The move followed mass layoffs from other tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Inc, Meta, and Amazon. The company is set to lay off roughly 1,000 staff members of their 8,600 workers.

==Data breaches==
On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts, one of the largest breaches reported to date. The United States indicted four men, including two employees of Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack. On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts. The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to forge HTTP cookies.

On October 3, 2017, the company stated that all 3 billion of its user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft.

==Criticism==
===DMCA notice to whistleblower===
On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistleblower website &quot;Cryptome&quot; for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo&#x27;s subscribers.

===Censorship of private emails affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests===
After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised, Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident.

==Partners and sponsorships==
On September 11, 2001, Yahoo announced its partnership with FIFA for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and 2006 FIFA World Cup tournaments. It was one of FIFA&#x27;s 15 partners at the tournaments. The deal included co-branding the organization&#x27;s websites.

<text>The IS tanks () were a series of heavy tanks developed as a successor to the KV-series by the Soviet Union during World War II. The IS acronym is the anglicized initialism of Joseph Stalin (, &quot;&quot;). The heavy tanks were designed as a response to the capture of a German Tiger I in 1943. They were mainly designed as breakthrough tanks, firing a heavy high-explosive shell that was useful against entrenchments and bunkers. The IS-2 went into service in April 1944 and was used as a spearhead by the Red Army in the final stage of the Battle of Berlin. The IS-3 served on the Chinese-Soviet border, the Hungarian Revolution, the Prague Spring and on both sides of the Six-Day War. The series eventually culminated in the T-10 heavy tank.

== Design and production ==
=== KV-85/IS-85/IS-1 ===
The KV-85 was a KV-1S with the new turret from the Object 237 (IS-85) still in development, mounting the 85mm D-5T gun. The tank was a result of the USSR&#x27;s tank design bureau being torn in two, one half focusing on the KV-85 and its variants, and the other working on the later IS series. The IS-85 was soon finished and it combined the hull of the KV-13, the new turret from the KV-85, and the same 85mm D-5T gun as both these tanks. The IS-85 was later referred to as IS-1. The first IS-1 rolled off the line in October 1943, but production was stopped in January 1944, as the IS-1 was quickly replaced by the IS-2. Because of this, only about 200 IS-1s were produced.

=== IS-2 ===

In December 1943, two up-gunned variants of the IS-85 were created: the IS-100, armed with the 100mm BS-3 gun, and the IS-122, armed with the 122mm A19 gun (later adopted and renamed as the D-25T). The IS-122 was found to be better than the IS-100 in trials, and so the IS-100 was dropped. The IS-122 was renamed to IS-2 and production started with the 1943 model using a KV-13 chassis. First deliveries of IS-2s were in December 1943. The 1944 model was produced with a revised front slope that was better from an armor point of view while still saving weight. Production in bulk of the IS-2 started in February 1944 and ended nearing the end of World War II. By the end of World War II, 3,854 IS-2 model 1943 and model 1944&#x27;s combined had been produced. German general Hasso von Manteuffel, who met tanks of that series in combat for the first time in Romania in 1944, considered the Stalin tank &quot;the finest in the world.&quot;

=== Object 703 IS-3 ===
There are two tanks known as IS-3: Object 244 was an IS-2 rearmed with the long-barrelled 85 mm cannon (D-5T-85-BM) and developed by the Leningrad Kirov Plant (LKZ), which was never series-produced for service use.
The IS-3 known as Object 703 is a Soviet heavy tank developed in late 1944, and began production in May 1945. Its semi-hemispherical cast turret (resembling an upturned soup bowl), became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks. Its pike nose design was also mirrored by other tanks of the IS tank family such as the IS-7 and T-10 tank. Too late to see combat in World War II, the IS-3 participated in the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, and on the Chinese-Soviet border, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Prague Spring and the Six-Day War.

=== Object 701 IS-4 ===

There are two tanks known as IS-4: Object 245 and Object 701. Object 245 was an IS-2 rearmed with a long 100 mm D-10T cannon.

The IS-4 known as the Object 701 was a Soviet heavy tank that started development in 1943 and began production in 1946. Derived from the IS-2 and part of the IS tank family the IS-4 featured a longer hull and increased armor. With the IS-3 already in production, and when sluggish mobility and decreased need for tanks (particularly heavy tanks) became an issue, many were sent to the Russian Far East with some eventually becoming pillboxes along the Chinese border in the 1960s. Less than 250 were produced.

=== Object 730 IS-5 ===
The IS-5, is merely one of the many designations given to what would ultimately become the T-10 tank.

=== Object 252/253 IS-6 ===
There existed two different IS-6s: the Object 253 was an attempt to develop a practical electrical transmission system for heavy tanks. Similar systems had been tested previously in France and the United States and had been used with limited success in the German Elefant/Ferdinand tank destroyer during World War II. The experimental transmission proved unreliable and was dangerously prone to overheating, and development was discontinued. The alternative Object 252 shared the same hull and turret as the Object 253, but used a different suspension with no return rollers, and a conventional mechanical transmission. The design was deemed to offer no significant advantages over the IS-2, just the reload time was less, and the IS-6 project was halted.

===Upgraded version of IS-6===
Since the IS-6 proved to have no significant advantages over IS-2 and its rival IS-4, in November 1944, they decided to dramatically upgrade the tank. The project was called &quot;Object 252U&quot; (U stands for &quot;Improvement&quot; in Russian). The tank featured a heavily sloped pike-nose armor, a new 122 mm D-13T gun, and more slope on the sides and rear. The design proved to be problematic in terms of crew comfort since the interior was too cramped and the design was cancelled.

=== Object 260 IS-7 ===

The IS-7 heavy tank design began in Leningrad in 1945 by Nikolai Fedorovich Shashmurin and was developed in 1948. Weighing 68 tonnes, thickly armoured and armed with a 130 mm S-70 long-barrelled gun, it was the largest and heaviest member of the IS family.
=== Object 730 T-10 IS-8 ===
The IS-8 (also known as Objekt 730) was the final development of the KV and IS tank series. It was accepted into service in 1952 as the IS-8, but due to the political climate in the wake of Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, it was renamed T-10, as it was the tenth heavy tank in Soviet service.

The biggest differences from its direct ancestor, the IS-3, were a longer hull, seven pairs of road wheels instead of six, a larger turret mounting a new gun with fume extractor, an improved diesel engine, and increased armour. General performance was similar, although the T-10 could carry more ammunition.

T-10s (like the earlier tanks they replaced) were deployed in independent tank regiments belonging to armies, and independent tank battalions belonging to divisions. These independent tank units could be attached to mechanized units, to support infantry operations and perform breakthroughs.

The T-10M is the final iteration of this type. It featured a longer gun barrel than previous models with 5-baffle muzzle brake and 14.5 mm machine gun. This was the last Soviet heavy tank to enter service. When the advanced T-64 MBT became available it replaced the T-10 in front line formations.

===Comparisons===


== Combat history ==

The IS-2 entered combat in World War II during the first months of 1944. The Soviets produced significant numbers of the type (close to 4,000) and deployed them against the most advanced German designs of the time, notably the Tiger I, Tiger II, and Panther, as well as against Elefant tank destroyers. The IS-2 was best used for bunker assault using its high-explosive ammunition, as its reload rate, just 2 rounds per minute, made it ineffective as a tank destroyer. The IS-3 saw service on the Chinese-Soviet border, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Prague Spring and on both sides of the Six-Day War. However, the mobility and firepower of medium-tanks and the evolution of the main battle tank rendered heavy tanks obsolete.

== Variants ==
;KV-85: A stopgap model built from a modified KV-1S hull mated to an Object 237(IS-1)&#x27;s turret and armed with the 85 mm D-5T.
;IS-1K: (1942) The first prototype of the IS-1 tank, which was made in two copies in 1942. The turret was from an experimental KV-9 tank, which did not go into mass production. But the high military command decided that the turret and gun of the KV-9 tank were too outdated. As a result, a new turret had to be designed for the new gun.
;IS-85 (IS-1): 1943 model armed with an 85 mm gun. When IS-2 production started, many were re-gunned with 122 mm guns before being issued.
;IS-100: A prototype version armed with a 100 mm gun; it went into trials against the &quot;IS-122&quot; which was armed with a 122 mm gun. Though the IS-100 was reported to have better anti-armor capabilities, the latter was chosen due to better all-around performance.
;IS-122 (IS-2 model 1943): 1943 model, armed with A-19 122 mm gun (later adopted as the D-25T gun). Production ended after World War II.
;IS-2 model 1944 :1944 improvement with D-25T 122 mm gun, with faster-loading drop breech and new fire control, and improved frontal hull armour using thinner armour with a more efficient shape.
;IS-2M: 1950s modernization of IS-2 tanks.
;IS-3:1944 armor redesign, with new rounded turret, angular front hull casting, integrated stowage bins over the tracks. Internally similar to IS-2 model 1944 and produced concurrently. About 350 built during the war.
;IS-3M: (1952) Modernized version of IS-3. Fitted with additional jettisonable external fuel tanks and improved hull welding.
;IS-4: 1944 design, in competition against the IS-3. Longer hull and thicker armor than IS-2. About 250 were built, after the war.
;IS-6: Prototype with an experimental electrical transmission. Chassis tested further with a conventional transmission after failure of the experimental system, but not deemed a significant enough improvement over existing heavy tank designs to warrant mass production.
;IS-7:1946 prototype, only three built. The IS-7 model 1948 variant had a weight of 68 metric tons and it was armed with the 130 mm S-70 naval cannon (7020 mm long barrel). The assisted loader can achieve up to 8 rounds per minute. Other equipment included stabilizers, infrared night scopes, and 8 machine guns. The hull armor was 150 mm placed at 50~52 degree angles. On the turret, the frontal thickness was 240–350 mm at an angle of 45-0 degrees. The IS-7 had a crew of five, with the driver in the hull, the commander and gunner in the front of the turret, with both loaders in the rear of the turret. A Slostin machine gun was to be installed as its AA armament.
;IS-8 (T-10): 1952 improvement with a longer hull, seven pairs of road wheels instead of six, a larger turret mounting a new gun with fume extractor, an improved diesel engine, and increased armor. Renamed T-10 as part of the Destalinization of the Soviet Union in the 1950s.

<doc id="188218" wikidata="Q4117792" url="?curid=188218" title="Vocal cord cyst">
<text>Vocal fold cysts (also known as &quot;vocal cord cysts&quot;) are benign masses of the membranous vocal folds. These cysts are enclosed, sac-like structures that are typically of a yellow or white colour. They occur unilaterally on the midpoint of the medial edge of the vocal folds. They can also form on the upper/superior, surface of the vocal folds. There are two types of vocal fold cysts:

# Sub-epithelial vocal fold cysts- located in the superficial lamina propria of the vocal folds.
# Ligament vocal fold cysts- located within the deeper layers of the lamina propria or on the vocal ligament.

The symptoms of vocal fold cysts vary but most commonly include a hoarse voice and problems with the pitch of the voice. Vocal fold cysts are diagnosed based on gathering a case history, perceptual examination, and laryngeal imaging. Practicing good vocal hygiene is recommended to prevent vocal fold cysts. Initial treatment of the cysts involves voice therapy to reduce harmful vocal behaviours. If symptoms remain after voice therapy, patients may require surgery to remove the cyst. Surgery is typically followed by vocal rest and further voice therapy to improve voice function. Cysts may also be treated using vocal fold steroid injection.

== Histology ==

The vocal folds consist of 3 primary layers; the Epithelium, the Lamina Propria (containing superficial, intermediate and deep layers) and the Thyroarytenoid Muscle. Vocal fold cysts commonly appear in the Superficial portion of the Lamina Propria, the cyst size impacts the nature of this layer making it more rigid. The border of vocal fold cysts contains squamous or epithelial cells. In the case of retention cysts, the border consists of glandular epithelium. Epidermoid cysts closely resemble epidermal cysts that can occur anywhere in the body.

== Types of vocal cord cysts ==
Sub-epithelial cysts (also known as &quot;mucous retention cysts&quot;) are closed lesions that occur from a build-up of tissue on the vocal folds. They are typically found in the middle portion of the upper lamina propria of the vocal folds. Sub-epithelial cysts are small and white in colour. Their presence on the vocal folds usually does not disrupt the vibration of the vocal folds for speech (known as the &quot;mucosal wave&quot;).

Ligament cysts (also known as &quot;epidermoid cysts&quot;) are closed lesions that occur near the vocal ligament in the deep layers of the lamina propria. Ligament cysts are usually larger in size than sub-epithelial cysts. They are yellow in colour and unlike sub-epithelial cysts, their presence is usually observed to disrupt the mucosal wave of the vocal folds in the region around the cyst.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Sub-epithelial vocal fold cysts and ligament vocal fold cysts are characterized by similar symptoms. The presence and severity of symptoms may be influenced by the location and size of the cyst.

Common symptoms include:

* Hoarse voice
* Inability to produce high pitch notes
* Fatigue when speaking
* Limited pitch range
* Pain near the larynx
* Variations in pitch when speaking

Signs and symptoms of vocal fold cysts may remain stable or increase over time. In rare cases it is also possible for symptoms to improve if the cyst ruptures spontaneously. Symptoms affecting quality of voice tend to worsen after speaking for long periods of time, or when speaking with increased volume. Many individuals who use their voice professionally find even a slight presence of symptoms to be problematic. However, some voice professionals are not impacted by the presence of vocal cysts.

== Vocal dynamics ==
Vocal fold cysts cause the properties of the vocal folds to change. When a cyst is present on a vocal fold, the cover of the vocal fold becomes more stiff and increases in mass. The increased mass and stiffness tends to result in hyperkinetic muscular movement during phonation. Hyperkinetic movement is characterized by increased rigidity in the affected vocal fold(s). This hyperkinetic movement results in the voice being perceived as hoarse. (see Signs and Symptoms) Specifically, the presence of a vocal fold cyst leads to an asynchronous mucosal wave of the vocal folds during phonation.

== Causes ==
There are several possible causes of vocal fold cysts: 
# They can be congenital.
# They can result from the blockage of a mucous gland&#x27;s excretory duct. In this case, they are sometimes referred to as retention cysts.
# They can be the result of phonotrauma. Phonotrauma refers to behaviours that can lead to vocal fold injuries, such as vocal overuse (i.e. too much speaking), vocal misuse (i.e. speaking in an unnaturally high or low pitch), or vocal abuse (i.e. yelling or whispering for prolonged periods). Vocal folds vibrate during phonation resulting in repeated collisions of the right and left vocal folds. Phonotrauma subjects the vocal folds to excessive mechanical forces during these vibratory cycles, which can lead to the development of a wound. It is the healing of these wounds, which leads to tissue re-structuring, that can result in a vocal fold cyst.

== Diagnosis ==
There are generally four components included in the full diagnosis of a vocal cord cyst: a medical and voice history, a head and neck exam, a perceptual assessment of the voice and imaging of the vocal folds. A medical and voice history can help distinguish patterns of misuse and phonotrauma to assist in diagnosis. The primary perceptual sign of vocal fold cysts is hoarseness of the voice. Diagnosis through perceptual means alone is difficult, therefore in the fourth component of diagnosis the patient often undergoes an imaging procedure. Imaging is most commonly done with laryngeal videostroboscopy. A videostroboscopy is an examination of the vocal folds using flashes of light to slow down the image of the vocal fold movement enough to provide a sharp picture of the phases of the movement cycle (mucosal wave.) This procedure provides information about vocal fold vibrations during speech, vocal intensity and vocal frequency. Imaging shows the reduced movement of the vocal folds (mucosal wave) when a vocal fold cyst is present. Further, videostroboscopy tends to show increased submucosal swelling in the affected areas of the vocal fold(s) More recently, other technologies have been introduced to assist with obtaining imaging of the vocal folds, including the use of Narrow-band imaging (NBI.) Narrow-band imaging involves the use of blue and yellow lights to improve the picture quality of an image and accentuate blood vessel visibility. NBI has been found to help improve visual identification of vocal fold cysts in some cases.

Vocal fold cysts can be differentiated from other vocal fold growths as they are usually unilateral. The two types of vocal fold cysts (sub-epithelial and ligament cysts) can be differentiated by colour, size and location. (See section on Types of vocal cord cysts for more information.)

If the vocal fold cyst(s) are presumed to be congenital, the patient should have a history of presenting with a hoarse voice.

Patients with vocal fold cysts are considered for surgery when presenting with:
* Dysphonia
* Lack of improvement through voice therapy

== Prevention ==
A key aspect of preventing vocal fold cysts is good vocal hygiene. Good vocal hygiene promotes the healthy use of the vocal apparatus and the avoidance of phonotrauma. Good vocal hygiene practices involve the avoidance of:
* Shouting
* Whispering loudly or for long periods of time
* Frequently of talking over loud background noise
* Talking while yawning
* Continual clearing of the throat
* Speaking in an unnatural voice (i.e. too high or low)
* Talking with a cold or laryngitis
* Smoking tobacco or marijuana
* The consumption of alcohol and coffee
* The use of antihistamines, aspirin, steroids, tricyclic antidepressants, or any substance that alters perception (i.e. sleeping pills)
* Foul air
In addition, good vocal hygiene involves getting enough rest and drinking sufficient water. It is important to keep the vocal fold tissue healthy and hydrated, and when possible to limit the quantity of speaking in order to avoid damage.

== Treatment ==
Vocal fold cysts are treated using a multidisciplinary approach. Vocal fold cysts are most responsive when surgical intervention is supplemented with voice therapy. Applying vocal therapy techniques in isolation has not yet been proven to remediate and decrease the actual size of the vocal fold cyst.

Voice therapy to address harmful vocal behaviours is recommended as the first treatment option. Voice therapy may involve reducing tension in the larynx, reducing loudness, reducing the amount of speech produced, and modifying the environment. If symptoms are significant, treatment usually involves microsurgery to remove the cyst. Although voice therapy is useful for preventing vocal fold cysts caused by phonotrauma and for promoting safe vocal practices, vocal fold cysts tend not to respond to therapy alone and typically require surgery for full repair.

During surgery, attempts are made to preserve as much vocal fold tissue as possible, given that glottal insufficiency (a gap in the vocal folds) is a possible consequence of surgery. Vocal fold tissue can be preserved during surgery by raising a micro-flap, removing the cyst, then laying the flap back down. This is intended to lead to minimal scarring and improved voice function. However, if any epithelium from the cyst sac is left behind during surgery, the cyst may regrow. Surgery of the larynx may also be conducted using a CO2 laser, which was reported as early as the 1970s. Congenital ductal cysts (those caused by blockage of a glandular duct) may be treated by marsupialization.

Following surgery, patients are recommended to take 2 to 14 days of vocal rest. In absolute vocal rest, activities such as talking, whispering, whistling, straining, coughing, and sneezing are restricted. Once adequate healing has occurred, the patient may be transitioned to relative vocal rest, which typically involves 5 to 10 minutes of breathy voicing per hour. Voice therapy is then required to restore as much function as possible. Post-operative voice therapy may include addressing harmful vocal behaviours, exercises to restrengthen the larynx, and reintegration into normal voice activities.

Professional voice users who do not experience substantial limitations due to their cysts may choose to forego surgery. Considering that some cysts remain stable over long periods of time, voice therapy alone may be an option for those who are resistant to surgery. Another option for those who are unwilling to undergo surgery is vocal fold steroid injection (VFSI). Injection of the vocal folds may be done transorally or percutaneously, through the thyrohyoid membrane, thyroid cartilage, or cricothyroid membrane. After VFSI, patients are recommended to take 1 to 7 days of vocal rest. VFSI may also be used to delay surgery, or as a treatment method when the risks associated with surgery are deemed to be too high.

== Prognosis ==
Following diagnosis, voice therapy should be implemented to optimize vocal hygiene. Vocal fold cysts tend not to improve solely through vocal rest or vocal therapy.

Patients with sub-epithelial cysts have a better prognosis for timely recovery of vocal abilities than patients with ligament vocal fold cysts. Typically, patients can resume speaking activities in 7–30 days following surgery, and singing activities 30–90 days post-surgery.

Up to 20% of patients show scarring, polyps or vascular changes of the vocal folds following surgery. In severe cases, these resulting symptoms may require further surgery. The patient must always be aware of the impact and potential complications of surgery on their voice, especially if the voice is heavily used occupationally. In these cases, post-operative therapy should be discussed.

<doc id="188219" wikidata="Q786896" url="?curid=188219" title="Reinke's edema">
<text>Reinke&#x27;s edema is the swelling of the vocal cords due to fluid (Edema) collected within the Reinke&#x27;s space. First identified by the German anatomist Friedrich B. Reinke in 1895, the Reinke&#x27;s space is a gelatinous layer of the vocal cord located underneath the outer cells of the vocal cord. When a person speaks, the Reinke&#x27;s space vibrates to allow for sound to be produced (phonation). The Reinke&#x27;s space is sometimes referred to as the superficial lamina propria.

Reinke&#x27;s edema is characterized by the &quot;sac-like&quot; appearance of the fluid-filled vocal cords. The swelling of the vocal folds causes the voice to become deep and hoarse. Therefore, the major symptom of Reinke&#x27;s edema is a hoarseness similar to laryngitis. The major cause associated with Reinke&#x27;s edema is smoking. In fact, 97 percent of patients diagnosed with Reinke&#x27;s edema are habitual smokers. Other identified risk factors include overuse of the vocal cords, gastroesophageal reflux, and hypothyroidism. The disease is more often cited in women than in men, because lower voice changes are more noticeable in women.

The first cases of Reinke&#x27;s edema were recorded in 1891 by M. Hajek, followed by F. Reinke in 1895. In his investigations, Reinke injected a stained glue into the superficial lamina propria (Reinke&#x27;s space) to mimic edema. Reinke&#x27;s edema is considered to be a benign (non-cancercous) polyp (protrusion) that represents 10% of all benign laryngeal pathologies. Treatment of Reinke&#x27;s edema starts with the elimination of associated risk factors, such as smoking, gastric reflux, and hypothyroidism. Advanced cases may undergo phonosurgery to remove the fluid from the vocal cords.

== Signs and symptoms ==
List of common symptoms:
* A &quot;sac-like&quot; appearance of the vocal folds
* Hoarseness and deepening of the voice
* Trouble speaking (dysphonia)
* Reduced vocal range with diminished upper limits
* Stretching of the mucosa ()
* Shortness of breath (dyspnoea)

Reinke&#x27;s edema is characterized by a &quot;sac-like&quot; appearance of the vocal folds. The edema is a white translucent fluid that causes a bulging () of the vocal cord. The most common clinical symptom associated with Reinke&#x27;s edema is an abnormally low pitched voice with hoarseness. The low pitch voice is a direct result of increased fluid in the Reinke&#x27;s space, which vibrates at a lower frequency than normal (females &lt;130 Hz; males &lt;110 Hz). Hoarseness is a common problem of many laryngeal diseases, such as laryngitis. It is described as a harsh and breathy tone of voice. Hoarseness is often seen alongside dysphonia, a condition in which the individual has difficulty producing the sounds of speech normally.

The swelling of the vocal cords and the lowering of the voice are warning signs that an individual has Reinke&#x27;s edema. At the microscopic level, an examination of the vocal cords in patients with Reinke&#x27;s edema will show lowered levels of collagen, elastin, and extracellular matrix proteins. These characteristics can be used to diagnose Reinke&#x27;s edema. Reinke&#x27;s edema is considered a benign tumor or polyp that may become precancerous if smoking is involved. An indicator of cancer is the development of leukoplakia, which manifests as white patches on the vocal folds.

Smoking, gastric reflux, and hypothyroidism are all risk factors for Reinke&#x27;s edema. The symptoms of Reinke&#x27;s edema are considered to be chronic symptoms because they develop gradually over time and depend on how long the individual is exposed to the risk factor. In the case of smoking, as long as the individual continues the habit of smoking, the Reinke&#x27;s edema will continue to progress. This is true for other risk factors as well, such as untreated gastric reflux and overuse of the voice, which is common to professions such as singers and radio announcers.

==Causes==
Smoking is the number one cause of Reinke&#x27;s edema. Other factors include gastroesophageal reflux, hypothyroidism and chronic overuse of the voice. Smoking and reflux are the only risk factors that may lead to cancer. Additionally, the combination of several risk factors increase the likelihood of an individual developing Reinke&#x27;s edema. For example, an individual who smokes and also has gastric reflux would have an increased susceptibility for developing Reinke&#x27;s edema over time.

Reinke&#x27;s edema is commonly diagnosed in middle-aged females with a history of smoking (aged 50 years or older). Because males have lower pitched voices than females, males are less likely to observe significant changes in the voice and are therefore less likely to seek treatment. Females also report more physical discomfort due to Reinke&#x27;s edema. The risk of Reinke&#x27;s edema increases with age and also with prolonged exposure to smoking. Additionally, individuals in professions that require constant use of the voice, such as singers, teachers, and radio hosts, may be at an increased risk for developing the disease.

Because the disease is heavily linked to smoking, there is no established way to screen for Reinke&#x27;s edema. Similarly, the only way to prevent Reinke&#x27;s edema is to avoid smoking. By adopting a non-smoking lifestyle after being diagnosed with Reinke&#x27;s edema, it is possible to stop the disease&#x27;s progression, although it is not possible to reverse it. Therefore, it is critical to maintain a non-smoking lifestyle even after surgery, because the fluid can re-emerge. In fact, in many cases surgeons will not perform surgery without the guarantee that the individual will stop smoking.

==Mechanism==

The vocal cords consist of five layers of cells:
* Squamous epithelium
* Superficial lamina propria (Reinke&#x27;s space) 
* Intermediate lamina propria 
* Deep lamina propria 
* Vocalis muscle 
In order for humans to produce sound for speech, the vocal folds must readily vibrate. The two layers of the vocal cords that vibrate are the Reinke&#x27;s space and the overlying epithelium. In fact, these layers move freely over the more rigid intermediate and deep lamina proprias. Accumulation of fluid within the Reinke&#x27;s space alters the elasticity of the vocal cord, making it less stiff and more gelatinous. This slows the vocal cord vibration, which results in a deepened and hoarse voice. Because men normally have a lower voice than women, the change is more noticeable in women.

Edema usually occurs on both vocal cords. This is known as bilateral Reinke&#x27;s edema. The pathophysiology or mechanism of Reinke&#x27;s edema is not well known, however, chemicals contained within cigarette smoke are associated with an increased vascular permeability of blood vessels, which results in fluid leaking into the Reinke&#x27;s space. Normally, the vocal cords are surrounded by neatly aligned blood vessels, however, these blood vessels can become disarranged and fragile in Reinke&#x27;s edema. In addition, cigarette smoke can create reactive oxygen species that alter the environment of the vocal cords. Tissue analysis of Reinke&#x27;s edema shows decreased amounts of the proteins fibronectin, elastin, collagens I and III, and extracellular matrix proteins. This leads to an overall decreased stiffness of the tissue layer, which vibrates more slowly and produces a deeper sounding voice.

The progression of Reinke&#x27;s edema is gradual and is directly related to the duration of exposure to risk factors, such as smoking and gastric reflux. Disease progression is divided into two types: &quot;pale&quot; and &quot;livid&quot;. The &quot;pale&quot; type is defined by a glazed appearance of the vocal cords with a clear (colorless) fluid underneath. This represents the early stage of the disease. The advanced &quot;livid&quot; type of Reinke&#x27;s edema is identified by an increased amount of fluid, accompanied by fluid color change from colorless to yellow-grey. The swelling of the vocal folds cause ballooned-like appearance, known as a polyp. The polyps of Reinke&#x27;s edema are usually benign, however, there may be a risk of cancer if the patient is a smoker. Additionally, if the edema becomes too severe, patients may experience difficulty breathing due to airway obstruction.

== Diagnosis ==

Reinke&#x27;s edema is often diagnosed by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (an Otorhinolaryngologist or Otolaryngologist) by examination of the vocal folds (&quot;cords&quot;). First, the doctor will review the patient&#x27;s medical history and symptoms, such as hoarseness, dysphonia, and reduced vocal range. There is no familial or hereditary link to Reinke&#x27;s edema. The doctor will need to know if the patient is a habitual smoker. Once the patient&#x27;s history is reviewed, the vocal cords will be visualized using laryngoscopy, a technique in which a tube with a camera (endoscope) is passed through the nose and down the larynx. Laryngoscopes can be rigid or flexible. Flexible laryngoscopes, such as fiber laryngoscopes, allow the patient to produce sound as the tube is placed, and therefore allows the doctor to visualize movement of the vocal cord. The use of rigid laryngoscopes generally requires general anaesthesia due to the discomfort involved in distracting the soft tissues of the mouth and pharynx.

Based on the results of the laryngoscopy, Reinke&#x27;s edema can be classified using a standardized system set in place by Yonekawa. This system characterizes the disease based on severity.

Yonekawa Classification:
* Grade I – Lesions contact the anterior third of the vocal fold
* Grade II – Lesions contact the anterior two-thirds of the vocal fold
* Grade III – Lesions contact the entirety of the vocal fold
If further evaluation is needed, stroboscopy is used to examine the mucosal waves of the vocal cords. Mucosal waves describe the waves produced by vibration of the vocal cords during speech. Stroboscopes produce flashes of light that are timed to the patient&#x27;s vocal frequency. Every time the light is flashed, it will create a still frame image of the vocal cords at that particular moment in time. These are combined to produce an image of the wave. In the case of Reinke&#x27;s edema, structural changes to the vocal cords will result in abnormal wave patterns.

==Treatment==
The first step in treating Reinke&#x27;s edema is to eliminate or control those risk factors that are causing the disease. This includes the cessation of smoking, the control of gastroesophageal reflux using antacids or proton-pump inhibitors (eg, Protonix®), and the discontinuation of activities that cause vocal distress. Those experiencing a hoarseness of the voice may choose to undergo voice therapy to improve the voice&#x27;s quality and range. Most cases of Reinke&#x27;s edema are caused by the long term usage of cigarettes. In this case, it is important to make lifestyle changes to stop smoking. While this will not resolve or improve the edema, the cessation of smoking will halt the disease&#x27;s progression.

If the elimination of risk factors is not sufficient to improve the patient&#x27;s symptoms, surgery may be required. The most common type of surgery performed today for Reinke&#x27;s edema is called surgical microlaryngoscopy. Most procedures follow the microflap technique set in place by Hirano. During surgery, an incision is made into the vocal cord using either microscissors or a Carbon dioxide laser (CO2). A flap of mucous membrane is lifted and the affected tissue is removed using suction or a microdebrider. The flap is then re-draped and trimmed to the appropriate size.

Most cases of Reinke&#x27;s edema are bilateral −affecting both vocal cords− rather than unilateral. In the case of bilateral edema, the surgeon must choose whether to operate each side of the vocal cord in two separate surgeries or to operate both sides in a single surgery. The complication associated with removing tissue from both sides in a single surgery is that the raw, cut ends of the vocal cords may form an anterior glottis web, in which the two sides grow together in a continuous sheet. Other complications of surgery include tissue scarring due to damage to the vocal ligament during the incision and vocal cord stiffening due to over-suctioning of the superficial lamina propria (Reinke&#x27;s space).

While surgical microlaryngoscopy has its associated risks, if left untreated, Reinke&#x27;s edema can lead to a variety of long-term complications. Besides dysphonia (impaired sound production for speech), the most serious of these complications is airway obstruction due to severe inflammation of the vocal cords. The risk of complications has decreased drastically with the creation of new tools, such as the CO2 laser for surgical microlaryngoscopy. Before the Hirano microflap method was developed in 1895, vocal stripping was the most common procedure used to correct Reinke&#x27;s edema. Vocal stripping was often performed without magnification and with a monocular laryngoscope, instead of a binocular scope. This led to major complications such as vocal ligament scarring.

Women are more likely than men to undergo surgery due to a greater change in vocal pitch and quality. Surgery is capable of restoring the voice, with the condition that smoking is not resumed after surgery. Reinke&#x27;s edema is not a life-limiting pathology unless the tissue becomes precancerous.

== Research ==
Recent studies have examined the role of specific cell types in Reinke&#x27;s edema, including the role of vocal cord fibroblasts. In normal tissue, these spindle-shaped CD34+ fibroblasts produce extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and elastin. Recent findings have shown a morphological change in fibroblasts extracted from the tissue of Reinke&#x27;s edema to a more dendritic-like shape with several protrusions. Large populations of these altered CD34+ fibroblasts have been found surrounding the areas of edema. They lack normal expression of several cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins and express additional proteins that are not expressed in normal vocal cord fibroblasts. Cigarette smoke was discovered to increase COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) expression in fibroblasts, which could explain the role of cigarette smoke in Reinke&#x27;s edema.

While smoking is a clear risk factor for Reinke&#x27;s edema, others are being investigated to explain Reinke&#x27;s edema in nonsmokers. Research has suggested the role of bacterial colonies in non-neoplastic lesions such as Reinke&#x27;s edema. In one study using pyrosequencing, thirty-one of the forty-four non-neoplastic lesions sampled were found to have &quot;Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae&quot; bacterial strains as the dominant bacteria present. Species of &quot;Streptococcus&quot; were present in every lesion analyzed, representing 72.9% of all bacteria found specifically within Reinke&#x27;s edema lesions and 68.7% of bacteria across all the vocal fold lesions sequenced. While smoking, gastric reflux, and vocal abuse have been more widely agreed upon in literature as risk factors for Reinke&#x27;s edema, the altered bacterial cultures could be developed as a diagnostic tool in the future.

The majority of the research within the last ten years focuses on improving surgery for Reinke&#x27;s edema. Due to the importance of the Reinke&#x27;s space in speech, it is important that minimally-invasive techniques be perfected that minimize the risk of complications. The carbon dioxide laser has been successfully incorporated into the surgical technique; there are several other lasers being investigated for use in Reinke&#x27;s edema. These include photoangiolytic lasers and potassium titanyl phosphate lasers.

<doc id="188222" wikidata="Q193211" url="?curid=188222" title="Cyst">
<text>A cyst is a closed , having a distinct envelope and division compared with the nearby tissue. Hence, it is a cluster of cells that have grouped together to form a sac (like the manner in which water molecules group together to form a bubble); however, the distinguishing aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the &quot;shell&quot; of such a sac are distinctly abnormal (in both appearance and behaviour) when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location. A cyst may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of pus is called an abscess, not a cyst. Once formed, a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically, but that would depend upon its type and location.

Cancer-related cysts are formed as a defense mechanism for the body following the development of mutations that lead to an uncontrolled cellular division. Once that mutation has occurred, the affected cells divide incessantly and become cancerous, forming a tumor. The body encapsulates those cells to try to prevent them from continuing their division and contain the tumor, which becomes known as a cyst. That said, the cancerous cells still may mutate further and gain the ability to form their own blood vessels, from which they receive nourishment before being contained. Once that happens, the capsule becomes useless, and the tumor may advance from benign to cancerous.

Some cysts are neoplastic, and thus are called cystic tumors. Many types of cysts are not neoplastic, they are dysplastic or metaplastic. &quot;Pseudocysts&quot; are similar to cysts in that they have a sac filled with fluid, but lack an epithelial lining.

==Terminology==

* &quot;microcyst – a&quot; small cyst that requires magnification to be seen
* &quot;macrocyst –&quot; a cyst that is larger than usual or compared to others

==Related structures==
A &quot;pseudocyst&quot; is very similar to a cyst, but is a collection of cells without a distinct membrane (epithelial or endothelial cells).

A &quot;syrinx&quot; in the spinal cord or brainstem is sometimes inaccurately referred to as a &quot;cyst&quot;.

==Cysts by location==
===Female reproductive system===

*Nabothian cyst (on the surface of the cervix)

*Paratubal cyst (in front of fallopian tube behind the ovary)

*Vaginal cysts
**Gartner&#x27;s duct cyst (lateral to vaginal wall)
**Bartholin&#x27;s cyst (at vaginal introitus)
**Skene&#x27;s duct cyst (beside the urinary meatus)
**Ectopic ureterocoele (around the urinary meatus)
**Urethral diverticulum (in front of vaginal wall)

=== Male reproductive system ===
* Rete tubular ectasia (within the rete testis)
* Epididymal cyst (in the epididymis)
* Hydrocele testis (testicle): clear fluid within the cavum vaginale
* Spermatocele (testicle): fluid within the head of epididymis

===Cutaneous and subcutaneous===
* Acne cyst – Pseudocysts associated with cystic acne - an inflammatory nodule with or without an associated epidermoid inclusion cyst
* Arachnoid cyst (between the surface of the brain and the cranial base or on the arachnoid membrane)
* Epidermoid cyst
* Myxoid cyst (cutaneous condition often characterized by nail plate depression and grooves)
* Pilar cyst (cyst of the scalp)
* Pilonidal cyst (skin infection near tailbone)
* Sebaceous cyst – sac below skin
* Trichilemmal cyst – same as a pilar cyst, a familial cyst of the scalp

===Head and neck===

* Odontogenic cyst
* Ceruminous cyst (ear)
* Chalazion cyst (eyelid)
* Mucous cyst of the oral mucosa
* Nasolabial cyst
* Nasopalatine duct cyst
* Thyroglossal cyst
* Vocal fold cyst

===Chest===
* Fibrous cyst (breast cyst)
* Pulmonary cyst (air pocket in the lung)
* Pericardial cyst (abnormal dilatation of pericardium)

===Abdomen===
* Liver cysts
** Simple cysts
** Hydatid cysts
** Biliary cystadenoma
** Biliary cystadenocarcinoma
** Polycystic liver disease
* Adrenal cyst (glands located above the kidneys) - It is a rare disease, affecting 0.06 to 0.18% of autopsy studies. It constitutes 5.4 to 6.0% of adrenal gland diseases. There are five major types of adrenal cysts: simple or endothelial cysts, true or epithelial cysts, pseudocysts, parasitic cysts, and cysts not classified elsewhere. 7% of the cysts can be malignant.
* Renal cyst (kidneys)
* Pancreatic cyst
* Peritoneal inclusion cyst (lining of the abdominal cavity) - It is a cluster of fluid-filled cysts lining the abdominal cavity of reproductive age women with a history of pelvic, abdominal surgeries, or abdominal inflammation. Those affected maybe presented with an abdominal, pelvic, lower back that lasted for months.
*Enteric duplication cyst

===Central nervous system===
* Choroid plexus cyst 
* Colloid cyst 
* Pineal gland cyst (in the pineal gland in the brain)
* Glial cyst
* Tarlov cyst (spinal canal)

===Musculoskeletal system===
* Aneurysmal bone cyst, a benign bone tumor with a radiographic cystic appearance.
* Baker&#x27;s cyst or popliteal cyst (behind the knee joint)
* Mucoid cyst (ganglion cysts of the digits)
* Stafne static bone cyst (an anatomic variant with radiographic cystic appearance in the posterior mandible)
* Subchondral cyst (cysts near the bony joints)

===Seen in various locations===
* Dermoid cyst (seen in ovaries, testes, and many other locations, from head to tailbone)
* Ganglion cyst (hand and foot joints and tendons)
* Mucoid cyst (ganglion cysts of the digits)

==Infectious cysts==
* Cysticercal cyst – an infection due to the larval stage of &quot;Taenia sp.&quot; (Crain&#x27;s backs)
* Hydatid cyst – an infection in the liver or other parts of the body due to the larval stage of &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot; (tapeworm)

== Neoplastic cysts ==
* Dermoid cyst
* Keratocystic odontogenic tumor
* Calcifying odontogenic cyst

==Treatment==
Treatment ranges from simple enucleation of the cyst to curettage to resection. There are cysts—e.g., buccal bifurcation cyst—that resolve on their own, in which just close observation may be employed, unless it is infected and symptomatic.

==Cystic fibrosis==
Despite being described in 1938 as &quot;the microscopic appearance of cysts in the pancreas&quot;, cystic fibrosis is an example of a genetic disorder whose name is related to fibrosis of the cystic duct (which serves the gallbladder) and does not involve cysts.

This is just one example of how the Greek root &quot;cyst-&quot;, which simply means a fluid-filled sac, also is found in medical terms that relate to the urinary bladder and the gallbladder, neither of which involve cysts.

<doc id="188225" wikidata="Q1069116" url="?curid=188225" title="Medium tank">
<text>A medium tank is a classification of tanks, particularly prevalent during World War II, which represented a compromise between the mobility oriented light tanks and the armour and armament oriented heavy tanks. A medium tank&#x27;s classification is not actually based on weight, but on tactical usage and intended purpose; for instance the German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank has a mass similar to contemporary Allied heavy tanks. The most widely produced, cost effective and successful tanks of World War II (the German Panzer IV, the Soviet T-34, and the American M4 Sherman) were all medium tank designs. Many of the medium tank lines became what are called main battle tanks in most countries.

==History==
The first tanks to carry the name &quot;Medium&quot; appeared in the First World War with the British Medium Mark A Whippet. It was smaller, lighter and faster than the British heavy tanks of the time and only carried machine guns.

The medium tank doctrine came into use in the interwar period. Its existence outlasted the super-heavy tank and the heavy tank and gradually transitioned into the main battle tank.

Medium tanks of the interwar period included the British Vickers Medium Mark II and the Soviet multi-turreted T-28.
In the period leading up to World War II, the British stopped using the term Medium for their tanks as the new philosophy of &#x27;Cruiser tank&#x27; and &#x27;Infantry tank&#x27; which defined tanks by role rather than size came into use.
There were medium tanks that focused on anti-infantry capabilities (such as in World War II: the initial short-barrel gun Panzer IV, and the initial 75 mm gun M4 Sherman), and medium tanks which were more focused on the anti-tank role, mounting high-velocity tank guns. The French cavalry tanks (&quot;Chars de Cavalerie&quot;) such as the SOMUA S35 focused on speed in addition to power and protection of the other designs. They were similar to what other countries called medium tanks.

When Soviet tank designers were preparing a successor to the BT tank series, they combined its excellent mobility with thick, sloped armour and the unprecedented firepower of a 76.2 mm high-velocity gun. The result was the T-34 medium tank, whose superb capabilities shocked the German Wehrmacht when it invaded the Soviet Union. The lessons of Blitzkrieg, first employed by the Germans and eventually adopted by other nations, found their best expression in formations of mutually-supporting medium tanks and motorised infantry. The traditional view of infantry and cavalry tank roles was rendered obsolete.

Both the Soviet Union and the United States benefited from their industrial capacity to manufacture a well-balanced medium tank in very large numbers — around 57,000 T-34 and 49,234 M4 Sherman tanks were built during the war.

===Cold War===

During and after World War II, the roles of light tanks were gradually taken over by less-expensive armoured cars and specialised reconnaissance vehicles. Heavy tanks, having shown their limitations in combat, experienced a limited post-war arms race of progressively more heavily armed and armoured designs. With the rise of more sophisticated anti-tank missile weapons, to which heavy tanks had demonstrated high vulnerability, these too were eventually phased out. With advances in technology, aspects such as mobility, armour and weaponry pushed the medium tank to form the core of a country&#x27;s armoured fighting capability, eventually merging into the main battle tank. Simpler and more economical self-propelled guns, and later anti-tank guided missiles, came to fulfill some fire-support and anti-tank roles, thus shifting the tactical approach how tanks were used.

Although the term &quot;medium tank&quot; classification has largely fallen out of use after World War II, the term is informally used to describe some first and second-generation main battle tanks which fall between 20 and 50 tons, such as the Leopard 1 and T-72 each of which weigh around 40 short tons, while third and subsequent generations have increased markedly in weight and have included some of the heaviest main battle tanks such as the M1 Abrams which is over 60 short tons. In the 1990s the &quot;medium&quot; main battle tanks still proved useful, such as the Canadian Leopard 1 tanks deployed to Kosovo in 1999 which were much better suited to the poor roads and soft ground than the French armoured cars there, but were still able to move along narrow streets and over lighter bridge classifications than the much heavier M1 Abrams tanks used by the Americans.

==Role==
The role of medium tanks started with a prioritisation of speed. Medium tanks could travel faster, but needed help to cross trenches, where heavy tanks were large enough to cross unaided. In British use, this evolved into the Cruiser tank class, while other tank doctrines formed around the medium tank making the main advance.

In this later use, medium tanks represent the designer&#x27;s intent of producing a successful balance of firepower, mobility, and protection. Medium tanks aim to be suitable to the widest variety of roles, with less reliance on other types of tank during normal operations.

<doc id="188226" wikidata="Q711378" url="?curid=188226" title="John Moore (British Army officer)">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore (13 November 1761 – 16 January 1809) was a British Army officer and politician. He is best known for his military training reforms and for his death at the Battle of Corunna, in which he repulsed a French army under Marshal Soult during the Peninsular War.

After the war General Sarrazin wrote a French history of the battle, in which he said: &quot;Whatever Bonaparte may assert, Soult was most certainly repulsed at Corunna; and the British gained a defensive victory, though dearly purchased with the loss of their brave general Moore, who was alike distinguished for his private virtues, and his military talents.&quot;

==Early years==
John Moore was born in Glasgow, the son of John Moore, a doctor and writer, and the older brother of Admiral Sir Graham Moore. He attended Glasgow High School, but at the age of 11 joined his father and Douglas, the young 16-year-old 8th Duke of Hamilton (1756–1799), his father&#x27;s pupil, on a grand tour of France, Italy and Germany. This included a two-year stay in Geneva, where Moore&#x27;s education continued.

== Military and political career 1776–1798 ==

He joined the British Army in 1776 as an ensign in the 51st Regiment of Foot then based in Menorca. He first saw action in 1778 during the American War of Independence as a lieutenant in the 82nd Regiment of Foot, which was raised in Lanarkshire for service in North America by the 8th Duke of Hamilton. From 1779 to 1781 he was garrisoned at Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1779, he distinguished himself in action during the Penobscot Expedition in present-day Maine, when a small British detachment held off a much larger American force until reinforcements arrived. After the war, in 1783, he returned to Britain and in 1784 was elected to Parliament as the Member for Lanark Burghs, a seat he held until 1790.

In 1787, he was made Major and joined the 60th briefly before returning to the 51st. In 1791, his unit was assigned to the Mediterranean and he was involved in campaigning in the invasion of Corsica and was wounded at Calvi. He was given a Colonelcy and became Adjutant-General to Sir Charles Stuart.

Friction between Moore and the new British viceroy of Corsica led to his recall and posting to the West Indies under Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1796. Moore played a leading role in the British recapture of Saint Lucia, which at the time was under the nominal control of the French as a result of a successful invasion by French Republican administrator Victor Hugues. During the campaign, Moore retook Fort Charlotte with the 27th Inniskilling Fusiliers after two days of bitter fighting. The regiment was honoured for their actions in capturing the fort by having their regimental colour displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at Morne Fortune for an hour, before being hauled down and replaced by the British flag. Upon the capture of the fort, Abercromby departed the island, placing Moore in charge of the British garrison. Moore remained at this post until falling with yellow fever, upon which he was repatriated to Britain.

==Moore in Ireland 1798==
In 1798, he was made Major-General and served in the suppression of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. His personal intervention was credited with turning the tide at the Battle of Foulksmills on 20 June and he regained control of Wexford town before General Gerard Lake could, thereby possibly preventing its sacking.

==Moore and military training==

In 1799, he commanded a brigade in the Helder Expedition, with the campaign failing after the British and Russian forces failed to overcome entrenched Dutch defenders. Moore himself was seriously injured in the action. He recovered to lead the 52nd regiment during the British campaign in Egypt against the French, having become colonel of that regiment in 1801 on the death of General Cyrus Trapaud.

He returned to Great Britain in 1803 to command a brigade at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Folkestone, where he established the innovative system of drill and manoeuvre. Sir Arthur Bryant wrote: &quot;Moore&#x27;s contribution to the British Army was not only that matchless Light Infantry who have ever since enshrined his training, but also the belief that the perfect soldier can only be made by evoking all that is finest in man – physical, mental and spiritual.&quot;

==War with France 1803–1808==
When it became clear that Napoleon was planning an invasion of Britain, Moore was put in charge of the defence of the coast from Dover to Dungeness. It was on his initiative that the Martello Towers were constructed (complementing the already constructed Shorncliffe Redoubt), following a pattern he had been impressed with in Corsica, where the Torra di Mortella, at Mortella Point, had offered a stout resistance to British land and sea forces. He also initiated the cutting of the Royal Military Canal in Kent and Sussex, and recruited about 340,000 volunteers to a militia that would have defended the lines of the South Downs if an invading force had broken through the regular army defences. In 1804, Moore was made a Knight Companion of the Bath and, in 1805, he was promoted to Lieutenant-General.

In 1806, he returned to active duty in the Mediterranean and then in 1808 in the Baltic with Edward Paget to assist the Swedish. Disagreements with Gustavus IV soon led to his being sent home where he was ordered to Portugal in July 1808.

==Spanish War 1808–1809==

Moore took command of the British forces in the Iberian Peninsula following the recall of Sir Harry Burrard, Sir Hew Dalrymple and Sir Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington) to face the inquiry over the Convention of Cintra on the French troops&#x27; evacuation from Portugal. When Napoleon arrived in Spain with 200,000 men, Moore drew the French northwards while retreating to his embarkation ports of A Coruña and Vigo. Moore established a defensive position on hills outside the town while being guarded by the 15th Hussars. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna, being &quot;struck in his left breast and shoulder by a cannon shot, which broke his ribs, his arm, lacerated his shoulder and the whole of his left side and lungs&quot;. Like Admiral Lord Nelson, he was mortally wounded in battle, surviving long enough to be assured that he had gained a victory. He remained conscious and composed throughout his final hours. Before succumbing to his wounds, Moore confided to his old friend and aide-de-camp, Colonel Paul Anderson: &quot;You know, I always wished to die this way, I hope the people of England will be satisfied! I hope my country will do me justice!&quot; He asked Colonel Anderson to speak to his friends and mother, but became too emotional to continue, and changed the subject. 

He asked if his staff were safe and was assured that they were, and where his will could be found. Casting his eyes around the room, he spied Charles Banks Stanhope and said to him: &quot;Remember me to your sister, Stanhope.&quot; He was then silent and died shortly afterwards.

Moore was buried wrapped in a military cloak in the ramparts of the town. Moore&#x27;s funeral was commemorated in the poem &quot;The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna&quot; by Charles Wolfe (1791–1823), which became popular in 19th-century poetry anthologies. The first verse runs:
&lt;poem&gt;
Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O&#x27;er the grave where our hero we buried.
&lt;/poem&gt;
ending six verses later with:
&lt;poem&gt;
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,
But we left him alone with his glory.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Although the historian Napier attributes the funeral monument to Marshal Soult, it was erected by orders of the Spanish commander, the Marquis de la Romana, when he returned to Corunna after the French abandoned Galicia.

In his native Glasgow he is commemorated by a statue in George Square, and in England by a monument in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral by John Bacon. Houses are named for him at The High School of Glasgow and HM Queen Victoria School, Dunblane. Sir John Moore Avenue is in Hythe Kent near the Royal Military Canal.

<text>NGC 6240, also known as the Starfish Galaxy, is a nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) in the constellation Ophiuchus. It was discovered by French astronomer Édouard Stephan on 12 July 1871.

The galaxy is the remnant of a merger between three smaller galaxies. The collision between the three progenitor galaxies has resulted in a single, larger galaxy with three distinct nuclei and a highly disturbed structure, including faint extensions and loops.

The power sources of ULIRGs in general has been greatly debated. Infrared light from galaxies generally originates from dust in the interstellar medium. ULIRGs are abnormally bright in the infrared. The infrared dust emission in ULIRGs is over one trillion times more luminous than the Sun (i.e. it has an infrared luminosity of ). Astronomers have speculated that either intense star formation regions or active galactic nuclei (which contain supermassive black holes) may be responsible for the intense dust heating that produces this emission, although the general consensus is that both may be present in most ULIRGs. Studying the exact nature of ULIRGs has been difficult, however, because the dust in the centers of these galaxies obscures both visible and near-infrared starlight and because theoretical models of both starbursts and active galactic nuclei have demonstrated that they may look similar. Because NGC 6240 is a nearby example of such a ULIRG, astronomers have studied it intensively to understand its power source.

===X-ray observations===
Observations performed by Stefanie Komossa and collaborators with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory have detected strong hard X-ray emission from both of the nuclei. The intensity of this emission and the presence of emission from lowly ionized or neutral iron indicate that both of the nuclei are active galactic nuclei.
Presumably, these are the black holes that were originally at the centers of the two merging galaxies. Over the course of millions of years, the two black holes are expected to come closer together and form a binary supermassive black hole.
Recent studies by Wolfram Kollatschny and collaborators using the MUSE instrument on board the VLT have revealed that there are in fact three, not two, supermassive black holes at the core of this remnant. Their masses are suggested to be 90 million, 710 million, and 360 million solar masses. Two of the three black holes are active. The additional SMBH implies that three original galaxies are merging instead of two.

== Supernovae ==
Four supernovae have been observed in NGC 6240: SN 2000bg (Type IIn, mag. 17.4), SN 2010gp (type Ia, mag. 17.5), SN 2013dc (Type IIP, mag. 18.7), and PSN J16525760+0223367 (type Ia, mag. 15.8).

== Final stages ==
A galaxy merger is a slow process lasting more than a billion years as two galaxies, under the inexorable pull of gravity, dance toward each other before finally joining together. After research done over the past few years, scientists have concluded that this galaxy has reached its last stages before colliding into one another. Photographic evidence proves that the two nuclei have been growing closer, and in that process, they have been emitting more gasses and stellar winds outward. Those winds evict about 100 solar masses in gases from the galaxy every year. These type of winds and growth of the black holes are known to occur during the last 10 to 20 million years of the merger; it is assumed that this is the amount of time left for the galaxy to finish its collision phase. After this phase, the merged galaxies will become one, becoming a post-merger object until if and when any tidal tails and plumes evaporate.

<text>USS &quot;Brandywine (formerly named Susquehanna&quot;) was a wooden-hulled, three-masted frigate of the United States Navy bearing 44 guns which had the initial task of conveying the Marquis de Lafayette back to France. She was later recommissioned a number of times for service in various theaters, such as in the Mediterranean, in China and in the South Atlantic Ocean.

During several instances she served as a role player in American gunboat diplomacy, a role she was well suited for with her large long-range 32-pounder guns and her short-range carronades which produced fragmentation and fire damage to the ship fired upon, as well as splinter and shrapnel injury to its crew.

==1825: Conveying Marquis de Lafayette to France==
From July 1824 to September 1825, the last surviving French General of the Revolutionary War, the Marquis de Lafayette, made a famous tour of the 24 states in the United States. At many stops on this tour, he was received by the populace with a hero&#x27;s welcome, and many honors and monuments were presented to commemorate and memorialize Lafayette&#x27;s visit.

&quot;Susquehanna&quot;—a 44-gun frigate—was laid down on September 20, 1821, at the Washington Navy Yard. Shortly before she was to be launched in the spring of 1825, President John Quincy Adams decided to have an American warship carry the Marquis de Lafayette back to Europe, in the wake of his visit to the land he had fought to free almost 50 years before.

The general had expressed his intention of sailing for home sometime in the late summer or early autumn of 1825. Adams selected &quot;Susquehanna&quot; for this honor, and accordingly—as a gesture of the nation&#x27;s affection for Lafayette—the frigate was renamed &quot;Brandywine&quot; to commemorate the Battle of Brandywine, in which Lafayette was wounded fighting with American forces. Launched on June 16, 1825, and christened by Sailing Master Marmaduke Dove, &quot;Brandywine&quot; was commissioned on August 25, 1825, Captain Charles Morris in command.

As an honor to the Marquis, officers were selected from as many States as possible and, where practicable, from descendants of persons who had distinguished themselves in the American Revolution. One of these young men selected as an officer on the &quot;Brandywine&quot;″s maiden voyage was 19-year-old Virginian Matthew Fontaine Maury, who would eventually make great influences in the science of oceanography.

After fitting out at the Navy Yard, the frigate traveled down the Potomac River to await her passenger at St. Mary&#x27;s, Maryland, not far from the river&#x27;s mouth. Lafayette enjoyed a last state dinner to celebrate his 68th birthday on the evening of September 6 and then embarked in the steamboat &quot;Mount Vernon&quot; on September 7 for the trip downriver to join &quot;Brandywine&quot;. On September 8, the frigate stood out of the Potomac River and sailed down Chesapeake Bay toward the open ocean.

After a stormy three weeks at sea, the warship arrived off Le Havre, France, early in October; and, following some initial trepidation about the government&#x27;s attitude toward Lafayette&#x27;s return to a France now ruled by the ultra-royalist King Charles X, &quot;Brandywine&quot;″s passenger and her captain disembarked, the former to return home and the latter to tour the country for six months to study shipyards, ship design and other naval matters.

==1825: European operations==
&quot;Brandywine&quot; left Le Havre that same day to join the United States&#x27; Mediterranean Squadron. En route, she stopped at Cowes on the Isle of Wight in England to re-caulk seams that had opened rather badly during the Atlantic crossing.

Then, after being rendered more seaworthy, she resumed her voyage to Gibraltar on October 22, reaching the famed British bastion guarding the Mediterranean Sea&#x27;s Atlantic entrance on November 2. At the end of a fortnight in port, &quot;Brandywine&quot; sailed for the Balearic Islands in company with the ship of the line and sloop of war . Following an 11-day passage, the trio reached Port Mahon, Minorca; and &quot;Brandywine&quot; spent the next three months refitting.

In February 1826, arrived in Port Mahon with orders recalling &quot;Brandywine&quot; to the U.S., and the frigate set sail for home late in the month. She stopped at Gibraltar early in March and finally entered New York City in mid-April.

==1826: Pacific Ocean operations==
After passing the rest of spring and much of the summer in repairs and outfitting for duty in the Pacific Ocean, &quot;Brandywine&quot; departed New York City on September 3, 1826, as the flagship of Commodore Jacob Jones who was sailing around Cape Horn for the Pacific coast of South America to take over command of the American squadron in the region from Commodore Isaac Hull and his flagship, USS &quot;United States&quot;. She also carried a relief crew for the schooner that had been slated to remain on the Pacific Station.

By the time the frigate joined the squadron on January 6, 1827, Spain had abandoned her efforts to re-conquer her empire in the Western Hemisphere, so &quot;Brandywine&quot;″s tour of duty in the Pacific proved far less troubled than that of her predecessor. She directed her efforts to protecting American citizens, especially merchant seamen who were being impressed into service by the Peruvian Navy.

Her own relief—the frigate —arrived in the summer of 1829 bringing Commodore Charles C. B. Thompson, the squadron&#x27;s new commander, along with another crew for &quot;Dolphin&quot;; and &quot;Brandywine&quot; set sail for home. She reached New York City on October 8 and was decommissioned soon thereafter.

==1830: Gunboat diplomacy in Europe==
Placed back in commission on January 10, 1830, Capt. Henry E. Ballard in command, the warship set out for the Gulf of Mexico two months later to gather information concerning conditions in that area. She returned to the east coast at Norfolk, Virginia on July 7 and began preparations for another European deployment.

&quot;Brandywine&quot; departed Hampton Roads, Virginia on October 22, 1830, and headed for Gibraltar. At first, this deployment was devoted almost exclusively to sailing from one peaceful port to the next, showing the flag to maintain and enhance American prestige. However, President Andrew Jackson—determined to collect indemnities owed to the U.S. for merchant ships that had been confiscated by several European nations while under Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s governments during the Napoleonic Wars—decided to begin with the Kingdom of Naples.

While Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, sat on the throne there, Naples had seized several American merchantmen; and the most recent successor to the throne, King Ferdinand II, had repudiated the debts. Jackson sent former Maryland congressman John Nelson to Naples as U.S. minister to negotiate the payment of these debts.

He also dispatched Commodore Daniel Patterson to the Mediterranean with reinforcements for the squadron already there and with orders to take overall command of American forces from Commodore James Biddle. The frigate gave a physical dimension to Nelson&#x27;s legal arguments.

==1832: Demonstrating American firepower==
When Nelson first raised the issue of the debts, King Ferdinand refused even to consider the question. This prompted the American minister to write to Commodore Patterson asking for naval support.

The commodore divided his squadron into two groups. The first contingent—headed by &quot;Brandywine&quot; and including —reached Naples on July 23, 1832, and anchored near Ferdinand&#x27;s palace. This group remained in port until late in August when it returned to Port Mahon. Beginning with , that arrived on September 17, however, the ships of the second contingent began standing into the harbor at Naples singly. Soon, the frigate arrived, followed in rapid succession by and .

Not a shot was fired and no explicit reference to the squadron was made during the negotiations; nevertheless, the unspoken message of power helped the king to see the justice of the American claims and prompted him to sign a treaty promising to pay 2,100,000 ducats to the U.S. over the next nine years. Her remaining months in the Mediterranean proved less dramatic; and &quot;Brandywine&quot; sailed for the United States late in the spring of 1833, returning to New York on July 9 and going out of commission two days later.

==1834: Pacific Ocean operations==
Reactivated in the spring of 1834, on April 4, Capt. David Deacon in command, and set sail on June 2 to replace as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron. She reached Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on July 22 and stayed until August 14, when she resumed her journey down the coast and around Cape Horn.

&quot;Brandywine&quot; arrived at Valparaiso on October 3 after a stormy passage of the cape, and Commodore Alexander S. Wadsworth broke his flag in her on November 1. For the next three years, the warship plied the waters along South America&#x27;s west coast protecting U.S. citizens and commerce. On November 3, 1836, she collided with the Peruvian ship &quot;Limena&quot;
off Callao, Peru, while &quot;Limena&quot; was on a voyage from Callao to Igargue, Peru; &quot;Limena&quot; suffered severe damage and put back into Callao for repairs.

Finally, expiring enlistments signaled the time for &quot;Brandywine&quot; to sail for home, and she departed Callao in January 1837, bringing Commodore Wadsworth back home at the conclusion of his own tour of duty. After a relatively quiet 94-day passage, she reached Norfolk, Virginia, on April 22, 1837, and was placed in ordinary on May 9, 1837.

==1839: The &quot;Caroline&quot; incident==
After being laid up for more than two years, the frigate was recommissioned on August 2, 1839, Capt. William C. Bolton in command; and, once outfitted, sailed for the Mediterranean on October 22.

This cruise was enlivened by tension with Great Britain over the &quot;Caroline&quot; incident. In 1837, when many people in the United States had sympathized with Canadian rebels, some Canadian loyalists had captured the steamboat &quot;Caroline&quot; from the American side of the Niagara River. In November 1840, a Canadian had been arrested and charged with murder in Lewiston, New York, after drunkenly boasting that he had taken part in the cutting out of &quot;Caroline&quot; and had killed an American.

Feelings on both sides of the Atlantic deepened during the spring of 1841, and the American minister to the Court of St. James&#x27;s wrote to Commodore Hull urging him to leave the Mediterranean lest war break out and his squadron be trapped there.

==1841: Avoiding war with Britain==
Upon receiving this warning, Hull ordered his ships to get underway and head for Gibraltar. Not knowing what faced them when they reached the strait, &quot;Brandywine&quot; and her consorts were prepared for the worst. Steady pilots manned the helms on both sides, and peace persisted unbroken when the warship passed the strait and entered the Atlantic Ocean.

The frigate continued on westward and entered New York Harbor on May 12, 1841. Later that summer, the crisis with Great Britain abated somewhat, and &quot;Brandywine&quot; headed back to the Mediterranean on June 29. She completed her originally scheduled tour there under the command of Capt. David Greisinger and then returned to New York on July 12, 1842, to be decommissioned on July 30, 1842.

==1843: China operations==
&quot;Brandywine&quot; went back into commission on February 16, 1843, Lieutenant Charles W. Chauncey in command, and set sail for the East Indies on 24 May. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, she reached Bombay, India on October 24 to pick up the special envoy to China, Caleb Cushing, and took him to Macau where he went ashore and began negotiations for a treaty.

While Cushing was working to develop contacts with the Chinese government, &quot;Brandywine&quot; visited Manila, Hong Kong and Whampoa. On June 16, 1844, the high commissioner appointed by the Chinese emperor to deal with Cushing, Ch&#x27;i-ying, arrived at Macau; and negotiations opened on the 21st.

Following 12 days of discussions, the Treaty of Wang Hsia was signed on July 3 providing for the establishment of five American treaty ports in China. It also granted protection to American sailors shipwrecked on Chinese shores and guaranteed that both civil and criminal law cases involving Americans would be adjudicated in consular courts. In effect, the treaty extended to the U.S. the privileges that Great Britain had extracted from China in the Treaty of Nanking that ended the Opium War, though with one important exception. The American treaty expressly forbade the opium traffic, but the British treaty did not.

Cushing set sail in the brig on August 29 to return to the U.S. with the new treaty. &quot;Brandywine&quot;, on the other hand, remained in the Orient until departing Macau for Honolulu, Hawaii on December 2, carrying word of the Chinese privy council&#x27;s approval of the treaty.

From Hawaii, she sailed to the west coast of South America where she made calls at several ports before setting out to double Cape Horn on her way home. At the end of a long and successful cruise, &quot;Brandywine&quot; stood into Norfolk, Virginia on September 17, 1845, and was decommissioned there eight days later.

==1847: Brazil Station operations==
After nearly two years in ordinary, the frigate was recommissioned once more on August 30, 1847, Capt. Thomas Crabbe in command. On September 13, &quot;Brandywine&quot; set sail for the Brazil Station where she cruised for more than three years protecting United States interests in the region. The warship then returned to the United States at New York City on December 4, 1850, and was decommissioned 10 days later.

==1861: American Civil War operations==
Laid up in ordinary for more than a decade, &quot;Brandywine&quot; finally resumed active service as a result of the American Civil War. She was recommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on October 27, 1861, Commander Benjamin J. Totten in command, and set sail immediately for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she arrived on October 29.

Housed over and converted to a storeship, the former warship supported the operations of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for almost three years. She spent much of that time anchored near Fort Monroe, her most conspicuous absence coming in the wake of CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;&#x27;s attempt to break the Union blockade early in the spring of 1862.

Towed to Baltimore, Maryland by , &quot;Brandywine&quot; remained there until early June 1862, by which time the danger posed by the Confederate ironclad had waned considerably. Later moved to Norfolk, she also assumed the role of receiving ship for the squadron.

==1864: &quot;Brandywine&quot; sinks at her moorings==
She remained so employed until a fire broke out in her paint locker on September 3, 1864, and destroyed her. She sank at her moorings at Norfolk but was later raised and sold to Maltby &amp; Co., of Norfolk on March 26, 1867.

==Note==
&quot;Brandywine&quot; is notable as the final evolution of the 44-gun frigate design that began by and her sisters a quarter-century earlier; while ships such as were launched in the 1840s and differed in details, their basic design was identical to &quot;Brandywine&quot;. &quot;Brandywine&quot; was also the very first warship ever built with an innovative elliptical stern which reduced the chronic vulnerability of the traditional square stern ship to enemy fire and allowed her to carry stern-mounted guns.

<text>Pennsylvania Station (also known as New York Penn Station or simply Penn Station) is the main intercity railroad station in New York City and the busiest transportation facility in the Western Hemisphere, serving more than 600,000 passengers per weekday . The station is located beneath Madison Square Garden in the block bounded by Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets and in the James A. Farley Building, with additional exits to nearby streets, in Midtown Manhattan. It is close to several popular Manhattan locations, including Herald Square, the Empire State Building, Koreatown, and Macy&#x27;s Herald Square.

Penn Station has 21 tracks fed by seven tunnels, including its two North River Tunnels, four East River Tunnels, and one Empire Connection tunnel. It is at the center of the Northeast Corridor, a passenger rail line that connects New York City with Boston to its north and Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. to its south, along with various intermediate stations. Intercity trains are operated by Amtrak, which owns the station, while commuter rail services are operated by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and NJ Transit (NJT). Connections are available within the complex to the New York City Subway and buses.

Penn Station is named for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), its builder and original owner, and shares its name with several stations in other cities. The original Pennsylvania Station was an ornate station building designed by McKim, Mead, and White and considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style. Completed in 1910, it enabled direct rail access to New York City from the south for the first time. Its head house and train shed were torn down in 1963 at a time of low train ridership, with the rail infrastructure reconstituted as the smaller underground station that survives today. The &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board described the demolition of the original station as a &quot;monumental act of vandalism&quot;, and its destruction galvanized the modern historic preservation movement.

The 2020s saw the opening of Moynihan Train Hall, an expansion of Penn Station into the Farley Post Office building, as well as expansion of the LIRR concourse and a new direct entrance from 33rd Street to the LIRR concourse. Further plans call for adding railway platforms in a new southern annex to connect to two new Gateway Program tunnels under the Hudson River, adding underground connections to the Herald Square station and with the PATH to the 33rd Street station, and renovating the core Penn Station under Madison Square Garden.

== History ==
=== Planning and construction ===
Until the early 20th century, the PRR&#x27;s rail network terminated on the western side of the Hudson River (once known locally as the North River) at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey. Manhattan-bound passengers boarded ferries to cross the Hudson River for the final stretch of their journey.

The rival New York Central Railroad&#x27;s line ran down Manhattan from the north under Park Avenue and terminated at Grand Central Depot (later replaced by Grand Central Terminal) at 42nd Street. Many proposals for a cross-Hudson connection were advanced in the late 19th century, but financial panics in the 1870s and 1890s scared off potential investors. In any event, none of the proposals advanced during this time were considered feasible.

An early proposal for a bridge was considered but rejected. The alternative was to tunnel under the river, but this was infeasible for steam locomotive use. The development of the electric locomotive at the turn of the 20th century made a tunnel feasible. In 1901, PRR president Alexander Cassatt announced the railroad&#x27;s plan to enter New York City by tunneling under the Hudson and building a grand station on the West Side of Manhattan south of 34th Street. The station would sit in Manhattan&#x27;s Tenderloin district, a historical red-light district known for its corruption and prostitution.

Beginning in June 1903, the two single-track North River Tunnels were bored from the west under the Hudson River. A second set of four single-track tunnels, the East River Tunnels, were bored from the east under the East River, linking the new station to Queens, the PRR-owned Long Island Rail Road, and Sunnyside Yard in Queens, where trains would be maintained and assembled. Construction was completed on the Hudson River tunnels on October 9, 1906, and on the East River tunnels on March 18, 1908.

=== Original structure ===


A small portion of Penn Station opened on September 8, 1910, in conjunction with the opening of the East River Tunnels, and LIRR riders gained direct railroad service to Manhattan. On November 27, 1910, Penn Station was fully opened to the public. With the station&#x27;s full opening, the PRR became the only railroad to enter New York City from the south.

During half a century of operation by the Pennsylvania Railroad (1910–1963), scores of intercity passenger trains arrived and departed daily to Chicago and St. Louis on &quot;Pennsy&quot; rails and beyond on connecting railroads to Miami and the west. Along with Long Island Rail Road trains, Penn Station saw trains of the New Haven and the Lehigh Valley railroads. A side effect of the tunneling project was to open the city up to the suburbs, and within 10 years of opening, two-thirds of the daily passengers coming through Penn Station were commuters.

The station put the Pennsylvania Railroad at comparative advantage to its competitors offering direct service from Manhattan to the west and south. Other railroads began their routes at terminals in Weehawken, Hoboken, Pavonia and Communipaw which required passengers from New York City to take the interstate Hudson Tubes (now PATH) or ferries across the Hudson River before boarding their trains. By 1945, at its peak, more than 100 million passengers a year traveled through Penn Station.

By the late 1950s, intercity rail passenger volumes had declined dramatically with the coming of the Jet Age and the Interstate Highway System. The station&#x27;s exterior had become somewhat grimy, and due to its vast scale, the station was expensive to maintain. A renovation covered some of the grand columns with plastic and blocked off the spacious central hallway with a new ticket office. The Pennsylvania Railroad optioned the air rights, which called for the demolition of the head house and train shed, to be replaced by an office complex and a new sports complex, while the tracks of the station would remain untouched.

Plans for the new Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden were announced in 1962. In exchange for the air rights to Penn Station, the PRR would receive a smaller underground station at no cost and a 25 percent stake in the new Madison Square Garden Complex. Modern architects rushed to save the ornate building, but to no avail; demolition of the above-ground head house began in October 1963. A giant steel deck was placed over the tracks and platforms to allow rail service to continue during construction. Photographs of the day showed passengers waiting for trains even as the head house was demolished around them. This was possible because most of the rail infrastructure (including the waiting room, concourses, and boarding platforms) was below street level.

The demolition of the Penn Station head house was controversial and caused outrage internationally. &quot;One entered the city like a god. One scuttles in now like a rat,&quot; the architectural historian Vincent Scully famously wrote of the original station. The controversy over the demolition of such a well-known landmark, and its deplored replacement, is often cited as a catalyst for the architectural preservation movement in the United States. Within the decade, Grand Central Terminal was protected under the city&#x27;s new landmarks preservation act, a protection upheld by the courts in 1978 after a challenge by Grand Central&#x27;s owner, Penn Central (the corporate successor of the PRR, following its merger with the rival New York Central Railroad).

=== Under Madison Square Garden ===
Post-1968, the core Penn Station has been underground, sitting below Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street, and Two Penn Plaza. The core has three levels: concourses on the upper two levels and train platforms on the lowest. The two levels of concourses, while renovated and expanded during the construction of Madison Square Garden, are original to the 1910 station, as are the tracks and platforms.

Over the following decades, various renovations attempted to add service and some concourse space. The West End Concourse under Eighth Avenue opened in 1986. In 1987, a rail connection to the West Side Rail Yard opened, and in 1991, the opening of the Empire Connection allowed Amtrak to consolidate all of its New York City trains at Penn Station and save $600,000 a year in fees; previously, trains from the Empire Corridor terminated at Grand Central Terminal, a legacy of the two stations&#x27; respective roots in separate railroads.

In 1994, the station was renovated to add the 34th Street LIRR entrance and central corridor, along with artwork and improved waiting and concession areas. The new entrance consisted of a structure with a glass and brick facade, a clock salvaged from the original station, and air-conditioning units for the terminal. In 2002, the NJ Transit concourse was created in space previously occupied by retail and Amtrak office space, although the concourse could only be accessed from the Amtrak entrance on 32nd Street. Plans for a new entrance from 31st Street to the NJ Transit concourse were announced in 2006, and the entrance opened in 2009. In 2020, the ticketed waiting room on the main concourse was renovated by Amtrak and NJ Transit to include furniture with USB outlets, an additional entrance, and a lactation suite.

After the September 11 attacks, security was increased and passenger flow curtailed. In 2002, $100 million of work added security features such as lighting, cameras, and barricades. The taxiway under Madison Square Garden, which ran from 31st Street to 33rd Street at mid-block, was permanently closed off with concrete Jersey barriers. Escalators providing direct access to the lobby of Madison Square Garden were closed and later removed. The underground Gimbels Passageway connecting pedestrians to 34th Street–Herald Square has been sealed off since 1986, after decades of safety concerns and sexual assaults.

Despite the modest renovations, the underground Penn Station continued to be criticized as &quot;reviled&quot;, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, and a low-ceilinged &quot;catacomb&quot; lacking charm, especially when compared to the much larger and more ornate Grand Central Terminal. The &quot;New York Times&quot;, in an editorial supporting development of an enlarged terminal, said that &quot;Amtrak&#x27;s beleaguered customers...scurry through underground rooms bereft of light or character,&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; transit reporter Michael M. Grynbaum called Penn Station &quot;the ugly stepchild of the city&#x27;s two great rail terminals.&quot; After its nadir in the 1960s, ridership exploded in subsequent decades, a situation never contemplated by the structure&#x27;s designers. By the 2010s, the station operated at almost three times its intended capacity; over 600,000 passengers used the station daily in 2019.

=== Expansion and renovation ===
In the early 1990s, U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan proposed building a new station in the James A. Farley Building, the city&#x27;s former main post office across the street which was designed by the same firm as the original Penn Station; Moynihan had shined shoes in the original station as a boy. Many redevelopment or expansion concepts were proposed over the 1990s and 2000s, but none reached fruition until funding from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act enabled the expansion of the West End Concourse of the LIRR under the Farley Building in 2016.

In 2016 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans for the renovation of Penn Station and mixed-use redevelopment of the Farley Building, including development of a new train hall, which he called the Empire Station Complex. In January 2021, the new expansion, Moynihan Train Hall, opened and was named for the man who had conceived it. The $1.6 billion, renovation retained the original, landmarked Beaux Arts Farley Building, added a central atrium with a glass roof, and provided access to Amtrak and LIRR trains. A new 33rd Street entrance to the LIRR concourse opened at the same time. The station received a place in the world selection for the 2021 Prix Versailles in the passenger stations category.

Following the opening of the 33rd Street entrance, the LIRR concourse was doubled in width from , and the ceilings were raised to a minimum height of by removing seven &quot;head knockers&quot;, low-hanging steel beams only above the concourse&#x27;s floor which were part of the original Penn Station; the expansion was completed in March 2023. 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues was converted into a pedestrian plaza and permanently closed to vehicular traffic, opening in June 2024 as part of a $65 million project funded by Vornado.

== Services ==

The station is served by 1,300 arrivals and departures per day, twice as many as there were during the 1970s. There are more than 600,000 subway, commuter rail and Amtrak passengers who use the station on an average weekday, or up to 1,000 every ninety seconds. It is the busiest passenger transportation facility in the United States and in North America.

Tripper Bus runs buses from a stop near Penn Station to Bethesda, Maryland and Arlington, Virginia. Go Buses runs buses from a stop near Penn Station to Newton, Massachusetts and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Most intercity and commuter bus services to and from midtown Manhattan use the Port Authority Bus Terminal, located approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers) to the north of Penn Station.

=== Proposed Metro-North service ===

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority plans to bring Metro-North Railroad commuter trains to Penn Station as part of its Penn Station Access project. The East Side Access project, which was completed in 2023, has freed up track and platform space at Penn Station by redirecting some LIRR trains from Penn Station to Grand Central Madison. This new capacity, as well as track connections resulting from the East Side Access project, will allow Metro-North trains on the New Haven Line to run to Penn Station via Amtrak&#x27;s Hell Gate Bridge.

Four new local Metro-North stations in the Bronx are planned as part of this project, at Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester/VanNest, and Hunts Point. The MTA also proposes a second service from the Metro-North&#x27;s Hudson Line to Penn Station using Amtrak&#x27;s West Side Line in Manhattan. The Penn Station Access project would provide direct rides from Connecticut, Westchester County, the Lower Hudson Valley, and the Bronx to West Midtown; ease reverse-commuting from Manhattan and the Bronx to Westchester County, the Lower Hudson Valley, and Connecticut; and provide transportation service to areas of the Bronx without direct subway service.

== Station layout ==

Penn Station does not have a unified design or floor plan but rather is divided into separate Amtrak, LIRR and NJ Transit concourses with each concourse maintained and styled differently by its respective operator. The Amtrak and NJ Transit concourses are located on the first level below the street level while the Long Island Rail Road concourse is two levels below street level.

The main concourse, now primarily used by NJ Transit which was principally used by Amtrak until the opening of the Moynihan Train Hall in 2021, is at the west end of the station directly beneath Madison Square Garden. It was created out of the original station&#x27;s waiting rooms and main concourse, though few remnants of the original still exist in the space. It was renovated in the early 2000s in anticipation of &quot;Acela&quot; service and includes an enclosed waiting area for ticketed passengers with seats, outlets and Wi-Fi. The ticketed waiting room underwent a $7.2 million renovation from 2019 to 2020 that was funded jointly between Amtrak and NJ Transit. The renovation included new furniture and fixtures that feature seats with electrical and USB outlets, an upgraded ceiling with new LED lighting, a new information desk, a second entrance in close proximity to the NJ Transit concourse that provides improved access towards the Seventh Avenue side of the Station, two new Passenger Information Display Systems boards that display NJ Transit departure information and a lactation suite for nursing mothers.

The LIRR&#x27;s connecting concourse runs below West 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, as it has since the original station opened in 1910. Significant renovations were made to the LIRR areas over a three-year period ending in 1994, including the opening of the Central Corridor passageway and the addition of a new entry pavilion on 34th Street. The 34th Street entry pavilion measures across by tall and has a glass tower and two air-cooling shafts. The West End Concourse, west of Eighth Avenue, opened in 1986, and was widened and lengthened to cover tracks 5 through 21 in 2017.

The NJ Transit concourse near Seventh Avenue opened in 2002 out of existing retail and Amtrak office space. A new street-level entrance to this concourse at the corner of 31st Street and Seventh Avenue opened in September 2009. Previously, NJ Transit used space in the Amtrak concourse.

In December 2017, Amtrak and Zyter released a mobile app called FindYourWay to help commuters navigate around Penn Station, though Zyter also plans to roll out the app at other large Amtrak stations.
The station&#x27;s three providers use different official addresses for the station.

* Amtrak: 351 West 31st Street
* LIRR: 34th Street at 7th and 8th Avenues
* NJ Transit: 31st Street and 7th Avenue


=== Tracks and surrounding infrastructure ===

Tracks 1–4 end at bumper blocks at the eastern end of the platform and have no access to the East River Tunnels and Amtrak&#x27;s Sunnyside Yard in Queens, so they are used only by NJ Transit. In normal operations, Amtrak and NJ Transit share tracks 5–12, all three railroads share tracks 13–16, and the LIRR has the exclusive use of tracks 17–21 on the north side of the station.

From the east, the East River Tunnels&#x27; lines 1 and 2 (the more southerly tubes) can only access tracks 5–17 and are used by most Amtrak and NJ Transit trains, while the East River Tunnels&#x27; lines 3 and 4 (the more northerly tubes) can only access tracks 14–21 and are mostly used by LIRR. From the west, the North River Tunnels can access tracks 1–19, while the Empire Connection can only access tracks 1–9 and the LIRR&#x27;s West Side Yard can only access tracks 10–21.

All station tracks are powered by 12 kV overhead wire. Tracks 5–21 also have 750 V DC third rail. Due to the lack of proper ventilation in the tunnels and station, only electric locomotives and dual-mode locomotives are scheduled to enter Penn Station. Diesel-only NJT trains terminate at Hoboken Terminal or Newark Penn Station, and diesel-only LIRR trains terminate at or prior to Long Island City.

Trains on track 18 open their doors only on the north side (platform 10).

==== 2017–2018 service disruptions and track improvements ====
Since the early 2010s, Amtrak had planned to fix the deteriorating rails and infrastructure around Penn Station, but due to the prioritization of other projects, applied only minimal fixes. In early 2017, this culminated in numerous power outages, derailments, and delays due to track maintenance delays. There were frequent service disruptions to train schedules caused by the deterioration of its tracks and their supporting infrastructure, as well as in those of the East River and North River tunnels that respectively connect the station to Long Island and New Jersey.

A string of early 2017 service disruptions started on March 23, 2017, when an &quot;Acela&quot; train derailed, causing delays for the day. On April 3, a NJ Transit train derailed at a known problem site, where repairs had been deferred. This caused four days of reduced service along the Northeast Corridor for both Amtrak and NJ Transit, because the incident damaged the switch that connects Tracks 1–8 to the North River tunnels. This closure caused a cascading failure, delaying Amtrak and Long Island Rail Road trains on the unaffected tracks.

On April 14, a New Jersey Transit train became stuck in the North River tunnels, causing the station to grow crowded with waiting passengers. After an Amtrak police officer used a Taser on a man who was acting disruptively, rumors of gunshots sparked a stampede that injured 16 people. Following the stampede, U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer called on Amtrak to centralize law enforcement response.

As a result of these incidents, the Long Island Rail Road had proposed taking over Penn Station from Amtrak to improve maintenance, and New Jersey has suggested withholding state payments to Amtrak. Amtrak has discussed accelerating major maintenance work, even at the cost of further disruptions, to more quickly stabilize infrastructure and decrease more future incidents that could potentially cause even greater disruption.

On April 28, 2017, Amtrak announced that it would perform some track maintenance during the summer over a period of one and a half months. Five tracks were closed for repairs as part of the reconstruction work, severely reducing track capacity in a situation media outlets deemed &quot;the summer of hell&quot;. Many affected NJ Transit passengers were diverted to take the PATH instead. Some Amtrak trains from the Empire Corridor were routed to Grand Central instead of Penn Station. Regular service resumed on September 5, 2017.

Amtrak made further improvements to Penn Station&#x27;s trackage in summer 2018. As a result, some Empire Corridor trains were rerouted again to Grand Central. The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; and &quot;Cardinal&quot; to Chicago were truncated or rerouted because of this work.

== Planning and redevelopment ==

Resurgence of train ridership in the 21st century has pushed the current Pennsylvania Station structure to capacity, leading to several proposals to renovate or rebuild the station, often characterized as correcting for the 1960s demolition of the original facility.

In 2013, the Regional Plan Association and Municipal Art Society formed the Alliance for a New Penn Station. Citing overcrowding and the limited capacity of the current station under Madison Square Garden, the Alliance began to advocate for limiting the extension of Madison Square Garden&#x27;s operating permit to ten years. In May 2013, four architecture firms released concepts for redeveloping Penn Station without Madison Square Garden above it, by moving the Garden a few blocks southwest to the Morgan Postal Facility, to the area south of the James Farley Post Office, or to a new pier west of Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Madison Square Garden officials rejected the idea of moving the facility, calling the plans &quot;pie-in-the-sky&quot;, but on July 24, 2013, the New York City Council voted 47–1 to give the Garden a ten-year operating permit, after which the owners would have to move or seek permission anew.

In January 2016, at the same time he announced the development of Moynihan Train Hall, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that requests for proposals would be solicited for the redevelopment of the station under the Garden, which would be a public-private partnership called the Empire Station Complex. Investors would be granted commercial rights to the station in exchange for paying building costs.

In June 2023, nearing the end of the ten-year permit granted in 2013, the MTA, along with Amtrak and NJ Transit, filed a report stating that Madison Square Garden is no longer compatible with Penn Station, saying, &quot;MSG&#x27;s existing configuration and property boundaries impose severe constraints on the station that impede the safe and efficient movement of passengers and restrict efforts to implement improvements, particularly at the street and platform levels.&quot; On September 14, 2023, the New York City Council voted 48–0 to renew the operating permit for Madison Square Garden for five years, the shortest-ever granted by the city to the Garden.

=== Southern expansion ===
In January 2020, Governor Cuomo unveiled a proposed southern annex to Penn Station, part of his vision for the Empire Station Complex. The annex would include eight additional tracks with four platforms and would involve demolishing the entire block bounded by 30th and 31st streets between Seventh and Eighth avenues, directly south of the existing station, as well as parts of the two blocks to the east and west. The plans were later revised to call for a 12-track station. The new tracks would connect to and take advantage of the new capacity provided by the Hudson River tunnels built as part of the Gateway Program. The necessity of new tracks has been debated, in light of studies by regional advocacy groups and the railroads themselves suggesting that service improvements to enable regional through-running could similarly boost capacity. This new southern terminal, which would require federal approvals and could cost as much as $16.7 billion, has not proceeded as of 2025.

=== Station reconstruction ===
In April 2021, MTA officials under governor Andrew Cuomo proposed two options to reconstruct the Penn Station building under Madison Square Garden, to be financed by the development of 10 new office and residential towers in the surrounding neighborhood. One concept would retain the existing two-level concourse; the other envisioned a taller single-level concourse with a multi-story glass atrium in the former midblock taxiway. Both plans would improve passenger circulation and could demolish the Hulu Theater for a new Eighth Avenue entrance. Opponents alleged the tower development would disproportionately benefit real-estate firm Vornado Realty Trust, which would redevelop several buildings without paying property taxes.

In November 2021, after Cuomo resigned, governor Kathy Hochul announced plans to hasten the reconstruction to take place before construction of a southern annex, and to slightly reduce the size of the office tower development. Hochul&#x27;s plan selected the one-level concourse alternative, and in June 2022, Hochul and New Jersey governor Phil Murphy announced a call for architects and engineers to submit preliminary designs. John McAslan was announced as designer that September.

In February 2023, Vornado declared it would no longer invest in new office space due to high interest rates and lack of demand following the COVID-19 pandemic, and in June 2023 Hochul announced that Penn Station reconstruction would be &quot;decoupled&quot; from any office tower development. That same June, private developer ASTM North America unveiled an unsolicited alternative reconstruction plan, with both a 55-foot tall Eighth Avenue entrance and a 105-foot tall midblock atrium, which would be financed by both private investment from ASTM and government funding.

In November 2024, the United States Department of Transportation provided a $72 million grant to cover two-thirds of the design and engineering phase of the Penn Station Reconstruction project, as well as a 30,000-foot plaza and a connection to the 34th Street–Herald Square station.

=== Gateway Program ===

The Gateway Program is the planned expansion and renovation of the Northeast Corridor between Newark, New Jersey, and New York City to alleviate the bottleneck under the Hudson River and allow for refurbishment of the existing North River Tunnels. Two new tunnels would add 25 cross-Hudson train slots during rush hours and could connect to a 7-track, 4-platform terminal annex to Penn Station to its south. Some previously planned improvements were also incorporated into the Gateway plan.

The Gateway Program was unveiled in 2011, one year after the cancellation of the somewhat-similar Access to the Region&#x27;s Core (ARC) project, and was originally projected to cost $14.5 billion and take 14 years to build. Construction of a &quot;tunnel box&quot; that would preserve right-of-way on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side began in September 2013, using $185 million in recovery and resilience funding awarded after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In 2015, Amtrak said that damage done to the existing trans-Hudson tunnels by Sandy had made their replacement urgent. That year, Amtrak reported that environmental and design work was underway, estimated the project cost at $20 billion, and said construction would last four to five years.

A draft environmental impact statement was released in July 2017, but the first Trump administration delayed consideration of it. Unblocking the project was a stated priority of the Biden administration, and the project was approved in May 2021. Federal funding was anticipated from the Biden administration&#x27;s Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which became law in November 2021. The first federal funding was announced by President Biden in 2023, with the federal government committing as much as $11 billion of the $16.1 billion price tag and the states of New York and New Jersey agreeing to split the
rest. Construction began in late 2023 and was underway as of 2025.

<doc id="188236" wikidata="Q551267" url="?curid=188236" title="Johann Weikhard von Valvasor">
<text>Johann Weikhard Freiherr von Valvasor or Johann Weichard Freiherr von Valvasor (, ) or simply Valvasor (baptised on 28 May 1641 – September or October 1693) was a natural historian and polymath from Carniola, present-day Slovenia, and a fellow of the Royal Society in London.

He is known as a pioneer in the study of karst topography. Together with his other writings, until the late 19th century his best-known work—the 1689 &quot;Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot;, published in 15 books in four volumes—was the main source for older Slovenian history, making him one of the precursors of modern Slovenian historiography.

==Biography==
Valvasor was born in the town of Ljubljana (Laibach), at the time the principal city of Duchy of Carniola, today the capital of Slovenia, to an aristocratic family originally from Bergamo, Italy. In the 16th century, it was Johann Baptist Valvasor who moved the Valvasor family to the Duchy of Carniola in central Europe, to a part of the Habsburg monarchy that is now part of Slovenia. In medieval Latin &quot;Valvasor&quot; or &quot;Valvasore&quot; held the meaning &#x27;carrier of a feud&#x27;.

Neither the exact day nor the actual place of Valvasor&#x27;s birth are known, but his baptism was registered at Ljubljana Cathedral, where he was baptized &quot;Joannes Waichard Valvasor&quot;. He was the twelfth child born to Bartholomäus and Anna Maria Freiin von Rauber, who only lived at Medija Castle in Izlake but also had a town residence in Ljubljana at Old Square. His godparents were Freiherr (Baron) Konrad Ruess von Ruessenstein from Strmol Castle and Regina Dorothea Rasp from Krumperk Castle.

Valvasor&#x27;s father died when the boy was ten years old. His mother died when he was 16. At the time he was attending the Jesuit school in Ljubljana. Graduating in 1659 at the age of seventeen, he did not choose to continue his studies at a university but decided to broaden his horizons by meeting learned men on a journey across Europe. This journey lasted fourteen years and it even took him to northern Africa. During this period, he joined the army in the Austro-Turkish War, where he became closely acquainted with the conditions on the Croatian Military Frontier.

Shortly after marrying 13-year-old Anna Rosina Grafenweger in 1672, Valvasor acquired Bogenšperk Castle near Litija, where he arranged a writing, drawing and printing workshop. Valvasor spent a fortune on the publishing of his books; towards the end of his life, his debts forced him to sell Bogenšperk Castle, his vast library and his collection of prints. In 1690, Aleksandar Ignacije Mikulić, the Bishop of Zagreb, bought his library, along with some 7,300 graphics, and moved it to Slavonia, where the collection became part of the library of the Zagreb Archbishopric, now part of the Croatian State Archives. 
In 1692, he lost most of his wealth after he invested in travel, graphics and printbooks which proved unprofitable. He had nine children, among them daughters Maria Sidonia, Maximilla Kordula, Johanna Rosina, and Anna Theresia, and sons Wolfang Waikhard, Johann Gottlieb, Johann Ludwig, Johann Wolfgang Engelbert, and Franz Joseph. Five children died very early, and then, when delivering their last child in 1687, Anna Maria Rosina died as well. Just three months after her death, Valvasor married Baroness Anna Maximilla Zetschker of Vrhovo. They had four children. In 1693, the same year that their last child, Franz Engelbert, was baptized, Valvasor died at age 52 in Krško.

He is believed to have been buried in the family crypt at Medija Castle, but this is uncertain. The Yugoslav Partisans dynamited the castle in 1944 and no trace of his putative grave remains today.

==Legacy==
===&quot;The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot;===
Valvasor&#x27;s most important work remains &quot;The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot; (original title: , Slovene: ), published in 1689 in 15 books (four volumes), totalling 3532 pages and including 528 illustrations and 24 appendices, which provides a vivid description of Carniola at the time. He also recorded the first written document on vampires when he wrote on the legend of a vampire in Istria named Jure Grando.

From 2009 until 2012, it was translated into Slovene by Doris, Primož and Božidar Debenjak. The initiator, project manager, editor and technical editor of this monumental publishing project was Tomaž Čeč.

===Karst research===
Valvasor was a pioneer of study of karst phenomena. Upon the proposal of Edmond Halley, who was not only an astronomer but also a geophysicist, and in 1687 his extensive treatise on the hydrology of intermittent Lake Cerknica won him a fellowship of the Royal Society.

<text>The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola (, ) is an encyclopedia published in Nuremberg in 1689 by the polymath Johann Weikhard von Valvasor. It is the most important work on his homeland, the Duchy of Carniola, the present-day central part of Slovenia. 

==Content==
Written in New High German, the anthology was published in four volumes, subdivided into 15 books with 3,552 large-format pages and 24 annexes. It was lavishly illustrated with 528 copperplate engravings. The work refers to history, geography, topography, medicine, biology, geology, theology, customs and folklore of the Carniolan region that makes up a large part of present-day Slovenia. Valvasor could rely on older accounts, nevertheless the meticulously researched and scientifically sound collection was pioneering at that time. From 2009 until 2012, it was translated into Slovene by Doris, Primož and Božidar Debenjak. The initiator, project manager, editor and technical editor of this publishing project was Tomaž Čeč. 

Valvasor was the first to write about the olm. He intended to write a kind of travelogue than a dictionary and therefore the entries are not arranged in alphabetical order. The author also sprinkles anecdotes, fairytales and poems to diversify the composition. Concerned that outsiders did not know his region well enough, he undertook the presentation of Carniola in words and pictures, installing a copperplate workshop at his Bogenšperk Castle near Litija and publishing collections of his work.

<doc id="188257" wikidata="Q622988" url="?curid=188257" title="Paul McCartney and Wings">
<text>Paul McCartney and Wings, often billed simply as Wings, were an English-American rock band formed in 1971 in London by former Beatle Paul McCartney; his wife Linda McCartney on keyboards; session drummer Denny Seiwell; and former Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine. They were noted for their commercial successes, musical eclecticism, and frequent personnel changes. They went through three lead guitarists and four drummers. The core trio of the McCartneys and Laine, however, remained intact throughout the group&#x27;s existence.

Created following the McCartneys&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Ram&quot;, the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Wild Life&quot; (1971) and &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; (1973) (the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough), were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul&#x27;s work with the Beatles. After the release of the title track of the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band. The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973&#x27;s &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, a commercial and critical success that spawned two top-ten singles in &quot;Jet&quot; and the title track. Following that album, the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, only for Britton to quit shortly afterward and be replaced by Joe English. With the new line-up, Wings released 1975&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Mars&quot;, which included the US number one single &quot;Listen to What the Man Said&quot;, and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975–76. Intended as more of a group effort, &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot; (1976) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; and &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot;.

In 1977, the band earned their only UK number one single, with &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;, which became one of the best-selling singles in history. Wings experienced another line-up shuffle, however, with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;London Town&quot;. The McCartneys and Laine again added new members, recruiting guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley. The resulting album, &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;, was a relative flop, with its singles under-performing and the critical reception negative. During the supporting tour, Paul was arrested in Japan for cannabis possession, putting the band on hold. Despite a final US number one with a live-recorded version of &quot;Coming Up&quot; (1980), Wings discontinued in 1981 after Laine departed from the band. In total, the band had six number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
After the Beatles&#x27; break-up in 1970, McCartney recorded two solo albums: &quot;McCartney&quot; (1970), credited to himself, and &quot;Ram&quot; (1971), with his wife, Linda McCartney. He had insisted from the beginning of their marriage that Linda should be involved in his musical projects, notwithstanding her lack of previous experience as a musician, so that they did not have to be apart when he was on tour. &quot;Ram&quot; was recorded in New York City, where McCartney auditioned a number of drummers and guitarists, selecting Seiwell and guitarist David Spinozza. When Spinozza became unavailable because of other session commitments, Hugh McCracken was enlisted to take his place.

=== 1971–1973: First line-up ===
After the release of &quot;Ram&quot;, McCartney decided to form a new group and asked Seiwell and McCracken to join. Seiwell accepted, but McCracken declined, so McCartney invited Denny Laine, whom he had known since the early 1960s, to join. Laine, who was working on a solo album at the time, got a phone call from McCartney enquiring if he would like to work with him, as McCartney said: &quot;I&#x27;d known him in the past and I just rang him and asked him, &#x27;What are you doing?&#x27; He said, &#x27;Nothing&#x27;, so I said, &#x27;Right. Come on then!&#x27;&quot; Laine then dropped plans for his album there and then. As he had in the Beatles, McCartney would serve as the chief bassist and lead singer for Wings and he doubled on guitar, keyboards, drums and assorted instruments at various times. When asked why he stayed on bass guitar rather than change back to guitar after the Beatles disbanded, he has explained that by then, he was &quot;a bass player pretty much, who also happened to play guitar&quot; and also considers himself a bassist who happens to play piano.

In August 1971, Seiwell and Laine joined Paul and Linda McCartney to record Paul&#x27;s third post-Beatles album for Apple Records. The result was &quot;Wild Life&quot;, released 7 December. It was the first project to credit Wings as the artist. The band name is said to have come to McCartney as he was praying in the hospital while Linda was giving birth to their second child together, Stella, on 13 September 1971. Paul McCartney recalled in the film &quot;Wingspan&quot; that the birth of Stella was &quot;a bit of a drama&quot;; there were complications at the birth and that both Linda and the baby almost died. He was praying fervently and the image of wings came to his mind. He decided to name his new band &quot;Wings.&quot;

In an attempt to capture the spontaneity of live performances, five of &quot;Wild Life&quot; eight songs were first takes by the band. The album included a cover of Mickey &amp; Sylvia&#x27;s &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;. Like &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Wild Life&quot; left music critics cold, a response that typified the anti-McCartney sentiments that prevailed among the music press following the Beatles&#x27; break-up. In their 1975 book &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler called &quot;Wild Life&quot; &quot;rushed, defensive, badly timed, and over-publicized&quot;, and wrote that it showed McCartney&#x27;s songwriting &quot;at an absolute nadir just when he needed a little respect&quot;. Wings similarly struggled to gain artistic credibility, particularly during the early 1970s, with critics, fans and McCartney&#x27;s musical peers alike ridiculing the inclusion of Linda as a keyboard player and backing vocalist.

On 24 January 1972, McCartney added to the Wings line-up guitarist Henry McCullough, after he had tried out for the band. The new line-up immediately mounted an impromptu tour of UK universities (with the group driving around in a van), followed by a tour of small European venues. Although this was the first tour including an ex-Beatle after the Beatles broke up, Wings played no Beatles numbers during the tour, to show that it was a new band in its own right.

In February 1972, Wings released a single called &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot;, a response to the events of Bloody Sunday. The song was banned by the BBC for its anti-Unionist political stance. Despite limited airplay, it reached number 16 in the UK, as well as number 1 in both the Republic of Ireland and Spain. Wings released a children&#x27;s song, &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;, as its next single, which reached the top 10 in the UK. Although some critics interpreted it as a sarcastic reaction to the ban on &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot;, it was in fact a serious effort by McCartney to record a song for children. Wings followed it with December 1972&#x27;s &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;, which was again banned by the BBC, this time for its alleged drug and sexual references. The B-side, &quot;C Moon&quot;, was played instead. The single peaked at number 5 in the UK.

The band were renamed &quot;Paul McCartney and Wings&quot; for the 1973 album &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; (and for the follow-up &quot;Band on the Run&quot;), which yielded their first US number 1 hit, &quot;My Love&quot;. The album included two tracks left over from the &quot;Ram&quot; sessions and was originally intended as a two-record set. After producer Glyn Johns had walked out on the project, however, McCartney conceded to EMI&#x27;s opinion that the material was &quot;substandard&quot; and cut it down to a single disc. Among the unreleased songs from the seven-month sessions was the Linda composition &quot;Seaside Woman&quot;, which was finally issued in 1977, credited to &quot;Suzy and the Red Stripes&quot;.
Near the end of the &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot; sessions, in October 1972, Wings recorded the theme song to the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, which reunited McCartney with Beatles producer/arranger George Martin. Issued as a non-album single in mid-1973, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; became a worldwide hit and has remained a highlight of McCartney&#x27;s post-Wings concert performances (often accompanied by pyrotechnics). That same year, McCartney and Wings filmed a TV special, the critically maligned &quot;James Paul McCartney&quot;, which featured footage of the group performing in outdoor settings and in front of a studio audience.

After a successful British tour in May–June 1973, Wings went into rehearsals for their next album. McCullough and Seiwell abruptly left the band in August, however, at the end of rehearsals. Both musicians were disenchanted with the group&#x27;s musical direction and Linda&#x27;s inclusion; McCullough also objected to McCartney&#x27;s domineering attitude towards him as a guitar player, while Seiwell had long felt aggrieved at the lack of a formalised financial arrangement and his status as a lowly paid sideman.

With the band reduced to a trio, the McCartneys and Laine cut what turned out to be Wings&#x27; most successful album, &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, at EMI&#x27;s primitive eight-track recording studio in Lagos, Nigeria. The album went to number 1 in both the US and UK and spawned three hit singles: the rockers &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Helen Wheels&quot; (originally included only on the US version of the album) and the title track—a suite of movements recalling side two of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. It also included &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot; and &quot;No Words&quot;, the first Wings song on which Laine received a co-writing credit beside the McCartneys. &quot;Band on the Run&quot; enjoyed a highly favourable response from music critics and restored McCartney&#x27;s tarnished post-Beatles image.

=== 1974–1978: Second line-up ===
After &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, Jimmy McCulloch, former lead guitarist in Thunderclap Newman and Stone the Crows, joined the band. The first Wings project with McCulloch was &quot;McGear&quot;, a 1974 collaboration between Paul and his younger brother Mike McGear, with session musician Gerry Conway playing drums. Warner Bros. Records chose not to play up the &quot;Wings&quot; angle in its marketing for &quot;McGear&quot;, and the album sold poorly. However, the sessions also generated a single credited to McGear&#x27;s group the Scaffold, &quot;Liverpool Lou&quot;, which became a top-10 hit in the UK. Shortly thereafter, Geoff Britton joined Wings on drums, and the first recording session with this full line-up was held in Nashville, where the band stayed at the farm of songwriter Curly Putman Jr. The trip was immortalised in the 1974 non-album single &quot;Junior&#x27;s Farm&quot;, backed with a straight country track entitled &quot;Sally G&quot;, the group&#x27;s last release on Apple Records. In a rare occurrence for this era, both sides of the single separately reached the Billboard Top 20 in the US.
Wings began recording sessions for their next album in London in November 1974, then moved to New Orleans to complete &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; (1975), the first release from the group on Capitol Records. The album topped the charts and contained the US number 1 single &quot;Listen to What the Man Said&quot;, which also featured Dave Mason, formerly of Traffic, on guitar and Tom Scott on saxophone. When the &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; recording sessions moved to New Orleans, Britton quit Wings and was replaced by Joe English who won the job at a secret audition before McCartney. In late 1975 Wings embarked on the Wings Over the World tour, following a postponement to allow McCulloch to recuperate from a hand fracture. Starting in Bristol, the tour took them to Australia (November), Europe (March 1976), the US (May/June), and Europe again (September), before ending in a four-night grand finale at London&#x27;s Wembley Empire Pool. For this tour, added to Wings&#x27; stage act was a horn section consisting of Tony Dorsey, Howie Casey, Thaddeus Richard and Steve Howard, on saxes, brass and percussion.
In between sections of the tour, Wings recorded &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot;, which was released at the end of March 1976, just prior to the US leg of the world tour. It represented a departure from the previous Wings template in that each of the five members of the band (including English) sang lead on at least one song. However, the two singles, &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; and &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot; (the former a US number one), were both sung by Paul. Four of the album tracks were played in the 1976 portion of the tour, which also included five Beatles songs. One of the Seattle concerts from the American leg of the 1975–76 world tour was filmed and later released as the concert feature &quot;Rockshow&quot; (1980). The tour&#x27;s American leg, which also included Madison Square Garden in New York City and Boston Garden in Massachusetts, spawned a triple live album, &quot;Wings over America&quot; (1976), which became the fifth consecutive Wings album to reach number 1 in the US. From this album came a single release of the live version of &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; originally from the &quot;McCartney&quot; album. The single&#x27;s flipside was &quot;Soily&quot;, a previously unreleased rocker that was often used as a closer for the concerts.
After the tour, and following the release of &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; in early 1977, Wings took a break. Later in the year, the band started recording their next album in the Virgin Islands, but the sessions were interrupted by Linda&#x27;s pregnancy and then by the departures of both McCulloch and English. McCulloch, who joined Small Faces, died of morphine and alcohol poisoning in 1979. English joined Chuck Leavell&#x27;s band Sea Level and later founded the Christian-oriented Joe English Band.

Undeterred by their departure, Wings released the already-completed McCartney–Laine ballad &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;, an ode to the Scottish coastal region where McCartney had made his home in the early 1970s. Its broad appeal was maximised by a pre-Christmas release. It became an international hit, dominating the charts in Britain (where it was Wings&#x27; only number 1 single), Australia and many other countries over the Christmas/New Year period. Ultimately, it became the first single to exceed sales of 2 million in the UK, eclipsing the previous all-time best-seller (the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You&quot;), and remains one of the biggest-selling UK singles of all time. However, it was not a success in the US, where the B-side &quot;Girls School&quot; received most of the airplay but barely reached the top 40.

The core trio of Wings then released the album &quot;London Town&quot; in 1978. Though only the remaining trio are pictured on the sleeve, much of the album included McCulloch and English, having been recorded before their departures. Laine, however, remained and was co-credited on five of the tracks, including the title song. It was a commercial success, although it became the first Wings album since &quot;Wild Life&quot; not to reach number 1 in the US (peaking at number 2). &quot;London Town&quot; featured a markedly softer-rock, synth-based sound than previous Wings albums. &quot;With a Little Luck&quot; reached number 1 in the US and number 5 in the UK, but &quot;I&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; and &quot;London Town&quot; were commercial disappointments in both countries.

=== 1978–1981: Third line-up ===
Later in 1978, lead guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley joined the band, restoring Wings to touring strength. In 1979, McCartney signed a new record contract, leaving Capitol, the company he had been with in the US and Canada since he was a Beatle, and joining Columbia Records, while remaining with Parlophone in the rest of the world. Influenced by the punk and new wave scenes, Wings abandoned its mellow touch and hired Chris Thomas to help in the production process. The result was a somewhat less polished sound. This new version of Wings released the disco-oriented single &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot;, backed by &quot;Daytime Nighttime Suffering&quot;, which reached the top 5 in both the US and UK. However, the subsequent album &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; was not favourably received by critics and although it went platinum in the US, sales were disappointing in comparison to its immediate predecessors. It contained the Grammy-winning song &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot;, the result of an October 1978 superstar session with members of Wings, the Who, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd, among others. Three singles, &quot;Old Siam, Sir&quot; (UK only), &quot;Getting Closer&quot;, and &quot;Arrow Through Me&quot; (US only), were culled from the album, but performed poorly on the charts. During much of 1979, Wings were inactive as McCartney worked on a new solo album (&quot;McCartney II&quot;) without the band.

In November and December 1979, Wings toured the UK, once again adding the horns and brass section consisting of Tony Dorsey, Howie Casey, Thaddeus Richard, and Steve Howard. This tour climaxed with a massive &quot;Rockestra&quot; all-star collection of musicians in London in aid of UNICEF and Kampuchean refugees. Also during this tour, a live version of the &quot;McCartney II&quot; track &quot;Coming Up&quot; was recorded in Glasgow and became Wings&#x27; sixth US number one hit the following year.

Paul McCartney and his family arrived in Japan on 16 January 1980 for the planned 11-date Wings&#x27; concert tour of Japan (due to visit Budokan Hall, Tokyo from 21 to 24 January 1980; Aichi-Ken, Taiiku-Kan, Nagoya on 25–26; Festival Hall, Osaka on 28; Osaka Furitsu-Kan, Osaka on 29; Budokan Hall, Tokyo from 31 January to 2 February 1980). McCartney was arrested immediately upon arriving at New Tokyo Airport for possession of of marijuana (with an estimated street value of 600,000 yen) hidden in Paul&#x27;s luggage. The arrest put the tour in jeopardy and Wings&#x27; music was immediately banned from all television and radio stations across Japan. Wings&#x27; Japanese promoters claimed that almost 100,000 tickets for the concerts had been sold, representing a possible loss of well over 100 million yen. The promoters had no option but to cancel all of the tour dates the day after McCartney&#x27;s arrest. The other band members of Wings, except Linda, left Japan and returned to England on 21 January 1980. McCartney spent ten days in jail before being (unexpectedly) released without charge on 25 January 1980 and deported. After returning to England, McCartney decided to release his solo album &quot;McCartney II&quot; and plans for a US tour were subsequently dropped. Meanwhile, Denny Laine released the single &quot;Japanese Tears&quot; and formed the short-lived Denny Laine Band with Steve Holley and released a solo album &quot;Japanese Tears&quot; that December.

By 1980, McCartney was growing weary of maintaining Wings and his personal and professional aspirations began to diverge from the group. The McCartneys now had three school-age children and had moved out of London to the countryside of East Sussex, desiring that their children have a normal upbringing. Musically, McCartney was dissatisfied by the band&#x27;s performances during the 1979 UK tour, and when rehearsals for the next album began in October, it was apparent his latest songs were not a good fit for the band. Consequently, he and George Martin, who would be producing the album, decided not to use Wings for recording. Instead, top session musicians and guest artists were brought in to make the best possible album. In November 1980, Holley and Juber were told they would not be needed for the new album and other than sessions in January 1981 to finish work on the &quot;Cold Cuts&quot; album of previously unreleased tracks, no further activities were scheduled for Wings. Juber has said he could see the &quot;writing on the wall&quot; regarding Wings&#x27; future at that point and moved to New York to continue his career there.

Laine stayed on for the &quot;Tug of War&quot; sessions in Montserrat in February 1981 but his relationship with McCartney had become strained over business and personal matters. Laine had begun to feel that he was not being adequately compensated for his role in Wings, and was particularly bitter that he was employed as a contract writer on &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;, a song he co-wrote with McCartney. He had been paid a flat fee for his contributions so when the song became a hit, he did not share in the royalties. Laine was also upset with McCartney over his drug arrest in Japan which meant a loss of extra income from the tour as well as putting future tour plans in doubt. Laine&#x27;s marriage was also troubled, and his wife and the McCartneys did not get along well, adding to his upset with Wings. In April 1981, Laine announced he was leaving Wings, citing the lack of tour plans as the reason. While Laine&#x27;s departure effectively ended the band, a spokesman for McCartney said that Wings still continued as an active concept. McCartney finally acknowledged the band no longer existed while promoting the release of &quot;Tug of War&quot; in 1982.

=== The Country Hams ===
The Country Hams was a pseudonym used by the group for the release of the single &quot;Walking in the Park with Eloise&quot; in 1974, a song written years before by Paul&#x27;s father James. Wings (with guest musicians Chet Atkins and Floyd Cramer) recorded it during the sessions for Junior&#x27;s Farm.

=== Suzy and the Red Stripes ===
Suzy and the Red Stripes was a pseudonym used by the group for the release of the Linda McCartney and Wings single &quot;Seaside Woman&quot; in 1977. It was written and sung by Linda McCartney. It was the only release by Wings under that name. Linda said that the &quot;Suzy and the Red Stripes&quot; pseudonym came about because she had been called &quot;Suzi&quot; in Jamaica because of &quot;a fantastic reggae version of &#x27;Suzi Q&#x27;&quot;, and Red Stripe is Jamaica&#x27;s leading brand of beer.

=== Partial reunions ===
In March 1997, Denny Laine, Laurence Juber and Steve Holley did an impromptu &quot;Wings&quot; reunion at a Beatlefest convention in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This was not a planned event, and no further reunions were intended. However, ten years later, in July 2007, Laine, Juber and Denny Seiwell reunited for one show at a Beatlefest (renamed Fest for Beatles Fans) convention in Las Vegas. Among other songs, they performed &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; and &quot;Go Now&quot;. Laine and Seiwell appeared again at the Fest for Beatles Fans in Secaucus, New Jersey, in March 2010 and were joined by Juber at the Fest in Chicago in August 2010.

Laine, Juber and Seiwell performed together at the Fest for Beatles Fans in Los Angeles, California, in October 2014; the setlist included &quot;Hi, Hi, Hi&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot;. In August 2017, the trio performed at the festival once again, this time joined by drummer Steve Holley.

Laine, Juber, Seiwell and Holley performed together in January 2018 at Grand Oak Live, a music venue in Upland, California, headlining an event called Imagine Something Yesterday.

Laine, Juber and Holley performed again in March 2019 at the Fest for Beatles Fans in Jersey City, New Jersey performing songs from the band&#x27;s final album &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Wings had twelve top-10 singles (including one number one) in the UK and fourteen top 10 singles (including six number ones) in the US. All 23 singles released by Wings reached the US top 40, and one two-sided hit, &quot;Junior&#x27;s Farm&quot;/&quot;Sally G&quot;, reached the top 40 with each side. Of the nine albums released by Wings, all went top 10 in either the UK or the US, with five consecutive albums topping the US charts. Paul McCartney was unquestionably Wings&#x27; leader and dominant creative force, but Denny Laine, Jimmy McCulloch, and Linda McCartney all contributed a little in songwriting, and Laine, McCulloch, Joe English, and Linda McCartney all performed a few lead vocals.

The success of Wings was a vindication for McCartney. His first few post-Beatles albums were highly criticized and often dismissed by critics as &quot;lightweight&quot; next to the more serious nature of his former bandmates&#x27; solo output. But by the mid-1970s, the solo careers of the other three former Beatles were in varying degrees of decline, with John Lennon putting his career on hold in 1975 for the first five years of his son Sean&#x27;s life. A year later, George Harrison had all but retired from live performances, with his new releases failing to match the success of his initial solo output. Ringo Starr was living in Los Angeles and was writing and recording, but as a solo artist had not been performing onstage other than rare guest appearances. Meanwhile, Wings continued to tour regularly and enjoy much commercial success. According to author Robert Rosen, by 1980, Lennon was envious enough of McCartney&#x27;s continuing success to make his re-emergence on the music scene.

One of the criticisms of Wings was that the other members were little more than sidemen backing up a solo McCartney. Guitarist Henry McCullough quit the band because he grew tired of being told by McCartney exactly what to play, and said that Wings were never a &quot;real band.&quot; On the other hand, other former members of Wings such as Joe English and Laurence Juber have said that they were allowed a degree of creative freedom. In an interview, Juber, Wings&#x27; third lead guitarist, said, &quot;I was a sideman, but the job assignment very much included considering myself a part of the band ... In all its incarnations Wings sounded like a band, not like a solo McCartney project and I think that reflects well not only on Paul&#x27;s ability to share in the creative process, but also on the importance of Denny and Linda&#x27;s contributions, too. The other players brought their own personalities to the scene.&quot;

In addition to its own output, Wings recorded several songs that were released through various outlets both before and after the band&#x27;s break-up. Denny Laine&#x27;s 1977 solo album &quot;Holly Days&quot; was a joint effort by Laine with Paul and Linda McCartney; three songs on Laine&#x27;s 1980 solo album &quot;Japanese Tears&quot; were performed by Wings with Laine on lead vocals; Laine also contributed to several songs on Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1982 and 1983 solo albums &quot;Tug of War&quot; and &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot;, respectively. Juber&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Maisie&quot;—which was backed by members of Wings—appeared on his solo album &quot;Standard Time&quot;. The McCartneys and Laine contributed backing vocals to George Harrison&#x27;s 1981 tribute to John Lennon, &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;. Linda McCartney continued to tour and record with her husband up until her death in 1998, after which a compilation of her songs entitled &quot;Wide Prairie&quot; was released that featured seven Wings songs written or co-written by her. Wings also backed Paul&#x27;s brother Mike McGear on the &quot;McGear&quot; album, as well as McGear&#x27;s band the Scaffold on the single &quot;Liverpool Lou&quot; and its B-side &quot;Ten Years After on Strawberry Jam&quot;. Paul McCartney also used three unreleased Wings songs as B-sides of his solo singles several years after Wings&#x27; break-up.

Wings&#x27; 1977 single &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;/&quot;Girls School&quot; is still the biggest-selling non-charity single in the UK (although Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; sold more, its sales include a reissue in aid of the Terrence Higgins Trust), and it ranked fourth in the official list of all-time best-selling singles in the UK issued in 2002.

In 2001, &quot;&quot; was released, a project spanning an album and a television special retrospective.

Founding member Denny Laine died on 5 December 2023, at the age of 79.

In 2024, &quot;One Hand Clapping&quot;, a live-in-studio album recorded in 1974, was finally released.

<text>Breakfast television (Europe and Australia) or morning show (Canada and the United States) is a type of news or infotainment television programme that broadcasts live in the morning (typically scheduled between 5:00 and 10:00a.m., or if it is a local programme, as early as 4:00a.m.). Often presented by a small team of hosts, these programmes are typically marketed towards the combined demography of people getting ready for work and school and stay-at-home adults and parents.

The first – and longest-running – national breakfast/morning show on television is &quot;Today&quot;, which set the tone for the genre and premiered on 14 January 1952 on NBC in the United States. For the next 70 years, &quot;Today&quot; was the number one morning program in the ratings for the vast majority of its run and since its start, many other television stations and television networks around the world have followed NBC&#x27;s lead, copying that program&#x27;s successful format.

==Format and style==
Breakfast television/morning show programs are geared toward popular and demographic appeal. The first half of a morning program is typically targeted at work commuters with a focus on hard news and feature segments; often featuring updates on major stories that occurred overnight or during the previous day, political news and interviews, reports on business and sport-related headlines, weather forecasts (either on a national or regional basis), and traffic reports (generally common with locally produced morning shows on terrestrial television stations serving more densely populated cities, though this has begun to filter down to smaller markets as Intelligent transportation system networks have spread further into smaller communities). Later in the program, segments will typically begin to target a dominantly female demographic with a focus on &quot;infotainment&quot;, such as human-interest, lifestyle and entertainment stories. Many local or regional morning shows feature field reports highlighting local events, attractions and/or businesses, in addition to those involving stories that occurred during the overnight or expected to happen in the coming day.

Morning programs that air across national networks may offer a break for local stations or affiliates to air a brief news update segment during the show, which typically consists of a recap of major local news headlines, along with weather and, in some areas, traffic reports. In the United States, some morning shows also allow local affiliates to incorporate a short local forecast into a national weather segment – a list of forecasts for major U.S. cities are typically shown on affiliates which do not produce such a &quot;cut-in&quot; segment.

During the early morning hours (generally before 10:00a.m. local time), local anchors will mention the current time – sometimes, along with the current temperature – in various spots during the newscast, while national anchors of shows covering more than one time zone will mention the current time as &quot;&#x27;xx&#x27; minutes after the hour&quot; or &quot;before the hour&quot;; the time and/or temperature are also usually displayed within the station or programme&#x27;s digital on-screen graphic during most segments within the broadcast. (Most local stations originally displayed the current time and temperature only during their morning newscasts, though many began to extend this display within their logo bug to their midday and evening newscasts starting in the mid-1990s, starting in major markets and eventually expanding to stations in smaller markets.) Especially with their universal expansion to cable news outlets in the early 2000s, many news-oriented morning shows also incorporate news tickers showing local, national and/or international headlines; weather forecasts; sport scores; and, in some jurisdictions where one operates, lottery numbers from the previous drawing day during the broadcast (although these may be shown during rolling news blocks or throughout the programming day on cable news outlets, some local stations that have utilized tickers solely for their morning shows have extended them to later newscasts, whereas others only display them during their morning news programs).

The three breakfast morning shows in the United States (&quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;) air live only in the Eastern Time Zone. (Spanish-language shows air live in the Eastern, Central, and Mountain time zones.) Stations in the remaining time zones receive these programs on a tape delay, with an updated feed broadcast to viewers in the Pacific Time Zone. Occasionally, a morning show may be broadcast nationwide if their staff is handling coverage of breaking news during its broadcast hours, or special live news events (such as British royal weddings).

==History==
===United States===
====Network and local programs====
The first morning news program was &quot;Three To Get Ready&quot;, a local production hosted by comedian Ernie Kovacs that aired on WPTZ (now KYW-TV) in Philadelphia from 1950 to 1952. Although the program (named after WPTZ&#x27;s channel number, 3) was mostly entertainment-oriented, the program did feature some news and weather segments. Its success prompted NBC to look at producing something similar on a national basis. Following the lead of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, which debuted in January 1952, and was the first morning news program to be aired nationally, many other broadcast stations and television networks around the world followed and imitated that program&#x27;s enormously successful format with news, lifestyle features, and personality.

CBS, in contrast, has struggled since television&#x27;s early age to maintain a long-term morning program. Though it initially tried to mimic &quot;Today&quot; when it debuted a morning show in a two-hour format in 1954, the show was reduced to one hour within a year in order to make room for the new children&#x27;s television series &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. The network abandoned the morning show in 1957. From the late 1960s throughout the 1970s, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; (later re-used as the title of the network&#x27;s early-morning newscast from 1987 to 2024) aired as a straight one-hour morning newscast that had a high rate of turnover among its anchors. In January 1979, CBS launched &quot;Morning&quot; (titled in accordance with the day of the week, such as &quot;Monday Morning&quot;, and airing Sunday through Friday), which focused more on long-form feature reports, a format that would be most closely associated with its Sunday edition, although it emphasized hard news during the week. This format, however, was relegated exclusively to Sundays after two years, and still airs under the title &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;. It was not until 1982 that &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; ended its run on weekdays (it continued on weekend mornings before ending altogether in 1984), allowing CBS to expand its morning show to a full two hours. However, the high rate of turnover among anchors returned. An ill-fated comedic revamp of the show, &quot;The Morning Program&quot;, debuted in 1987; with its awkward mix of news, entertainment and comedy bits, the program (which was produced primarily by a unit of the network&#x27;s entertainment division) was heavily panned by critics. After that, however, came &quot;This Morning&quot;, which has to date had the longest run of any of CBS&#x27; morning show attempts. &quot;This Morning&quot; was eventually cancelled 12 years later, being replaced by &quot;The Early Show&quot; in 1999; &quot;The Early Show&quot;, in turn, ceded to the new version of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; (this time featuring a format focused more on hard news and interviews, excising lifestyle and infotainment segments) in January 2012; &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; proved to be more successful, but anchor turnover (especially after the removal of Charlie Rose after allegations of workplace sexual harassment) and other factors eroded its audience, resulting in its replacement by &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; in 2021—a program that carries a skew towards news and lifestyle content similar to its competitors.

ABC was a latecomer to the morning show competition. Instead of carrying a national show, it instead adopted the &quot;AM&quot; franchise introduced by many of its local stations in 1970. KABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;AM Los Angeles&quot; launched the national career of Regis Philbin and was a direct predecessor to his syndicated talk show &quot;Live!&quot;. &quot;AM Chicago&quot; on WLS-TV would later evolve into &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, which went on to become one of the most successful programs in the history of American television syndication (however, &quot;Oprah&quot; usually aired in the afternoon in most markets). &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; on WEWS-TV was Cleveland&#x27;s entry into the franchise; with its light format, ABC (after a brief but failed effort to launch the Los Angeles version nationally as &quot;AM America&quot;) launched a national program based closely on the format of &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; and &quot;Good Day!&quot; (a similar program that aired on Boston affiliate WCVB-TV) in November 1975 under the title &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. &quot;GMA&quot; has traditionally run in second place (ahead of CBS&#x27;s various morning efforts but behind &quot;Today&quot;), but has surpassed &quot;Today&quot; in the ratings a few times throughout its history (first in the early 1980s, then from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s and again regularly since 2012). Since the 1980s, &quot;Live!&quot; (now hosted by Kelly Ripa and her husband Mark Consuelos) has been produced and distributed by ABC&#x27;s syndication arm, primarily for ABC stations (although not exclusively, as it is carried on stations affiliated with other networks), but produced by ABC&#x27;s New York City owned-and-operated station, WABC-TV.

Members of PBS, the nation&#x27;s main public television network, typically air children&#x27;s programming from the network&#x27;s PBS Kids lineup during the morning and daytime hours. Some members may also carry exercise-oriented programs as early-morning programming (such as &quot;Lilias, Yoga and You&quot;). From 1974 to 1995, Maryland Public Television offered &quot;A.M. Weather&quot;, a 15-minute national weather update staffed by meteorologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). From 1994 to 2002, WPBT distributed the &quot;Morning Business Report&quot;, a 15-minute financial news spin-off of the syndicated &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot; (which was also distributed by the Miami member station).

Fox, the youngest of the &quot;Big Four&quot; broadcast networks, does not have a morning show and has only once attempted such a program; the network attempted to transition sister cable network FX&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; to Fox as &quot;Fox After Breakfast&quot; in 1996, to little success, but instead has ceded to its local affiliates and Fox Television Stations, which have programmed fully local morning news programs that are at parity or have overtaken their Big Three network counterparts.

The CW (and before that, its co-predecessor The WB) carried &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; for its national small-market feed, The CW Plus (as well as its predecessor, The WB 100+ Station Group) from 2002 to 2014, in lieu of a national program; that program was also mainly syndicated to affiliates of The CW and MyNetworkTV (and predecessors The WB and UPN) as well as several independent stations until its abrupt cancellation in April 2015. Generally since then, outside of a few select CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, stations usually program infomercials, a local extension of a Big Three sister station&#x27;s morning newscast during national morning shows, or as Sinclair Broadcast Group did from July 2017 until March 2019, returned to programming for children under the KidsClick block. In 2021, Sinclair launched a rolling syndicated newscast, &quot;The National Desk&quot; (since renamed &quot;The National News Desk&quot;), formatted as a &quot;commentary-free&quot; hard news program (despite the company&#x27;s history of requiring its stations to air conservative-leaning must-run news and opinion segments during their local newscasts); the program has since expanded to include evening and weekend editions, along with a companion to the morning broadcast, &quot;The National Weather Desk&quot; (focusing on weather news, climate reporting and regional forecasts).

A few of the major Spanish language broadcast networks also produce morning shows, which are often focused more towards entertainment and tabloid headlines, interviews, and features, rather than hard news. &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot; is the longest-running Spanish language morning program on U.S. network television, having aired on Univision since April 1997. Similar to CBS&#x27;s struggles to maintain continuity with its morning shows, Telemundo had made several attempts at hard news and traditional morning shows dating to the late 1990s, including &quot;Cada Dia&quot;, and &quot;Un Nuevo Día&quot;, which launched in 2008 under the title &quot;¡Levántate!&quot;, and would win the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Morning Program in Spanish in 2015 and 2017. In 2021, Telemundo attempted another relaunch of its morning show, &quot;Hoy Dia&quot;, which was positioned as a news-centric morning show closer in format to its NBC counterpart &quot;Today&quot;. However, in 2022, Telemundo used a hiatus for the 2022 FIFA World Cup to move &quot;Hoy Dia&quot; from its news department to its entertainment division, resulting in the program transitioning to an entertainment-oriented format.

Local television stations began producing their own morning shows in the 1970s, most of which mirrored the format of their network counterparts, mixing news and weather segments with talk and lifestyle features; stations in many mid-sized and smaller markets with heavy rural populations also produced farm reports, featuring stories about people and events in rural communities, rundowns of agricultural product exchange data from the previous day and weather forecasts tailored to farmers (although the number of these programs have dwindled on the local level since the 1990s, three such programs still exist in national syndication, the weekdaily &quot;AgDay&quot; and the weekend-only &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot; and &quot;This Week in Agribusiness&quot; (the latter of which was created and remains hosted by former &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot; personalities Orion Samuelson and Max Armstrong), which have also received national distribution on cable and satellite via RFD-TV; the latter program had also previously aired on WGN America until 2008).

More traditional local newscasts began taking hold in morning timeslots (mainly on stations that maintain their own news departments) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These programs began as half-hour or one-hour local newscasts that aired immediately before the national shows and were led in by more hard news-focused, early-morning network newscasts (&quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News This Morning&quot; and the early-morning iteration of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;; the former has since been replaced by &quot;Early Today&quot;, while the latter shows are now titled &quot;Good Morning America First Look&quot; and &quot;CBS News Mornings&quot;). However, since that time, they have slowly expanded, either by pushing an earlier start time or by adding additional hours on other stations that are owned, managed or which outsource their local news content to that station, thereby competing with the network shows.

Similarly, following the launch of Fox in the late 1980s, many news-producing stations affiliated with major networks not among the traditional &quot;Big Three television networks&quot; or which operate as independent stations began producing morning newscasts that compete in part with national counterparts in part or the entirety of the 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. time period; by the late 2000s, these stations began to expand their morning shows into the 9:00 a.m. hour (where they normally compete with syndicated programs on ABC and CBS stations, and the third hour of &quot;Today&quot; on NBC stations) and in some markets, expanded into the 10:00 a.m. hour by the late 2010s. The expansion of news on Fox affiliates, along with advertising restrictions involving with the Children&#x27;s Television Act, effectively ended the morning children&#x27;s television market on broadcast television by the mid-2000s. Beginning in the early 2010s, stations began experimenting with 4:30 a.m. and even 4:00 a.m. newscasts in some major markets (and even gradually expanding into mid-size and some smaller markets), pushing local news further into what traditionally is known as an overnight graveyard slot. Some local morning newscasts, which formerly had both softer &quot;morning&quot; musical and graphical packages and lighter news, along with feature segments with local businesses and organizations, now resemble their later-day counterparts with hard news coverage of overnight events. 

Some locally produced morning shows that utilize a mainly infotainment format still exist, most prominently among some large and mid-market stations owned by the E. W. Scripps Company (which inherited the &quot;Morning Blend&quot; format originated in 2006 by the Journal Media Group following its 2015 acquisition of that company&#x27;s stations) and Tegna Inc. (which inherited many of the local talk/lifestyle shows originated by Belo – such as &quot;Good Morning Texas&quot; on Dallas ABC affiliate WFAA – prior to the 2014 acquisition of the latter group by the predecessor broadcasting unit of Gannett), and often serving as lead-outs of national network morning shows. These shows are not usually produced by a station&#x27;s news department, as they are intended as a vehicle for advertorial content that promotes local businesses and events.

====Cable television====
Cable news outlets have adopted the morning show format as well. &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; on Fox News follows a similar format to the networks&#x27; morning shows (though it incorporates conservative commentary similar to that featured on other Fox News programs), while MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Way Too Early&quot; and &quot;Morning Joe&quot; follow a pundit-driven format with a larger focus on political analysis and panel discussions. Some morning shows have been television simulcasts of talk radio shows, including &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; (which aired on MSNBC from 1997 to 2007, when the network cancelling its contract for the program after host Don Imus made a racially charged remark during a broadcast, and subsequently aired on Fox Business and later RFD-TV before being cancelled in 2018), and sports talk programs such as &quot;Boomer and Gio&quot; (originally simulcast on MSG Network in the New York market from 2010 to 2013, and then nationally on CBS Sports Network starting in 2014) and &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; (which has been simulcast on various cable networks and streaming platforms since 2009, and since 2020, has streamed on Peacock). 

CNN had primarily aired rolling news blocks (such as &quot;Early Edition&quot; and &quot;CNN Live This Morning&quot;) in the morning hours until it debuted &quot;American Morning&quot;, which followed a format focusing upon news and political headlines, in 2001. In 2011, the program was replaced by &quot;Starting Point&quot;, which focused more upon topical discussions. Amid low ratings, &quot;Starting Point&quot; was replaced in 2013 by &quot;New Day&quot;, shifting towards general news and politics. In 2022, &quot;New Day&quot; was replaced by &quot;CNN This Morning&quot;, an attempt by then-CNN president Chris Licht to emulate the &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and &quot;Morning Joe&quot; formats he had installed during his tenures at CBS News and MSNBC. It was cancelled in 2024 amid another change in leadership and associated cuts; a block of CNN&#x27;s daytime program &quot;CNN News Central&quot; was moved into its timeslot, while the &quot;This Morning&quot; branding was retained by CNN&#x27;s weekend morning show, and repurposed by CNN&#x27;s early-morning program &quot;Early Start&quot; (which had originally premiered alongside &quot;Starting Point&quot;).

The Weather Channel originally has long featured forecast programs with a primary emphasis on business travelers and work commuters, culminating in the debuts of &quot;Your Weather Today&quot; (in 2000) and its business travel-focused, early-morning counterpart &quot;First Outlook&quot; (in 2001). Since 2014, &quot;America&#x27;s Morning Headquarters&quot; (&quot;AMHQ&quot;), previously hosted by former &quot;Good Morning America&quot; weather anchor Sam Champion, has served as its main morning show; the program&#x27;s weekday edition has expanded over time, extending to seven hours (lasting until 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time) by 2024, with a shorter four-hour edition on weekends. With a shift toward a mix of weather and infotainment programs in the late-2000s, TWC premiered &quot;Wake Up with Al&quot;, an early-morning show hosted by &quot;Today&quot; weather anchor Al Roker, in 2009. The show was cancelled in October 2015 amid a transition away from infotainment programming (it was the only TWC program to be produced primarily outside of Atlanta) with the timeslot filled by an extension of &quot;AMHQ&quot;.

Entertainment channels such as VH1 and E! have also aired morning shows (such as &quot;Big Morning Buzz Live&quot; and &quot;That Morning Show&quot;, and the 2020 version of &quot;E! News&quot;). Sports channels sometimes carry morning shows (such as ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Get Up&quot; and NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Football&quot;), with a focus on news headlines (including highlights of events that occurred the previous day, and previews of events occurring that day) and topical discussions.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, breakfast television typically runs from 6:00a.m. to between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.

Television broadcasting hours in the United Kingdom until early 1972 were tightly regulated and controlled by the British government under the control of the Postmaster-General. Restrictions were placed on how many hours per day could be used by licensees for television broadcasts. By the mid-1960s, this was allocated at seven hours per day (Monday through Fridays) and 7.5 hours per day (Saturdays and Sundays), thus providing a 50-hour broadcasting limit per week. Certain programming was exempt from these restrictions (schools, adult education, religion, sport); however no time was allocated to breakfast television until the early 1970s.

In January 1972, under the then-Conservative government, the Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced to the British parliament that all such restrictions would be lifted, and daily broadcasting hours could now be set by the individual broadcaster. By October 1972, both the BBC and ITV were providing daytime television programmes, with the commercially licensed ITV taking full advantage of the relaxed broadcasting hours. However, due to financial issues and the economic problems of the 1970s, breakfast television was not considered until later in the decade.

After a nine-week trial in 1977 on the regional television stations Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (which oversaw all ITV licensees) considered breakfast television so important that it created an entire franchise for the genre, becoming the only national independent television franchise. At the end of 1980, this franchise was awarded to TV-am. Initially planned for launch in 1982, it was delayed until the start of 1983 so that it didn&#x27;t take any oxygen from the launch of the UK&#x27;s fourth channel. This allowed BBC1 to launch its own morning programme first on 17 January 1983, &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. TV-am, with &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; as its flagship programme, launched just over two weeks later. on 1 February. TV-am struggled at first because of a format that was considered to be stodgy and formal compared to the more relaxed magazine style of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;, and a reliance on advertising income from a timeslot when people were not accustomed to watching television. However, it eventually flourished, only to lose its licence at the end of 1992, after being outbid by GMTV.

Breakfast television appeared on Channel 4 in April 1989 when it launched &quot;The Channel 4 Daily&quot;, which was conceived as a &quot;newspaper&quot; with a collection of various short-form segments. In 1992, after failing to attract an audience, Channel 4 replaced it with &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; — a more informal morning show with a focus on entertainment and comedy, presented from studios constructed in an actual house. The new format proved to be much more successful. 1989 also saw BBC2 launch a breakfast service: its news-based offering was launched to allow the BBC to provide a daily report on events at Westminster and was supplemented by teletext news pages from Ceefax and a 15-minute simulcast of &quot;BBC Breakfast News&quot;.

In 2010, ITV plc, which by then owned 75% of GMTV, gained full control of the station after it acquired the remaining 25% stake held by The Walt Disney Company. In September 2010, the full legal name of the licensing company was changed from &quot;GMTV Limited&quot; to &quot;ITV Breakfast Limited&quot;, with &quot;GMTV&quot; closing on 3 September and &quot;Daybreak&quot; and &quot;Lorraine&quot; launching on 6 September 2010. ITV had big difficulties with the slot as well; &quot;Daybreak&quot; was eventually cancelled in 2014 due to low ratings, and was replaced by &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on 28 April 2014. The series continues to trail &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; consistently, and has marketed with the traditional &quot;Today&quot; format mixed with political debates. One of the co-hosts was Piers Morgan, until his departure in 2021, and the programme used his notoriety as a marketing point, to middling success.

The regional variations of BBC One and ITV1, the only terrestrial networks that provide localized news bulletins, do not air local breakfast television programmes, though abbreviated regional news opt-outs are provided each half-hour during &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. Outside of these short bulletins, local breakfast programmes in the vein of those broadcast in North America were largely nonexistent in the UK for most of the history of British television. From 2007 to 2009, now-defunct local channel Channel M, which served Greater Manchester, broadcast a three-hour breakfast programme called &quot;Channel M Breakfast&quot;; it was cancelled in May 2009, amid significant local programming and staffing cutbacks at the station. Several local television channels launched during the 2010s as part of then-culture secretary Jeremy Hunt&#x27;s Local Digital Television Programme, particularly those owned by Local TV Limited, broadcast two hours of local news at breakfast as part of their news and public affairs programming remits.

Since its launch in 2021, news channel GB News has aired a breakfast show called &quot;The Great British Breakfast&quot;. It was originally anchored by three presenters in the style of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, but soon shifted to a two-anchor format.

In May 2015, Global made changes to their &quot;Morning News&quot; programs east of Alberta; instead of the entire show being anchored locally, 16 minutes of each hour is anchored in Toronto for national and international news stories. Each &quot;Morning News&quot; program starts at 6 a.m. and ends at 9 a.m., with the exception of Global BC, Global Calgary, and Global Edmonton, which start their broadcasts at 5 a.m.. These three stations also air weekend editions of &quot;Morning News&quot; which start at 7 a.m. and end at 10 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. In 2013, Global Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Show&quot; was extended by half an hour. The additional half-hour is broadcast on every Global station at 9 a.m..

Locally produced programs featuring a franchise title on affiliates of Fox, the CW, MyNetworkTV, independent stations and associated Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC):
* &quot;Daybreak&quot; - This title is used by WISH-TV in Indianapolis to brand its morning newscasts, and has been branded &quot;Daybreak&quot; for as long WISH-TV has produced Morning Newscasts, and when they were once affiliated with CBS. &quot;Daybreak&quot; is also used by Gray Television&#x27;s KKCO/KJCT-LP in Grand Junction, Colorado. 
* &quot;Good Day&quot; – Fox&#x27;s local morning news show format is used by both stations that are either owned-and-operated or affiliated with the network (i.e., &quot;Good Day L.A.&quot; in Los Angeles). The program may have a different name in several markets (e.g., &quot;Fox 6 WakeUp News&quot; on WITI in Milwaukee), but the format is the same from market to market. WAGA-TV adopted the name of their local morning newscast &quot;Good Day Atlanta&quot; in 1992 while still affiliated with CBS and taking the place of the first incarnation of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. ABC affiliate WATN-TV in Memphis which was once affiliated with Fox uses the title &quot;Good Day Memphis&quot; for their morning newscasts.
* &quot;Good Morning [region]&quot; – used by local ABC affiliates to complement &quot;Good Morning America&quot; (e.g., &quot;Good Morning Twin Tiers&quot; on WENY in Elmira, New York). KTVK which was once an ABC affiliate from 1955 until 1996 and is now an Independent/CBS alternate station; continues to use the title &quot;Good Morning Arizona&quot; for their morning newscast that runs from 4:30 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. WHBQ-TV, a Fox affiliated station in Memphis but once affiliated with ABC uses the title &quot;Good Morning Memphis&quot; for their morning newscasts. 
** An earlier variant is &quot;A.M. [region]&quot; (such as with &quot;AM Buffalo&quot; on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York), which was later adapted by ABC for &quot;AM America&quot;, a short-lived morning show that aired on the network for eleven months in 1975 before it chose to adapt Cleveland affiliate WEWS&#x27; local program &quot;The Morning Exchange&quot; into the future national format for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. The 1980s PBS program &quot;A.M. Weather&quot; also used the same title form.
* &quot;[Station Calls/Branding] Morning News&quot; – The defunct Tribune Broadcasting&#x27;s local morning news show format usually seen on the company&#x27;s Fox- and CW-affiliated stations (such as WPIX in New York City, New York; WGN-TV in Chicago; KTLA in Los Angeles; KCPQ in Seattle; and WXIN in Indianapolis), though this format has also been used on Fox and CW stations – as well as a few ABC, CBS and NBC stations – not owned by Tribune (such as the &quot;Fox 25 Morning News&quot; on KOKH in Oklahoma City) under a more generic title form. Tribune was purchased by Nexstar Media Group in 2019, with WPIX sold to the E. W. Scripps Company at the same time (WITI and KCPQ were sold to Fox Television Stations in March 2020), though no changes are expected to any of those programs or their titling. Scripps sold WPIX to Mission Broadcasting in 2020, which allows Nexstar to operate the station.
* &quot;[Station Calls/Branding] This Morning&quot; – used primarily on CBS owned-and-operated stations and affiliates (such as &quot;CBS 2 News This Morning&quot; on WCBS-TV in New York City). It has been used by CBS stations for their newscasts since prior to the 1999 cancellation of the first incarnation of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;; the name and format has also been sporadically used on non-CBS affiliates. Some CBS stations renamed their program to &quot;The [Branding/Calls] Early Show&quot; to match the national title of CBS&#x27;s 1999–2012 morning program.
** A variant of this branding is simply titled &quot;Mornings&quot;, and has been adopted by CBS as the name of their current Morning program. Currently used by Scripps KNXV-TV (ABC) and sister station KASW (CW) in Phoenix for their respected morning newscast that airs on both stations. 
* &quot;Today in [region]&quot; or &quot;[Branding/calls] Today&quot; – used by NBC affiliates to complement &quot;Today&quot; (such as &quot;Today in Central New York&quot; on WSTM-TV in Syracuse, New York); Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami brands its morning newscast &quot;Today in Florida&quot;, that station has used the title since 1988 when it was an NBC affiliate, even after the morning newscast on the market&#x27;s NBC O&amp;O WTVJ began to use the similar title &quot;Today in South Florida&quot;. Similarly, sister station WHDH in Boston retained its morning show title &quot;Today in New England&quot; despite losing their NBC affiliation at the start of 2017; replacement NBC O&amp;O station WBTS-CD uses the title &quot;NBC Boston Today&quot;.
* &quot;Wake Up&quot; – also used primarily on CBS affiliates, often with the city name or local region after it (such as &quot;Wake Up Rochester&quot; on WROC-TV in Rochester, New York and &quot;Wake Up Western Slope&quot; on KREX-TV in Grand Junction, Colorado). In the example of WITI&#x27;s &quot;Fox 6 WakeUp News&quot; noted above, that station has used the title since 1992 when it was a CBS affiliate, with the program adapting to the Fox local morning format after 1995. &quot;Wake Up&quot; was briefly used as the main title of the long running &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; children&#x27;s show (which ran for 29 years on CBS from 1955 until 1984) in 1981.
*Several stations throughout the United States use their own title forms to reflect their local character; for instance, KLFY-TV in Lafayette, Louisiana titles their morning show as &quot;Passe Partout&quot; (which has been on the station since 1957) to reflect the area&#x27;s Cajun/Creole roots.

<text>A test card, also known as a test pattern or start-up/closedown test, is a television test signal, typically broadcast at times when the transmitter is active but no program is being broadcast (often at sign-on and sign-off).

Used since the earliest TV broadcasts, test cards were originally physical cards at which a television camera was pointed, allowing for simple adjustments of picture quality. Such cards are still often used for calibration, alignment, and matching of cameras and camcorders. From the 1950s, test card images were built into monoscope tubes which freed up the use of TV cameras which would otherwise have to be rotated to continuously broadcast physical test cards during downtime hours.

Electronically generated test patterns, used for calibrating or troubleshooting the downstream signal path, were introduced in the late-1960s, and became commonly used from the 1970s and 80s. These are generated by test signal generators, which do not depend on the correct configuration (and presence) of a camera, and can also test for additional parameters such as correct color decoding, sync, frames per second, and frequency response. These patterns are specially tailored to be used in conjunction with devices such as a vectorscope, allowing precise adjustments of image equipment.

The audio broadcast while test cards are shown is typically a sine wave tone, radio (if associated or affiliated with the television channel) or music (usually instrumental, though some also broadcast with jazz or popular music).

Digitally generated cards came later, associated with digital television, and add a few features specific of digital signals, like checking for error correction, chroma subsampling, aspect ratio signaling, surround sound, etc. More recently, the use of test cards has also expanded beyond television to other digital displays such as large LED walls and video projectors.

==Technical details==
Test cards typically contain a set of patterns to enable television cameras and receivers to be adjusted to show the picture correctly (see SMPTE color bars). Most modern test cards include a set of calibrated color bars which will produce a characteristic pattern of &quot;dot landings&quot; on a vectorscope, allowing chroma and tint to be precisely adjusted between generations of videotape or network feeds. SMPTE bars—and several other test cards—include analog black (a flat waveform at 7.5 IRE, or the NTSC setup level), full white (100 IRE), and a &quot;sub-black&quot;, or &quot;blacker-than-black&quot; (at 0 IRE), which represents the lowest low-frequency transmission voltage permissible in NTSC broadcasts (though the negative excursions of the colorburst signal may go below 0 IRE). Between the color bars and proper adjustment of brightness and contrast controls to the limits of perception of the first sub-black bar, an analog receiver (or other equipment such as VTRs) can be adjusted to provide impressive fidelity. 

Test cards have also been used to determine actual coverage contours for new television broadcasting antennas and/or networks. In preparation for the new commercial ITV service in the 1950s, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) tasked Belling &amp; Lee, an Enfield-based British electronics company best known for inventing the Belling-Lee connector just over three decades earlier, with designing a series of Pilot Test Transmission test cards and slides intended for potential viewers and DX-enthusiasts to test the ITA&#x27;s new Band III VHF transmitter network that was designed with the assistance of the General Post Office (GPO), then the UK&#x27;s government-run PTT agency. These test cards, some featuring the G9AED call sign assigned by the GPO for said transmissions, featured a squiggly line in a circle in the middle of the test card with an on-screen line gauge indicated in miles which was used as a guide to reveal the distance between the receiver, the (temporary) transmitter and a replicating landscape feature causing ghosting. Said test cards were mainly transmitted from temporary mobile transmitters attached to caravan trailers based at the predicted locations of the ITA&#x27;s eventual main transmitters, such as Croydon, Lichfield, Emley Moor and Winter Hill. Almost a decade later, the BBC started using a modified SMPTE monochrome test card radiating from the Crystal Palace transmitter to test its new UHF network which it eventually launched as BBC Two in 1964.

Test cards are also used in the broader context of video displays for concerts and live events. There are a variety of different test patterns, each testing a specific technical parameter: gradient monotone bars for testing brightness and color; a crosshatch pattern for aspect ratio, alignment, focus, and convergence; and a single-pixel border for over-scanning and dimensions.

==History==


Test cards are as old as TV broadcasts, with documented use by the BBC in the United Kingdom in its early 30-line mechanical Baird transmissions from 1934 and later on as simplified &quot;tuning signals&quot; shown before startup as well as in Occupied France during World War II. They evolved to include gratings for resolution testing, grids to assist with picture geometry adjustments, and grayscale for brightness and contrast adjustments. For example, all these elements can be seen in a Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française 819-line test card introduced in 1953.

In North America, most test cards such as the famous Indian-head test pattern of the 1950s and 1960s have long since been relegated to history. The SMPTE color bars occasionally turn up, but with most North American broadcasters now following a 24-hour schedule, these too have become a rare sight.

With the introduction of color TV, electronically generated test cards were introduced. They are named after their generating equipment (ex: Grundig VG1000, Philips PM5544, Telefunken FuBK, etc.), TV station (ex: BBC test card) or organization (ex: SMPTE color bars, EBU colour bars).

In developed countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the financial imperatives of commercial television broadcasting mean that air-time is now typically filled with programmes and commercials (such as infomercials) 24 hours a day, and non-commercial broadcasters have to match this.

A late test card design, introduced in 2005 and fully adapted for HD, SD, 16:9 and 4:3 broadcasts, is defined on ITU-R Rec. BT.1729. It offers markings specificity design to test format conversions, chroma sampling, etc.

Formerly a common sight, test cards are now only rarely seen outside of television studios, post-production, and distribution facilities. In particular, they are no longer intended to assist viewers in calibration of television sets. Several factors have led to their demise for this purpose:
* Modern microcontroller-controlled analogue televisions rarely if ever need adjustment, so test cards are much less important than previously. Likewise, modern cameras and camcorders seldom need adjustment for technical accuracy, though they are often adjusted to compensate for scene light levels, and for various artistic effects.
* Use of digital interconnect standards, such as CCIR 601 and SMPTE 292M, which operate without the non-linearities and other issues inherent to analog broadcasting, do not introduce color shifts or brightness changes; thus the requirement to detect and compensate for them using this reference signal has been virtually eliminated. (Compare with the obsolescence of stroboscopes as used to adjust the speed of record players.) On the other hand, digital test signal generators do include test signals which are intended to stress the digital interface, and many sophisticated generators allow the insertion of jitter, bit errors, and other pathological conditions that can cause a digital interface to fail.
* Likewise, use of digital broadcasting standards, such as DVB and ATSC, eliminates the issues introduced by modulation and demodulation of analog signals.
* Test cards including large circles were used to confirm the linearity of the set&#x27;s deflection systems. As solid-state components replaced vacuum tubes in receiver deflection circuits, linearity adjustments were less frequently required (few newer sets have user-adjustable &quot;VERT SIZE&quot; and &quot;VERT LIN&quot; controls, for example). In LCD and other deflectionless displays, the linearity is a function of the display panel&#x27;s manufacturing quality; for the display to work, the tolerances will already be far tighter than human perception.

For custom-designed video installations, such as LED displays in buildings or at live events, some test images are custom-made to fit the specific size and shape of the setup in question. These custom test images can also be an opportunity for the technicians to hide inside jokes for the crew to see while installing equipment for a show.
==Monoscope==

Rather than physical test cards, which had to be televised using a camera, television stations often used a special purpose camera tube which had the test pattern painted on the inside screen of the tube. Each tube was only capable of generating the one test image, hence it was called a monoscope.

Monoscopes were similar in construction to an ordinary cathode-ray tube (CRT), only instead of displaying an image on its screen it scanned a built-in image. The monoscope contained a formed metal target in place of the phosphor coating at its &quot;screen&quot; end and as the electron beam scanned the target, rather than displaying an image, a varying electrical signal was produced generating a video signal from the etched pattern. Monoscope tubes had the advantage over test cards that a full TV camera was not needed, and the image was always properly framed and in focus. They fell out of use after the 1960s as they were not able to produce color images.
==Other uses==

A lesser-known kind of test pattern is used for the calibration of photocopiers. Photocopier test patterns are physical sheets that are photocopied, with the difference in the resulting photocopy revealing any tell-tale deviations or defects in the machine&#x27;s ability to copy.

There are also test patterns kits and software developed specifically for many consumer electronics. The B&amp;K Television Analyst was developed in the 1960s for testing monochrome TV sets in the NTSC standard and was later modified for European and Australian PAL standards. Among other uses, it consisted of a flying spot scanner on which a test pattern printed on a cellulose acetate slide was shown.

When CRT monitors were still commonly used on personal computers, specific test patterns were created for proper calibration of such monitors in the cases whereby multimedia images could not be shown properly on said monitors. Some VCD and DVD lens cleaner discs, such as the Kyowa Sonic lens cleaning kits from 1997–2001, also included test patterns as well.

More recent examples include the THX Optimizer which can be accessed in the setup menu in almost every THX-certified DVD, as well as well as the &quot;HDR sRGB Graphics Test (400 nits)&quot; and &quot;Test Patterns&quot; series available on Netflix meant to test out streaming bandwidth on Internet-enabled devices, especially on widescreen smart HDR TVs, 4K and 8K displays and also used to sync audio and video feeds, which can be affected, among other factors, by Bluetooth and Internet latency.

Test patterns are also used to calibrate CCTV cameras and monitors, as well as medical imaging displays and equipment for telemedicine and diagnostic purposes, such as the SMPTE RP-133 medical diagnostic imaging test pattern specification for medical and surgical displays, created around 1983–86; as well as a later derivative called the TG18-QC test pattern created by the AAPM in 2001. Test patterns to calibrate X-ray machines, in particular those manufactured by Leeds Test Objects in England, also exist as well.

==In numismatics==
Television has had such an impact in today&#x27;s life that it has been the main motif for numerous collectors&#x27; coins and medals. One of the most recent examples is The 50 Years of Television commemorative coin minted on 9 March 2005, in Austria. The obverse of the coin shows the centre portion of the Telefunken T05 test card, while the reverse shows several milestones in the history of television.

==In popular culture==
The Philips Pattern and SMPTE color bars are widely recognised as one of the iconic popular culture symbols of the 1980s and 1990s in the markets where they were used. Numerous novelty and collectible items has been patterned after the famous test card, including wall clocks, bedsheets, wristwatches, and clothing. The character Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory wore tees with both patterns and a bloggers identified the SMPTE shirt&#x27;s use in more than a dozen episodes over the life of the series.

The BBC Test Card F features throughout 2006-07 TV sci-fi detective series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;.

==Test card music==
In Britain, music rather than radio sound was usually played with the test card. The music played by the BBC, and afterwards ITV, was library music, which was licensed on more favourable terms for frequent use than commercially available alternatives. Later, Channel 4 used UK library LPs from publishers like KPM, Joseph Weinberger and Ready Music.

Until September 1955, the BBC used live playing 78 RPM commercial records as an audio background to the test cards. After that date, they switched to using recorded music on tape. The following year, the BBC began to build up its own library of specially produced music for the half hour tapes – initially three tunes in similar style, followed by an identification sign (the three notes B-B-C played on celesta). ITV (which began its first trade transmissions in 1957) continued to use commercially available recordings until the late 1960s, when it also began to make specially produced tapes.

For rights reasons, much of the music was recorded by light music orchestras in France and Germany, though sometimes by British musicians, or top international session players using pseudonyms, such as The Oscar Brandenburg Orchestra (an amalgamation of Neil Richardson, Alan Moorhouse and Johnny Pearson) or the Stuttgart Studio Orchestra. Other composers and bandleaders commissioned for this type of work included Gordon Langford, Ernest Tomlinson. Roger Roger, Heinz Kiessling, Werner Tautz, Frank Chacksfield and Syd Dale.

During the 1980s, the test card was gradually seen less and less - it was pushed out first by Teletext pages, then extended programme hours. The same tapes were used to accompany both the test card and Ceefax on BBC channels, but some fans argue that new tapes introduced after Ceefax became the norm in 1983 were less musically interesting.

<text>Franz Bäke (28 February 1898 – 12 December 1978) was a German officer and tank commander during World War II. He was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords of Nazi Germany. In post-war popular culture, Bäke was memorialised in the historical fiction series &quot;Panzer Aces&quot; by German author Franz Kurowski.

==Early career and World War I==
Born in 1898, Bäke volunteered for the German Army in May 1915 and was posted to an infantry regiment. Fighting on the Western Front, Bäke earned the Iron Cross 2nd Class in 1916. Bäke was discharged from military service in January 1919. From 1919 to 1921, Bäke served in the &quot;Freikorps&quot; Epp, a right-wing paramilitary unit named after Franz Ritter von Epp. In parallel, he studied medicine and dentistry and attained degree of Doctor of Medical Dentistry in 1923.

On 1 March 1933, Bäke joined the &quot;SA&quot;; his final rank within the SA was SA-Standartenführer as of August 1944. Bäke established his own dentistry practice in Hagen. In 1937 he was accepted into the reserves and was posted to a reconnaissance unit. In 1938, he was mobilized for full-time service as an officer and took part in the occupation of Czechoslovakia.

==World War II==
Bäke&#x27;s unit took part in the invasion of Poland as part of the 1st Light Division, which was redesignated 6th Panzer Division in October 1939. With this unit, Bäke took part in the Battle of France and Operation Barbarossa. Following the encirclement of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad, the division took part in the abortive attempt to relieve the 6th Army in Operation Winter Storm in December 1942 and then retreated to Kharkiv. In January 1943, Bäke was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. During the Battle of Kursk (Operation Citadel) in July 1943, Bäke&#x27;s unit fought near Belgorod, retreating to the Dniepr afterwards. For his actions during Operation Citadel, Bäke was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross.
On 1 November 1943, Bäke was appointed as a regimental commander. In December 1943, he was ordered to form an ad hoc reinforced tank regiment named Heavy Panzer Regiment Bäke. The regiment consisted of 46 Panther and 34 Tiger I tanks, supported by self-propelled artillery and a mechanized engineer battalion. In January 1944, Bäke commanded his regiment during the battles for the Balabonovka pocket. Bäke single-handedly destroyed three Soviet tanks during the battle with infantry weapons at close range, for which he received three Tank Destruction Badges. Next, the regiment was part of a relief effort in support of Group Stemmermann, encircled in the Cherkassy Pocket. For his actions during these battles, Bäke received the Swords to the Knight&#x27;s Cross on 21 February 1944. In March, the regiment fought in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket.

In May 1944, Bäke was promoted to Oberst and later appointed commander of Panzer Brigade &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot;. Bäke&#x27;s unit attacked the U.S. 90th Infantry Division near Aumetz on the night of 7–8 September 1944. Bäke&#x27;s command found itself poorly deployed and under sustained counter-attack from American infantry. By the evening of 8 September, Bäke had lost thirty tanks, sixty half-tracks, and nearly a hundred other vehicles in the lopsided battle. His infantry losses were also heavy, with the unit reporting to OB West that it had only nine armored vehicles and that unit strength was down to 25 per cent of the authorized establishment.
On 28 February 1945, Bäke transferred from reserve to active duty. On 10 March he was appointed commander of Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 2, formally the 13th Panzer Division, and sent to Hungary. Bäke&#x27;s division fought as part of the Panzer Corps &quot;Feldherrnhalle&quot; during the retreat through Hungary and Czechoslovakia. On 20 April, Bäke was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and officially given command of the division. On 8 May 1945 he surrendered to American forces. Bäke was interned for two years; he was released in 1947. He returned to Hagen and resumed his dental practice. He died in 1978.

==In popular culture==

Bäke is one of many highly decorated tank commanders popularised by the German author Franz Kurowski in his historical fiction book series &quot;Panzer Aces&quot;, along with Kurt Knispel and Michael Wittmann. According to historians Ronald Smelser and Edward Davies, Kurowski is a &quot;guru&quot; among those who romanticise the German war effort on the Eastern Front. Smelser and Davies define gurus as &quot;authors, [who] have picked up and disseminated the myths of the Wehrmacht in a wide variety of popular publications that romanticize the German struggle in Russia&quot;.

In Kurowski&#x27;s retelling of the operation to relieve the Cherkassy Pocket, Bäke is able to establish a corridor to the trapped German forces, after fighting unit after unit of the Red Army. Kurowski writes: &quot;when the Soviets launched their expected attack, they were wiped out by the exhausted Panzer soldiers&quot;. In another of Kurowski&#x27;s accounts, while attempting to relieve the 6th Army encircled in Stalingrad, Bäke destroys 32 enemy tanks in a single engagement.

The historian Sönke Neitzel questions the number of &quot;tank kills&quot; attributed to various tank commanders. According to Neitzel, number of successes by highly decorated soldiers should be read with caution as it is rarely possible to determine reliably in the heat of the battle how many tanks were destroyed and by whom. Military historian Steven Zaloga uses the term &quot;tank ace&quot; in quotation marks in his 2015 work &quot;Armored Champion: The Top Tanks of World War II&quot;. Zaloga points out that most of the supposed panzer aces operated the Tiger I heavy tank on the Eastern Front; having advantages both in firepower and in armor, Tiger I was &quot;nearly invulnerable in a frontal engagement&quot; against any of the Soviet tanks of that time. A crew operating a Tiger could thus engage its opponents from a safe distance.

Zaloga also discusses the &quot;romantic nonsense&quot; of the popular perception of a tank versus tank engagement as an &quot;armoured joust&quot; – two opponents facing each other, – with the &quot;more valiant or better-armed [one] the eventual victor&quot;. Most of the successful tank commanders were indeed &quot;bushwahackers&quot;, having a battlefield advantage rather than a technical one. Zaloga concludes: &quot;Most of the &#x27;tank aces&#x27; of World War II were simply lucky enough to have an invulnerable tank with a powerful gun&quot;. (quotations marks in the original).

<doc id="188280" wikidata="Q3271557" url="?curid=188280" title="Imperial cult">
<text>An imperial cult is a form of state religion in which an emperor or a dynasty of emperors (or rulers of another title) are worshipped as demigods or deities. &quot;Cult&quot; here is used to mean &quot;worship&quot;, not in the modern pejorative sense. The cult may be one of personality in the case of a newly arisen Euhemerus figure, or one of national identity (e.g., Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh or Empire of Japan) or supranational identity in the case of a multinational state (e.g., Imperial China, Roman Empire). A &quot;divine king&quot; is a monarch who is held in a special religious significance by his subjects, and serves as both head of state and a deity or head religious figure. This system of government combines theocracy with an absolute monarchy.

==Historical imperial cults==
===Ancient Egypt===
The Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were, throughout ancient Egyptian history, believed to be incarnations of the deity Horus; thereby derived by being the son of Osiris, the afterlife deity, and Isis, goddess of marriage.

The Ptolemaic dynasty based its own legitimacy in the eyes of its Greek subjects on their association with, and incorporation into, the imperial cult of Alexander the Great.

===Imperial China===
In Imperial China, the Emperor was considered the Son of Heaven. The scion and representative of heaven on earth, he was the ruler of all under heaven, the bearer of the Mandate of Heaven, his commands considered sacred edicts. A number of legendary figures preceding the proper imperial era of China also hold the honorific title of emperor, such as the Yellow Emperor and the Jade Emperor.

===Ancient Rome===
Even before the rise of the Caesars, there are traces of a &quot;regal spirituality&quot; in Roman society. In earliest Roman times the King was a spiritual and patrician figure and ranked higher than the &quot;flamines&quot; (priestly order), while later on in history only a shadow of the primordial condition was left with the sacrificial &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; linked closely to the plebeian orders.

King Numitor corresponds to the regal-sacred principle in early Roman history. Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome, was heroized into Quirinus, the &quot;undefeated god&quot;, with whom the later emperors identified and of whom they considered themselves incarnations.

Varro spoke of the initiatory mystery and power of Roman regality (&quot;adytum et initia regis&quot;), inaccessible to the exoteric communality.

In Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Phyrro&quot;, 19.5, the Greek ambassador declared amid the Roman Senate he felt instead like being in the midst of &quot;a whole assembly of Kings&quot;.

As the Roman Empire developed, the Imperial cult gradually developed more formally and constituted the worship of the Roman Emperor as a god. This practice began at the start of the Empire under Augustus, and became a prominent element of Roman religion.

The cult spread over the whole Empire within a few decades, more strongly in the east than in the west. Emperor Diocletian further reinforced it when he demanded the &quot;proskynesis&quot; and adopted the adjective &quot;sacrum&quot; for all things pertaining to the imperial person.

The deification of emperors was gradually abandoned after the Emperor Constantine I started supporting Christianity. However, the concept of the imperial person as &quot;sacred&quot; carried over, in a Christianized form, into the Byzantine Empire.

===Ancient and Imperial Japan===
In ancient Japan, it was customary for every clan to claim descendance from gods (&quot;ujigami&quot;) and the Imperial Family tended to define their ancestor as the dominant or most important &quot;kami&quot; of the time. Later in history, this was considered common practice by noble families, and the head members of the family, including that of the Imperial Family, were not seen to be divine. Rather than establish sovereignty by the manner of claimed godhood over the nation however, the Emperor and the Imperial Family stood as the bond between the heavens and the Earth by claims of descending from the Goddess Amaterasu, instead dealing in affairs related with the gods than any major secular political event, with few cases scattered about history. It was not until the Meiji period and the establishment of the Empire, that the Emperor began to be venerated along with a growing sense of nationalism.
* Arahitogami – the concept of &quot;a god who is a human being&quot; applied to the Emperor Shōwa (Emperor Hirohito as he was known in the Western World), until the end of World War II.
* Ningen-sengen – the declaration with which the Emperor Shōwa, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1946, (formally) declined claims of divinity, keeping with traditional family values as expressed in the Shinto religion.
In the 16th, 19th, and 20th centuries, Japanese nationalist philosophers paid special attention to the emperor and believed devotion to him and other political causes that furthered the Japanese state was &quot;the greatest virtue&quot;. However, in the 14th century, most religious figures and philosophers in Japan thought that excessive veneration of the state and the emperor would consign one to hell.

===Ancient Southeast Asia===
Devaraja is the Hindu-Buddhist cult of deified royalty in Southeast Asia. It is simply described as Southeast Asian concept of divine king. The concept viewed the monarch (king) as the living god, the incarnation of the supreme god, often attributed to Shiva or Vishnu, on Earth. The concept is closely related to Indian concept of Chakravartin (wheel turning monarch). In politics, it is viewed as the divine justification of a king&#x27;s rule. The concept gained its elaborate manifestations in ancient Java and Cambodia, where monuments such as Prambanan and Angkor Wat were erected to celebrate the king&#x27;s divine rule on earth.

In the Mataram kingdom, it was customary to erect a &quot;candi&quot; (temple) to honor the soul of a deceased king. The image inside the &quot;garbhagriha&quot; (innermost sanctum) of the temple often portrayed the king as a god, since the soul was thought to be united with the god referred to, in &quot;svargaloka&quot; (heaven). It is suggested that the cult was the fusion of Hinduism with native Austronesian ancestor worship. In Java, the tradition of the divine king extended to the Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit kingdoms in the 15th century. The tradition of public reverence to the King of Cambodia and King of Thailand is the continuation of this ancient devaraja cult.

==Examples of divine kings in history==
Some examples of historic leaders considered to have been divine kings are:
* Africa
** Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.
** The Shilluk Kingdom was ruled by a divine monarchy.
** Ghanas (&quot;Kings&quot;) of the Empire of Ghana.
* Asia
** God Worshipping Society leader Hong Xiuquan, leader of the Taiping Rebellion, claimed to be the younger brother of Jesus and attempted to establish rule as a divine king.
** Korean Buddhist monk Gung-ye, King of Taebong.
** The Japanese emperors up to the end of World War II.
** Javanese kings during the Hindu-Buddhist era (4th–15th centuries AD), such as the Sailendra dynasty, Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit.
** Kings of the Khmer Empire in Cambodia.
** Srivijaya kings.
* Americas
** Kings of the Maya city-states of the Classical period.
** Sapa Incas in pre-Hispanic South America; considered descendants of the sun god Inti.
* Oceania
** Kings or Akua Alii of the Hawaiian Islands before 1839.
* Europe
** Many Roman emperors were declared gods by the Roman Senate (generally after their death; see Roman imperial cult).

==Fictional examples==
*In Warhammer 40,000, the Emperor of Mankind, immortal and perpetual ruler of the Imperium of Man, is worshiped as the deity of the state religion, although he waged a fierce campaign of strict state atheism until the Horus Heresy when the Emperor successfully defeated his fallen son, Horus Lupercal, but was mortally wounded and forced to be interned within the Golden Throne in order to survive.

<doc id="188282" wikidata="Q213180" url="?curid=188282" title="Maidstone">
<text>Maidstone is the largest town in Kent, England, of which it is the county town. Maidstone is historically important and lies east-south-east of London. The River Medway runs through the centre of the town, linking it with Rochester and the Thames Estuary. Historically, the river carried much of the town&#x27;s trade as the centre of the agricultural county of Kent, which is known as the Garden of England. There is evidence of settlement in the area dating back before the Stone Age. The town, part of the borough of Maidstone, had an approximate population of 100,000 in 2019. Since World War II, the town&#x27;s economy has shifted from heavy industry towards light industry and services.

==Toponymy==
Saxon charters dating back to show the first recorded instances of the town&#x27;s name, &quot;de maeides stana&quot; and &quot;maegdan stane&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;stone of the maidens&quot; or &quot;stone of the people&quot;. The latter meaning may refer to the nearby megalith around which gatherings took place. The name evolved through &quot;medestan/meddestane&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, with possible variation &quot;Mayndenstan&quot; in 1396. The modern name appeared by 1610. It has been suggested that the name derives from stones set into the river to allow clothes to be rinsed in the cleaner water away from the banks.

==History==
Neolithic finds have revealed the earliest occupation of the area, and the Romans have left their mark in the road through the town and evidence of villas. The Normans set up a shire moot, and religious organisations established an abbey at Boxley, hospitals and a college for priests. Today&#x27;s suburb of Penenden Heath was a place of execution in medieval times. 

Maidstone played a key role during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. The rebel priest, John Ball, had been imprisoned there and was freed by Kentish rebels under the command of Wat Tyler, who is reputed to have been a resident of the town.

Maidstone&#x27;s charter as a town was granted in 1549; although briefly revoked, a new charter in 1551 created the town as a borough. The charter was ratified in 1619 under James I, and the coat of arms was designed, bearing a golden lion and a representation of the river (in heraldic terms: &quot;Or, a fess wavy Azure between three roundels Gules, on a chief Gules a leopard passant gardant Or&quot;). The arms also include the head of a white horse (representing Invicta, the motto of the county of Kent), a golden lion and an iguanodon. The iguanodon relates to the discovery in the 19th century of the fossilised remains of that dinosaur, now in the Natural History Museum in London. Maidstone has had the right to a town gaol since 1604.

During the English Civil War, the Battle of Maidstone took place in 1648, resulting in a victory for the Parliamentarians. Andrew Broughton, who was Mayor of Maidstone in 1649 (and also Clerk to the High Court of Justice) was responsible for declaring the death sentence on Charles I, and today a plaque in Maidstone Town Centre memorialises Broughton as &#x27;Mayor and Regicide&#x27;.

Paper mills, stone quarrying, brewing and the cloth industry have all flourished here. The paper maker James Whatman and his son invented wove paper (Whatman paper) at Turkey Mill from 1740, an important development in the history of printing.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of cavalry barracks in 1798. Invicta Park Barracks is now home to the 36 Engineer Regiment.

Maidstone Prison is north of the town centre and was completed in 1819.

In 1897–1898 the Maidstone typhoid epidemic killed at least 132 people, and was the largest typhoid epidemic at the time. Hundreds of nurses from around the country volunteered to care for the patients, and several nurses were sent by Eva Luckes, matron of The London Hospital, including Edith Cavell.

===Modern history===
Modern Maidstone incorporates a number of outlying villages and settlements (see Geography below).

The county council offices to the north of the town centre were built of Portland stone between 1910 and 1913. On 29 September 1975 a local pub serving Invicta Park Barracks, &quot;The Hare and Hounds&quot;, was damaged by a bomb during an IRA campaign in England.

Maidstone General Hospital opened on the outskirts of the town in 1983, replacing West Kent General Hospital, which opened 150 years earlier in Marsham Street. It is just to the north of Oakwood Hospital (originally the Kent County Asylum), which closed in the mid-1990s.

Residents are employed in the retail, administrative or service sectors; there are industrial estates around the town providing employment. Some of the workforce commute to other towns, including to London.

==Governance==
===Members of Parliament===
The town was divided between the constituencies of Maidstone and Malling, (Maidstone and The Weald until 2024), and Faversham and Mid Kent. Before 1997 Maidstone was in the county constituency of Maidstone. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone and Malling is Conservative Helen Grant. Previous MPs include Ann Widdecombe, Sir John Wells, Sir Alfred Bossom and Benjamin Disraeli. Since 2015 the MP for Faversham and Mid Kent has been Conservative Helen Whately. Prior to the 2015 election, the MP was Conservative Sir Hugh Robertson and, before him, another Conservative, Andrew Rowe.

===Local government===
Kent County Council is responsible for social services, education, maintenance of and new road infrastructure, fire services and minerals. It is elected every four years: Maidstone elects nine representatives, and villages are in the four rural wards.

The town is the main town of Maidstone borough, which includes the surrounding rural areas except to the north-west. The town is divided into the 12 local government wards of Allington, Bridge, Downswood and Otham, East, Fant, Heath, High Street, Park Wood, Shepway North, Shepway South, South, and North. These wards have 30 of the 55 seats on Borough Council.

Maidstone Borough Council is responsible for services such as recreation, refuse collection, most planning decisions and social housing.

==Geography==
The town is six miles downstream from where the River Medway, having flowed in a generally west–east direction, is joined by the Rivers Teise and Beult at Yalding and changes its course to a northerly one. It cuts through the ridge formed by the greensand, so that the town occupies a site on two opposite hills, the easterly one containing the town centre. Beyond that, and higher, is Penenden Heath.

The River Len joins the Medway at Maidstone. Though a short river, it provided the water to drive numerous watermills. The Loose Stream, which rises at Langley and joins at Tovil, once powered over 30 mills. Mill ponds on these rivers are a prominent feature of the landscape.

Maidstone has continued to grow. In doing so it has incorporated hitherto separate settlements, villages and hamlets within its boundaries. These include Allington, Barming, Bearsted, Penenden Heath, Sandling, Tovil and Weavering Street. Housing estates include Grove Green, Harbourland, Ringlestone, Roseacre, Shepway, Senacre and Vinters Park.

Maidstone was at one time a centre of industry, brewing and paper making being among the most important. Nowadays smaller industrial units encircle the town. The site of Fremlin&#x27;s Brewery, once the largest in Kent, is now Fremlin Walk shopping centre. The pedestrianised areas of the High Street and King Street run up from the river crossing at Lockmeadow; Week Street and Gabriel&#x27;s Hill bisect this route.

===Climate===
Kent experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is at East Malling, about three miles west of Maidstone.

East Malling&#x27;s highest temperature of was recorded in August 2003. The lowest temperature recorded is during January 1947 and 1972. East Malling also holds the record for the mildest January day in South East England, , also set in 2003. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was on 20 December 2010. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate).

==Demography==

In the 2001 UK census, Maidstone town wards had a population of 75,070, a density of 28 residents per hectare. The town had 31,142 households, of which 38% were married couples, 29% were individuals, 10% were cohabiting couples, and 9% were single-parent families. 14% of households had someone living alone of pensionable age.

==Economy==

===Industry===
Until 1998, the Sharps toffee factory (later part of Cadbury Trebor Basset), was in central Maidstone and provided a significant source of employment.

Loudspeaker manufacturer KEF was founded in 1961 on the premises of the metal-working operation Kent Engineering &amp; Foundry (hence KEF). KEF still occupies the same river-bank site. In the late 1990s KEF manufactured a loudspeaker called &quot;the Maidstone&quot;.

The town centre has the largest office centre in the county and the area is a base for the paper and packaging industry. Many high-technology firms have set up in surrounding business parks.

Southern Water and Mid Kent Water operate the Maidstone water system.

&quot;Maidstone Borough Corporation&quot; began construction of Maidstone power station at Fairmeadow in 1900 and supplied electricity from 1901, firstly for street lighting then other uses. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership of the station passed to the British Electricity Authority and then to the Central Electricity Generating Board. In 1966 the power station had a generating capacity of 13.125 MW and delivered 6,921 MWh of electricity. The CEGB later closed the station and it was demolished in 1973.

===Shopping===
The town is ranked in the top five shopping centres in the south-east of England for shopping yields and, with more than one million square feet of retail floor space, in the top 50 in the UK. Much of this space is located in the two main shopping centres in the town, the The Mall Maidstone (previously known as The Chequers Centre) and the Fremlin Walk which opened in 2005.

Other recent developments include the riverside Lockmeadow Centre, with a multiplex cinema, restaurants, nightclubs (now a trampoline park), and the town&#x27;s market square. The leisure industry is a key contributor with the night-time economy worth £75m per annum.

<text>The year 681 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 73 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;. The denomination 681 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events and trends ==

=== By place ===
==== Middle East ====
* King Sennacherib of Assyria is assassinated by one or two of his sons in the temple of the god Ninurta at Kalhu (Northern Mesopotamia) after a 24-year reign in which he defeated the Babylonians, made Nineveh (modern Iraq) a showplace, and diverted the waters of the Tigris River into a huge aqueduct to supply the city with irrigation.
* Sennacherib&#x27;s second wife, Naqi&#x27;a (Zakitu), uses her wiles and influences to have the imperial council appoint her son Esarhaddon as her husband&#x27;s successor in preference to the young man&#x27;s two older brothers, who flee to Urartu (Armenia). Esarhaddon, unlike his father, is friendly toward Babylon and orders her reconstruction.

==== Asia ====
* Xi of Zhou becomes king of the Zhou Dynasty (China).

<doc id="188288" wikidata="Q184559" url="?curid=188288" title="Arteriosclerosis">
<text>Arteriosclerosis, literally meaning &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot;, is an umbrella term for a vascular disorder characterized by abnormal thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity of the walls of arteries; this process gradually restricts the blood flow to one&#x27;s organs and tissues and can lead to severe health risks brought on by atherosclerosis, which is a specific form of arteriosclerosis caused by the buildup of fatty plaques, cholesterol, and some other substances in and on the artery walls (it can be brought on by smoking, a bad diet, or many genetic factors).

Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Genetic-epidemiologic studies have identified a long list of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for CAD. However, such studies indicate that family history is the most significant independent risk factor.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of arteriosclerosis depend on the vessel affected by the disease. If affecting cerebral or ophthalmic vessels, as in cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks, signs and symptoms may include sudden weakness, facial or lower limb numbness, confusion, difficulty understanding speech, and problems seeing. If affecting coronary vessels, as in coronary artery disease (including acute myocardial ischemia or a &quot;heart attack&quot;), signs and symptoms may include chest pain.

== Pathophysiology ==

The lesions of arteriosclerosis begin as the intima (innermost layer of blood vessel wall) of an artery start to fill up with the deposition of cellular wastes. As these start to mature, they can take different forms of arteriosclerosis. All are linked through common features such as the stiffening of arterial vessels, thickening of arterial walls and the degenerative nature of the disease.
* Arteriolosclerosis, unlike atherosclerosis, is a sclerosis that only affects small arteries and arterioles, which carry nutrients and blood to the cells.
* Atherosclerosis is the narrowing of arteries from a buildup of plaque, usually made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium, and fibrin, inside the arteries. This affects large and medium-sized arteries; however, its positioning varies person to person.
* Monckeberg&#x27;s arteriosclerosis or medial calcific sclerosis is seen mostly in the elderly, commonly in arteries of the extremities.
* Hyperplastic: Hyperplastic arteriosclerosis refers to the type of arteriosclerosis that affects large and medium-sized arteries.
* Hyaline type: Hyaline arteriosclerosis, also referred to as arterial hyalinosis and arteriolar hyalinosis, refers to lesions that are caused by the deposition of homogenous hyaline in the small arteries and arterioles.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of an individual suspected of having arteriosclerosis can be based on a physical exam, blood test, EKG and the results of these tests (among other exams).

== Treatment ==

Treatment is often in the form of preventive measures of prophylaxis. Medical therapy is often prescribed to help prevent arteriosclerosis for underlying conditions, such as medications for the treatment of high cholesterol (e.g., statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors), medications to treat high blood pressure (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and antiplatelet medications. Lifestyle changes are also advised, such as increasing exercise, stopping smoking, and moderating alcohol intake.

There are a variety of types of surgery:
* Angioplasty and stent placement: A catheter is first inserted into the blocked or narrowed part of the artery, followed by a second one with a deflated balloon that is passed through the catheter into the narrowed area. The balloon is then inflated, pushing the deposits back against the arterial walls, and then a mesh tube is usually left behind to prevent the artery from retightening.
* Coronary artery bypass surgery: This surgery creates a new pathway for blood to flow to the heart. The surgeon attaches a healthy piece of vein to the coronary artery, just above and below the blockage to allow bypass.
* Endarterectomy: This is the general procedure for the surgical removal of plaque from the artery that has become narrowed or blocked.
* Thrombolytic therapy: This is a treatment used to break up masses of plaque inside the arteries via intravenous clot-dissolving medicine.

== Epidemiology ==
In 2008, the US had an estimate of 16 million cases of atherosclerotic heart disease and 5.8 million strokes. Cardiovascular diseases that were caused by arteriosclerosis also caused almost 812,000 deaths in 2008, more than any other cause, including cancer. About 1.2 million Americans are predicted to have a heart attack each year.

== History ==
The diagnostics and clinical implications of this disease were not recognized until the 20th century. Many cases have been observed and recorded, and Jean Lobstein coined the term &quot;arteriosclerosis&quot; while he was analyzing the composition of calcified arterial lesions.

The name &quot;arteriosclerosis&quot; is derived the Greek words ἀρτηρία (&quot;artēría&quot;, artery) and σκληρωτικός (&quot;sklērōtikós&quot;, hardened).

<text>Irish whiskey ( or &quot;uisce beatha&quot;) is whiskey made on the island of Ireland. The word &#x27;whiskey&#x27; (or whisky) comes from the Irish , meaning &quot;water of life&quot;. Irish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century onwards greatly damaged the industry, so much so that although Ireland boasted at least 28 distilleries in the 1890s, by 1966 this number had fallen to just two, and by 1972 the remaining distilleries, Bushmills Distillery and Old Midleton Distillery (replaced by New Midleton Distillery), were owned by just one company, Irish Distillers.

The monopoly situation was ended by an academically conceived launch of the first new distillery in decades, Cooley Distillery, in 1987. Since 1990, Irish whiskey has seen a resurgence in popularity and has been the fastest-growing spirit in the world every year since. With exports growing by over 15% per annum, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. Ireland has 32 distilleries in operation, with more either planned or under development.

== History ==

Irish whiskey was one of the earliest distilled drinks in Europe, arising around the 12th century. It is believed that Irish monks brought the technique of distilling perfumes back to Ireland from their travels to southern Europe around 1,000 AD. The Irish then modified this technique to obtain a drinkable spirit.

Although termed &quot;whiskey&quot;, the spirit produced during this period would have differed from what is currently recognised as whiskey, as it would not have been aged, and was often flavoured with aromatic herbs such as mint, thyme, or anise. Irish Mist, a whiskey liqueur launched in 1963, is purportedly based on such a recipe.

Although known to have occurred for hundreds of years, records of whiskey production in Ireland can be difficult to come by, particularly in the earlier years when production was unregulated. Even in later years, as production was frequently illicit, official records bear little resemblance to reality. In addition, as many Irish records were traditionally oral rather than written, details on early production are likely lost.

The oldest known documented record of whiskey in Ireland was in 1405; in the Annals of Clonmacnoise it was written that the head of a clan died after &quot;taking a surfeit of aqua vitae&quot; at Christmas. Its first known mention in Scotland dates from 1494. However, it is known that by 1556 whiskey was widespread, as an act passed by the Parliament of Ireland (3 &amp; 4 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 7 (I)) declared whiskey to be &quot;a drink nothing profitable to be drunken daily and used, is now &quot;universally&quot; throughout this realm made&quot;. This act also made it technically illegal for anyone other than &quot;the peers, gentlemen and freemen of larger towns&quot; to distil spirits without a licence from the Lord Deputy. However, as Crown control did not extend far beyond the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin, this had little effect. Irish whiskey is also described in &quot;Aqua Vitæ: its commodities describ&#x27;d&quot; by Richard Stanyhurst.

===Start of licensed distillation===
In 1608, King James I granted a licence to Sir Thomas Phillips, a landowner in County Antrim. Today Kilbeggan Distillery in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, lays claim to the title of oldest distillery in Ireland, as the first distillery in Kilbeggan was established in 1757 (although not continuously operating since e.g., the Kilbeggan Distillery was entirely shut down around 1917 and again between 1954 and 2007 and was &quot;in rubble&quot; and &quot;totally derelict&quot; by 1983). Despite this the licence was continuously paid and whiskey is currently distilled in Kilbeggan using the original 1757 licence. Kilbeggan also has what is believed to be the oldest operational copper pot still in the world, first used in 2007 after being &quot;last used in the 19th century&quot;. However it is through the earlier 1608 licence that the Old Bushmills Distillery lays claim to being the oldest surviving grant of licence to distil in the world. However, the current Bushmills distillery and company was not registered to trade until 1784 and despite the promotion of the Phillips licence as its claimed founding date, the Bushmills distillery does not clearly descend from any distillery operated by Phillips through ownership or location.

In 1661, the Crown introduced a tax on whiskey production in Britain and Ireland. Therefore, in theory, all whiskey distillers in Ireland were to register and pay taxes. Although Crown control now extended far beyond the Pale, there is limited official record of whiskey distillation during this period. One reason for this is that, until 1761, registration was done on a voluntary basis. Therefore, as registration entailed paying a tax, it was much avoided for obvious reasons. Another reason is that those tasked with enforcing the law were frequently local landlords, and, if their tenants were the illicit distillers, it was not in their best interests to enforce the law. It is known, however, that more distillation occurred than is officially recorded, as when registration later became compulsory, several registrations detail the use of existing facilities.

From a regulatory perspective, the introduction of the act is a historical milestone as it provides a clear distinction between licit and illicit whiskey distillation in Ireland. For many years following its introduction, whiskey produced by registered distillers was known as &quot;parliament whiskey&quot;, while that produced by illicit producers was, and still is referred to as &quot;Poitín&quot;, a Gaelic term meaning &quot;small pot&quot; (often anglicised as poteen) in reference to the small pot stills used by the illicit distillers. However, although traditionally the product of illicit production, many legal varieties of &quot;Poitín&quot; have come to market in recent years.

In the 18th century, demand for whiskey in Ireland grew significantly, driven both by strong population growth, and by displacing the demand for imported spirits. Growth in the latter is very much visible in the share of Irish duties paid on legal spirits in the late 1700s. In 1770, whiskey only accounted for 25% of the total duty on spirits received by the exchequer, while duty on imported rum accounted for 51%, with the remainder divided equally between brandy and gin. By 1790, however, whiskey&#x27;s share accounted for 66%.

As a consequence of this increased demand, some distillers prioritized quantity over quality, to the detriment of their product. This prompted Parliament to pass the Distillation Act 1759 (33 Geo. 3. c. 9) prohibiting distillers from using any ingredient other than malt, grain, potatoes or sugar in the production of whiskey, and specifically prohibiting several unsavoury ingredients. Another consequence was that the potential revenue lost to the exchequer through the under-reporting of output at legal distilleries and the tax avoidance of illicit producers became more significant, prompting Parliament to introduce the Distillers Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3. c. 50). This significantly reformed how the taxes payable on whiskey production were calculated. Previously, taxes were payable on production volumes, which were subject to manipulation. However, this act removed the potential for under-reporting by making taxes payable on a distillery&#x27;s potential output (based on the capacity of its pot stills), rather than its actual, or reported, output. In addition, the act penalised smaller distillers in an attempt to reduce reporting fraud.

Due to the stringency of this act, which made assumptions about output (for instance, a 500-gallon pot still was assumed to produce 33,075 gallons a month) and the minimum numbers of days which a still was in operation per annum (112), many of the smaller or less efficient registered distilleries were forced underground. In 1779, when the act was introduced, there were 1,228 registered distilleries in Ireland; however, by 1790, this number had fallen to 246, and by 1821, there were just 32 licensed distilleries in operation. This had the effect of concentrating licit distillation in a smaller number of distilleries based mainly in the larger urban centres, such as Cork and Dublin, which offered better markets for legal producers. In the rural areas distillation became a more illicit activity, in particular in the northwest of Ireland where agricultural lands were poorer and poitín provided a supplemental source of income to the tenant farmers, an income which landlords were again slow to curtail as it would have weakened their abilities to pay rent. The scale of this illicit activity was such that one surveyor estimated that duty was paid on only 2% of the spirit consumed in the northwestern provinces of Ulster and Connaught, while Aeneas Coffey (an excise officer at the time, and later inventor of the Coffey still) estimated that there were over 800 illicit stills in operation in Inishowen, County Donegal alone. By contrast, illicit distillation in Munster and Leinster was less extensive.

By some measures the act was successful, as the volume of whiskey on which excise was paid increased from 1.2 million to 2.9 million gallons. In addition, it prompted capital investments in establishing larger distilleries (which were more easily regulated), due to the need for economies of scale to profit from legal distillation. However, when demand for whiskey increased in the early 1800s, due to population growth, and changing consumption patterns (which saw it becoming more ingrained in Irish cultural activities), much of the demand was initially met by small-scale illicit distillers who did not need to pay tax or comply with the restrictions of the 1779 act. In fact, so much illicit spirit was available during this period that the licensed distillers in Dublin complained that it could be obtained &quot;as openly in the streets as they sell a loaf of bread&quot;.

===Reform and expansion===
In 1823, the authorities, acknowledging the problems with the licensing system, cut the duties by half, and introduced the Excise Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 94) which significantly reformed the existing legislation, making legal distillation much more attractive. In particular, the reforms removed the need for distillers to rush production in order to produce as much (or more) whiskey than duties would be paid on, leading to improvements in fuel efficiency and product quality, as distillers could operate the stills at a more appropriate pace. In addition, restrictions on the type and capacity of stills used were removed, granting distillers more freedom to tailor their equipment. Another significant reform was a change to how duty was paid. Previously, duty was charged monthly, based on still output, meaning that distilleries paid tax on whiskey before it was sold. However, under the reforms, duty was to be paid only when the whiskey was actually sold, making its storage in bond more attractive, as less of the distillery&#x27;s working capital would be tied up in already-taxed stock.

Together, these reforms greatly improved the distilling landscape, leading to a drop in illicit whiskey production and a boom in investment in legal distilleries. In 1821, two years before the reforms, there were 32 licensed distilleries in Ireland. Just four years later (in 1827), this number had risen to 82, and reached 93 by 1835, a 19th-century peak. The increased attractiveness of legal distillation is evident in the scale of the equipment used. Prior to the Excise Act 1823, the largest pot still in Ireland had a capacity of just 750 gallons. By 1825, however, the Old Midleton Distillery operated a 31,618-gallon pot still, which remains the largest ever built; Note: the largest pot still in operation in the world (as of 2014), located next door in the New Midleton Distillery, are roughly half this size, at 16,498 gallons (75,000 litres).

Domestic demand was reduced somewhat in the mid-1800s, due to the Temperance movement of the 1830s, and the Great Famine of the 1840s (during which a million Irish died and a million Irish emigrated). Between 1823 and 1900, however, whiskey output in Ireland still increased fourfold, and with access to the overseas markets provided by the British Empire, Irish whiskey became the most popular spirit in the world. &quot;Dublin whiskey&quot; was particularly well regarded.

===Dublin whiskey peak===
In the early 1800s, Ireland was the largest spirit market in the United Kingdom, with demand for spirit exceeding that of more populous England. Therefore, as capacities expanded, Ireland became the largest producer of spirits in the United Kingdom; and Dublin, then the largest market for spirits in Ireland, emerged as a major distilling centre. By 1823, Dublin boasted the five largest licensed distilleries in the country. At their peak, the distilleries in Dublin would grow to become the largest in the world, with a combined output of almost 10 million gallons per annum, the largest of which, Roe&#x27;s Thomas Street Distillery, had an output exceeding 2 million gallons per annum. By 1878, the reputation of Dublin whiskey was such that Distillers Company Ltd., a Scottish distilling firm, having built a distillery in Dublin, claimed that Dublin whiskey could sell for a 25% premium over other Irish whiskeys, and that it had a demand five times that of Scotch at the time. Although these figures are likely inflated, they give an indication of the esteem in which Dublin whiskey was held, even by Scottish distillers.
During this period, the four largest Dublin distilling firms, of John Jameson, William Jameson, John Powers and George Roe (all family-run, and collectively known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;) came to dominate the Irish distilling landscape. The chief output of these distilleries, known as single or &quot;pure pot still&quot; whiskey, was made from a mix of malted and unmalted barley, and solely distilled in pot stills. The style, having initially emerged as a means of avoiding a 1785 tax on malt, endured although the tax had been later repealed. In fact, even by the late 1880s, only two of Ireland&#x27;s then 28 existing distilleries were producing single malt whiskey, the rest steadfast in their devotion to &quot;pure pot still&quot;.

In this period, when Irish whiskey was at its zenith, it would have been difficult to imagine that Scotch, then produced by small-scale producers and almost unheard of outside of Scotland, would soon become the world&#x27;s preeminent drink, while Irish whiskey, then the world&#x27;s most popular whiskey, would enter a century of decline, culminating with all of Dublin&#x27;s great distilleries shutting their doors. By the late 20th century, the once-popular pure pot still whiskey had almost disappeared entirely, with only two specialist bottlings, Green Spot and Redbreast remaining in existence. However, since 2010, several new single pot whiskeys have been launched.

=== Coffey still ===
There were a number of factors, both internal and external, which led to this decline. However, one of the main turning points was the patenting in 1832 of the Coffey still by Aeneas Coffey. Ironically, Coffey was both the former Inspector General of Excise in Ireland, and subsequently, after leaving the excise service, an Irish distiller himself. His patent, the Coffey still, was a continuous distillation apparatus which offered an improvement on the traditional pot still. Although similar continuous stills had been proposed in the past, including by other Irish distillers themselves, the Coffey still was the most effective, and soon entered widespread use.

Unlike traditional pot stills, which were operated in a batch manner, Coffey stills could be operated continuously. This made them cheaper to operate, as they required less fuel, and more efficient to run, producing a continuous, rapid output of spirit. In addition, because technically, continuous distillation entails the conduct of a series of distillation runs in sequence internally within a self-contained unit rather than the conduct of a single distillation within a pot still, Coffey stills were capable of producing a far higher strength output than pot stills. However, this advantage also came with a downside. As a consequence of increasing the alcohol concentration in the product, Coffey stills removed some of the other volatile components responsible for flavour. As a result, their use proved extremely controversial when first introduced.

Ireland was the initial testing ground for the Coffey still, with Coffey showcasing them in his own distillery and offering them to other Irish distillers. Although there were seven in operation in Ireland by 1833, their use did not become widespread amongst the larger distilleries. In particular, the big four Dublin distillers, proud of their existing produce, scoffed at its use, questioning if its product, grain whiskey, which they termed &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;silent&quot; (i.e. tasteless) &quot;spirit&quot;, could even be termed whiskey. It wasn&#x27;t that the distillers were Luddites, afraid of change; their distilleries were among the most advanced in the world. The distillers were simply steadfast in the belief that their existing methods yielded a superior whiskey. For instance, John Jameson trialled a Coffey still at his distillery, but chose to not adopt the technology because he was not satisfied with the quality of product it produced. Therefore, in the face of opposition in Ireland, Coffey offered his still to the English gin and Scottish whisky distillers, who proved more receptive, and where the technology gained widespread use.

The adoption of the Coffey still in Scotland was indirectly assisted by Ireland&#x27;s Great Famine of the 1840s, which led to the repealing of the Corn Laws, which between 1815 and 1846 had restricted the import of cheaper foreign grain into Britain and Ireland. After the laws were repealed in 1846, cheap American corn could be imported and used to produce neutral spirit in Coffey stills. This spirit, though lacking in taste, could then be blended with traditional pot still derived spirit to produce a cheaper &quot;blended whiskey&quot;. This blended whiskey, which was less intense in taste than pure pot still, was to prove popular in Britain, capturing much market share from Irish pure pot still whiskey.

Despite changing tastes and falling market share, the adoption of Coffey stills was stubbornly resisted by Irish distillers for many years, with some arguing for restrictions on their use. For instance, in 1878, the big Dublin distillers jointly published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Truths about Whisky&quot;, in which they referred to the output of Coffey stills as &quot;Good, bad or indifferent; but it cannot be whiskey, and it ought not to be sold under that name&quot;. In 1904, almost seventy years after the Coffey still had been patented, the Senior Manager of Ireland&#x27;s largest rural distillery, Allman&#x27;s of Bandon, placed an outright ban on the introduction of Coffey stills at his distillery, in the face of opposition from a director.

The issue came to a head in 1908, when a royal commission was appointed to investigate the issue. By this point, 60% of all whiskey produced in Britain and Ireland was made in Coffey stills. In 1909, the royal commission settled the argument, declaring that whiskey could refer to the output of either Coffey or pot stills. By comparison, a similar debate occurred in France, such that under French law, Cognac must be double-distilled in pot stills, whereas Coffey stills are permissible in the production of armagnac.

===An industry in decline===
In addition to the introduction of blended whiskeys and the Irish distillers&#x27; failure to account for its appeal to changing tastes, there were a number of additional issues which placed further pressure on the Irish distillers: the Irish War of Independence, the subsequent civil war, and trade war with Britain (which cut off whiskey exports to Britain and all Commonwealth countries, then Irish whiskey&#x27;s biggest market); prohibition in the United States (1920–1933), which severely curtailed exports to Irish whiskey&#x27;s second-biggest market (Irish whiskey had accounted for more than 60% of whiskey sales in the US in the 1800s); widespread counterfeiting of Irish whiskeys in America and Britain; protectionist policies introduced by the Irish Free State government, which significantly capped whiskey exports in the hope of taxing domestic consumption; and finally, over-expansion and mismanagement at several Irish distilleries. Together, these factors greatly hampered exports and forced many distilleries into economic difficulties and out of business, and by the early 20th century Scotland had surpassed Ireland to become the world&#x27;s largest whiskey producer.

When British historian Alfred Barnard published his account of the distilleries of Britain and Ireland in 1887, there were 28 distilleries in operation in Ireland. By the 1960s, there were only a handful of these remaining in operation, and in 1966 three of these (John Jameson, Powers, and Cork Distilleries Company) chose to amalgamate their operations under the name of Irish Distillers and to close their existing facilities and concentrate their operations in a new purpose-built facility to be constructed beside the Old Midleton Distillery in County Cork. In 1972, these were joined by the only other remaining Irish operation, Bushmills, so that by the mid-1970s there were only two whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland, the New Midleton Distillery and the Old Bushmills Distillery, both owned by Irish Distillers, and with only one of these having operated during Irish whiskey&#x27;s golden years.

Production reached a nadir at about 400,000–500,000 cases per annum during the consolidation period, down from a peak of 12 million cases around 1900.

=== Resurgence ===
The late 1980s saw the beginnings of a long and slow resurgence in the Irish whiskey industry, with the establishment of the Cooley Distillery in 1987 by John Teeling, and then Pernod Ricard&#x27;s takeover of Irish Distillers in 1988, which led to increased marketing of Irish whiskeys, in particular Jameson, overseas.

Since the 1990s, Irish whiskey has undergone a major resurgence, and for the next twenty years it was the fastest growing spirit in the world, with annual growth of approximately 15–20% per annum. In 2010, the Kilbeggan Distillery, which had closed in 1954, was reopened fully by Teeling. Irish distillers, who operated under rules less strict than those applying to Scottish producers, experimented with new flavours, methods and cocktails.

By June 2019, the number of operating distilleries had grown to 25, and several more were in the planning stages. As of 2017, roughly 750 people were employed on a full-time basis in the whiskey industry in Ireland. In addition, it is estimated that the industry provides support to a further 4,200 jobs across agriculture and other sectors of the economy. As of 2018, sales of Irish whiskey stood at 10.7 million 9-litres cases, up from 4.4 million cases in 2008, with sales projected to exceed 12 million cases (its historical peak) by 2020, and 24 million by 2030. In 2021, annual sales were 14 million cases (168&amp;million bottles), and in 2022, there were 42 distilleries on the island.

==Process==
Irish whiskey has a smoother finish as opposed to the smoky, earthy overtones common to Scotch whisky, which come largely from drying the malted barley using peat smoke. Peat is rarely used in the malting process outside of Scotland. There are notable exceptions to these rules in both countries. Examples include Connemara peated Irish malt whiskey from the Cooley Distillery in Cooley, County Louth; Pearse Whiskey from Pearse Lyons Distillery in Dublin; and Dunville&#x27;s peated from Echlinville Distillery.

==Regulations and labelling==
===Legal definition===
Irish whiskey is a protected European Geographical Indication (GI) under Regulation (EC) No 110/2008. As of 29 January 2016, production, labelling and marketing of Irish whiskey must be verified by the Irish revenue authorities as conforming with the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s 2014 technical file for Irish whiskey.

Key requirements include specifications that Irish whiskey must:
* Be distilled and matured on the island of Ireland (comprising the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) from a mash of malted cereals with or without whole grains of other cereals and which has been:
** saccharified by the diastase of malt contained therein, with or without other natural enzymes;
** fermented by the action of yeast;
** distilled at an alcoholic strength of less than 94.8% alcohol by volume in such a way that the distillate has an aroma and taste derived from the materials used and only plain water and caramel colour is added to it;
** subject to the maturation of the final distillate for at least three years in wooden casks, such as oak, not exceeding capacity
* Retain the colour, aroma and taste derived from the production process referred to above
* Have a minimum alcoholic by volume content of 40%

Individual technical specifications for the three varieties of Irish whiskey, &quot;single pot still&quot;, &quot;single malt&quot;, &quot;single grain&quot;, plus &quot;blended&quot; whiskey (a mix of two or more of these varieties) are also outlined in the technical file. The use of the term &quot;single&quot; in the aforementioned varieties being permissible only if the whiskey is totally distilled on the site of a single distillery.

===Labelling===
There are several regulations governing the labelling of Irish whiskeys, in particular:
* Spirit drinks must not be labelled, packaged, sold, advertised or promoted in such a way to suggest they are Irish whiskey or any of the sub-varieties unless they meet the relevant requirements;
* Any age statement must refer to the age of the youngest whiskey used;
* Although traditionally spelled with an &#x27;e&#x27;, Irish whiskey may also be marketed as &quot;Irish whisky&quot;.

==Distilleries in Ireland==
===Current distilleries===
According to the Irish Whiskey Association, as of December 2019, there were 32 whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland. However, many of these were recently established and had not yet aged their own spirits for sale as whiskey:
* &quot;Achill Island Distillery&quot;, County Mayo (est. 2015) – produces the Irish American brand whiskey.
* &quot;Ballykeefe Distillery&quot;, County Kilkenny (est. 2017) – released its own whiskey in March 2021. Also produces vodka, gin and poitín.
* &quot;Baoilleach Distillery&quot;, County Donegal (est. 2019) – produces gin and poitín, will start production of whiskey in early 2022.
* &quot;Blacks of Kinsale&quot;, County Cork (est. 2015) – produces whiskey, gin and rum.
* &quot;Blackwater Distillery&quot;, County Waterford (est. 2014) – currently produces a range of gins. Due to release its own whiskey in 2022.
* &quot;Boann Distillery&quot;, County Meath (est. 2019)
* &quot;Boatyard Distillery&quot;, County Fermanagh (est. 2016) – currently produces gin and vodka, whiskey is maturing.
* &quot;Burren Whiskey Distillery&quot;, County Clare (est. 2019)
* &quot;Clonakilty Distillery&quot;, County Cork (est. 2016) – opened to the public in March 2019.
* &quot;Connacht Whiskey Company&quot;, County Mayo (est. 2014) – released its first whiskey in June 2021. Also produces gin, vodka and poitín; and markets a single malt sourced from other distilleries.
* &quot;Cooley Distillery&quot;, County Louth (est. 1987) – when opened it was the only independent distillery in Ireland. Along with its sister distillery in Kilbeggan, it produces the Connemara, Tyrconnell, Kilbeggan and 2Gingers whiskeys. It has been owned by Suntory Global Spirits since 2011.
* &quot;Copeland Distillery&quot;, County Down (est. 2019) – currently produces gin, rum and whiskey.
* &quot;Crolly Distillery&quot;, County Donegal (est. 2020) – will produce single malt whiskey, production began in November 2020.
* &quot;Dingle Distillery&quot;, County Kerry (est. 2012) – distills gin, vodka and whiskey. The first batches of whiskey were released in late 2016. A single pot still whiskey was released in 2017.
* &quot;Dublin Liberties Distillery&quot;, Dublin (est. 2018) – opened to the public in February 2019.

===Historical distilleries===

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, around 1,000 registered distilleries opened and closed across Ireland with multiples of this number operating illegally. Most of these have disappeared without a trace, only to be remembered by local street names e.g. Bond Street in Dublin. For instance, the excise return for 1800 lists 40 distilleries operating in Dublin city alone, while Drogheda is estimated to have had 15 distilleries in the 1780s, with as many as ten operating in Cork city in the 19th century. Of these numerous ventures, only one, Bushmills, has remained in continuous operation until the present day. However, the Kilbeggan Distillery (est. 1757) which closed in 1954, reopened in recent years, while a new distillery was constructed in Tullamore to replace an existing distillery which also closed in 1954. Some of the notable distilleries previously in operation across Ireland are listed below.

In the 1970s, production was moved to the New Midleton Distillery, County Cork and the Bow Street Distillery now operates as a visitors&#x27; centre.
* Dodder Bank Distilleries, Dublin
* John&#x27;s Lane Distillery, Dublin (1796–1976) – Run by James Power &amp; Son, John&#x27;s Lane was one of the &quot;big four&quot; Dublin distilleries, and the original home of Power&#x27;s Irish Whiskey. The distillery had an output of 900,000 gallons per annum in the 1880s. Production was moved to Midleton in the 1970s.
* Jones Road Distillery, Dublin (1873 – c. 1945)
* Marrowbone Lane Distillery, Dublin (late 1700s–1920s) – One of the &quot;big four&quot; Dublin distilleries, Marrowbone Lane was run by William Jameson &amp; Co.

It was located opposite Guinness&#x27; St. James&#x27; Gate brewery, which itself was the largest brewery in the world at one point. After the distillery was closed, some of its buildings were purchased and incorporated into the Guinness Brewery. In particular, the landmark St. Patrick&#x27;s Tower, which dates from 1757 and is one of the oldest smock windmills in Europe, is still visible on the site of the Guinness brewery. In 2017, Diageo announced plans to relaunch the Roe &amp; Co whiskey brand, and to establish a new distillery in an old power plant building at the Guinness Brewery, meters from the site of the original Thomas Street Distillery.

==Types==
Irish whiskey comes in several forms, with the name of the style depending on the type of grain used and the distillation process. Traditionally, Irish whiskey was produced in pot stills. Irish whiskeys made in a pot still fall into two categories.

===Single malt Irish whiskey===
Whiskeys made entirely from malted barley distilled in a pot still within a single distillery are referred to as single malt whiskeys, a style also very commonly associated with Scotch whisky. These may be double or triple distilled.

===Single pot still whiskey===
Single pot still whiskey is made from a mixture of malted and unmalted barley completely distilled in a pot still within a single distillery. This differs from single malt whiskey through the inclusion of raw, unmalted grain in the mash. This style has also historically been referred to as &quot;pure pot still&quot; whiskey and &quot;Irish pot still whiskey&quot;, with older bottlings and memorabilia often bearing these names. Single pot whiskeys were the most common style of Irish whiskey until the emergence of blends in the 20th century.

===Grain whiskey===
Whiskey produced from continuous distillation in a column or Coffey still, rather than a pot still, is referred to as grain whiskey. This may be produced from a variety of grains. Lighter and more neutral in taste, this spirit is rarely found on its own, though some examples exist. The vast majority of grain whiskey is used to make blended whiskey, a product made by mixing column still product with richer and more intense pot still product.

===Blended whiskey===
A mixture of the above styles. Regardless of whether the blended whiskey is made from combining grain whiskey with either single malt whiskey or with single pot still whiskey or both, it is labelled with the same terminology. Blended whiskeys are now the most common style of both Irish and Scotch whiskeys.

===Examples===

* Blends: J.J. Corry The Gael Black Bush, Bushmills Original, Clontarf, Inishowen, Jameson, Kilbeggan, Locke&#x27;s Blend, Midleton Very Rare, Millars, Paddy, Powers, Tullamore Dew
* Single pot still: Green Spot, Redbreast (12, 15, 21, 27 years)
* Single malt: Bushmills (10, 12, 16, 21 years), Connemara Peated Malt (Regular, Cask Strength and 12 years), Locke&#x27;s Single Malt (8 years), Knappogue Castle Irish Whiskey (12, 14, 16 years), Tullamore Dew Single Malt (10 year), Tyrconnell
* Single grain: Kilbeggan Single Grain (8, 10, 15, 18 years), Teeling&#x27;s Single Grain

<text>Vilnius Town Hall () is a historical town hall in the square of the same name in the Old Town of Vilnius, Lithuania.

== Palace ==
The town hall in Vilnius was mentioned for the first time in 1432. Initially it was a Gothic style building, and has since been reconstructed many times. The current Vilnius Town Hall was rebuilt in neoclassical style according to the design by Laurynas Gucevičius in 1799. It has remained unchanged since then. Its Gothic cellars have been preserved and may be visited.

Nowadays it is used for representational purposes as well as during the visits of foreign state officials and rulers, including George W. Bush and Queen Elizabeth II.

== Square ==
The Town Hall Square () at the end of the Pilies Street is a traditional centre of trade and events in Vilnius. Major annual fairs, such as Kaziukas Fair, are held in this square, the main Christmas tree is decorated here, various concerts and other attractions are organised as well as celebrations of the important dates of the state.

=== History ===
As far back as the early fifteenth century, the square was bordered by small shops. With the expansion of the city and the development of trade the number of small shops was increasing. Most of them were selling salt, iron and meat products. It is known that all of these shops could not have been sold, donated or transferred freely as everything was strictly regulated. Trading on the Town Hall Square was restricted by regulations such as the prohibition for the Jewish butchers to build their butcher&#x27;s shops both on the urban market and on Vokiečių (&quot;German&quot;) Street. It was also prohibited to buy up products on the roadsides and sell them later in the city at a higher price. It was a measure to avoid the season of high prices, especially if there was a shortage of some product such as grain in deficit times. Any violations were punished with monetary fines, flogging, imprisonment and confiscation of merchandise. Confiscated goods were donated to various refuges and hospitals.

Following the example many established cities Vilnius was granted the Magdeburg Rights in 1387. Those rights granted a right for merchants on the routes through Vilnius to stop in the capital and to sell their goods in a market. In 1503, due to the number of foreign traders the city built a special guest house for them to stay, on the site of the present day National Philharmonic. They had rooms for merchants and their retinues and premises to store their goods as well as room for horses, carts and sledges. Strict regulations were also imposed on traders and guilds regarding the construction of their market places and participation in the city&#x27;s events.

However, fighting with resellers was often a real challenge: powerful owners of jurisdictions would not always obey the orders of the rulers. Scottish and Jewish tradesmen in the seventeenth century were forbidden to trade in golden, silver, silk and semi-silk fringes and edgings, but this prohibition was not applied to the said articles produced in manufactures of Naples and Frankfurt.

Many attractions and events were organised in the square such as the performances of bears, travelling acrobats, comedians, and various troupes. The mysteries, or semi-religious performances, were also popular.

The Town Hall Square was the place where various celebrations were announced such as meetings with important guests and foreign rulers and family festivals of local noblemen.

<doc id="188298" wikidata="Q163725" url="?curid=188298" title="Magdeburg rights">
<text>Magdeburg rights (, , ; also called Magdeburg Law) were a set of town privileges first developed by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor (936–973) and based on the Flemish Law, which regulated the degree of internal autonomy within cities and villages granted by the local ruler. Named after the city of Magdeburg, these town charters were perhaps the most important set of medieval laws in Central Europe. They became the basis for the German town laws developed during many centuries in the Holy Roman Empire. The Magdeburg rights were adopted and adapted by numerous monarchs, including the rulers of Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, and Lithuania, a milestone in the urbanization of the region which prompted the development of thousands of villages and cities.

==Provisions==

Being a member of the Hanseatic League, Magdeburg was one of the most important trade cities, maintaining commerce with the Low Countries, the Baltic states, and the interior (for example Braunschweig). As with most medieval city laws, the rights were primarily targeted at regulating trade to the benefit of the local merchants and artisans, who formed the most important part of the population of many such cities. External merchants coming into the city were not allowed to trade on their own, but were instead forced to sell the goods they had brought into the city to local traders, if any wished to buy them.

Jews and Germans were sometimes competitors in those cities. Jews lived under privileges that they carefully negotiated with the king or emperor. They were not subject to city jurisdiction. These privileges guaranteed that they could maintain communal autonomy, live according to their laws, and be subjected directly to the royal jurisdiction in matters concerning Jews and Christians. One of the provisions granted to Jews was that a Jew could not be compelled to be a &quot;Gewährsmann&quot;/informant; that is, he had the right to keep confidential how he had acquired objects in his possession. A Jew with this right could voluntarily divulge who had gifted, sold, or loaned him the object, but it was illegal to coerce him to say. Other provisions frequently mentioned were a permission to sell meat to Christians, or employ Christian servants. By at least some contemporary observers, the parallel infrastructure of Jews and gentiles was considered significant; in medieval Poland&#x27;s royal city development policy, both German merchants and Jews were invited to settle in Polish cities.

==Spread of the law==

Among the most advanced systems of old Germanic law of the time, in the 13th and 14th centuries, Magdeburg rights were granted to more than a hundred cities, in Central Europe apart from Germany, including Schleswig, Bohemia, Poland, Pomerania, Prussia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (following the Christianization of Lithuania), including present-day Belarus and Ukraine, and probably Moldavia. In these lands they were mostly known as &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Teutonic&quot; law. Since the local tribunal of Magdeburg also became the superior court for these towns, Magdeburg, together with Lübeck, practically defined the law of northern Germany, Poland and Lithuania for centuries, being the heart of the most important &quot;family&quot; of city laws. This role remained until the old Germanic laws were successively replaced with Roman law under the influence of the &quot;Reichskammergericht,&quot; in the centuries after its establishment during the Imperial Reform of 1495.

==Implementation across Europe==

The first town to be granted Magdeburg rights in Poland was Złotoryja in 1211. Soon many towns were vested with the law including Wrocław, Opole, Inowrocław, Sandomierz, Gniezno, Poznań, Bochnia, Głogów, Bytom, Sieradz, Kraków, Legnica, Opatów, Konin, Piotrków, Racibórz in the 13th century, whereas Szczecin and Stargard were granted the rights in 1243 by the duke of Pomerania. The Law of Magdeburg implemented in Poland was different from its original German form. It was combined with a set of civil and criminal laws, and adjusted to include the urban planning popular across Western Europe – which was based (more or less) on the ancient Roman model. Meanwhile, country people often ignorant of the actual German text, practiced the old common law of Poland in private relations. Local variants of Magdeburg law were created, such as Środa law based on the rights granted to Środa Śląska by Henry the Bearded in 1235, Kalisz law, a variant of the Środa law, based on the rights granted to Kalisz by Bolesław the Pious before 1268, and Poznań law, a variant of Magdeburg rights, based on the rights granted to Poznań by Bolesław the Pious in 1253.
Following the formation of the Polish–Lithuanian union in 1385, Magdeburg rights spread to Lithuania, first granted to the chief cities of Vilnius, Brest and Kaunas, although more slowly than earlier in Poland, especially late in the east and in private towns. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the rights were granted to many other towns, including, chronologically, Trakai, Grodno, Kyiv, Polotsk, Minsk, Novogrudok, Rechytsa, Slonim, Barysaw, Mogilev, Mazyr, Mir, Pińsk, Alytus, Nyasvizh, Šiauliai, Biržai, Lida, Kėdainiai and Vitebsk. Magdeburg rights in Lithuania were initially modeled after the Polish cities of Kraków and Lublin, and then after Vilnius.
Hundreds of towns in Poland and Lithuania, some now located in Belarus, Latvia and Ukraine, were formerly governed on the basis of the location privilege known as the &quot;settlement with German law&quot;, excluding local variants of Magdeburg rights, with some of the more notable cities being, chronologically, Lublin, Zielona Góra, Tarnów, Olkusz, Sanok, Bydgoszcz, Rzeszów, Lwów, Będzin, Kielce, Krosno, Wieliczka, Częstochowa, Jarosław, Przemyśl, Chełm, Kazimierz Dolny, Łódź, Kamieniec Podolski, Łuck, Żytomierz, Rivne, Kowel, Siedlce, Leszno, Tarnopol, Rydzyna, Augustów, Płoskirów, Zamość, Daugavpils, Brody, Orsza, Biała Cerkiew, Nowogród Siewierski, Czernihów, Nizhyn, Krzemieńczuk, Vinnytsia, Poltava, Stanisławów, Jēkabpils, Suwałki, Białystok, Uman, Palanga, Telšiai, Cherkasy and Marijampolė. The rights reached the easternmost cities of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, including Roslavl, Smolensk and Starodub, now part of Russia. The advantages of the Magdeburg rights were not only economic, but also political. Members of noble families were able to join the city patriciate usually unchallenged. There were cases of changing the type of municipal rights, such as in Błonie from Magdeburg to Chełmno rights, and in Bielsk Podlaski and Tykocin from Chełmno to Magdeburg rights.

Most towns ruled by the Teutonic Order and Duchy of Masovia, as well as some cities under direct Polish and Lithuanian rule, obtained Chełmno rights, a local variant of Magdeburg rights, which prevailed in the area roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s northeastern quarter of Poland, including the current Polish capital of Warsaw. In addition to this, many towns in the Duchy of Pomerania in modern north-western Poland and other Baltic port cities were granted Lübeck law, thus the original Magdeburg law was relatively rare in what is now northern Poland.

In the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, the first town to receive the Magdeburg rights was Székesfehérvár in 1237, followed by Trnava (1238), Nitra (1248), Levoča (1271) and Žilina (1369). Towns and cities including Bardejov, Buda, Bratislava and Košice adopted the Southern German Nuremberg town rights, rather than the Magdeburg rights.

In 1832, the city of Chernivtsi was granted Magdeburg rights by the Austrian authorities.

==Heritage==

The old towns of Kraków, Lviv, Vilnius and Zamość, considerably developed under the Magdeburg rights, are World Heritage Sites, and Kazimierz Dolny, Lublin, Paczków, Poznań, Przemyśl, Rydzyna, Sandomierz, Stary Sącz, Tykocin and Wrocław are also designated Historic Monuments of Poland.

There are memorials to the Magdeburg rights in Kyiv, Minsk, Tetiiv, Veiviržėnai and Vinnytsia.

<text>USS &quot;Ohio&quot; (SSBN-726/SSGN-726), the lead boat of her class of nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), is the fourth vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the U.S. state of Ohio. She was commissioned with the hull designation of SSBN-726, and with her conversion to a guided missile submarine she was re-designated SSGN-726.

== Conversion to SSGN ==

Original plans called for &quot;Ohio&quot; to be retired in 2002. Instead, &quot;Ohio&quot; and three sister boats were modified and remain in service as cruise missile submarines (SSGNs). In November 2002 &quot;Ohio&quot; entered drydock, beginning a 36-month refueling and conversion overhaul. Electric Boat announced on 9 January 2006 that the conversion had been completed.

==Service history==
===As SSBN===
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 1 July 1974 and her keel was laid down on 10 April 1976 by Mrs. Robert A. Taft, JR., wife of Senator Robert Taft Jr. of Ohio. On 2 February 1978, the Precommissioning Unit was formed with Commander A. K. Thompson as its commanding officer. &quot;Ohio&quot; was launched on 7 April 1979 sponsored by Mrs. Annie Glenn, wife of Senator John H. Glenn of Ohio.

In the summer of 1981, sea trials were held to test the equipment and systems, and the submarine was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 28 October 1981. On 11 November 1981, &quot;Ohio&quot; was commissioned. The principal speaker, Vice President George H. W. Bush, remarked to the 8000 assembled guests that the boat introduced a &quot;new dimension in our nation&#x27;s strategic deterrence,&quot; and Admiral Hyman G. Rickover noted that &quot;Ohio&quot; should &quot;strike fear in the hearts of our enemies.&quot; On that day, command of the two crews (designated Blue and Gold) of &quot;Ohio&quot; was assumed by Captain A. K. Thompson (Blue) and Captain A. F. Campbell (Gold).

Following Post Shakedown Availability at Electric Boat Division, &quot;Ohio&quot; left the Atlantic and transited to her new home port, Bangor, Washington, by way of Cape Canaveral – where she tested her missile launch systems – and the Panama Canal, arriving on 12 August 1982. During August and September 1982, the first loadout of Trident C-4 missiles and a predeployment refit were conducted. &quot;Ohio&quot; and her Blue Crew departed on the first Trident Submarine Strategic Deterrent Patrol in October 1982.

From June 1993 to June 1994 &quot;Ohio&quot; underwent overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, receiving extensive upgrades to sonar, fire control, and navigation systems. &quot;Ohio&quot; resumed strategic deterrent patrols in January 1995 as part of Submarine Squadron Seventeen, Submarine Group Nine, Pacific Submarine Force.

===As SSGN===
Following her conversion to a SSGN, &quot;Ohio&quot; rejoined the fleet on 7 February 2006. On 21 January 2007, the Gold Crew departed Naval Base Kitsap for Hawaii to conduct a forward-deployed crew exchange, the first such forward-deployed swap in approximately 20 years. Ballistic submarines of &quot;Ohio&quot;″s class employ two crews, &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot;, in order to facilitate continuous operation at sea, called &quot;forward-presence&quot; in USN parlance. &quot;Ohio&quot; left for her first mission as an SSGN on 15 October 2007. The Blue crew underwent several tests and inspections before completing a mission some time in December. &quot;Ohio&quot; was also the first one of the class to complete a mission.

On 28 June 2010, &quot;Ohio&quot; was one of three &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines involved in a US response to Chinese missile testing in the contested East China Sea. &quot;Ohio&quot;, , and all surfaced simultaneously in the waters of the Philippines, South Korea, and the British Indian Ocean Territory respectively. 

In November 2011, Lt. Britta Christianson became the first U.S. female officer, and first female overall, to complete submarine warfare qualification, while she was assigned to &quot;Ohio&quot;″s Gold Crew. CSC Dominique Saavedra became the first enlisted female to earn her submarine qualification aboard &quot;Ohio&quot; in August 2016. She would go on to deploy with &quot;Michigan&quot;, the first sub specially modified with separate accommodations for enlisted female crew.

In December 2020, it was announced that &quot;Ohio&quot; would be decommissioned and enter the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program by 2026.

<text>William Thomas &quot;Champion Jack&quot; Dupree (July 23, 1909 or July 4, 1910 – January 21, 1992) was an American blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer. His nickname was derived from his early career as a boxer.

==Biography==
Dupree was a New Orleans blues and boogie-woogie pianist, a barrelhouse &quot;professor&quot;. His father was from the Belgian Congo and his mother was part African American and Cherokee. His birth date has been given as July 4, July 10, and July 23, 1908, 1909, or 1910; the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc give July 4, 1910.

He was orphaned at the age of eight and sent to the Colored Waifs Home in New Orleans, an institution for orphaned or delinquent boys (about six years previously, Louis Armstrong had also been sent to the Home, after being arrested as a &quot;dangerous and suspicious character&quot;). Dupree taught himself to play the piano there and later apprenticed with Tuts Washington and Willie Hall, whom he called his father and from whom he learned &quot;Junker&#x27;s Blues&quot;. He was also a &quot;spy boy&quot; for the Yellow Pocahontas tribe of the Mardi Gras Indians. He soon began playing in barrelhouses and other drinking establishments.

He began a life of travelling, living in Chicago, where he worked with Georgia Tom, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he met Scrapper Blackwell and Leroy Carr. He also worked as a cook. In Detroit, after Joe Louis encouraged him to become a boxer, he fought 107 bouts, winning Golden Gloves and other championships and picking up the nickname Champion Jack, which he used the rest of his life.

He returned to Chicago at the age of 30 and joined a circle of recording artists, including Big Bill Broonzy and Tampa Red, who introduced him to the record producer Lester Melrose. Many of Dupree&#x27;s songs were later credited to Melrose as composer, and Melrose claimed publishing rights to them.

Dupree&#x27;s career was interrupted by military service in World War II. He was a cook in the United States Navy and was held by the Japanese for two years as a prisoner of war. Following Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s death in office, Dupree composed the &quot;F.D.R. Blues&quot;.

After the war, his biggest commercial success was &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, which he recorded as a duet with Teddy McRae. This led to several national tours and eventually a European tour. In 1959, he played an unofficial (and unpaid) duo gig with Alexis Korner at the London School of Economics.

Dupree moved to Europe in 1960, settling first in Switzerland and then Denmark, England, Sweden and, finally, Germany. In Switzerland he met local guitarist Chris Lange at the Africana Club in Zurich. Lange became Dupree’s regular guitarist, and played a lot with him on several albums for the ‘Folkways’ and ‘Storyville’ labels and accompanied him also on his many other gigs in Europe between 1961 and 1965. On June 17, 1971, he played at the Montreux Jazz Festival, in the Casino Kursaal, with King Curtis, backed by Cornell Dupree on guitar, Jerry Jemmott on bass and Oliver Jackson on drums. The recording of the concert was released in 1973 as the album &quot;King Curtis &amp; Champion Jack Dupree: Blues at Montreux&quot; on the Atlantic label.

In the mid-1970s, Dupree lived at Ovenden in Halifax, England, after marrying a local woman, Shirley Ann Harrison, whom he had met in London. A piano he used was later discovered at Calderdale College in Halifax.

In 1976, he divorced Shirley and moved to Copenhagen, where he lived in the anarchist-occupied Freetown Christiania, where he met guitarist Kenn Lending. Dupree and Lending would form a partnership that lasted until Dupree&#x27;s death in 1992. This period of his life was the subject of the 1975 film &quot;Barrelhouse Blues - Feelings and Situations&quot; by the artists Laurie Grundt and Eva Acking which includes several filmed performances, including one where Dupree plays drum set. Dupree later moved to Hanover, Germany. He continued to record in Europe with Kenn Lending, Louisiana Red and Axel Zwingenberger and made many live appearances. He also worked again as a cook, specializing in New Orleans cuisine. In 1990 Dupree returned to the United States to perform at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. The event was marked with the recording of the album &quot;Back Home in New Orleans&quot;. He died of cancer on January 21, 1992, in Hanover.

==Musical style and output==
Dupree&#x27;s playing was almost all straight blues and boogie-woogie. He was not a sophisticated musician or singer, but he had a wry and clever way with words: &quot;Mama, move your false teeth, papa wanna scratch your gums.&quot; He sometimes sang as if he had a cleft palate and even recorded under the name Harelip Jack Dupree. This was an artistic conceit, as he had clear articulation, particularly for a blues singer.

Many of his songs were about jail, drinking and drug addiction, although he himself was a light drinker and did not use other drugs. His &quot;Junker&#x27;s Blues&quot; was transmuted by Fats Domino into &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, Domino&#x27;s first hit record. Some of Dupree&#x27;s songs had gloomy topics, such as &quot;TB Blues&quot; and &quot;Angola Blues&quot; (about Louisiana State Penitentiary, the infamous Louisiana prison farm), but he also sang about cheerful subjects, as in &quot;Dupree Shake Dance&quot;: &quot;Come on, mama, on your hands and knees, do that shake dance as you please&quot;. He was a noted raconteur and transformed many of his stories into songs, such as &quot;Big Leg Emma&#x27;s&quot;, a rhymed tale of a police raid on a barrelhouse.

The lyrics of Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s version of &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot;—&quot;You can shake it one time for me!&quot;—echo Dupree&#x27;s song &quot;Shake Baby Shake&quot;.

On his best-known album, &quot;Blues from the Gutter&quot;, released by Atlantic Records in 1958, he was accompanied on guitar by Larry Dale, whose playing on that record inspired Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones.

In later years Dupree recorded with John Mayall, Mick Taylor, Eric Clapton and The Band.

Although best known as a singer and pianist in the New Orleans style, Dupree occasionally pursued more musically adventurous projects, including &quot;Dupree &#x27;N&#x27; McPhee: The 1967 Blue Horizon Session&quot;, a collaboration with the English guitarist Tony McPhee, recorded for the Blue Horizon label.

Since his death, Dupree has undergone a revival of interest on the British vintage dance scene. His recording of &quot;Shakin&#x27; Mother for You&quot; now features on the playlist of most DJ&#x27;s on the UK Lindy Hop scene and it has become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard track for the &#x27;Cardiff Stroll&#x27;.

<text>USS &quot;Louisiana&quot; (SSBN-743) is the 18th and last ship of the United States Navy″s of nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarines. She carries Trident ballistic missiles and has been in commission since 1997. She is the fourth commissioned ship to bear the name of the U.S. state of Louisiana.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for the construction of &quot;Louisiana&quot; was awarded on 19 December 1990 and her keel was laid down at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, Connecticut, on 23 October 1992. She was launched on 27 July 1996, sponsored by Patricia O&#x27;Keefe, and commissioned on 6 September 1997 at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay at Kings Bay, Georgia.

==Service history==
===Atlantic Fleet operations===
&quot;Louisiana&quot;″s first home port was Kings Bay. Her commissioning gave Kings Bay its planned full complement of 10 ballistic missile submarines.

===Transfer to Pacific Fleet===
In the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War and the subsequent reorganization of U.S. military forces, a U.S. nuclear policy review recommended that the U.S. Navy reduce its inventory of &quot;Ohio&quot;-class fleet ballistic missile submarines from 18 to 14 by 2005. An original plan to meet this goal by retiring the four oldest &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines , , , and was abandoned. Instead, those four were converted into cruise missile submarines (SSGNs). The conversions reduced the size of the Trident-equipped ballistic missile submarine fleet to 14 units. In order to balance the remaining Trident-equipped fleet between the United States Atlantic Fleet and United States Pacific Fleet, five &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines relocated from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Between 2002 and 2005, , , , , and &quot;Louisiana&quot; relocated from Kings Bay to Naval Base Kitsap.

===Pacific Fleet operations===
====2016 collision====
On 18 August 2016, &quot;Louisiana&quot; collided with , a submarine and special warfare support vessel, while conducting operations in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Both vessels returned to their respective home ports under their own power. Damage to &quot;Louisiana&quot; was limited to her forward starboard hull.

==Awards==
===2006 Omaha Trophy===

The Strategic Air Command Consultation Committee presented the Omaha Trophy to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in 1971 on behalf of the citizens of Omaha, Nebraska, with the request that it be awarded annually to the outstanding SAC wing; the award later grew to include four different categories, including Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Command, Strategic Aircraft Operations Command, Strategic Space and Information Operations Command, and Submarine Ballistic Missile Command. On 31 May 2007, United States Strategic Command announced that &quot;Louisiana&quot; had won the 2006 Omaha Trophy in the Submarine Ballistic Missile Command category, which recognizes excellence in the fleet and is presented annually to the ballistic missile submarine unit demonstrating the highest standards of performance; in order for &quot;Louisiana&quot; to receive the award, both her Blue Crew and Gold Crew had to achieve excellence in every category possible from loading weapons to tactical scenarios related to strategic warfare to sailor retention and crew morale, with selection for the award based on formal evaluations, meritorious achievement, safety, and other factors such as community involvement and humanitarian actions. General Kevin P. Chilton, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, presented the trophy to &quot;Louisiana&quot;″s crew.

===2009 Meritorious Unit Commendation===
Both the Blue and Gold crews of &quot;Louisiana&quot; received the Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gary Roughead on 17 February 2009 during an all-hands call while he was visiting Naval Base Kitsap. The award was based on a recognition that both crews collectively had performed service of a character comparable in a non-combat situation to that which would merit the award of a Bronze Star Medal, or an award of like caliber, to an individual in a combat situation. &quot;Louisiana&quot; was specifically recognized for meritorious service and superior performance across the spectrum of strategic submarine operations, setting fleet standards of excellence for administration, engineering, supply, personnel programs, and community support. &quot;Louisiana&quot; was the first ballistic missile submarine to be awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation since 2001.

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
&quot;Louisiana&quot;″s crest recalls the traditions of the people of the state of Louisiana and the three previous U.S. Navy ships to bear the name &quot;Louisiana&quot;. The symbolism of the crest reminds both crews of their bond to the people and history of Louisiana, as well as the tradition of the naval veterans who have served aboard ships of the same name. To others, the crest serves as a statement that the crews carry forward and those traditions of faithful and excellent service.

 The gold braid encircling the seal represents commitment of the two crews to the values of pride, patriotism, honor, and tradition. The 18 stars surrounding the crest identify &quot;Louisiana&quot; as the 18th state of the Union and &quot;Louisiana&quot; as the 18th &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarine. The Louisiana state bird, the pelican, is shown protecting her young with outstretched wings; the pelican, as legend has it, is the only bird known to give its own flesh to feed its young when it is unable to find food, and this signifies the mission of &quot;Louisiana&quot; and her two crews to defend, at all costs, the freedoms and values that America represents.

The red, white, and blue colors in the crest symbolize &quot;Louisiana&quot;″s duty to the nation. The crest also includes the gold, white, and blue of the state of Louisiana to recall the submarine″s name″s origins. Additionally, the dark blue and gold in the crest traditionally associated with the United States Navy represent excellence and the sea, and also symbolizes the two crews Blue Crew and Gold Crew of &quot;Louisiana&quot;. The bow-on perspective of the modern &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarine is meant to be striking, bold, and steadfast in its appearance, serving as a warning of &quot;Louisiana&quot;″s resolute commitment to defending freedom.

The four stars on the submarine″s bow indicate that &quot;Louisiana&quot; the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name. The laurel symbolizes each crew member&#x27;s commitment to honorable service to their country and ship. The tridents symbolize naval weaponry, both past and present, and sea prowess. Their bottom spikes pierce the Louisiana state motto, anchoring it, while pointing toward the ocean depths where the ship patrols. An iris with three petals was once the armorial emblem of French sovereigns, and it is often used as a symbol of the state of Louisiana; here it represents France&#x27;s strong influence on the State of Louisiana. The banner with the inscription &quot;Union, Justice, and Confidence&quot; proclaims the Louisiana state motto. Wrapping the banner around the ship symbolizes the crew&#x27;s strong &quot;esprit de corps&quot; with the people of the state of Louisiana. The crawfish further symbolizes the cultural heritage of the people of the state of Louisiana.

<doc id="188305" wikidata="Q93788" url="?curid=188305" title="Max Fleischer">
<text>Max Fleischer (born Majer Fleischer ; July 19, 1883 – September 11, 1972) was a Polish-American animator and studio owner. Born in Kraków, in Austrian Poland, Fleischer immigrated to the United States where he became a pioneer in the development of the animated cartoon and served as the head of Fleischer Studios, which he co-founded with his younger brother Dave. He brought such comic characters as Koko the Clown, Betty Boop, Popeye, and Superman to the movie screen, and was responsible for several technological innovations, including the rotoscope, the &quot;follow the bouncing ball&quot; technique pioneered in the &quot;Ko-Ko Song Car-Tunes&quot; films, and the &quot;stereoptical process&quot;. Film director Richard Fleischer was his son.

==Early life==
Majer Fleischer was born July 19, 1883, to a Jewish family in Kraków, (then part of Austria-Hungary: Austrian Partition). He was the second of six children of a tailor from Dąbrowa Tarnowska, Aaron Fleischer, who later changed his name to William in the United States, and Malka &quot;Amelia&quot; Pałasz. His family emigrated to the United States in March 1887, settling in New York City, where he attended public school. During his early formative years, he enjoyed a middle-class lifestyle, the result of his father&#x27;s success as an exclusive tailor to high society clients. This changed drastically after his father lost his business ten years later. His teens were spent in Brownsville, a poor Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn. He continued his education at evening high school. He received commercial art training at Cooper Union and formal art instruction at the Art Students League of New York, studying under George Bridgman. He also attended the Mechanics and Tradesman&#x27;s School in midtown Manhattan.

Fleischer began his career at &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;. Beginning as an errand boy, he advanced to photographer, photoengraver, and eventually, staff cartoonist. At first, he drew single-panel editorial cartoons, but then graduated to the full strips &quot;Little Algie&quot; and &quot;S.K. Sposher, the Camera Fiend&quot;. These satirical strips reflected his life in Brownsville and his fascination with technology and photography, respectively—both displaying his sense of irony and fatalism. It was during this period he met newspaper cartoonist and early animator, John Randolph Bray, who would later give him his start in the animation field.

On December 25, 1905, Fleischer married his childhood sweetheart, Ethel (Essie) Goldstein. On the recommendation of Bray, Fleischer was hired as a technical illustrator for the Electro-Light Engraving Company in Boston. In 1909 he moved to Syracuse, New York, working as a catalog illustrator for the Crouse-Hinds Company, and a year later returned to New York as art editor for &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine under editor Waldemar Kaempffert.

==Career==
===The Rotoscope===
By 1914, the first commercially produced animated cartoons began to appear in movie theaters. They tended to be stiff and jerky. Fleischer devised an improvement in animation through a combined projector and easel for tracing images from a live-action film. This device, known as the Rotoscope, enabled Fleischer to produce the first realistic animation since the initial works of Winsor McCay. Although his patent was granted in 1917, Max and his brothers Joe and Dave Fleischer made their first series of tests between 1914 and 1916.

===First venture===

The Pathé Film exchange offered Max his first opportunity as a producer due in part to the fact that Dave had been working there as a film cutter since 1914. Max chose a political satire of a hunting trip by Theodore Roosevelt. After several months of labor, the film was rejected, and Max was making the rounds again when he was reunited with John R. Bray at Paramount Pictures. Bray had a distribution contract with Paramount at the time and hired Max as production supervisor for his studio. With the outbreak of World War I, Max was sent to Fort Sill, Oklahoma to produce the first Army training films on subjects that included &quot;Contour Map Reading&quot;, &quot;Operating the Stokes Mortar&quot;, &quot;Firing the Lewis Machine Gun&quot;, and &quot;Submarine Mine Laying&quot;. Following the Armistice, Fleischer returned to Bray and the production of theatrical and educational films.

===The Inkwell Studios===

Fleischer produced his &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; films featuring &quot;The Clown&quot; character, which his brother Dave originated; he had worked as a sideshow clown at Coney Island. It was one of the later tests made from footage of Dave as a clown that interested Bray.

Fleischer&#x27;s initial series was first produced at the Bray Studios and released as a monthly installment in the &quot;Bray-Goldwyn Pictograph Screen Magazine&quot; from 1919 to 1921. In addition to producing &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot;, Max&#x27;s position at Bray was primarily production manager, and supervisor of several educational and technical films such as &quot;The Electric Bell&quot;, &quot;All Aboard for the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Hello, Mars&quot;. And it was as production manager that Fleischer hired his first animator, Roland Crandall, who remained with him throughout the active years of Fleischer&#x27;s studio.

&quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; featured the novelty of combining live action and animation and served as semi-documentaries with the appearance of Max Fleischer as the artist who dipped his pen into the ink bottle to produce the clown figure on his drawing board. While the technique of combining animation with live action was already established by others at the Bray Studio, it was Fleischer&#x27;s clever use of it combined with Fleischer&#x27;s realistic animation that made his series unique.

In 1921, Max and Dave established Out of the Inkwell Films, Incorporated, and continued production of &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; through various states-rights distributors. &quot;The Clown&quot; had no name until 1924, when Dick Huemer came aboard after animating on the early &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; cartoons. He set the style for the series, redesigning &quot;The Clown&quot;, and named him &quot;Ko-Ko&quot;. Huemer created Ko-Ko&#x27;s canine companion, known as Fitz, and moved the Fleischers away from their dependency on the Rotoscope for fluid animation, leaving it for special uses and reference points where compositing was involved. Because Max valued Huemer&#x27;s work, he instructed Huemer to make just the key poses and have an assistant fill in the remaining drawings. Max assigned Art Davis as Huemer&#x27;s assistant and this was the beginning of the animation position of &quot;inbetweener&quot;, which was essentially another Fleischer &quot;invention&quot; that resulted in efficient production and was adopted by the entire industry by the 1930s.

It was during this time that Max developed Rotoscoping, a means of photographing live action film footage with animation cels for a composited image. This was an improvement over the method used by Bray where a series of 8&quot; x 10&quot; stills were made from motion picture film and used as backgrounds behind animation cels. The Rotograph technique went into more general use as &quot;aerial image photography&quot; and was a staple in animation and optical effects companies for making titles and various forms of matte composites.

In addition to the theatrical comedy films, Fleischer produced technical and educational films including &quot;That Little Big Fellow&quot; and &quot;Now You&#x27;re Talking&quot; for A.T.&amp;T. In 1923, he made two 20-minute features explaining Albert Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity and Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Evolution&quot; using animated special effects and live action.

===Red Seal===
In 1924, Fleischer partnered with Edwin Miles Fadiman, Hugo Riesenfeld and Lee de Forest to form Red Seal Pictures Corporation, which owned 36 theaters on the East Coast, extending as far west as Cleveland, Ohio. During this period, Fleischer invented the &quot;Follow the Bouncing Ball&quot; technique in his &quot;Ko-Ko Song Car-Tunes&quot; series of animated sing-along shorts. In these films, the lyrics of a song appear on screen and theater patrons are encouraged to sing along with the characters. An animated ball bounces across the top of the lyrics to indicate when words should be sung.

Of the 36 &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; 12 used the De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film process, the first of which was &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; in 1926. This preceded Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928), which has been erroneously cited for decades as the first cartoon to synchronize sound with animation. The &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; series lasted until early 1927 and was interrupted by the bankruptcy of the Red Seal company—just five months before the start of the sound era.

Alfred Weiss, owner of Artcraft Pictures, approached Fleischer with a contract to produce cartoons for Paramount. Due to legal complications of the bankruptcy, the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series was renamed &quot;The Inkwell Imps&quot; and ran from 1927 to 1929. This was the start of Fleischer&#x27;s relationship with the huge Paramount organization, which lasted for the next 15 years. After a year, the Fleischer brothers started experiencing mismanagement under Weiss and left the company in late 1928. Inkwell Films, Inc. filed for bankruptcy in January 1929, and Fleischer formed Fleischer Studios, Inc. in March 1929.

===Fleischer Studios, Inc.===
Fleischer first set up operations at Carpenter-Goldman Laboratories in Queens with a small staff (see Fleischer Studios). After eight months, his new company was solvent enough to move back to its former location at 1600 Broadway, where it remained until 1938. At Carpenter-Goldman, Fleischer began producing industrial films including &quot;Finding His Voice&quot; (1929), a demonstration film illustrating the Western Electric Variable Density sound recording and reproduction method. Despite the conflicts with Weiss, Fleischer managed to negotiate a new contract with Paramount to produce a revised version of the &quot;Song Car-tunes&quot;, produced with sound and renamed&quot; Screen Songs&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot;.

At this early stage in the sound era, Fleischer produced many technically advanced films that were the result of his continued research and development that perfected the post-production method of sound recording. Several of these devices provided visual cues for the musical conductor to follow. As dialogue and songs became major elements, more precise analysis of soundtracks was possible through other inventions from Fleischer such as &quot;The Cue Meter&quot;.

===Betty Boop===
Max Fleischer&#x27;s Betty Boop character was born out of a cameo caricature in the early &quot;Talkartoon&quot;, &quot;Dizzy Dishes&quot; (1930). Fashioned after popular singer Helen Kane, she originated as a hybrid poodle/canine figure and was such a sensation in the New York preview that Paramount encouraged Fleischer to develop her into a continuing character. While she originated under animator Myron &quot;Grim&quot; Natwick, she was transformed into a human female under Seymour Kneitel and Berny Wolf and became Fleischer&#x27;s most famous character.

The &quot;Betty Boop&quot; series began in 1932 and became a big success for Fleischer. That same year, Helen Kane filed a lawsuit against Fleischer, Fleischer Studios, and Paramount claiming that the cartoons were a deliberate caricature of her, created unfair competition, and had ruined her career. The suit went to trial in 1934. Judge Edward J. McGoldrick ruled, &quot;The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force.&quot; In his opinion, the &quot;baby&quot; technique of singing did not originate with Kane.

===Popeye the Sailor===

Fleischer&#x27;s greatest business decision came with his licensing of the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor, who was introduced to audiences in the Betty Boop cartoon short, &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; (1933). Popeye became one of the most successful screen adaptations of a comic strip in cinema history. Much of this success was due to the perfect match of the Fleischer Studio style combined with its unique use of music. By the late 1930s, a survey indicated that Popeye had eclipsed Mickey Mouse in popularity, challenging Disney&#x27;s preeminence in the market.

===Paramount===

During its zenith by the mid-1930s, Fleischer Studios was producing four series, &quot;Betty Boop&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Screen Songs&quot;, and &quot;Color Classics&quot;, resulting in 52 releases each year. From the very beginning, Fleischer&#x27;s business relationship with Paramount was a joint financial and distribution arrangement, making his studio a service company supplying products for the company&#x27;s theaters. During the Great Depression, Paramount went through four bankruptcy reorganizations, which affected their operational expenses.

As a founding member of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Fleischer was aware of the technical advancements of the industry, particularly in the development of color cinematography. Due to Paramount&#x27;s financial restructuring, he was unable to acquire the three-color Technicolor process from the start. This created the opportunity for Walt Disney, who was then a small fledgling producer, to acquire a four-year exclusivity. With this, he created a new market for color cartoons beginning with &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; (1932). In 1934 Paramount approved color production for Fleischer, but he was left with the limited two-color processes of Cinecolor (red and cyan) and Two-Color Technicolor (red and cyan) for the first year of his &quot;Color Classics&quot;. The first entry, &quot;Poor Cinderella&quot; (1934) was made in the two-emulsion/two-color Cinecolor Process and starred Betty Boop in her only color appearance. By 1936, Disney&#x27;s exclusivity had expired, and Fleischer had the benefit of the three-color Technicolor Process beginning with &quot;Somewhere in Dreamland&quot;.

These color cartoons were often augmented with Fleischer&#x27;s patented three-dimensional effects promoted as the &quot;Stereoptical Process&quot;, a precursor to Disney&#x27;s Multiplane animation. This technique used 3-D model sets replacing flat pan backgrounds, with the animation cels photographed in front. This technique was used to the greatest degree in the two-reel &quot;Popeye Features&quot; &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor&quot; (1936) and &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba&#x27;s Forty Thieves&quot; (1937). These double-length cartoons demonstrated Fleischer&#x27;s interest in animated feature films. While Fleischer petitioned for this for three years, it was not until the New York opening at Radio City of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (February 1938) that Paramount executives realized the value of animated features and ordered one for a 1939 Christmas release.

===Decline===
The popularity of the Popeye cartoons created a demand for more. To meet Paramount&#x27;s demands, the studio was challenged with rapid expansion, production speed-ups, and crowded working conditions. Finally, in May 1937, Fleischer Studios was affected by a five-month strike, resulting in a boycott that kept the studio&#x27;s releases off theater screens until November. Having a paternal attitude towards his employees, Max took it personally, as if he had been betrayed, and thus developed an ulcer. Following the strike, Max and Dave Fleischer decided to move the studio for more space and to escape further labor agitation.

In March 1938, Paramount approved Max&#x27;s proposal to produce a feature just when he was preparing to move the studio from New York City to Miami, Florida. Once in Miami relations between Max and Dave began deteriorating, beginning with the pressures to deliver their first feature, complicated further by Dave&#x27;s adulterous affair with his secretary, Mae Schwartz.

Jonathan Swift&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; was a favorite of Max&#x27;s and was pressed into production. Fleischer and Paramount originally budgeted the film &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; at $500,000—the same miscalculation made by Disney with &quot;Snow White&quot;. The final cost for &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; was $1.5 million. It played limited engagements with only 24 prints in 36 theaters during the 1939 Christmas season, but grossed more than $3 million during the Christmas week, giving Paramount a profit of $1.5 million before going into foreign release. But Fleischer Studios was penalized $350,000 for going over budget, and the contract did not allow Max and Fleischer Studios participation in the foreign earnings. This was the beginning of the financial difficulties of Fleischer Studios with reduced royalties due to this debt to Paramount.

In 1940, Max was relegated to business affairs and continued technical development. His efforts resulted in a reflex camera viewfinder and research into line transfer methods to replace the time-consuming and tedious process of cel inking. While ahead of his time, that same year Fleischer and Paramount experienced lost revenues owing to the failure of the new series &quot;Gabby&quot;, &quot;Animated Antics&quot;, and &quot;Stone Age&quot;, all launched under the leadership of Dave. After Republic Studios allegedly failed to develop Superman as a live-action serial, Max acquired the license that fall and initiated development.

The cost for the &quot;Superman&quot; series has been grossly overstated for decades on the basis of Dave Fleischer&#x27;s UCLA 1968 Oral History interview by Joe Adamson. The actual figure stated in Fleischer&#x27;s 1941 contract was in the $30,000 range, twice the cost of a Popeye cartoon. &quot;Superman&quot; was a &quot;serious&quot; type of cartoon that was not being made by rival studios which features anthropomorphic comic animal characters. The science fiction/fantasy elements of Superman appealed to Max&#x27;s interests, finally leading the studio into maturity and relevance for the 1940s.

The early returns on &quot;Gulliver&quot; prompted Paramount president Barney Balaban to order a second feature for their 1941 Christmas release. This second feature, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, was unique, having a contemporary setting. Most importantly, it was technically and artistically superior to &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Paramount had high hopes for its Christmas 1941 release, which was well received by critics during its December 5 preview. However, the exhibitors rejected it, fearing that it would not do business because it was not a Disney animated Fairy Tale. And with the bombing of Pearl Harbor two days after the preview, the original Christmas release due in three weeks was cancelled.

With the cancellation of &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, Max was called to a meeting with Balaban in New York, where he was asked for his resignation. Dave had resigned following the completion of Post-production on Mr. Bug in late November 1941. Paramount finished out the remaining five months of the 1941 Fleischer contract with the absence of both Max and Dave Fleischer, and the name change to Famous Studios became official on May 27, 1942. Paramount installed new management, among them Max&#x27;s son-in-law, Seymour Kneitel.

===Later career===
Unable to form a studio due to the demand for military training films, Fleischer was brought in as head of the animation department for the industrial film company, The Jam Handy Organization in Detroit, Michigan. While there he supervised the technical and cartoon animation departments, producing training films for the Army and Navy. Fleischer was also involved with top-secret research and development for the war effort including an aircraft bomber sighting system. In 1944, he published &quot;Noah&#x27;s Shoes&quot;, a metaphoric account of the building and loss of his studio, casting himself as Noah.

Following the war, he supervised the production of the animated adaptation of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (1948), sponsored by Montgomery Ward. Fleischer left Handy in 1953 and returned as production manager for the Bray Studios in New York, where he developed an educational television pilot about unusual birds and animals titled, &quot;Imagine That!&quot;

In 1954, Max&#x27;s son, Richard Fleischer, was directing &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; for Walt Disney. This brought about the honorary luncheon that united Max with his former competitor and reunited him with several former Fleischer animators who were then employed by Disney. This meeting of the former rivals seemed cordial, and Max remarked that he was very happy making educational films at this point in his career. However, in his collection of memoirs entitled &quot;Just Tell Me When to Cry&quot;, Richard relates how, at the mere mention of Disney&#x27;s name, Max would mutter, &quot;that son-of-a-bitch&quot;.

Fleischer won a lawsuit against Paramount in 1955 over the removal of his name from the credits of his films. While Fleischer had issues over the breach of contract, he had avoided suing for a decade to protect his son-in-law, Seymour Kneitel, who was a lead director at Paramount&#x27;s Famous Studios. In 1958, Fleischer revived Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. and partnered with his former animator Hal Seeger, to produce 100 color &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; (1960–1961) cartoons for television. Actor Larry Storch performed the voices for Koko the Clown and supporting characters Kokonut and Mean Moe. While Max appeared in the un-aired pilot, he became too ill to appear in the series, and, in poor health, he spent the rest of his life attempting to regain ownership of Betty Boop.

Fleischer and wife Essie moved to the Motion Picture Country House in 1967. Fleischer died from arterial sclerosis of the brain on September 11, 1972, two months after his 89th birthday. In the announcement of his death, Time Magazine labeled him the &quot;dean of animated cartoons&quot;. His death preceded the reclaiming of his star character, Betty Boop, and a national retrospective.

The anthology film &quot;The Betty Boop Scandals of 1974&quot; started the Fleischer Renaissance with new 35mm prints of a selection of the best Fleischer cartoons made between 1928 and 1934. This was followed by &quot;The Popeye Follies&quot;. These special theatrical programs generated interest in Max Fleischer as the alternative to Walt Disney, spawning a new wave of film research devoted to an expanded interest in animation beyond trivial entertainment.

== Preservation ==
A trailer for &quot;Superman&quot; (1941) produced by Max Fleischer was preserved and restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive from the 35mm nitrate successive exposure negative and a 35mm optical track negative. Restoration funding was provided by ASIFA-Hollywood. The restoration had its world premiere at the 2024 UCLA Festival of Preservation.

<text>The United Service Organizations Inc. (USO) is an American nonprofit-charitable corporation that provides live entertainment, such as comedians, actors and musicians, social facilities, and other programs to members of the United States Armed Forces and their families. Since 1941, it has worked in partnership with the Department of War, and later with the Department of Defense (DoD), relying heavily on private contributions and on funds, goods, and services from various corporate and individual donors. Although it is congressionally chartered, it is not a government agency.

Founded during World War II, the USO sought to be the GI&#x27;s &quot;home away from home&quot; and began a tradition of entertaining the troops and providing social facilities. Involvement in the USO was one of the many ways in which the nation had come together to support the war effort, with nearly 1.5 million people having volunteered their services in some way. The USO initially disbanded in 1947, but was revived in 1950 for the Korean War, after which it continued, also providing peacetime services. During the Vietnam War, USO social facilities (&quot;USOs&quot;) were sometimes located in combat zones.

The organization became particularly known for its live performances, called &quot;camp shows&quot;, through which the entertainment industry helps boost the morale of servicemen and women. In the early days, Hollywood was eager to show its patriotism, and many celebrities joined the ranks of USO entertainers. They went as volunteers to entertain, and celebrities continue to provide volunteer entertainment in military bases in the U.S. and overseas, sometimes placing their own lives in danger by traveling or performing under hazardous conditions. In 2011, the USO was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

Currently, the USO maintains over 200 locations in 27 U.S. states and 13 foreign countries. During a gala marking the USO&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 2016, retired Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the chairman of the USO Board of Governors, estimated that the USO has served more than 35 million Americans over its history.

==History==

===Mission and goals===
The USO was founded on February 4, 1941 by Mary Ingraham in response to a request from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale and recreation services to U.S. uniformed military personnel. Roosevelt was elected as its honorary chairman. This request brought together six civilian organizations: the Salvation Army, YMCA, Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA), National Catholic Community Service, National Travelers Aid Association and the National Jewish Welfare Board. They were brought together under one umbrella to support U.S. troops, as opposed to operating independently as some had done during the First World War. Roosevelt said he wanted &quot;these private organizations to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces.&quot; According to historian Emily Yellin, &quot;The government was to build the buildings and the USO was to raise private funds to carry out its main mission: boosting the morale of the military.&quot;

The first national campaign chairman was Thomas Dewey, who raised $16 million in the first year. The second chairman was future senator Prescott Bush. The USO was incorporated in New York on February 4, with the first facility erected in DeRidder, Louisiana, 1941. More USO centers and clubs opened around the world as a &quot;Home Away from Home&quot; for GIs. The USO club was a place to go for dances and social events, for movies and music, for a quiet place to talk or write a letter home, or for a free cup of coffee and an egg.

The USO also brought Hollywood celebrities and volunteer entertainers to perform for the troops. According to movie historian Steven Cohan, &quot;most of all ... in taking home on the road, it equated the nation with showbiz. USO camp shows were designed in their export to remind soldiers of home.&quot; They did this, he noted, by &quot;nurturing in troops a sense of patriotic identification with America through popular entertainment.&quot; An article in &quot;Look&quot; magazine at the time, stated, &quot;For the little time the show lasts, the men are taken straight to the familiar Main Street that is the goal of every fighting American far away from home.&quot; Maxene Andrews wrote, &quot;The entertainment brought home to the boys. &quot;Their&quot; home.&quot; Actor George Raft stated at the beginning of the war, &quot;Now it&#x27;s going to be up to us to send to the men here and abroad real, living entertainment, the songs, the dances, and the laughs they had back home.&quot;

USO promotional literature stated its goals:

In 2011, the USO was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama &quot;for contributions to lifting the spirits of America&#x27;s troops and their families through the arts&quot;.

===World War II===

After being formed in 1941, in response to World War II, &quot;centers were established quickly ... in churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, castles, beach clubs, and log cabins.&quot; Most centers offered recreational activities, such as holding dances and showing movies. And there were the well-known free coffee and doughnuts. Some USO centers provided a haven for spending a quiet moment alone or writing a letter home, while others offered spiritual guidance and made childcare available for military wives.

But the organization became mostly known for its live performances called &quot;Camp Shows&quot;, through which the entertainment industry helped boost the morale of its servicemen and women. USO Camp Shows, Inc. began in October 1941, and by that fall and winter 186 military theaters existed in the United States. Overseas shows began in November 1941 with a tour of the Caribbean.

From Laurel and Hardy Central:

Within five months 36 overseas units had been sent within the Americas, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and during 1942 1,000 performed as part of 70 units. Average performers were paid $100 a week; top stars were paid $10 a day because their wealth let them contribute more of their talents.

These overseas shows were produced by the American Theatre Wing, which also provided food and entertainment for the armed services in their Stage Door Canteens. Funds from the sale of film rights for a story about the New York Canteen went toward providing USO tours of shows for overseas troops.

Following the Invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, Edward G. Robinson was the first movie star to travel to Normandy to entertain the troops. He had already been active back home selling war bonds, and donated $100,000 to the USO. During his show, he said, &quot;This is the most privileged moment of my life, the opportunity to be here with you.&quot; The following month, Camp Shows began in Normandy.

Until fall 1944 overseas units contained five performers or fewer; &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, using local theaters in France and Italy, was the first to use an entire theater company, including scenery. At its high point in 1944, the USO had more than 3,000 clubs, and curtains were rising on USO shows 700 times a day. The USO&#x27;s fundraising efforts were controversial. An MGM film, &quot;Mr. Gardenia Jones&quot;, created to assist the USO in its fundraising campaign, was nearly withdrawn from theaters due to objections by the War Department, mainly because of scenes showing soldiers jumping with joy at the opportunity to shower in canteens and rest in overstuffed and comfortable USO chairs. The Army, noted &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;feels this is not good for morale as it implies that there are no showers or other comforts for soldiers in military camps.&quot; The film starred Ronald Reagan, then a captain in the Army Air Force.

Fundraising was also aided by non-USO entertainment groups. Soldier Shows, which troops – often experienced actors and musicians – organized and held their own performances, were common. The army formed a Special Services unit that organized such shows and supervised the USO, and the experience from the Soldier Shows led to Irving Berlin&#x27;s Broadway show &quot;This Is the Army&quot;. Performers and writers from throughout the army were recruited for the production; they remained soldiers and continued drills. Berlin, who had written and produced the similar &quot;Yip, Yip, Yaphank&quot; during World War I, took the entire 165-person cast on tour in Europe in 1942, raising nearly $10 million for the Army Emergency Relief Fund. The following year the show was made into a film by the same title, again starring Ronald Reagan. The &quot;This Is The Army&quot; stage production toured worldwide until it closed in October 1945 in Honolulu. The USO was also supported by the National War Fund.

War correspondent Quentin Reynolds, wrote in an article for &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; in 1943, that &quot;Entertainment, all phases of it – radio, pictures and live – should be treated as essential. You don&#x27;t know what entertainment means to the guys who do the fighting until you&#x27;ve been up there with the men yourself. ... You can quote me as saying that we should use entertainment as an essential industry so long as it&#x27;s for the boys in service. Anybody who has been there would insist on it. ... Hell, you should have seen how happy the G.I.s were when they heard the ballplayers were coming over. And John Steinbeck, just back from a chore as war correspondent, ... also applauded show business as part of the war effort and its importance as a morale builder.&quot;
According to historian Paul Holsinger, between 1941 and 1945, the USO did 293,738 performances in 208,178 separate visits. Estimates were that more than 161 million servicemen and women, in the U.S. and abroad, were entertained. The USO also did shows in military hospitals, eventually entertaining more than 3 million wounded soldiers and sailors in 192 different hospitals. There were 702 different USO troupes that toured the world, some spending up to six months per tour. In 1943, a United States Liberty ship named the SS &quot;U.S.O.&quot; was launched. She was scrapped in 1967.

Twenty-eight performers died in the course of their tours, from plane crashes, illness, or diseases contracted while on tour. In one such instance in 1943, a plane carrying a USO troupe crashed outside Lisbon, killing singer and actress Tamara Drasin, and severely injuring Broadway singer Jane Froman. Froman returned to Europe on crutches in 1945 to again entertain the troops. She later married the co-pilot who saved her life in that crash, and her story was made into the 1952 film &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot;, with Froman providing the actual singing voice. Others, such as Al Jolson, the first entertainer to go overseas in World War II, contracted malaria, resulting in the loss of his lung, cutting short his tour.

One author wrote that by the end of the war &quot;the USO amounted to the biggest enterprise American show business has ever tackled. The audience was millions of American fighting men, the theatre&#x27;s location: the world, the producer: USO camp shows&quot; Performances continued after the end of the war in 1945. 60 new units went to Europe after V-E Day, and 91 new units went to the Pacific after V-J Day. The USO dissolved in December 1947, after having spent $240 million in contributions on Camp Shows, canteens, and other services. Special Services productions grew in number as replacement.

In 1991, 20th Century Fox produced the film &quot;For the Boys&quot;, which told the story of two USO performers, and starred Bette Midler and James Caan. It covered a 50-year timespan, from the USO&#x27;s inception in 1941 through Operation Desert Storm, in 1991. Another movie was planned in 1950 but never made. Just 10 days after Al Jolson returned from entertaining troops in Korea, he agreed with RKO producers to star in a new movie, &quot;Stars and Stripes for Ever&quot;, about a USO troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. He died a week later as a result of physical exhaustion from his tour.

====Segregation and women in the USO====
According to Emily Yellin, many of the key foot soldiers in the USO&#x27;s mission were women who were &quot;charged with providing friendly diversion for U.S. troops who were mostly men in their teens and twenties.&quot; USO centers throughout the world recruited female volunteers to serve doughnuts, dance, and just talk with the troops. USO historian Julia Carson writes that this &quot;nostalgic hour,&quot; designed to cheer and comfort soldiers, involved &quot;listening to music – American style&quot; and &quot;looking at pretty girls, like no other pretty girls in the world – American girls.&quot;

African-American women scrambled to rally the community around the soldiers and create programs for them. By 1946, hostesses had served more than two thousand soldiers a day while also providing facilities for the wounded and convalescent who were on leave. They went to black businesses and fraternal organizations in order to find sponsorship for their USO group, and later expanded to fulfill the needs of soldiers during the Korean War. Moreover, they worked to merge black and white USOs into one desegregated unit. As black historian Megan Shockley noted, &quot;Their work for the desegregation of USOs had begun during World War II, and it finally paid off.&quot;

Women were also key entertainers who performed at shows. Stars such as Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth had traveled over a million miles. Yellin notes that on one tour, Hayworth visited six camps, gave thousands of autographs, and &quot;came back from Texas with a full-fledged nervous breakdown from over-enthusiasm!&quot; Opera singer Lily Pons, after she had performed a &quot;serious&quot; opera song to troops in Burma, &quot;an applause erupted that stunned even the most seasoned performers.&quot; She later wrote in a letter, &quot;Every woman back home wears a halo now, and those who represent her had better keep theirs on, too.&quot;

Author Joeie Dee pointed out that &quot;for women entertainers, traveling with the USO made it possible to be patriots and adventurers as well as professionals.&quot; She adds, however, that the G.I.s in the USO audiences &quot;tended to see these women in a different light – as reminders of and even substitutes for their girls back home, as a reward for fighting the war, as embodiments of what they were fighting for.&quot; Edward Skvarna remembers 1943, when he met Donna Reed at a USO canteen and asked her to dance. &quot;I had never danced with a celebrity before, so I felt delighted, privileged even, to meet her. ... But I really felt she was like a girl from back home.&quot; Jay Fultz, author of a biography of Reed, states that soldiers &quot;often wrote to her as if to a sister or the girl next door, confiding moments of homesickness, loneliness, privation and anxiety.&quot;

Like much of American society and its World War II military, USOs were segregated. In Riverside, California a Negro USO was established to serve the March Field service population. Celebrities visiting this USO included Clarence Muse and the Mantan Moreland &amp; Ben Carter duo.

====Women entertainers====
One female entertainer wrote about conditions while performing:

Singer-actress-dancer Ann Miller described performing for badly wounded soldiers. She did forty-eight shows for &quot;broken soldiers,&quot; who were mostly lying on stretchers in the lobbies of hotels, watching as she entertained them. Yellin writes, &quot;During her last show she collapsed and had to be taken home on an Army airplane.&quot; Afterwards, Miller described the experience:

===Korean War===

In 1947, the USO was disbanded, due partly to lack of funds. In 1951, when the United States entered the Korean War, Secretary of Defense George Marshall and Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews requested that the USO be reactivated &quot;to provide support for the men and women of the armed forces with help of the American people.&quot; According to war historian Paul Edwards, between 1952 and 1953, not a day went by without the USO providing services somewhere in Korea. At home or overseas, in 1952 it was serving 3.5 million in the armed forces using much the same methods of operation as it did in World War II.

Many stars, both well-known and new, came to perform, including Bob Hope, Errol Flynn, Debbie Reynolds, Piper Laurie, Jane Russell, Paul Douglas, Terry Moore, Marilyn Monroe, Danny Kaye, Rory Calhoun, Mickey Rooney, Linda Coleman, Al Jolson, Pérez Prado, Evita Muñoz and many others. Jolson was the first to volunteer, but due to lack of USO funds traveled to Korea at his own expense (he was also the first to entertain troops during World War II).
Veterans have recalled many of the USOs events, sometimes in vivid detail:

Author Linda Granfield in describing the show, writes, &quot;For two hours, the men could forget they were soldiers at war. After the show, they returned to the fighting in the hills. Some in that audience never made it back.&quot; By the end of the war, over 113,000 American USO volunteers were working at 294 centers at home and abroad. And 126 units had given 5,422 performances to servicemen in Korea and the wounded in Japan.

===Vietnam War===
The USO was in Vietnam before the first combat troops arrived, with the first USO club opened in Saigon in April 1963. The 23 centers in Vietnam and Thailand served as many as a million service members a month, and the USO presented more than 5,000 performances during the Vietnam War featuring stars such as John Wayne, Ann-Margret, Sammy Davis Jr., Raymond Burr, Phyllis Diller, Martha Raye, Joey Heatherton, Wayne Newton, Jayne Mansfield, Redd Foxx, Rosey Grier, Anita Bryant, Nancy Sinatra, Jimmy Hawkins, Jimmy Boyd, Lola Falana, George Peppard and Bob Hope. Philip Ahn, the first actor of Korean descent to become a Hollywood star, became the first Asian American USO performer to entertain troops in Vietnam.

In addition, the USO operated centers at major U.S. airports to provide a lounge and place to sleep for American servicemen between their flights. Vietnam historian James Westheider noted that the USO &quot;tried to bring a little America to Vietnam.&quot; Volunteer American civilians, who did 18-month tours, staffed the clubs. According to Westheider, &quot;The young women wore miniskirts – no slacks were allowed.&quot; Each club had a snack bar, gift shops, a barbershop, photo developing, overseas phone lines, and hot showers.

When providing entertainment, the USO did its best to attract known stars from back home to help relieve the stresses of war. Senator John Kerry recalled how important this kind of diversion would become. He remembered a &quot;Bob Hope Follies&quot; USO show, which included actress Ann-Margret, Miss America, football star Rosey Grier, and others. According to Kerry biographer Douglas Brinkley, &quot;When the Swift finally made it back to the My Tho River, the crew confronted the heartbreaking sight of a huge Navy landing craft ferrying the troops back. The USO show was over.&quot; Kerry later wrote, &quot;The visions of Ann Margret and Miss America and all the other titillating personalities who would have made us feel so at home hung around us for a while until we saw three Chinook helicopters take off from the field and presumed that our dreams had gone with them.&quot;

But for GIs who saw the show, it was worth it: &quot;We turned to watch Ann perform, and for about two minutes of American beauty, the war was forgotten. Everyone fully understood just what was really worth fighting for. ... The show was fantastic, but the escape the Bob Hope tour provided us in expectation for days before, and after, helped us keep in touch with what we were there for – God, Country, apple pie ... and Ann-Margret!&quot;

The visits by the stars meant a lot to the men and women in Vietnam. &quot;It was not just the entertainment; it meant that they were not forgotten that far away from home,&quot; writes Westheider. He adds that the tours made a &quot;deep impression&quot; on the stars as well. Singer and actress Connie Stevens remembered her 1969 tour with Bob Hope, when she decided to go despite the fact she had two children both under the age of two. Today, she claims that &quot;veterans were still stopping her and thanking her for visiting Vietnam over 30 years later.&quot;

Similarly, Ann-Margret during a book signing was approached by a veteran who asked her to sign a photo he took of her performing in Vietnam. Although the book&#x27;s publishing representative for the signing event would not allow her to sign anything other than her book, the veteran&#x27;s wife recalls:

In November–December 1968 the Sig Sakowitz troop from Chicago performed over 36 shows in South Vietnam with the USO in: Pleiku, Dalat, Danang, Cam Ran Bay, Phu Bai, Phu Loy, Hue, Natrang, Tan Son Nhut Airbase, Saigon and places in the boonies known only to military intelligence and the lonely soldiers yearning for a taste of home. The troop consisted of Doublemint Twins Terrie and Jennie Frankel, Gaslight Club singer Sara Sue, Comedian Tony Diamond and personality Sig Sakowitz. Shows were also performed with comedian Joey Bishop of the Rat Pack.

George Peppard, successful star of stage, TV and motion pictures, arrived in Vietnam for a USO HANDSHAKE TOUR in 1970 to visit the military in the hospitals and out in the &quot;boonies.&quot;... He showed a keen interest in the men&#x27;s mission while they were hungry for news of life back in the &quot;World.&quot;... Polaroid pictures were taken by Mr. Peppard&#x27;s escort officer, autographed, and given to the men.
===Lebanese peacekeeping===
In 1983, a bloody civil war was raging in Lebanon. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a Multinational Force of peacekeepers composed largely of U.S., Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order. As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the United States Marine Corps and elements of the United States Sixth Fleet which operated out of the Mediterranean Sea.

Carrying on a tradition he had begun in World War II of spending Christmas with U.S. forces overseas, Bob Hope and his troupe of entertainers gave a show on board the battleship on December 24, 1983. Four hundred Marines stationed in Beirut attended the show.

===Italy===
American troops have been deployed in Italy since the end of World War II. In 1988, a car bomb targeted the USO club in Naples, which killed five people including a U.S. Navy officer.

===Gulf War===

To support troops participating in Operation Desert Shield, USO centers opened in Saudi Arabia. Entertainers performing for the troops included Bob Hope, Jay Leno, Steve Martin, Delta Burke, Ann Jillian, Gerald McRaney, Marie Osmond, the Pointer Sisters, country singer Gina James, and Bob Hope on his final USO tour.

===Afghanistan and Iraq===
To support troops participating in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, USO centers opened in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. USO centers number more than 160 around the world. In those years, the USO opened centers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Afghanistan. The USO provides a variety of programs and services, including orientation programs, family events, free Internet and e-mail access, free drinks and snacks, free phone calls home and recreation services. One of the newer programs, called &quot;USO in a Box,&quot; delivers program materials ranging from DVD players and videos to musical instruments to remote forward operating bases in Afghanistan.

U.S. military personnel and their families visit USO centers more than eight million times each year.
Bruce Willis visited Baghdad, Camp Kir Kush and Camp Caldwell, Iraq around December 2003. Mr. Willis visited military bases in Iraq during his visit in Iraq.

From June 8 to 11, 2009, TV personality Stephen Colbert traveled to Iraq to film his show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; for four days in a USO sponsored event.

Other entertainers who have traveled to the Middle East to perform include Al Franken (who made six USO tours in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan before being elected a United States Senator from Minnesota), Robin Williams, Craig Ferguson, Gary Sinise, Zac Brown, Five Finger Death Punch, Artie Lange, Gary Dell&#x27;Abate, Nick DiPaolo, Jim Florentine, Jim Norton, Dave Attell, Avenged Sevenfold, Jessica Simpson, Carrie Underwood, Drowning Pool, Toby Keith (with special guest Gina James), Montgomery Gentry, Kellie Pickler, Mayra Veronica, Carlos Mencia, O.A.R., Trace Adkins, Kathleen Madigan, Louis C.K., Dane Cook, Lewis Black, Third Day, Colin Quinn, Kathy Griffin, and Neil McCoy.

The USO has provided services for the annual &quot;Tribute to the Troops&quot; special of World Wrestling Entertainment. They have aired WWE RAW from Afghanistan and Iraq every Christmas in the United States in a pre-taped show from the combat zone.

== Services ==
The USO provides services to troops before, during, and after deployment through staffed and unstaffed USO centers inside and outside combat zones.

=== Operation Phone Home ===
USO centers in combat zones provide free phone calls home and internet access to service members through its private telephone network and high-speed internet.

=== Bob Hope Legacy Reading Program ===
The Bob Hope Legacy Reading program allows service members to record and send a video of themselves reading a book to their children at home.

=== USO Care Package Program ===
The organization sends toiletry and snack care packages to servicemen including travel-sized hygiene products of which 170,000 were shipped in 2019, healthy snacks, and drink mixes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization assembled thousands of care packages for troops in mandatory 14-day quarantine en-route home.

=== USO Special Delivery ===
The USO hosts baby showers for military parents-to-be. The baby showers allow pregnant military spouses to network and form a community while their spouses are deployed.

=== USO2GO ===
USO2GO is a service that provides customizable kits to military servicemen stationed in areas without a USO Center containing toiletries and snacks, furniture, electronics, and/or anything else they might need. Since 2008, the USO has shipped more than 2,000 kits to places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, and others.

=== Entertainment ===
The USO has hosted more than 8.1 million center celebrity visits across the world.

==Honoring Bob Hope==
In 1997, the U.S. Congress honored Bob Hope by declaring him the &quot;first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces.&quot; According to Hope biographer William Faith, his reputation has become ingrained in the &quot;American consciousness&quot; because he had flown millions of miles to entertain G.I.s during both wartime and peace. His contribution to the USO began in 1941 and ended with Operation Desert Shield in 1991, spending 48 Christmases overseas with American service personnel. He was always treated as &quot;an asset to the U.S. Government with his willingness to entertain whenever they needed him.&quot; After WWII was declared over, the USO had sent out an &quot;impassioned bulletin&quot; asking entertainers not to abandon the GIs now that the war was over. Hope was among the first to say yes. The Military Order of the Purple Heart notes that &quot;his contributions to the USO are well known: they are legend.&quot;

As a result of his non-stop entertainment to both the civilian population and the military, he received numerous other honors over the years: a C-17 Air Force plane was named &quot;The Spirit of Bob Hope&quot;; a naval vessel was named the USNS &quot;Bob Hope&quot;; and streets, schools, hospitals, and a golf tournament were also named in his honor. A Senate resolution declared him &quot;a part of American folklore.&quot; The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; called him the most honored entertainer ever. And during his 1993 televised birthday celebration, when he turned 90, General Colin Powell saluted Hope &quot;for his tireless USO trouping&quot;, which was followed by onstage tributes from all branches of the armed forces. General William Westmoreland spoke about his loyalty to the GI throughout the gritty Vietnam years. And bandleader Les Brown, who was with him during many of his tours, mentioned that his band &quot;had seen more of Hope&#x27;s ass in the last forty years than any of Hope&#x27;s immediate family.&quot;

War correspondent Quentin Reynolds wrote in 1943, &quot;He and his troupe would do 300 miles in a jeep, and give four shows ... One of the generals said Hope was a first rate military target since he was worth a division; that that&#x27;s about 15,000 men. Presumably the Nazis appreciated Hope&#x27;s value, since they thrice bombed towns while the comic was there.&quot;

During the Vietnam War, Hope produced a number of high-rated television specials and began to perceive that the U.S. media had given him a broad endorsement to continue on his work in Vietnam. Soon after his Christmas show in Saigon in 1967, he learned that the Viet Cong had planned to launch an attack at the hotel Hope&#x27;s troupe was staying at, missing them by ten minutes. According to Faith, he was later &quot;mystified and... increasingly intolerant of the pockets of dissent. Draft-card burnings on college campuses angered him&quot;. Hope wrote in a magazine article that &quot;Can you imagine, that people in America are burning their draft cards to show their opposition and that some of them are actually rooting for your defeat?&quot; In the spring of 1973, Hope began writing his fifth book, &quot;The Last Christmas Show&quot;, which was dedicated to &quot;the men and women of the armed forces and to those who also served by worrying and waiting.&quot; He signed over his royalties to the USO.

His final Christmas show was during Operation Desert Shield in 1990. The show was not easy, notes Faith. &quot;There were so many restrictions. Hope&#x27;s jokes were monitored by the State Department to avoid offending the Saudis ... and the media was restricted from covering the shows... Because in Saudi Arabia national custom prescribes that women must be veiled in public, Ann Jillian, Marie Osmond, and the Pointer Sisters were left off Hope&#x27;s Christmas Eve show.&quot;

In 2009, Stephen Colbert performing his last episode of weeklong taping in Iraq for his &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; show, carried a golf club on stage and dedicated it to Bob Hope&#x27;s service for the USO.

==Accountability==
The USO has a paid staff of approximately 800. Additionally, more than 44,000 USO volunteers provide an estimated 371,417 hours of service annually. As reported by the USO, the unpaid volunteer to paid employee ratio overseas is 20 to 1. Within the United States, the number is &quot;significantly higher.&quot;

<doc id="188308" wikidata="Q910088" url="?curid=188308" title="Dry (album)">
<text>Dry is the debut studio album by the English singer-songwriter PJ Harvey, released on 30 March 1992 by Too Pure. The album was recorded at The Icehouse, a local studio in Yeovil, England, and the tracks were performed by Harvey&#x27;s eponymous trio. The first 5000 LPs and first 1000 CDs included demo versions of the album&#x27;s tracks and &quot;Dry&quot; was subsequently released in the United States on Indigo Records. Both versions were released in 1992. &quot;Dry&quot; was reissued on vinyl and CD in July 2020: an 11-track companion album collecting all of the demos titled &quot;Dry – Demos&quot; was also released on vinyl as a stand-alone record.

== Background ==
Speaking to &quot;Filter&quot; magazine in 2004, Harvey said of her debut album: &quot;&quot;Dry&quot; is the first chance I ever had to make a record and I thought it would be my last. So, I put everything I had into it. It was a very extreme record. It was a great joy for me to be able to make it. I never thought I&#x27;d have that opportunity, so I felt like I had to get everything on it as well as I possibly could, because it was probably my only chance. It felt very extreme for that reason.&quot;

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===

Upon its release &quot;Dry&quot; received critical acclaim. In a nine-out-of-ten review for &quot;NME&quot;, critic Andrew Collins called the album a collection of &quot;clever, repetitive, low-slung guitar poems&quot; and said &quot;Polly dredges these sounds from the pit of her dissected soul and drags them out of her mouth with clenched fists.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reviewer Greg Kot referred to &quot;Dry&quot; as &quot;jagged, lacerating and sexy in a disorienting sort of way&quot; and likened the album to &quot;Broken English&quot; (1979) by Marianne Faithfull and &quot;Horses&quot; (1975) by Patti Smith; Kot awarded the album three-and-a-half-out-of-four stars, further stating &quot;the best band out of the U.K. at the moment isn&#x27;t another My Bloody Valentine guitar clone&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Bill Wyman described &quot;Dry&quot; as a &quot;scorching portrait of the dark side of the female psyche&quot; and an &quot;uncompromising work of exhilarating, cauterizing beauty&quot;, awarding it an A+ rating. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Robert Hilburn gave &quot;Dry&quot; a three-and-a-half-out-of-four-star rating, writing that it &quot;falls somewhere in between … an instant classic [and] a seductive calling card that signals the arrival of an extraordinary new artist.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; column described &quot;Dry&quot; as a &quot;cloudy but essential feminist distinction between egoist bullroar and honest irrational outpouring&quot;, rating the album an A−.

Retrospective reviews of &quot;Dry&quot; have also been largely positive. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine summarised the album as &quot;a forceful collection of brutally emotional songs, highlighted by Harvey&#x27;s deft lyricism and startling voice, as well as her trio&#x27;s muscular sound&quot; in a four-and-a-half-out-of-five-star review. Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Laura Snapes said &quot;Dry&quot; &quot;is a volcano and the scorched earth surrounding it, ripped with landsliding guitars, cowpunk mania, twisted blues, profound extremes, and power chords that hit like boulders dropped from on high.&quot; The fourth edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, published in 2004, awarded the album a three-and-a-half-out-of-five-star rating, with Christian Hoard writing that its songs equalled &quot;anything the hair-flailing grunge boys could deliver.&quot;

=== Commercial performance ===
&quot;Dry&quot; peaked on the UK Albums Chart at number 11, remaining on the chart for a total of five weeks. A month prior to the album&#x27;s release, its second single, &quot;Sheela-Na-Gig&quot;, had peaked at number 69 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite &quot;Dry&quot;″s critical success in the United States the album did not chart on any mainstream or independent &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, however, &quot;Sheela-Na-Gig&quot; peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in September 1992.

&quot;Dry&quot; was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in March 2005 after shipments of 60,000 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold 176,000 copies in the US as of December 2005.

=== Accolades ===
In 1992 &quot;Dry&quot; was featured in several publications&#x27; year-end best-of lists. It placed at number 12 in &quot;Select&quot;″s list of the best albums of the year, number 18 in &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;20 Best Albums of 1992&quot; list, and was also featured in &quot;Q&quot;″s &quot;Recordings of the Year&quot; feature.

&quot;Dry&quot; has since been featured on several best-of-all-time lists. It was ranked number 70 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Best Debut Albums of All Time&quot; and number 151 on &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Dry&quot; is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="188315" wikidata="Q1049357" url="?curid=188315" title="Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea">
<text>Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is the fifth studio album by the English singer-songwriter PJ Harvey, released on 23 October 2000 by Island Records. Recorded during March to April 2000, it contains themes of love that are tied into Harvey&#x27;s affection for New York City.

The album became the second major commercial success of her recording career, following her successful breakthrough &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; (1995). Upon its release, the album received acclaim from most music critics and earned Harvey several accolades, including the 2001 Mercury Prize. It spent 17 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, and has been certified Platinum in the United Kingdom and Australia. It is generally regarded as one of her best works.

== Background and music ==
In 1998, while shooting a film as an actress for Hal Hartley in New York, she felt inspired by the city and wrote several songs. Some of them ended up on the record. In 1999, she chose to live there for nine months. However, she insisted in interviews it was not &quot;my New York album&quot;. Songs were also written while she was in London or at home in Dorset. &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; was then recorded at Linford Manor in Milton Keynes in March – April 2000. The record was co-produced by Mick Harvey, Rob Ellis and Harvey, and mixed by Victor Van Vugt at the Fallout Shelter. The album featured a duet with Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on the track &quot;This Mess We&#x27;re In&quot;, as well as backing vocals and keyboards from Yorke on the songs &quot;One Line&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot;. She had met Yorke in 1992 and they had stayed in contact. She said: &quot;I&#x27;d long been interested in the idea of somebody else singing a whole song on a record of mine, to have a very different dimension brought in by somebody else&#x27;s voice. It adds so much dynamic within the record to have this other character coming in&quot;.

She wanted the record to be more direct: &quot;It&#x27;s very different musically to the first couple of albums. It&#x27;s very melodic, and it&#x27;s much rounder and fuller. The earlier albums were very black and white in some sense, very extreme. Melodically, this is much more sophisticated than those records. It kind of feels like a combination of every album I&#x27;ve made so far rolled into one.&quot; The songs were also a musical departure from her previous dark material. Harvey told &quot;Q&quot; in 2001, &quot;I wanted everything to sound as beautiful as possible. Having experimented with some dreadful sounds on &quot;Is This Desire?&quot; and &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;—where I was really looking for dark, unsettling, nauseous-making sounds—&quot;Stories from the City...&quot; was the reaction. I thought, No, I want absolute beauty. I want this album to sing and fly and be full of reverb and lush layers of melody. I want it to be my beautiful, sumptuous, lovely piece of work.&quot; She did, however, concede jokingly that it was only &quot;pop according to PJ Harvey, which is probably as un-pop as you can get according to most people&#x27;s standards.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; compared her voice on the lead single &quot;Good Fortune&quot; to that of the Pretenders&#x27;s Chrissie Hynde, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; observed: &quot;Her singing often recalls Patti Smith and Siouxsie Sioux, artists who, like Harvey, project a sexuality derived from—yet never bound by—rock&#x27;s male sensibilities.&quot;

== Release and commercial performance ==
The album was released on 24 October 2000, and promoted with a video for the lead single &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, shot at night in streets of London. It reached number 23 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was certified Platinum in the UK, with sales over 300,000 copies. The album debuted at number 42 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. As of 2003, it has sold 357,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. It has also been certified Gold in France, and has sold 1 million copies worldwide.

The album was reissued on vinyl in February 2021 as part of a comprehensive reissue campaign of Harvey&#x27;s back catalogue. A collection of unreleased demos, titled &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea – Demos&quot;, was also released.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 25 reviews. &quot;NME&quot; hailed it as &quot;a magnificent, life-affirming opus&quot; by Harvey. Robert Christgau called it &quot;the best album of her career&quot; in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Other critics rated it as only average. Spencer Owen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; viewed the album as lacking in distinction, saying &quot;the sheen gets slicker and her music gets duller&quot;. The publication later, however, ranked it at number 124 in their &quot;The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s&quot; list in 2009. In 2021, they included it in their &quot;Rescored&quot; list, saying that they wished to change their original score of 5.4 to an 8.4.

=== Accolades ===
The album earned Harvey Brit Award nominations as Best British Female Artist for two years running, as well as two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the single &quot;This Is Love&quot;.

For the album, Harvey was nominated for the 2001 Mercury Prize for the third time (her previous nominations were for &quot;Rid of Me&quot; and &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;). The award ceremony was held on 11 September 2001. Harvey was in Washington, D.C., on that day and witnessed the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon from her hotel room window. She was announced as the winner and accepted her award by phone, saying &quot;It has been a very surreal day. All I can say is thank you very much, I am absolutely stunned.&quot; The win made Harvey the first female solo artist to receive the Mercury Prize in the award&#x27;s history.

The album was ranked number eight on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 50 Essential &quot;Women in rock&quot; Albums. In 2002, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea&quot; the Greatest Album of All-Time by a Female Artist. In 2006, the album was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named the album the 124th Top Album of the 2000s. In 2009, &quot;NME&quot; also placed the album inside their Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade, at number six. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the thirty-fifth best album of the decade. In 2019, the album was ranked 19th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s 100 Best Albums of the 21st Century list. In the 2012 version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was ranked at number 431, then in the 2020 update, it was moved up to number 313.

<doc id="188320" wikidata="Q620958" url="?curid=188320" title="Penis enlargement">
<text>Penis enlargement, or male enhancement, is any technique aimed to increase the size of a human penis. Some methods aim to increase total length, others the shaft&#x27;s girth, and yet others the glans and foreskin size. Techniques include surgery, supplements, ointments, patches, and physical methods like pumping, jelqing, and traction.

Surgical penis enlargement methods can be effective; however, such methods carry risks of complications and are not medically indicated except in cases involving a micropenis. Non-invasive methods have received little scientific study, and most lack scientific evidence of effectiveness. However, limited scientific evidence supports some elongation by prolonged traction. Some quack products may improve penis erection, mistaken by consumers for penis enlargement.

== Surgical methods ==

There are several surgical penis enlargement treatments, most of which carry a risk of significant complications. Procedures by unlicensed surgeons can lead to serious complications.

Surgical penis enlargement methods include penile augmentation and suspensory ligament release. Penile augmentation involves injecting fat cells into the penis or grafting fat cells onto the penis. Injecting fat cells into the penis can cause swelling and deformity; in some instances, removal of the penis may be necessary. Grafting fat cells onto the penis can be effective; however, the increase in size may disappear over time. Suspensory ligament release increases flaccid penis length, but does not increase the length of an erect penis and can create problems with sexual function.

The American Urological Association (AUA) and the Urology Care Foundation &quot;consider subcutaneous fat injection for increasing penile girth to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious. The AUA also considers the division of the suspensory ligament of the penis for increasing penile length in adults to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious.&quot; Both statements were first published in January 1994 and re-affirmed ever since. Complications from penis enlargement procedures include scarring that may lead, ultimately, to penis shrinkage or erectile dysfunction.

Other surgical treatments include the injection of dermal fillers, silicone gel, or PMMA. Dermal fillers are also not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the penis. Injectables such as hyaluronic acid and polyactic acid have shown some limited efficacy, however the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) &quot;strongly recommends against&quot; permanent fillers such as paraffins and silicone.

Because of great risk and uncertainty, medical professionals are generally skeptical of penile enlargement and avoid attempting it. A 2019 study in &quot;Sexual Medicine Reviews&quot; found that surgical methods of penis enlargement are typically ineffective and can be damaging to both physical and mental health. The authors found that such treatments are &quot;&#x27;supported by scant, low-quality evidence... Injectables and surgery should remain a last option, considered unethical outside of clinical trials&#x27;&quot;. According to the study, &quot;&#x27;overall treatment outcomes were poor, with low satisfaction rates and significant risk of major complications, including penile deformity, shortening, and erectile dysfunction&#x27;&quot;.

Medical doctors do treat micropenis with surgical procedures. In such cases, surgery can improve urinary or sexual function.

== Supplements ==
Penis-enlargement pills, patches, and ointments are sold online. Such products are generally considered ineffective.

== Physical techniques ==
Physical techniques involve extension devices, hanging weights, and vacuum pressure. There is also significant overlap between techniques intended to enlarge the penis and techniques intended to achieve other, related objectives, such as reversing impotence, extending the duration of erections, or enhancing sexual climax.

=== Pumping ===

Commonly called a &quot;penis pump&quot;, a vacuum erection device, or VED, creates negative pressure that expands and thereby draws blood into the penis. Medically approved VEDs, which treat erectile dysfunction, limit maximum pressure, whereas the pumps commonly bought by consumers seeking penis enlargement can reach dangerous pressure, damaging penis tissue. To retain tumescence after breaking the device&#x27;s airtight seal, one must constrict the penis&#x27; base, but constriction worn over 30 minutes can permanently damage the penis and cause erectile dysfunction. Although vacuum therapy can treat erectile dysfunction sufficiently to prevent penis deterioration and shrinkage, clinical trials have not found it effective for penis enlargement.

=== Jelqing ===
The latinized name &quot;jelqing&quot; is the corrupt form derived from the Persian &quot;jalq zadan&quot; (جلق زدن), &quot;jalq&quot; meaning &quot;to masturbate&quot; followed by an auxiliary verb &quot;zadan&quot; meaning &quot;to strike, hit or throb&quot;. Performed on the halfway tumescent penis, jelqing is a manual manipulation of simultaneous squeezing and stroking the shaft from base to corona. Also called &quot;milking&quot;, the technique has ancient Arab origins. Despite many anecdotal reports of success, medical evidence is absent. Journalists have dismissed the method as biologically implausible, or even impossible. Some clinicians caution against the routine use of jelqing techniques, including excessive or aggressive manipulations of the penis, due to concerns of potential fibrosis and plaque formation. Jelqing may increase the risk of developing hard flaccid syndrome, a condition characterized by a flaccid penis that remains in a firm, semi-rigid state in the absence of sexual arousal.

=== Traction ===
Traction is a nonsurgical method to lengthen the penis by employing devices that pull at the glans of the penis for extended periods of time. As of 2013, the majority of research investigating the use of penile traction focuses on treating the curvature and shrinkage of the penis as a result of Peyronie&#x27;s disease, although some literature exists on the effects on men with short penises.

Scientific evidence supports some elongation by prolonged traction. There are also medical studies that indicate that the lengthening effects can be negligible.

==Society and culture ==
Some doctors say that most men seeking penis enlargement have normal-sized penises, and many may experience &quot;penile dysmorphophobia&quot; by underestimating their own penis size while overestimating the average penis size.

Products purported to enlarge one&#x27;s penis were frequently promoted via spam email in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2003, a log file from an e-commerce site used by one such spammer was accidentally exposed on the public Internet. It showed that they received around 6,000 orders for their herbal supplement product &quot;Pinacle&quot; in a period of four weeks, with most orders being for $100 worth of product. The US Federal Trade Commission said at the time that &quot;there is no proof the pills work as advertised&quot;.

In 2013 in Vietnam, many Vietnamese men attempted to enlarge their penises by injecting liquid silicone into them. They were hospitalized for complications such as infections, necrosis, tumors, swelling, deformities, and sexual dysfunction.

<doc id="188321" wikidata="Q446294" url="?curid=188321" title="Hal Hartley">
<text>Hal Hartley (born November 3, 1959) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and composer who became a key figure in the American independent film movement of the 1980s and &#x27;90s. His films include &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; (1989), &quot;Trust&quot; (1990), &quot;Simple Men&quot; (1992), &quot;Amateur&quot; (1994) and &quot;Henry Fool&quot; (1997), which are notable for deadpan humour and offbeat characters quoting philosophical dialogue. Hartley frequently scores his own films, sometimes under the pseudonym Ned Rifle, and his soundtracks regularly feature music by Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo and PJ Harvey.

His films provided a career launch for a number of actors, including Adrienne Shelly, Edie Falco, James Urbaniak, Martin Donovan, Karen Sillas and Elina Löwensohn.

==Early life==
Hartley was born in Lindenhurst, New York, the son of an ironworker. Hartley had an early interest in painting and attended the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, where he studied art and developed an interest in filmmaking. In 1980, he was accepted to the filmmaking program at the State University of New York at Purchase in New York, where he met a core group of technicians and actors who would go on to work with him on his feature films, including his regular cinematographer Michael Spiller.

==Early feature films==
Hartley shot &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; in 1988. Made on a shoestring budget and filmed in his native Long Island, it was an unconventional love story about a suburban Long Island teenager (played by Adrienne Shelly, a soon-to-be Hartley regular) falling in love with a handsome mechanic with a criminal past (Robert John Burke, also a soon-to-be Hartley regular). The screenplay featured what have become Hartley&#x27;s trademarks – deadpan humour, offbeat, stilted, pause-filled dialogue, and characters posing philosophical questions about the meaning of life, combined with a degree of stylization in acting, choreography and camera movement. The film received positive reviews and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1990 Sundance Film Festival.

&quot;Trust&quot; (1990) followed similar themes and style to &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot;, again an offbeat romantic comedy starring Adrienne Shelly as a Long Island teenager who forms a complex romantic relationship with a mysterious computer repairman (played by Martin Donovan, another Hartley regular). &quot;Trust&quot; won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival. Hartley followed this with the short feature &quot;Surviving Desire&quot; (1991), a romantic comedy about a college professor (Donovan) who has an affair with a student (Mary B. Ward). &quot;Simple Men&quot; (1992), a drama about two brothers (played by Burke and Bill Sage) who reunite to search for their anarchist father and encounter two women in a small town (Karen Sillas and Elina Löwensohn), was entered in competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;Amateur&quot; (1994) marked a change of pace for Hartley, exploring somber themes. Described as &quot;a metaphysical thriller&quot;, it starred Isabelle Huppert as a former nun trying to write pornographic fiction who meets Thomas (Martin Donovan), a man suffering from amnesia, and Sophia (Elina Löwensohn), Thomas&#x27;s wife and a porn star, who reveals that Thomas was a violent criminal and pornographer.

Hartley developed &quot;Flirt&quot; (1995) as an extension of his short film of the same name made in 1993. The film is a triptych of three separate characters involved in romantic entanglements in different cities – New York, Berlin and Tokyo – with each story using the same dialogue. The film stars Hartley regulars Bill Sage, Parker Posey, Martin Donovan, Dwight Ewell and the Japanese actress Miho Nikaido, whom Hartley married in 1996.

==Later works==
Hartley achieved his greatest commercial and critical success with &quot;Henry Fool&quot; (1997), a comic drama about a near-catatonic garbageman Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and his sister Fay (Parker Posey), who meet Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), a libertine and aspiring novelist who inspires Simon to write and seduces Fay and her depressed mother (Maria Porter). The film garnered positive reviews, and it was entered into competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, where Hartley won the Best Screenplay Award.

Hartley was invited to contribute the American entry to 2000, Seen By... a series of films financed by French television to celebrate the 2000 millennium. His entry, a black comedy titled &quot;The Book of Life&quot; (1998) was shot entirely on digital video in New York City in 1998. According to the film summary &quot;[t]he end of the millenium has taken on a certain significance in modern day prophecies&quot;, and Hartley&#x27;s The Book of Life considers a scenario where Jesus Christ has second thoughts about the Apocalypse and argues with the Devil. The dialogue-heavy plot is driven the two along with Christ&#x27;s assistant Magdelene, debating the end of the world, and the possibility of human redemption; The story imagines Jesus (Martin Donovan) returning to Earth on the eve of the 2000 millennium to open the Book of Life (the Seven Seals stored on an Apple Mac laptop), which will start the Apocalypse. English alt-rocker PJ Harvey stars as herself, the ethereal Magdalene. Some sources state that William Burroughs is featured, but according to Hartley, this is actually a shot of the film&#x27;s production manager doing a Burroughs impression (Burroughs had actually died the previous year). The film screened on French television and had a limited commercial release in cinemas.

Hartley&#x27;s next feature &quot;No Such Thing&quot; (2001) tells the story of Beatrice (Sarah Polley), a journalist whose fiancé is killed by a monster in Iceland. Beatrice&#x27;s editor (Helen Mirren) orders Beatrice to go to Iceland to interview the monster (Robert John Burke), who is a sensitive philosopher. The film also stars Julie Christie as a doctor sympathetic to the monster&#x27;s cause. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;The Girl from Monday&quot; (2005), filmed in New York City and Puerto Rico, is set in a future dystopia where people are encouraged to record their sexual encounters as an economic transaction and thus increase their consumer buying power. The film stars Bill Sage, Sabrina Lloyd and Tatiana Abracos. It premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and received a limited cinematic release, receiving mostly negative reviews.

In late 2005, Hartley moved from New York to Berlin and began preparing &quot;Fay Grim&quot;, an intended sequel to &quot;Henry Fool&quot;. The film, which starred Parker Posey, James Urbaniak and Thomas Jay Ryan reprising their roles from &quot;Henry Fool&quot;, was a comedy-drama in which Fay is coerced by a CIA agent (Jeff Goldblum) to try to locate notebooks that belonged to Henry (now a fugitive). The film was shot in 2006 in locations in Berlin, Paris, and Istanbul and premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. It had a limited cinematic release in 2007 and received mixed reviews.

Since 1999, Hartley&#x27;s films predominantly have been shot with digital cameras, including the features &quot;The Book of Life&quot;, &quot;The Girl from Monday&quot;, &quot;Fay Grim&quot; and &quot;Meanwhile&quot; (2011), in addition to his short films. His digital aesthetic is significantly different from that seen in the 1990s, and his films shot by Michael Spiller on 35mm film, which exhibit blurring of the image (due to a very low shutter speed), the use of freeze frames, and shifts between colour and black-and-white footage, also display a considerable divergence from the washed-out colours and straightforward cinematography of the Long Island films from the early 1990s. &quot;Meanwhile&quot; received its world premiere at the Camerimage festival in Bydgoszcz, Poland on 29 November 2011. The hour-long feature was released on DVD in 2012 following a successful funding campaign by Hartley using the Kickstarter website.

In November 2013, Hartley funded &quot;Ned Rifle&quot;, the third film in the trilogy that began with &quot;Henry Fool&quot; and &quot;Fay Grim&quot;, via a Kickstarter campaign. The film premiered on September 7, 2014, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.

From 2015 to 2017, Hartley directed eight episodes of &quot;Red Oaks&quot;.

==Short films==
In addition to his feature work, Hartley has made a number of short films, many of which have been collected and re-released in DVD anthologies.

==Theatre==
Hartley&#x27;s stage play &quot;Soon&quot;, a drama dealing with the confrontation at Waco, Texas, between the religious community known as the Branch Davidians and the U.S. federal government, was first produced at the Salzburg Festival and then later that year in Antwerp. It was also staged in the U.S. in 2001.

==Awards==
In 1996, Hartley was made Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French Republic.

From 2001 through 2004, Hartley was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University while simultaneously editing &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, shooting &quot;The Girl from Monday&quot; and writing &quot;Fay Grim&quot;.

Hartley was awarded a fellowship by The American Academy in Berlin in late 2004, where he did research related to a proposed large-scale project concerning the life of French educator and social activist Simone Weil.

<text>Lester Franklin Melrose (December 14, 1891 – April 12, 1968) was a talent scout who was one of the first American producers of Chicago blues records.

==Career==
Lester Franklin Melrose was born in Sumner, Illinois, the second of six children of Frank and Mollie Melrose, who owned a small farm. He relocated to Chicago around 1914 and tried out unsuccessfully as a catcher for the Chicago White Sox baseball team before starting work as a grocery salesman.

In 1918 (though some sources state 1922), he joined forces with his elder brother Walter and Marty Bloom (born Martin Blumenthal, 1893-1974) to form the &quot;Melrose Brothers Music Company&quot;, a publishing house and music store on the South Side of Chicago. In May 1923, he met Jelly Roll Morton at the store, and Morton became the company&#x27;s chief songwriter and arranger. By the end of 1923, Walter Melrose moved the music publishing business downtown, while Lester continued for a while to operate the music store with a new partner.

In 1925, Lester Melrose sold his share of the store and became a freelance A&amp;R man, combining the roles of talent scout and record producer. He started to promote many blues artists who became popular, recording them mainly in Chicago.

He worked for several record labels simultaneously in the 1930s, including RCA Victor and its subsidiary Bluebird. He also worked for Columbia and its Okeh subsidiary. Among the artists he recorded and brought to the world&#x27;s attention were Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Boy Williamson, Memphis Minnie, Roosevelt Sykes,Memphis Slim, Lonnie Johnson, Big Joe Williams, Bukka White, Washboard Sam, Champion Jack Dupree, Jazz Gillum, Arthur Crudup, Victoria Spivey and Leroy Carr.

In many ways Melrose can be considered a founder of the Chicago blues, although he favored acoustic over electric performances. Most of his recordings were made with a small group of session musicians and had a similar sound overall. Muddy Waters, who was rejected when he auditioned for Melrose, called it &quot;sweet jazz&quot;. The music was a mixture of black blues and vaudeville styles and material with newer swing rhythms. Melrose&#x27;s chief contribution was to establish a sound with full band arrangements, ensemble playing and a rhythm section, which appealed to the increasingly urbanised black record-buying audience and prefigured the electric blues and R&amp;B of the late 1940s and the small group sound that became dominant in rock and roll.

The Melrose sound dominated Chicago blues before World War II, but the arrival of large numbers of Southern African Americans in Chicago during and after the war brought Melrose&#x27;s dominance to an end as a harder, deeper blues sound proved more popular with the new audience. However, Melrose continued to work into the 1950s. He then retired to Lake, Florida, and died there in April 1968.

Although he could not play or sing a note of music, he owned the copyright to over three thousand songs, mostly blues. As was the widespread custom at the time (and not just in blues music), Melrose often assigned composer credit and performance rights of the artists&#x27; songs to himself, paying the artists only for the recording session. His name appeared on &quot;Reefer Head Woman&quot;, recorded by Jazz Gillum, and featuring 16-year-old electric guitarist George Barnes (the song was later recorded by Aerosmith), and &quot;Me and My Chauffeur&quot;, recorded by Memphis Minnie (and later by Jefferson Airplane). His name also appeared on three Arthur Crudup songs recorded by Elvis Presley.

Melrose is a member of the Blues Hall of Fame.

==Family members==
His older brother Walter Melrose (1889 – 1973) was a music publisher who received songwriter credit for several songs identified with the Original Dixieland Jass Band, including the standards &quot;High Society&quot; and &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;, both of which were hits as late as the 1950s.

A third brother, Franklyn Melrose (1907 – 1941), was a jazz pianist who also used stage names of Kansas City Frank and Broadway Rastus. He died after a fracas/fight in a club.

<doc id="188325" wikidata="Q9385" url="?curid=188325" title="Ureter">
<text>The ureters are tubes composed of smooth muscle that transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. In an adult human, the ureters typically measure 20 to 30 centimeters in length and about 3 to 4 millimeters in diameter. They are lined with urothelial cells, a form of transitional epithelium, and feature an extra layer of smooth muscle in the lower third to aid in peristalsis.
The ureters can be affected by a number of diseases, including urinary tract infections and kidney stone. is when a ureter is narrowed, due to for example chronic inflammation. Congenital abnormalities that affect the ureters can include the development of two ureters on the same side or abnormally placed ureters. Additionally, reflux of urine from the bladder back up the ureters is a condition commonly seen in children.

The ureters have been identified for at least two thousand years, with the word &quot;ureter&quot; stemming from the stem relating to urinating and seen in written records since at least the time of Hippocrates. It is, however, only since the 1500s that the term &quot;ureter&quot; has been consistently used to refer to the modern structure, and only since the development of medical imaging in the 1900s that techniques such as X-ray, CT, and ultrasound have been able to view the ureters. The ureters are also seen from the inside using a flexible camera, called ureteroscopy, which was first described in 1964.

==Structure==

The ureters are tubular structures, approximately in adults, that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder. From the renal pelvis, they descend on top of the psoas major muscle to reach the brim of the pelvis. Here, they cross in front of the common iliac arteries. They then pass down along the sides of the pelvis and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides at the back of the bladder. The ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder. 

The ureters enter the bladder from its back surface, traveling before opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like &quot;ureteric orifices&quot;. This location is also called the vesicoureteric junction. In the contracted bladder, they are about apart and about the same distance from the internal urethral orifice; in the distended bladder, these measurements may be increased to about .

A number of structures pass by, above, and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder. In its upper part, the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle and sits just behind the peritoneum. As it passes down the muscle, it travels over the genitofemoral nerve. The inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta sit to the midline of the right and left ureters, respectively. In the lower part of the abdomen, the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the terminal ileum, and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon. As the ureters enter the pelvis, they are surrounded by connective tissue, and travel backward and outward, passing in front of the internal iliac arteries and internal iliac veins. They then travel inward and forward, crossing the umbilical, inferior vesical, and middle rectal arteries. From here, in males, they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter the bladder near the trigone. In females, the ureters pass behind the ovaries and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus. For a short part, the uterine arteries travel on top for a short () period. They then pass by the cervix, traveling inward towards the bladder. 

===Blood and lymphatic supply===
The arteries which supply the ureter vary along its course. The upper third of the ureter, closest to the kidney, is supplied by the renal arteries. The middle part of the ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries, direct branches from the abdominal aorta, and gonadal arteries; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery in men and the ovarian artery in women. The lower third of the ureter, closest to the bladder, is supplied by branches from the internal iliac arteries, mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries. The arterial supply can be variable, with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery, branches directly from the aorta, and, in women, the uterine and vaginal arteries.

The arteries that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of the ureters. There are many connections () between the arteries of the ureter, particularly in the adventitia, which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter. Venous drainage mostly parallels that of the arterial supply; that is, it begins as a network of smaller veins in the adventitia; with the renal veins draining the upper ureters, and the vesicular and gonadal veins draining the lower ureters.

Lymphatic drainage depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter. Lymph collects in submucosal, intramuscular and adventitial lymphatic vessels. Those vessels closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels, and from here into the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels. The middle part of the ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right, and the left paraaortic nodes on the left. In the lower ureter, lymph may drain into the common iliac lymph nodes, or lower down in the pelvis to the common, external, or internal iliac lymph nodes.

===Nerve supply===
The ureters are richly supplied by nerves that form a network () of nerves, the ureteric plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters. This plexus is formed from a number of nerve roots directly (T9–12, L1, and S2-4), as well as branches from other nerve plexuses and nerves; specifically, the upper third of the ureter receives nerve branches from the renal plexus and aortic plexus, the middle part receives branches from the upper hypogastric plexus and nerve, and the lower ureter receives branches from the lower hypogastric plexus and nerve. The plexus is in the adventitia. These nerves travel in individual bundles and along small blood vessels to form the ureteric plexus. Sensation supplied is sparse close to the kidneys and increases closer to the bladder.

Sensation to the ureters is provided by nerves that come from T11 – L2 segments of the spinal cord. When pain is caused, for example by spasm of the ureters or by a stone, the pain may be referred to the dermatomes of T11 – L2, namely the back and sides of the abdomen, the scrotum (males) or labia majora (females) and upper part of the front of the thigh.

===Microanatomy===

The ureter is lined by urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium that is capable of responding to stretches in the ureters. The transitional epithelium may appear as a layer of column-shaped cells when relaxed, and of flatter cells when distended. Below the epithelium sits the lamina propria. The lamina propria is made up of loose connective tissue with many elastic fibers interspersed with blood vessels, veins and lymphatics. The ureter is surrounded by two muscular layers, an inner longitudinal layer of muscle, and an outer circular or spiral layer of muscle. The lower third of the ureter has a third muscular layer. Beyond these layers sits an adventitia containing blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and veins.
===Development===
The ureters develop from the ureteric buds, which are outpouchings from the mesonephric duct. This is a duct, derived from mesoderm, found in the early embryo. Over time, the buds elongate, moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue, dilate, and divide into left and right ureters. Eventually, successive divisions from these buds form not only the ureters, but also the pelvis, major and minor calyces, and collecting ducts of the kidneys.

The mesonephric duct is connected with the cloaca, which over the course of development splits into a urogenital sinus and the anorectal canal. The urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus. Over time, as the bladder enlarges, it absorbs the surrounding parts of the primitive ureters. Finally, the entry points of the ureters into the bladder move upwards, owing to the upward migration of the kidneys in the developing embryo.

==Function==
The ureters are a component of the urinary system. Urine, produced by the kidneys, travels along the ureters to the bladder. It does this through regular contractions called peristalsis.

==Clinical significance==
===Ureteral stones===

A kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine, as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. Pain often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic. The affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. It is classically described that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become stuck:
where the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood vessels cross.

Most stones are compounds containing calcium such as calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. The first recommended investigation is a CT scan of the abdomen because it can detect almost all stones. Management includes analgesia, often with nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. Small stones (&lt; 4mm) may pass themselves; larger stones may require lithotripsy, and those with complications such as hydronephrosis or infection may require surgery to remove.

===Reflux===
Vesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into the ureters. This condition can be associated with urinary tract infections, particularly in children, and is present in up to 28–36% of children to some degree. A number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis of the condition, with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound.Factors that affect which of these are selected depends if a child is able to receive a urinary catheter, and whether a child is toilet trained. Whether these investigations are performed at the first time a child has an illness, or later and depending on other factors (such as if the causal bacteria is &quot;E. coli&quot;) differ between US, EU and UK guidelines.

Management is also variable, with differences between international guidelines on issues such as whether prophylactic antibiotics should be used, and whether surgery is recommended. One reason is most instances of vesicoureteral reflux improve by themselves. If surgery is considered, it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder, and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder, with the most common surgical option being Cohen&#x27;s cross-trigonal reimplantation.

===Anatomical and surgical abnormalities===
Blockage, or obstruction of the ureter can occur, as a result of narrowing within the ureter, or compression or fibrosis of structures around the ureter. Narrowing can result of ureteric stones, masses associated with cancer, and other lesions such as endometriosis tuberculosis and schistosomiasis. Things outside the ureters such as constipation and retroperitoneal fibrosis can also compress them. Some congenital abnormalities can also result in narrowing or the ureters. Congenital disorders of the ureter and urinary tract affect 10% of infants. These include partial or total duplication of the ureter (a duplex ureter), or the formation of a second irregularly placed () ureter; or where the junction with the bladder is malformed or a ureterocoele develops (usually in that location). If the ureters have been resited as a result of surgery, for example due to a kidney transplant or due to past surgery for vesicoureteric reflux, that site may also become narrowed.

A narrowed ureter may lead to ureteric enlargement () and cause swelling of the kidneys (hydronephrosis). Associated symptoms may include recurrent infections, pain or blood in the urine; and when tested, kidney function might be seen to decrease. These are considered situations when surgery is needed. Medical imaging, including urinary tract ultrasound, CT or nuclear medicine imaging is conducted to investigate many causes. This may involve reinserting the ureters into a new place on the bladder (reimplantion), or widening of the ureter. A ureteric stent may be inserted to relieve an obstruction. If the cause cannot be removed, a nephrostomy may be required, which is the insertion of a tube connected to the renal pelvis which directly drains urine into a stoma bag.

===Cancer===
Cancer of the ureters is known as ureteral cancer. It is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface of the ureters. Urothelial cancer is more common after the age of 40, and more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. When cancer is present, the most common symptom is blood in the urine; it may not cause symptoms, and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except in late disease. Ureteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.

Investigations performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging by a CT urogram or ultrasound. If a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible camera may be inserted into the ureters, called ureteroscopy, in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional lesions. After the cancer is staged, treatment may involve open surgery to remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved; or, if the lesion is small, it may be removed via ureteroscopy. Prognosis can vary markedly depending on the tumour grade, with a worse prognosis associated with an ulcerating lesion.

===Injury===
Injuries to the ureter can occur after penetrating abdominal injuries, and injuries at high speeds followed by an abrupt stop (such as a high speed car accident). The ureter can be injured during surgery to nearby structures. It is injured in 2 per 10,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomies and 13 per 10,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomies, usually near the suspensory ligament of the ovary or near the cardinal ligament, where the ureter runs close to the blood vessels of the uterus.

===Imaging===
Several forms of medical imaging are used to view the ureters and urinary tract. Ultrasound may be able to show evidence of blockage because of hydronephrosis of the kidneys and renal pelvis. CT scans, including ones where contrast media is injected intravenously to better show the ureters, and with contrast to better show lesions, and to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. Dye may also be injected directly into the ureters or renal tract; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast is injected directly into the renal pelvis, and a retrograde pyelogram is where dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter, and flows backwards into the ureters. More invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy, which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters. Ureteroscopy is most commonly used for medium to large-sized stones when less invasive methods of removal cannot be used.

==Other animals==
All vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce urine, and have a way of excreting it, so that waste products within the urine can be removed from the body. The structure specifically called the ureter is present in amniotes, meaning mammals, birds and reptiles. These animals possess an adult kidney derived from the metanephros. The duct that connects the kidney to excrete urine in these animals is the ureter. In placental mammals, it connects to the urinary bladder, whence urine leaves via the urethra. In monotremes, urine flows from the ureters into the cloaca. The ureters are ventral to the vasa deferentia in male placental mammals, but dorsal to the vasa deferentia in marsupials. In female marsupials, the ureters pass between the median and lateral vaginae.

==History==
The word &quot;ureter&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek noun , , meaning &quot;urine&quot;, and the first use of the word is seen during the era of Hippocrates to refer to the urethra. The anatomical structure of the ureter was noted by 40 AD. However, the terms &quot;ureter&quot; and &quot;urethra&quot; were variably used to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennium. It was only in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustachi and Jacques Dubois began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer to what are in modern English called the ureter and the urethra. Following this, in the 19th and 20th centuries, multiple terms relating to the structures such as ureteritis and ureterography, were coined.

Kidney stones have been identified and recorded about as long as written historical records exist. The urinary tract including the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been described by Galen in the second century AD.

The first to examine the ureter through an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young in 1929. This was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. The insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the ureters and urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941. Such an approach differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system employed during the preceding two millennia.

The first radiological imaging of the ureters was by X-rays, although this was made more difficult by the thick abdomen, which the low power of the original X-rays could not penetrate enough to produce clear images. More useful images were able to be produced when Edwin Hurry Fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered in material visible to X-rays inserted into the ureters, and in the early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract (retrograde pyelograms). Unfortunately, much of the earlier retrograde pyelograms were complicated by significant damage to the kidneys as a result of contrast based on silver or sodium iodide. Hryntshalk in 1929 pioneered the development of the intravenous urogram, in which contrast is injected into a vein and highlights the kidney and, when excreted, the urinary tract. Things improved with the development by Moses Swick and Leopold Lichtwitz in the late 1920s of relatively nontoxic contrast media, with controversy surrounding publication as to who was the primary discoverer. Side-effects associated with imaging improved even more when Tosten Almen published a ground-breaking thesis in 1969 based on the less toxic low-osmolar contrast media, developed based on swimming experiences in lakes with different salinity.

<doc id="188328" wikidata="Q3140745" url="?curid=188328" title="Offside (rugby)">
<text>In rugby football, the offside rule prohibits players from gaining an advantage from being too far forward. The specifics of the rule differ between the two major codes.

==Rugby union==
Offside laws in rugby union are complex. However the basic principle is simple: a player may not derive any advantage from being in front of the ball.

When the ball is carried by a single player in open play, any other player on the same team who is in front of the ball carrier is in an offside position. When the ball is in a ruck, maul, scrum or line-out, any player who is in front of the hindmost foot of the hindmost player of the same side in the ruck/maul/scrum/lineout is in an offside position. When the ball is in a scrum, the scrum-half must remain behind the ball and all other players not in the scrum must remain behind a line parallel to the goal-line and five metres behind the hindmost foot. A player in an offside position is forbidden from interfering with play in any way. In particular, a player in an offside position
* may not receive a pass (forward passes are illegal in any event)
* may not enter a ruck, maul or scrum
* may not play the ball
* may not move towards the ball
* may not move towards, tackle or obstruct a player of the opposing team who has the ball, or who is waiting to receive the ball
* must move at least 10 metres away from any opponent who is waiting to receive the ball

Infringement of any of these rules is generally punished with a penalty awarded to the opposing team. The opposing team may choose instead a scrum at the location where the offending team last played the ball. However, if the infringement was accidental (e.g. a player receives a forward pass without intending to be in an offside position) then a scrum is awarded at the location of infringement.

A player who is in an offside position remains offside until played onside in one of several ways:
* a teammate who has remained onside runs ahead of the offside player (this may be either the ball carrier/kicker or another teammate who has remained behind the ball carrier/kicker)
* the offside player runs behind the ball carrier/kicker
* an opponent at least 10 metres away from the offside player kicks, passes, intentionally touches, or runs 5 metres with the ball

At a lineout only players in the line (normally 7 per team), a receiver (often the scrum-half) and a thrower (usually the hooker) from each team are allowed within 5 metres of the line, however the defending hooker must be at least 2 metres from the line so as not to disturb the other thrower. The remaining players must be more than 10 metres away from the line or they will be penalised. They may move closer only to catch a long throw-in, or after the line-out ends, when the ball or a player carrying it leaves the lineout in any direction.

If a player kicks the ball, out of hand, from the dead ball area, players can be in front of the kicker, as long as they do not leave the dead ball area before the ball has been kicked.

==Rugby league==
A defending player is offside if they are less than 10 metres away from the play-the-ball (or, if the play-the-ball is inside his 10-metre line, closer to it than the try-line is) when the ball is played. He is also offside if, during open play, he is closer to the opposition&#x27;s try-line than the ball. At a scrum a defending player is also offside if he is less than 5 metres away from the base of the scrum.

An attacking player is offside if he is in front of the ball: if he is in front of a ball which is then kicked, he can be put onside if the kicker subsequently moves ahead of him before the ball is caught. If not, he must stand 10 metres away from the player who catches the ball (as if he were the acting half-back at a play-the-ball) or be penalised.

<text>In Internet computing, NSD (for &quot;name server daemon&quot;) is an open-source Domain Name System (DNS) server. It was developed by NLnet Labs of Amsterdam in cooperation with the RIPE NCC, from scratch as an authoritative name server (i.e., not implementing the recursive caching function by design). The intention of this development is to add variance to the &quot;gene pool&quot; of DNS implementations
used by higher level name servers and thus increase the resilience of DNS against software flaws or exploits.

NSD uses BIND-style zone-files (zone-files used under BIND can usually be used unmodified in NSD, once entered into the NSD configuration).

NSD uses zone information compiled via codice_1 into a binary database file (codice_2) which allows fast startup of the NSD name-service daemon, and allows syntax-structural errors in Zone-Files to be flagged at compile-time (before being made available to NSD service itself).

The collection of programs/processes that make-up NSD are designed so that the NSD daemon itself runs as a non-privileged user and can be easily configured to run in a Chroot jail, such that security flaws in the NSD daemon are not so likely to result in system-wide compromise as without such measures.

As of May 2018, four of the Internet root nameservers are using NSD:
* k.root-servers.net was switched to NSD on February 19, 2003.
* One of the 2 load-balanced servers for h.root-servers.net (called &quot;H1&quot;, &quot;H2&quot;) was switched to NSD, and now there are 3 servers all running NSD (called &quot;H1&quot;, &quot;H2&quot;, &quot;H3&quot;).
* l.root-servers.net switched to NSD on February 6, 2007.
* d.root-servers.net was switched to NSD in May 2018.

Several other TLDs use NSD for part of their servers.

<doc id="188339" wikidata="Q537123" url="?curid=188339" title="Levator ani">
<text>The levator ani is a broad, thin muscle group, situated on either side of the pelvis. It is formed from three muscle components: the pubococcygeus, the iliococcygeus, and the puborectalis.

It is attached to the inner surface of each side of the lesser pelvis, and these unite to form the greater part of the pelvic floor. The coccygeus muscle completes the pelvic floor, which is also called the &quot;pelvic diaphragm&quot;.

It supports the viscera in the pelvic cavity, and surrounds the various structures that pass through it.

The levator ani is the main pelvic floor muscle and contracts rhythmically during female orgasm, and painfully during vaginismus.

==Structure==
The levator ani is made up of 3 parts:
* Iliococcygeus muscle
* Pubococcygeus muscle
* Puborectalis muscle

The iliococcygeus arises from the inner side of the ischium (the lower and back part of the hip bone) and from the posterior part of the tendinous arch of the obturator fascia, and is attached to the coccyx and anococcygeal body; it is usually thin, and may be absent, or be largely replaced by fibrous tissue. An accessory slip at its posterior part is sometimes named the &quot;iliosacralis&quot;.

The pubococcygeus muscle has medial fibres forming the pubovaginalis in the female, and the puboprostaticus in the male.

===Origin and insertion===
The levator ani arises, in front, from the posterior surface of the superior pubic ramus lateral to the symphysis; behind, from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium; and between these two points, from the obturator fascia.

Posteriorly, this fascial origin corresponds, more or less closely, with the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia, but in front, the muscle arises from the fascia at a varying distance above the arch, in some cases reaching nearly as high as the canal for the obturator vessels and nerve.

The fibers pass downward and backward to the middle line of the floor of the pelvis; the most posterior are inserted into the side of the last two segments of the coccyx; those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side, in a median fibrous ridge called the anococcygeal body or raphe, which extends between the coccyx and the margin of the anus.

The middle fibers are inserted into the side of the rectum, blending with the fibers of the sphincter muscles; lastly in the male, the anterior fibers descend upon the side of the prostate to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, joining with the fibers of the external anal sphincter and transverse perineal muscles, at the central tendinous point of the perineum.

The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by connective tissue.

From this circumstance, as well as from its peculiar relation with the prostate, which it supports as in a sling, it has been described as a distinct muscle, under the name of &quot;levator prostatæ&quot;.

In the female, the anterior fibers of the levator ani descend upon the side of the vagina.

===Innervation===
The levator ani muscles are mostly innervated by the pudendal nerve, perineal nerve and acting together.

===Variation===
In addition, sacral spinal nerves (S3, S4) innervate the muscles directly as well (in ~70% of people). Sometimes (in ~40% of people) the inferior rectal nerve innervates the levator ani muscles independently of the pudendal nerve.

==Pubococcygeus muscle==

The pubococcygeus muscle or PC muscle is a hammock-like muscle, found in both sexes, that stretches from the pubic bone to the coccyx (tail bone) forming the floor of the pelvic cavity and supporting the pelvic organs.

===Structure===
The pubococcygeus arises from the back of the pubis and from the anterior part of the obturator fascia, and is directed backward almost horizontally along the side of the anal canal toward the coccyx and sacrum, to which it finds attachment.

Between the termination of the vertebral column and the anus, the two pubococcygeus muscles come together and form a thick, fibromuscular layer lying on the raphe (ridge) or (anococcygeal body) formed by the iliococcygei.

The greater part of this muscle is inserted into the coccyx and into the last one or two pieces of the sacrum.

====Variation====
This insertion into the vertebral column is, however, not accepted by all observers.

===Function===
The pubococcygeus muscle controls urine flow and contracts during orgasm as well as assisting in male ejaculation. It also aids in childbirth as well as core stability.

A strong pubococcygeus muscle has also been linked to a reduction in urinary incontinence and proper positioning of the baby&#x27;s head during childbirth.

===Kegel exercises===
The Kegel exercises are a series of voluntary contractions of all the perineal muscles. Such movement is done in an effort to strengthen all the striated muscles in the perineum&#x27;s area. They are often referred to simply as &quot;kegels&quot;, named after their founder, Dr. Arnold Kegel. These exercises also serve to contract, among others, the ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus, and cremaster muscle in men, as voluntary contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle also engages the cremasteric reflex, which lifts the testicles up, although this does not occur in all men. Kegel exercises have been prescribed to ameliorate erectile dysfunction due to venous leakage and to help men control premature ejaculation and to treat urinary incontinence in both sexes.

==Puborectalis muscle==

The fibers that form a looping around the rectum are named puborectalis (puboanalis). They arise from the lower part of the pubic symphysis, and from the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm. The origin of the puborectalis fibers is at the posterior surface of the pubis while their insertion is at the midline sling posterior to the rectum. The muscle band is innervated by perineal branches of the S3 and S4 nerve roots.

They meet with the corresponding fibers of the opposite side around the lower part of the rectum, and form for it a strong sling. Relaxation increases the angle between rectum and anus, allowing defecation in conjunction with relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters. Levator ani relaxation and rectal emptying is facilitated by anorectal straightening during squatting.

==Function==
The levator ani muscles are responsible for &quot;wagging&quot; the tail in tailed quadrupeds. These muscles are not as strong in the human, as tail-wagging is more demanding than the support function that the muscles serve in humans.

==Clinical significance==

===Levator ani syndrome===
Levator ani syndrome is episodic rectal pain caused by spasm of the levator ani muscle.

===Levator ani avulsion===

<doc id="188341" wikidata="Q5583528" url="?curid=188341" title="Goodnight Moon">
<text>Goodnight Moon is an American children&#x27;s book written by Margaret Wise Brown and illustrated by Clement Hurd. It was published on September 3, 1947, and is a highly acclaimed bedtime story.

This book is the second in Brown and Hurd&#x27;s &quot;classic series,&quot; which also includes &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;. The three books have been published together as a collection titled &quot;Over the Moon&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1935, author Margaret Wise Brown enrolled at the Bank Street Experimental School in New York, NY. At Bank Street, Brown studied childhood development alongside the school’s founder, Lucy Sprague Mitchell, who believed that children preferred stories about everyday topics rather than fantasies. Mitchell&#x27;s ideas combined with Brown&#x27;s observance of what children enjoyed formed the foundation for Brown&#x27;s writing, including the familiar world depicted in &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;.

In 1945, the idea for &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; appeared to Margaret Wise Brown in a dream. She wrote down the story in the morning, with the original title of the book being &quot;Goodnight Room&quot;. Brown gave illustrator Clement Hurd very little direction on the illustrations, and the characters in &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; are depicted as rabbits because Hurd was better at drawing rabbits than humans. This was among several decisions made regarding the illustrations over the course of the book&#x27;s creation. Other revisions include replacing a framed map on the wall with a scene from &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot; and blurring the udder of the &quot;cow that jumped over the moon.&quot;

==Publication history==
Illustrator Clement Hurd said in 1983 that initially the book was to be published using the pseudonym &quot;Memory Ambrose&quot; for Brown, with his illustrations credited to &quot;Hurricane Jones&quot;.

&quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; had poor initial sales: only 6,000 copies were sold upon initial release in the fall of 1947. Anne Carroll Moore, the influential children&#x27;s librarian at the New York Public Library (NYPL), regarded it as &quot;overly sentimental&quot;. The NYPL and other libraries did not acquire it at first. During the post-World War II Baby Boom years, it slowly became a bestseller. Annual sales grew from about 1,500 copies in 1953 to almost 20,000 in 1970; by 1990, the total number of copies sold exceeded four million. , the book sells about 800,000 copies annually, and by 2017 had cumulatively sold an estimated 48 million copies. &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; has been translated into at least fifteen other languages.

In 1952, at the age of 42, Margaret Wise Brown died following a routine operation, and did not live to see the success of her book. Brown bequeathed the royalties to the book (among many others) to Albert Clarke, who was the nine-year-old son of a neighbor when Brown died. Clarke, whose rights to the book earned him millions of dollars, said that Brown was his mother, a claim others dismiss.

In 2005, publisher HarperCollins digitally altered the photograph of illustrator Hurd, which had been on the book for at least twenty years, to remove a cigarette. HarperCollins&#x27; editor-in-chief for children&#x27;s books, Kate Jackson, said: &quot;It is potentially a harmful message to very young [children].&quot; HarperCollins had the reluctant permission of Hurd&#x27;s son, Thacher Hurd, but the younger Hurd said the photo of Hurd with his arm and fingers extended, holding nothing, &quot;looks slightly absurd to me&quot;. 

=== Other editions ===
In addition to several octavo and duodecimo paperback editions, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; is available as a board book and in &quot;jumbo&quot; edition designed for use with large groups.
* 1991, US, HarperFestival , publication date September 30, 1991, board book.
* 1997, US, HarperCollins , publication date February 28, 1997, Hardback 50th anniversary edition.
* 2007, US, HarperCollins , publication date January 23, 2007, Board book 60th anniversary edition.

In 2008, Thacher Hurd used his father&#x27;s artwork from &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; to produce &quot;Goodnight Moon 123: A Counting Book&quot;. In 2010, HarperCollins used artwork from the book to produce &quot;Goodnight Moon&#x27;s ABC: An Alphabet Book.&quot;

In 2015, Loud Crow Interactive Inc. released a &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; interactive app.

==Synopsis==
The text is a rhyming poem, describing an anthropomorphic bunny&#x27;s bedtime ritual of saying &quot;good night&quot; to various inanimate and living objects in the bunny&#x27;s bedroom: a red balloon, a pair of socks, the bunny&#x27;s dollhouse, a bowl of mush, a woman (an older female anthropomorphic rabbit, possibly his mother or an adult caretaker rabbit) who apparently says &quot;hush&quot;, and two kittens, among others; despite the kittens, a mouse is present in each spread. The book begins at 7:00 PM, and ends at 8:10 PM, with each spread being spaced 10 minutes apart, as measured by the two clocks in the room, and reflected (improbably) in the rising moon. The illustrations alternate between 2-page black-and-white spreads of objects and 2-page color spreads of the room, like the other books in the series (a common cost-saving technique at the time).

==Allusions and references==
&quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; contains a number of references to Brown and Hurd&#x27;s &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot;, and to traditional children&#x27;s literature. For example, the room of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; generally resembles the next-to-last spread of &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot;, where the little bunny becomes a little boy and runs into a house, and the mother bunny becomes the little boy&#x27;s mother; shared details include the fireplace and the painting by the fireplace of &quot;The Cow Jumping Over the Moon&quot;, though other details differ (the colors of the walls and floor are switched, for instance). The painting is itself a reference to the nursery rhyme &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle,&quot; where a cow jumps over the moon. However, when reprinted in &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;, the udder was reduced to an anatomical blur to avoid the controversy that E.B. White&#x27;s &quot;Stuart Little&quot; had undergone when published in 1945. The painting of three bears, sitting in chairs, alludes to &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot; (originally &quot;The Story of the Three Bears&quot;), which also contains a copy of the cow jumping over the moon painting. The other painting in the room, which is never explicitly mentioned in the text, portrays a bunny fly-fishing for another bunny, using a carrot as bait. This picture is also a reference to &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot;, where it is the first colored spread, when the mother says that if the little bunny becomes a fish, she will become a fisherman and fish for him. The top shelf of the bookshelf, below the Runaway Bunny painting, holds an open copy of &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot;, and there is a copy of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; on the nightstand.

==Literary significance and reception==
In a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children.&quot; In 2012 it was ranked number four among the &quot;Top 100 Picture Books&quot; in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

When &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; was first published, it was considered controversial for such reasons as its lack of educational message and its narrative being confined to a single room. From the time of its publication in 1947 until 1972, the book was &quot;banned&quot; by the New York Public Library due to the then-head children&#x27;s librarian Anne Carroll Moore&#x27;s hatred of the book. Moore was considered a top taste-maker and arbiter of children&#x27;s books not only in the New York Public Library, but for libraries nationwide in the United States, even well past her official retirement. The book was stocked on the library&#x27;s shelves only in 1972, at the time of the 25th anniversary of its publication. It did not appear on the NYPL&#x27;s 2020 list of the 10 most-checked-out books in the library&#x27;s history.

Children&#x27;s author Susan Cooper describes the book as possibly the only &quot;realistic story&quot; to gain the universal affection of a fairy-tale, while describing its narrative as a &quot;deceptively simple ritual&quot; rather than a story. Other authors have suggested that the book create an atmosphere of peace and calm, teaches children that life is stable, and can be trusted, and that unlike stories that merely use the night as a theme it can be helpful in putting children to sleep.

== Analysis ==
In his article &quot;Bedtime Books, the Bedtime Story Ritual, and Goodnight Moon&quot;, Daniel Pereira analyzes the function of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; as a &quot;bedtime book&quot; that is not only beneficial to children at bedtime, but is beneficial to parents as well. Pereira first defines a &quot;bedtime book&quot; as a book that both &quot;represents&quot; bedtime and is about bedtime, and is meant to be read by a parent and child together. Pereira further argues that bedtime books such as &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; serve parental interests since they help parents carry out their duty of being an &quot;entertainer, educator, enchanter&quot; at bedtime while also maintaining a sense of independence between the child and the parent. Pereira analyzes the effectiveness of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;″s illustrations in assisting parents at bedtime through discussing Joseph Stanton&#x27;s evaluation of the role of the &quot;old lady&quot;, who is treated as another &quot;feature of the landscape&quot; rather than as a character herself. Stanton notes that the objectification of the old lady contributes to a sense of independence in the child, who lacks a true parental figure in the &quot;great green room&quot;. Pereira asserts that despite this objectification, the old lady still conveys a message when she whispers &quot;hush&quot;. He notes that in doing so, the old lady &quot;delivers the parent&#x27;s bedtime message for them,&quot; which reminds the child reader to be quiet.

In the article &quot;&#x27;Goodnight Nobody&#x27;: Comfort and the Vast Dark in the Picture-Poems of Margaret Wise Brown and Her Collaborators&quot;, author Joseph Stanton discusses a motif present in &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; that he refers to as &quot;child-alone-in-the-wide-world&quot;. According to Stanton, this motif is present in much of Brown&#x27;s work and is characterized by a child character finding resolution in being left alone. Further contributing to this motif, Stanton argues that the child is at the center of both the words and the illustrations in &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; due to a lack of any parental figure. He states that the voice in &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; is not the child&#x27;s voice, but rather an omniscient voice that knows and understands what the child sees. Additionally, Stanton comments that each illustration focuses on what the child is looking at, which corresponds to what is being named in each scene.

In his article &quot;&#x27;Goodnight Moon&#x27; was once banned: Classic children&#x27;s book marks 75th anniversary&quot;, Jim Beckerman presents analysis about why children enjoy &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;. Beckerman references professor Julie Rosenthal&#x27;s point that &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; acts as a &quot;scavenger hunt&quot; for children, as they are able to search the illustrations for each object mentioned in the book. Beckerman also mentions some of professor April Patrick&#x27;s ideas, such as how the rhyming scheme fascinates children, as well as how children feel comfort in reading a book about real things.

==Animated adaptation==
In 1985, Weston Woods released a filmstrip adaptation of the book.

On July 15, 1999, &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; was announced as a 26-minute animated family video special/documentary, which debuted on HBO Family in December of that year, and was released on VHS on April 15, 2000, and DVD in 2005, in the United States. The special features an animated short of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;, narrated by Susan Sarandon, along with six other animated segments of children&#x27;s bedtime stories and lullabies with live-action clips of children reflecting on a series of bedtime topics in between, a reprise of &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; at the end, and the Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;All I Have To Do Is Dream&quot; playing over the closing credits. The special is notable for its post-credits clip, which features a boy being interviewed about dreams but stumbling over his sentence, which soon became a meme in 2011 when it was uploaded on YouTube. He was referencing a line from the 1997 Disney animated film &quot;Hercules&quot;. The boy&#x27;s identity was unknown until July 2021, when he came forward as Joseph Cirkiel in a video interview with Youtuber wavywebsurf.

Here are the other tales and lullabies featured in the video:
* Lullaby: &quot;Hit the Road to Dreamland&quot; sung by Tony Bennett (This lullaby plays in the opening credits, right before &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;.)
* Lullaby: &quot;Hush, Little Baby&quot; sung by Lauryn Hill
* Story: &quot;There&#x27;s a Nightmare in My Closet&quot; narrated by Billy Crystal
* Story: &quot;Tar Beach&quot; narrated by Natalie Cole
* Lullaby: &quot;Brahms&#x27; Lullaby&quot; sung by Aaron Neville
* Lullaby: &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; sung by Patti LaBelle

==Musical adaptation==
In 2012, American composer Eric Whitacre obtained the copyright holder&#x27;s permission to set the words to music. He did so initially for a soprano, specifically his then wife Hila Plitmann, with harp and string orchestra. He subsequently arranged it for soprano and piano, SSA (two soprano lines plus alto; commissioned by the National Children&#x27;s Chorus), and SATB (commissioned by a consortium of choirs).

== Exhibit adaptation ==
In 2006, an exhibit titled &quot;From Goodnight Moon to Art Dog: The World of Clement, Edith and Thacher Hurd&quot; was on display at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. This exhibit featured 3-D displays of Clement Hurd&#x27;s artwork, as well as artwork from his wife, Edith Hurd, and his son, Thacher Hurd. Included in the displays was the &quot;great green room&quot; scene from &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;. Providence was the exhibit&#x27;s final stop in the United States. The exhibit had also featured shows in Vermont, Michigan, Florida and South Carolina.

<text>Kensington is an abstract strategy board game devised by Brian Taylor and Peter Forbes in 1979, named after London&#x27;s Kensington Gardens, which contains the mosaic upon which the gameboard is patterned. It is played on a geometrical board based on the rhombitrihexagonal tiling pattern. The objective of the game is to capture a hexagon by occupying the six surrounding vertices. The game is simple while still allowing for complex strategy. The placing and movement of tokens have been compared to nine men&#x27;s morris.

==Board==
The gameboard consists of a combination of seven regular hexagons (2 red, 2 blue and 3 white), thirty squares, and twenty-four triangles. The board is composed of 72 total vertices where tokens can be placed. 

==Gameplay==
The two players, Red and Blue, alternately place tokens of their respective color on unoccupied vertices of the board until each has placed fifteen. Thereafter they alternate turns sliding a single token of their color along a line to an adjacent unoccupied vertex.

A player who occupies the three vertices of any triangle with tokens of their color has formed a &quot;mill&quot; and may relocate one enemy token to any other unoccupied vertex. A &quot;double mill&quot; is formed by occupying the four vertices of any square; doing so allows the player to relocate two enemy tokens. No more than two tokens may be relocated in a single turn, even if a player completes a mill and double mill with the same move.

The winner is the first player to occupy all six vertices of either any white hexagon or one of their own color. A win can be achieved during either the placement or movement phases of the game.

If, in the movement phase, a player cannot move, the other play may move again.

== Strategy ==
There is debate in the Kensington community as to the relative advantage of placing first or second. The player to place second also gets to place last which is a definite advantage because that placement cannot be directly countered. This advantage is offset by the other player being able to move first in the sliding phase. Most beginning players will find more success placing second. Often, the player who makes the first mill is able to scatter the opponent&#x27;s tokens and win without difficulty. However, a skilled player may be able to recover from an opponent&#x27;s mill. Relocated tokens can group together to form a mill across the board from their original locations. A popular strategy is to use one&#x27;s tokens to form &quot;jails&quot; where the opponent&#x27;s relocated tokens are sequestered and unable to form mills or hexagons.

Defense is very difficult and thus much of the game revolves around being first to secure a mill. The game often ends soon after the first mill is formed. A very powerful configuration is to be able to move a single token back and forth between two spaces creating a mill each turn. This results in certain victory.

==Marketing==
In a business venture parallel to &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; in Canada, the British inventors set up their own company to make and publish the game. This attracted a fair amount of press attention at the time and Kensington picked up a UK Game of the Year award. Attention for the game was short-lived and the game is now out of print, but second-hand copies are readily available online.

===1979 edition===
A 1979 edition was sold in a package resembling a double-LP album. The front part had a cut-out showing the centre of the one-piece non-folding gameboard which could be slid out of the sleeve like an LP. Rules were printed on the inside and the rear side showed the authors playing the game on the steps of the Albert Memorial. In the rules the authors offered a prize of £10,000 to the first person to find a position in which neither player of a two-player game could move.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; included &quot;Kensington&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, finding the way pieces are positioned and moved was &quot;reminiscent of nine men’s morris, but this game is more sophisticated.&quot;
