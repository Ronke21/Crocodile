<text>Sten Sture the Elder (; 1440 – 14 December 1503) was a Swedish statesman and regent of Sweden from 1470 to 1497 and again from 1501 to 1503. As the leader of the victorious Swedish separatist forces against the royal unionist forces during the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471, he weakened the Kalmar Union considerably and became the effective ruler of Sweden as Lord Regent for most of his remaining life.

==Background==
In contemporary sources he is alternatively referred to as &quot;Sten Gustavsson&quot; or &quot;Herr Sten&quot; &quot;(Lord Sten)&quot;; the practice of using noble family names as part of a personal name was not yet in use in Sweden at the time. He was born around 1440, the son of Gustav Anundsson of the Sture family and Birgitta Stensdotter Bielke, half-sister of the future Charles VIII. The Sture family was one of the high-ranking noble families of the time, though only distantly related to the royal house; his closest royal ancestor was King Sverker II of Sweden (both through family of Vinga and through family of Aspenäs). Sture&#x27;s father, Gustav Anundsson, was Castellan of Kalmar Castle and a Privy Councillor, but died when the son was four. Birgitta Stensdotter remarried Gustav Karlsson of the Gumsehuvud family, and the son was most likely raised in their home, first at Kalmar Castle and later at Ekholmen Castle.

The 15th century in Sweden was largely defined by the political struggles and civil wars between the unionists of the Kalmar Union, seeking to unite Sweden with Denmark and Norway under the rule of the Danish monarchs, with Danish support, and the separatists seeking to re-establish Sweden as an independent kingdom under a rival Swedish monarch. Due to his close family ties to the Swedish King Charles, the young Sten Sture became part of the Swedish separatist political movement from an early age, and visited Charles during his exile in Danzig. He is mentioned as a knight in 1462 and as a privy councillor in 1466, and took up residence on the family estate at Räfsnäs north of Mariefred. Sture fought with Bishop and Regent Kettil Karlsson Vasa during the uprising against the Danish King Christian I in 1464, taking part in the decisive victory at Haraker. He served as a military commander under King Charles VIII, defeating Erik Karlsson Vasa&#x27;s uprising at Uppbo in 1470 and later in the same year successfully beating back Christian I&#x27;s forces at Öresten.

He married Ingeborg Tott, niece by marriage of Magdalen of Sweden, in 1467; she was a renaissance personality interested in theology and science and seems to have had some importance in the intellectual development during his reign. The marriage was childless.

== First regency ==

Sture&#x27;s uncle, King Charles VIII named Sture heir to Charles&#x27; personal domains before his death in 1470, and left Sture in charge of the crown lands, including the city of Stockholm and Stockholm Castle. On the death of King Charles on 15 May 1470, Sture immediately became the most powerful noble and political force in the country and was elected Lord Protector and Regent of Sweden &quot;(riksföreståndare)&quot; by the Riksmöte in Arboga on 1 May 1471. Sture consolidated his position through the victory of Brunkeberg.
At the Battle of Brunkeberg on 10 October 1471, which was fought around Brunkebergsåsen outside the northern gates of Stockholm, his Swedish separatist army triumphed against Danish King Christian I&#x27;s Swedish unionist and Danish forces, injuring Christian and routing the unionist army. This victory elevated Sture to the position of a national savior. The sculpture &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot; in Storkyrkan in Stockholm, commonly attributed to the German sculptor Bernt Notke, was raised to commemorate the battle.

For a quarter of a century he ruled Sweden making the regency almost an office in its own right. He was supported by the peasantry, the commercial interests of the mining district of Bergslagen and the lower nobility, playing them out against the unionist high-ranked nobility and clergy and managing a difficult act of balance towards the Danish demands of reunion. In a meeting in Kalmar in 1483, the high nobility confirmed the new Danish king Hans as the true king of Sweden on condition of extensive privileges and guarantees granted to the high nobility, clergy and Privy Council, but Sture nevertheless managed to hold on to the political power for the time being, refusing to give up his office as Regent.

Sture&#x27;s reign saw the foundation of the first Swedish university, Uppsala University, founded by Archbishop Jakob Ulvsson in 1477 with support from Sture.

In 1487, Sture fought a successful war against the powerful Tott dynasty, forcing them to cede Öland and Borgholm to Sweden, while Denmark received Gotland. As a result of the war, the power the Tott&#x27;s held sharply declined.

In 1493, the Danish and Norwegian king, Hans (also called John I), formed an alliance with Ivan III of Russia against Sten Sture. From 1495 to 1497, Sten successfully repelled a Russian invasion of Finland. However, he subsequently fell out with the majority of the Swedish nobility, most prominently Svante Nilsson, and the Swedish Privy Council declared him to be deposed as regent on 8 March 1497.

== Second regency ==
In the ensuing war, Sten was supported by peasant forces, but they were defeated at the Battle of Rotebro by Hans of Denmark (also known as King John I of Denmark and Norway), who invaded Sweden in July the same year. On 6 October, Sten surrendered to King Hans in Stockholm and was reconciled with him. Hans was crowned King of Sweden, and Sten was given the highest position of authority in Sweden below the King. However, during the next rebellion against the Danes in 1501, he again took office as regent, leading the Swedish struggle for independence until his death. In May 1502, the unionist garrison in Stockholm, led by Queen Christina, capitulated due to severe starvation after a drawn-out siege. In early 1503 his forces were in control of Sweden apart from Kalmar and the island of Öland.

Sture used the capture of the Queen for propaganda purposes, personally accompanying the Queen to Halmstad in Denmark after a cease-fire had been negotiated by the Hanseatic League, in October 1503.
== Death and aftermath ==
On his way back from Denmark, Sture fell ill and died on 14 December 1503. Bishop Hemming Gadh, who accompanied Sture on the journey, alerted Svante Nilsson at Stegeborg Castle. Sture&#x27;s widow, Ingeborg Tott, who at the time was in control of the Stockholm garrison, was only presented with the news of her husband&#x27;s death once Svante Nilsson had reached Stockholm. She was persuaded to turn over Stockholm Castle and received Häme Castle in Finland as compensation.

Sture had no legitimate children from his marriage with Ingeborg Tott, only a daughter born out of wedlock, Birgitta, who became a nun in Vadstena Abbey. The male line of the old Sture family, the Tre Sjöblad family, died out with Sten Sture. His closest relatives and heirs were his deceased sister&#x27;s, the house of Vasa, and his nephew Erik Johansson Vasa, a knight and member of the Privy Council, inherited Sture&#x27;s extensive personal domains in Södermanland and Uppland. Erik Johansson&#x27;s son, the future King Gustav I of Sweden had been born a few years before Sten&#x27;s death. However, Erik Johansson was described by his contemporaries as a simpleminded and brutal man, prone to violent outbursts and on more than one occasion charged with manslaughter, and lacked the political skill of his uncle Sten Sture.

Regent Sten was succeeded by his colleague from the Privy Council and former enemy Svante Nilsson, of the Natt och Dag family, as regent. Svante Nilsson&#x27;s son and successor, Sten Sture the Younger, later chose to adapt the Sture name for political purposes, despite only being distantly related.

== Burial and monuments ==

To commemorate the victory at Brunkeberg, Sten Sture ordered a wooden monument for Storkyrkan in Stockholm, &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;, built in the late 1480s. Saint George&#x27;s horse carries the coat of arms of the Tre Sjöblad family, Sten Sture&#x27;s coat of arms, and the monument is therefore interpreted as a symbol of his victory over Denmark, the dragon. A bronze copy of the monument was placed on Köpmantorget in Stockholm in 1912.

Sten Sture was buried in the church of Mariefred Charterhouse, which he had helped establish and made significant contributions to during his reign. His remains were moved to Strängnäs Cathedral during the reign of Gustav I, after the short-lived monastery was closed in 1526, during the protestant reformation. A memorial outside the town church of Mariefred marks the former site of the monastery. The present burial monument in the choir of Strängnäs Cathedral was ordered in 1774 by King Gustav III.

Sture became a prominent symbolic figure in the 19th century nationalist movement in Sweden, together with the early 15th century rebel leader Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson and King Gustav I who ended the Kalmar Union. A large stone monument to Sten Sture, by the sculptor Carl Milles (1875–1955), was inaugurated in Uppsala in 1925. There are several places and buildings named after Sten Sture in the town of Arboga in central Sweden, where Sten Sture was elected in 1471, due to the efforts of the local Sture society in the late 19th century. &quot;Stureparken&quot; was created for the 400th anniversary in 1871, and an obelisk dedicated to the memory of the election of Sten Sture was erected in the park in 1890.

<text>Kettil Karlsson (Vasa) (c. 1433 – 11 August 1465) was a Swedish clergyman, diplomat, military leader and statesman during the Kalmar Union era. He was a member of the house of Vasa. At age 25, he was elected Bishop of Linköping. He rebelled against King Christian I in 1463, was Captain General &quot;(rikshövitsman)&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; regent of Sweden from February to August 1464, stepping down during the brief return of King Charles Canutesson from exile. After falling out with King Charles, Kettil Karlsson was subsequently elected Lord Protector and Regent &quot;(riksföreståndare)&quot; of Sweden from 26 December 1464 to his death.

== Biography ==

=== Family and education ===
Kettil Karlsson was the son of Karl Kristiernsson (Vasa), Swedish Privy Councillor &quot;(riksråd)&quot; and Castellan &quot;(hövitsman)&quot; of Raseborg Castle, and Ebba Eriksdotter (Krummedige), daughter of the Danish Steward of the Realm and Privy Councillor Erik Segebodsen Krummedige, giving him family connections in the high nobility of both kingdoms. He was given an ecclesiastical education and was enrolled on 19 August 1454 at the University of Rostock, later also at the University of Leuven on 16 June 1455.

=== Church career ===

After obtaining a master&#x27;s degree he returned to Sweden and served as canon in Uppsala, where his cousin Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna was Archbishop. Through his family connections he fell in favour with King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, shortly after Christian became King of Sweden in 1457. King Christian recommended him as Coadjutor Bishop of Linköping, to serve under the aging Bishop Nils König, in a letter to Pope Callixtus III in February 1458. Nils König died just two months later, in April 1458, and the cathedral chapter chose Kettil Karlsson as his successor. Kettil Karlsson travelled to Rome to seek papal confirmation for his appointment. However, the approval was not given at first, seemingly due to Kettil Karlsson&#x27;s young age (25) which required a papal dispensation. On a subsequent journey to Mantua, where the Bishop-elect also served as diplomat to the Holy See on behalf of King Christian, Pope Pius II granted the confirmation and dispensation on 24 September 1459. Kettil Karlsson was then received formally as Bishop of Linköping in 1460.

=== Rise to power ===
The deposed King Charles Canutesson had been in exile in Danzig since 1457. In the early 1460s, rumours about Charles&#x27; imminent return caused Christian I to attempt to increase his political control over Sweden.

In 1463, Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna, who had been governing Sweden during King Christian&#x27;s stay in Finland, was imprisoned by the King on his return and brought to Copenhagen, over the Archbishop&#x27;s refusal to carry out the King&#x27;s tax policies. The Archbishop&#x27;s Oxenstierna and Vasa relatives, among them Kettil Karlsson, took up arms against the King, gathering a peasant militia and noble supporters. Kettil Karlsson became leader of the uprising in Östergötland and northern Småland, laying siege to the unionist-controlled royal castles. His relatives gathered their forces in the northern provinces of Västmanland, Dalecarlia and Uppland, where resistance among the farmers and miners against Christian&#x27;s tax and foreign trade policies was strong. In February 1464 Kettil Karlsson was elected in Västerås as Captain general of the Swedish separatists. He briefly laid siege to Stockholm but broke off the siege on receiving news of Christian I&#x27;s Danish army approaching from the south, plundering Kettil Karlsson&#x27;s residence at Linköping Castle on their way.

Kettil Karlsson&#x27;s separatist army won a decisive victory against King Christian&#x27;s Danish unionist army on 17 April 1464 at the Battle of Haraker, north of Västerås. A subsequent attempt by the unionist Lord High Constable Ture Turesson Bielke to land troops in Västmanland was defeated by Kettil Karlsson&#x27;s militia from Rekarne at Kvicksund. However, Stockholm remained in the unionists&#x27; control, and the separatists lacked a fleet to blockade Stockholm harbour. A Riksmöte called by Bishop Kettil and the separatist party recalled the exiled King Charles Canutesson, who brought a fleet and mercenary troops. The city of Stockholm was captured by the separatists, who hailed Charles Canutesson as King on 9 August 1464, but Stockholm Castle remained in the hands of Ture Turesson&#x27;s unionists.

Meanwhile, Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson had been released from Danish captivity due to political pressure from the Church and abroad, reconciling with King Christian. The Archbishop&#x27;s arrival in Stockholm caused a conflict between the bishops and King Charles Canutesson, which rapidly escalated into open warfare. Joining forces with Ture Turesson&#x27;s garrison at Stockholm Castle, the bishops soon made King Charles&#x27; position untenable.

=== Regentship and death ===
Kettil Karlsson was elected Lord Protector and Regent of Sweden on 26 December 1464, with Jöns Bengtsson as co-ruler, and on 30 January 1465 King Charles abdicated, instead receiving the castles of Raseborg and Korsholm in Finland. Bishop Kettil&#x27;s rule was brief. He died from the plague on 11 August 1465 at Stockholm Castle and was buried below the altar of Linköping Cathedral. On his death, Jöns Bengtsson became sole Regent of Sweden.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
Jöns Bengtsson was deposed and replaced as Regent by the Privy Councillor Erik Axelsson Tott in 1466, who in 1467 brought Charles Canutesson back as King for a third regency. The conflict between the separatist party, led by the Sture family, and unionists under Erik Karlsson (Vasa), flared up in 1469, with Sten Sture the Elder, one of the separatist noble leaders from Kettil Karlsson&#x27;s 1464 uprising, commanding the separatist army. After King Charles&#x27; death in 1470, Sten Sture was elected Regent. Sten Sture defeated Christian I at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471, leaving the Sture separatist party in control of Sweden for another generation. Gustav Eriksson Vasa (1496–1560), Kettil Karlsson&#x27;s half cousin once removed, would eventually rise to the leadership of the separatist party and was elected King of Sweden in 1523, marking the beginning of the house of Vasa as hereditary royal dynasty of Sweden.

<text>A telegraph key, clacker, tapper or morse key is a specialized electrical switch used by a trained operator to transmit text messages in Morse code in a telegraphy system. Keys are used in all forms of electrical telegraph systems, including landline (also called wire) telegraphy and radio (also called wireless) telegraphy. An operator uses the telegraph key to send electrical pulses (or in the case of modern CW, unmodulated radio waves) of two different lengths: short pulses, called &quot;dots&quot; or &quot;dits&quot;, and longer pulses, called &quot;dashes&quot; or &quot;dahs&quot;. These pulses encode the letters and other characters that spell out the message.

== Types ==
The first telegraph key was invented by Alfred Vail, an associate of Samuel Morse. Since then the technology has evolved and improved, resulting in a range of key designs.

===Straight keys===
A &quot;straight key&quot; is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies. It is a simple bar with a knob on top and an electrical contact underneath. When the bar is pressed down against spring tension, it makes a closed electric circuit. Traditionally, American telegraph keys had flat topped knobs and narrow bars (frequently curved), while European telegraph keys had ball shaped knobs and thick bars. This appears to be purely a matter of culture and training, but the users of each are tremendously partisan.

Straight keys have been made in numerous variations for over 150 years and in numerous countries. They are the subject of an avid community of key collectors. The straight keys also had a &quot;shorting bar&quot; that closed the electrical circuit through the station when the operator was not actively sending messages. The shorting switch for an unused key was needed in telegraph systems wired in the style of North American railroads, in which the signal power was supplied from batteries only in telegraph offices at one or both ends of a line, rather than each station having its own bank of batteries, which was often used in Europe. The shorting bar completed the electrical path to the next station and all following stations, so that their sounders could respond to signals coming down the line, allowing the operator in the next town to receive a message from the central office. Although occasionally included in later keys for reasons of tradition, the shorting bar is unnecessary for radio telegraphy, except as a convenience to produce a steady signal for tuning the transmitter.

The straight key is simple and reliable, but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots (or &quot;dits&quot; as most operators call them) poses some medically significant drawbacks.
Transmission speeds vary from 5 words (25 characters) per minute, by novice operators, up to about 30 words (150 characters) per minute by skilled operators. In the early days of telegraphy, a number of professional telegraphers developed a repetitive stress injury known as &quot;glass arm&quot; or &quot;telegraphers’ paralysis&quot;. &quot;Glass arm&quot; may be reduced or eliminated by increasing the side play of the straight key, by loosening the adjustable trunnion screws. Such problems can be avoided either by using good manual technique, or by only using side-to-side key types.

===Alternative designs===
In addition to the basic up-and-down telegraph key, telegraphers have been experimenting with alternate key designs from the beginning of telegraphy. Many are made to move side-to-side instead of up-and-down. Some of the designs, such as &quot;sideswipers&quot; (or &quot;bushwhackers&quot;) and &quot;semi-automatic&quot; keys operate mechanically.

Beginning in the mid-20th century electronic devices called &quot;keyers&quot; have been developed, which are operated by special keys of various designs generally categorized as &quot;single-paddle&quot; keys (also called &quot;sideswipers&quot;), and &quot;double-paddle&quot; keys (or &quot;iambic&quot; or &quot;squeeze&quot; keys). The keyer may be either an independent device that attaches to the transmitter in place of a telegraph key, or circuitry incorporated in modern amateurs&#x27; radios.

====Sideswipers====
The first widely accepted alternative key was the &quot;sideswiper&quot; or &quot;sidewinder&quot;, sometimes called a &quot;cootie key&quot; or &quot;bushwhacker&quot;. This key uses a side-to-side action with contacts on both the left and right and the arm spring-loaded to return to center; the operator may make a &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot; by swinging the lever in either direction. A series of &quot;dits&quot; can be sent by rocking the arm back and forth.

This first new style of key was introduced in part to increase speed of sending, but more importantly to reduce the repetitive strain injury affecting telegraphers. The side-to-side motion reduces strain, and uses different muscles than the up-and-down motion (called &quot;pounding brass&quot;). Nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action.

The alternating action produces a distinctive rhythm or &quot;swing&quot; which noticeably affects the operator&#x27;s transmission rhythm (known as ‘&quot;fist&quot;’). Although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used, when the left and right contacts are electrically separated a sideswiper becomes a modern single-paddle key (see below); likewise, a modern single-lever key becomes an old-style sideswiper when its two contacts are wired together.

====Semi-automatic key====

A popular side-to-side key is the semi-automatic key or &quot;bug&quot;, sometimes known as a &quot;Vibroplex key&quot;, after an early manufacturer of mechanical, semi-automatic keys. The original &quot;bug&quot;s were fully mechanical, based on a kind of simple clockwork mechanism, and required no electronic keyer. A skilled operator can achieve sending speeds in excess of 40 words per minute with a ‘&quot;bug&quot;’.

The benefit of the clockwork mechanism is that it reduces the motion required from the telegrapher&#x27;s hand, which provides greater speed of sending, and it produces uniformly timed &quot;dits&quot; (dots, or short pulses) and maintains constant rhythm; consistent timing and rhythm are crucial for decoding the signal on the other end of the telegraph line.

The single paddle is held between the knuckle and the thumb of the right hand. When the paddle is pressed to the right (with the thumb), it kicks a horizontal pendulum which then rocks against the contact point, sending a series of short pulses (&quot;dits&quot; or dots) at a speed which is controlled by the pendulum’s length. When the paddle is pressed toward the left (with the knuckle) it makes a continuous contact suitable for sending &quot;dahs&quot; (dashes); the telegrapher remains responsible for timing the &quot;dahs&quot; to proportionally match the &quot;dits&quot;. The clockwork pendulum needs the extra kick that the stronger thumb press provides, which established the standard left-right paddle directions for the &quot;dit&quot;-&quot;dah&quot; assignments that persists on the paddles on 21st century electronic keys. A few semi-automatic keys were made with mirror-image mechanisms for left-handed telegraphers.

==Electronic keyers and paddle keys==

Like semi-automatic keys, the telegrapher operates an electronic keyer by tapping a paddle key, swinging its lever(s) from side-to-side. When pressed to one side (usually left), the keyer electronics generate a series of &quot;dahs&quot;; when pressed to the other side (usually right), a series of &quot;dits&quot;. Keyers work with two different types of keys: Single paddle and double paddle keys.

Like semi-automatic keys, pressing the paddle on one side produces a &quot;dit&quot; and the other a &quot;dah&quot;. Single paddle keys are also called &quot;single lever keys&quot; or &quot;sideswipers&quot;, the same name as the older side-to-side key design they greatly resemble. Double paddle keys are also called &quot;iambic&quot; keys
or &quot;squeeze&quot; keys. Also like the old semi-automatic keys, the conventional assignment of the paddle directions (for a right-handed telegrapher) is that pressing a paddle with the right thumb (pressing the single paddle rightward, or for a double-paddle key, pressing the left paddle with the thumb, rightwards towards the center) creates a series of &quot;dits&quot;. Pressing a paddle with the right knuckle (hence swinging a single paddle leftward, or the right paddle on a double-paddle key leftward to the center) creates a series of &quot;dahs&quot;. Left-handed telegraphers sometimes elect to reverse the electrical contacts, so their left-handed keying is a mirror image of standard right-handed keying.

Single paddle keys are essentially the same as the original sideswiper keys, with the left and right electrical contacts wired separately. Double-paddle keys have one arm for each of the two contacts, each arm held away from the common center by a spring; pressing either of the paddles towards the center makes contact, the same as pressing a single-lever key to one side. For double-paddle keys wired to an &quot;iambic&quot; keyer, squeezing both paddles together makes a double-contact, which causes the keyer to send alternating &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; (or &quot;dahs&quot; and &quot;dits&quot;, depending on which lever makes first contact).

Most electronic keyers include &quot;dot and dash memory&quot; functions, so the operator does not need to use perfect spacing between &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; or vice versa. With &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot; memory, the operator&#x27;s keying action can be about one &quot;dit&quot; ahead of the actual transmission. The electronics in the keyer adjusts the timing so that the output of each letter is machine-perfect. Electronic keyers allow very high speed transmission of code.
Using a keyer in what&#x27;s called &quot;iambic&quot; mode requires a key with two paddles: One paddle produces &quot;dit&quot;s and the other produces &quot;dahs&quot;. Pressing both at the same time (a &quot;squeeze&quot;) produces an alternating &quot;dit-dah-dit-dah&quot; () sequence, which starts with a &quot;dit&quot; if the &quot;dit&quot; side makes contact first, or a &quot;dah&quot; () if the &quot;dah&quot; side connects first.

An additional advantage of electronic keyers over semiautomatic keys is that code speed is easily changed with electronic keyers, just by turning a knob. With a semiautomatic key, the location of the pendulum weight and the pendulum spring tension and contact must all be repositioned and rebalanced to change the &quot;dit&quot; speed.

===Double-lever paddles===
Keys having two separate levers, one for &quot;dits&quot; and the other for &quot;dahs&quot; are called dual or dual-lever paddles. With a dual paddle both contacts may be closed simultaneously, enabling the &quot;iambic&quot; functions of an electronic keyer that is designed to support them: By pressing both paddles (squeezing the levers together) the operator can create a series of alternating &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot;, analogous to a sequence of iambs in poetry. For that reason, dual paddles are sometimes called &quot;squeeze keys&quot; or &quot;iambic keys&quot;. Typical dual-paddle keys&#x27; levers move horizontally, like the earlier single-paddle keys, as opposed to how the original &quot;straight-keys&#x27;&quot; arms move up-and-down.

Whether the sequence begins with a &quot;dit&quot; or a &quot;dah&quot; is determined by which lever makes contact first: If the &quot;dah&quot; lever is closed first, then the first element will be a &quot;dah&quot;, so the string of elements will be similar to a sequence of trochees in poetry, and the method could as logically be called &quot;trochaic keying&quot; (). If the &quot;dit&quot; lever makes first contact, then the string begins with a &quot;dit&quot; ().

Insofar as iambic keying is a function of the electronic keyer, it is not correct, technically, to refer to a dual paddle key &quot;itself&quot; as &quot;iambic&quot;, although this is commonly done in marketing. A dual paddle key is required for iambic sending, which also requires an iambic keyer. But any single- or dual-paddle key can be used non-iambicly, without squeezing, and there were electronic keyers made which did not have iambic functions.

Iambic keying or squeeze keying reduces the key strokes or hand movements necessary to make some characters, e.g. the letter C, which can be sent by merely squeezing the two paddles together. With a single-paddle or non-iambic keyer, the hand motion would require alternating four times for (&quot;dah&quot;-&quot;dit&quot;-&quot;dah&quot;-&quot;dit&quot; ).

The efficiency of iambic keying has recently been discussed in terms of movements per character and timings for high speed CW, with the author concluding that the timing difficulties of correctly operating a keyer iambicly at high speed outweigh any small benefits.

Iambic keyers function in one of at least two major modes: Mode  and mode . There is a third, rarely available mode .

==== Mode ====
Mode  is the original iambic mode, in which alternate dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed. Mode  is essentially &quot;what you hear is what you get&quot;: When the paddles are released, the keying stops with the last dot or dash that was being sent while the paddles were held.

==== Mode ====
Mode  is the second mode, which devolved from a logic error in an early iambic keyer. Over the years iambic mode  has become something of a standard and is the default setting in most keyers.

In mode , dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed. When the paddles are released, the keying continues by sending &quot;one more element&quot; than has already been heard. I.e., if the paddles were released during a &quot;dah&quot; then the last element sent will be a following &quot;dit&quot;; if the paddles were released during a &quot;dit&quot; then the sequence will end with the following &quot;dah&quot;.

Users accustomed to one mode may find it difficult to adapt to the other, so most modern keyers allow selection of the desired mode.

==== Mode ====
A third electronic keyer mode useful with a dual paddle is the &quot;Ultimatic&quot; mode (mode ), so-called for the brand name of the electronic keyer that introduced it. In the Ultimatic keying mode, the keyer will switch to the opposite element if the second lever is pressed before the first is released (that is, squeezed).

===Single-lever paddle keys===
A single-lever paddle key has separate contacts for &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot;, but there is no ability to make both contacts simultaneously by squeezing the paddles together for iambic mode.

When a single-paddle key is used with an electronic keyer, continuous &quot;dits&quot; are created by holding the &quot;dit&quot;-side paddle (...); likewise, continuous &quot;dahs&quot; are created by holding the &quot;dah&quot; paddle (...).

A single-paddle key can &quot;non&quot;-iambicly operate &quot;any&quot; electronic keyer, whether or not it even offers iambic functions, and regardless of whether the keyer iambically operates in mode , , or .

== Non-telegraphic keys ==
Simple telegraph-like keys were long used to control the flow of electricity in laboratory tests of electrical circuits. Often, these were simple &quot;strap&quot; keys, in which a bend in the key lever provided the key&#x27;s spring action.

Telegraph-like keys were once used in the study of operant conditioning with pigeons. Starting in the 1940s, initiated by B. F. Skinner at Harvard University, the keys were mounted vertically behind a small circular hole about the height of a pigeon&#x27;s beak in the front wall of an operant conditioning chamber. Electromechanical recording equipment detected the closing of the switch whenever the pigeon pecked the key. Depending on the psychological questions being investigated, keypecks might have resulted in the presentation of food or other stimuli.

==Operators&#x27; &quot;fist&quot;==
With straight keys, side-swipers, and, to an extent, bugs, each and every telegrapher has their own unique style or rhythm pattern when transmitting a message. An operator&#x27;s style is known as their &quot;fist&quot;.

Since every fist is unique, other telegraphers can usually identify the individual telegrapher transmitting a particular message. This had a huge significance during the first and second World Wars, since the on-board telegrapher&#x27;s &quot;fist&quot; could be used to track individual ships and submarines, and for traffic analysis.

However, with electronic keyers (either single- or double-paddle) this is no longer the case: Keyers produce uniformly &quot;perfect&quot; code at a set speed, which is altered at the request of the receiver, usually not the sender. Only inter-character and inter-word spacing remain unique to the operator, and can produce a less clear semblance of a &quot;fist&quot;.

<doc id="187557" wikidata="Q487" url="?curid=187557" title="Smile">
<text>A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. 
Among humans, a smile expresses , sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement. It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of anxiety known as a . Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world, there are large differences among different cultures, religions, and societies, with some using smiles to convey confusion, embarrassment or awkwardness.

== Evolutionary background ==
Primatologist Signe Preuschoft traces the smile back over 30 million years of evolution to a &quot;fear grin&quot; stemming from monkeys and apes, who often used barely clenched teeth to portray to predators that they were harmless or to signal submission to more dominant group members. The smile may have evolved differently among species, especially among humans.

== Social effects ==
Smiling seems to have a favorable influence upon others and makes one &quot;likable&quot; and more &quot;approachable&quot;. In the social context, smiling and laughter have different functions in the order of sequence in social situations:
* Smiling is sometimes a pre-laughing device and is a common pattern for paving the way to laughter;
* Smiling can be used as a response to laughter.

Smiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information in many different forms. One of these is an advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing sex appeal. However, recent research indicates a man&#x27;s smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective. The researchers did not explicitly study the role of smiles in other sexual preferences.

=== As reinforcement and manipulation ===
The influence of smiling on others is not necessarily benign. It may take the form of positive reinforcement, possibly for an underhand manipulative and abusive purpose.

== Cultural differences ==
While smiling is perceived as a positive emotion most of the time, there are many cultures that perceive smiling as a negative expression and consider it unwelcoming. Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or dishonesty. In some parts of Asia, people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the former Soviet Union area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior, or even a sign of stupidity.

Systematic large cross-cultural study on social perception of smiling individuals documented that in some cultures a smiling individual may be perceived as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual (and that cultural uncertainty avoidance may explain these differences). Furthermore, the same study showed that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smiling—in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced.

There can also be gender differences. In the United States and Canada, women report men telling them to smile. For example, Greg Rickford, a member of the Canadian Parliament told a female journalist to smile rather than answer the question she had asked. Biological anthropologist Helen Fisher states that, while this could be either caring or controlling behavior, such behavior is unlikely to be welcome.

== Dimples ==

Cheek dimples are formed secondary to a bifid zygomaticus major muscle, whose fascial strands insert into the dermis and cause a dermal tethering effect. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait. Having bilateral dimples (dimples in both cheeks) is the most common form of cheek dimples. A rarer form is the single dimple, which occurs on one side of the face only.

This bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the zygomatic bone. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth. Dimples are analogous and how they form in cheeks varies from person to person. The shape of a person&#x27;s face can affect the look and form as well: leptoprosopic (long and narrow) faces have long and narrow dimples, and eryprosopic (short and broad) faces have short, circular dimples. People with a mesoprosopic face are more likely to have dimples in their cheeks than any other face shape.

== Duchenne smile ==

While conducting research on the physiology of facial expressions in the mid-19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne identified two distinct types of smiles. A Duchenne smile involves contraction of both the zygomatic major muscle (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the orbicularis oculi muscle (which raises the cheeks and forms crow&#x27;s feet around the eyes). The Duchenne smile has been described as &quot;smizing&quot;, as in &quot;smiling with the eyes&quot;. An exaggerated Duchenne smile is sometimes associated with lying.

== Non-Duchenne smile ==
A non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscle. According to Messenger &quot;et. al.&quot; &quot;Research with adults initially indicated that joy was indexed by generic smiling, any smiling involving the raising of the lip corners by the zygomatic major ... More recent research suggests that smiling in which the muscle around the eye contracts, raising the cheeks high (Duchenne smiling), is uniquely associated with positive emotion.&quot;

The &quot;Pan Am smile&quot;, also known as the &quot;Botox smile&quot;, is the name given to a fake smile, in which only the zygomatic major muscle is voluntarily contracted to show politeness. It is named after the now-defunct airline Pan American World Airways, whose flight attendants would always flash every passenger the same perfunctory smile. Botox was introduced for cosmetic use in 2002. Chronic use of Botox injections to deal with eye wrinkles can result in paralysis of the small muscles around the eyes, preventing the appearance of a Duchenne smile.

== Other animals ==

In other animals, the baring of teeth is often used as a threat or warning display—known as a snarl—or a sign of submission. For chimpanzees, it can also be a sign of fear. However, not all animal displays of teeth convey negative acts or emotions. For example, Barbary macaques demonstrate an open mouth display as a sign of playfulness, which likely has similar roots and purposes as the human smile.

<text>Erik Axelsson (Tott) ( – 1481) was a Dano-Swedish statesman who served as the regent of Sweden under the Kalmar Union, jointly with Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna in 1457 and alone from 1466 to 1467.

== Biography ==
He was born in Scania during the reign of King Eric of Pomerania, as the son of Axel Pedersen Thott, lord of Herlev and Lilloe, and his second wife Ingeborg Ivarsdotter. He entered the service of his mother&#x27;s first cousin, King Charles VIII of Sweden (), at an early age, when Charles was Lord High Constable and Castellan.

Erik Axelsson was the &quot;Swedish anchor&quot; of his family, of whom most regarded themselves as Danish subjects. His father&#x27;s first wife was from Scania, a region then integral to the (Danish) kingdom. In two generations during the latter half of the 15th century, the nine Tott brothers (&quot;Axelssöner&quot;), held high and mighty positions just when Denmark and Sweden were struggling to shape the Kalmar Union, however trying to preserve their own family&#x27;s position and often act in concert. A few of them changed sides in certain occasions, but mostly each of them aligned according to their most important personal landholdings. For longer periods Eric held for the Swedish crown the key Finnish castles and fiefdoms of Viborg, Tavastehus (and built Olofsborg), and was always on the Swedish side, accepting the Danish monarch when Swedish nobility wanted that, and supported separate state/monarchy when the Swedes wanted that. His brother, Iver Axelsen Tott, established a veritable principality for himself by taking the island of Gotland, and sometimes surrounding regions.

Eric opposed his older kinsman the king in 1457, when he as king had gathered much dissatisfaction among Swedish high nobility. In 1467, Eric yet again supported King Charles VIII in his third election. He acquired the former Swedish estates of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in 1467, including Årsta Castle. As overlord of Finland (&quot;Österland&quot;), he initiated the construction of the border fortress Olavinlinna in Savonlinna and the Vyborg town wall, both in the 1470s.

Eric Axelsson was married to Bengta Mattsdotter Lillie () and Elin Gustavsdotter Sture () but died childless. His brothers Ivar Tott () and Laurens Axelsson Tott () survived him, inheriting most of his properties, together with his various nephews and nieces.

== Tott&#x27;s Russian wars ==
Tott&#x27;s Russian wars refers to two conflicts between Russia and Sweden spanning from the years of 1475–1476, and then 1479–1482. They were both fought over the construction of fortifications at Nyslott.

=== Tott&#x27;s first Russian war ===
After the appointment of Erik Axelsson Tott as commander of Viborg in 1457, tensions began to rise with Novgorod. Despite a peace treaty being signed in 1468, the Russians engaged in raids along the border the same year. The situation was worsened by the fact that a truce signed in 1458 would expire in 1473.

In 1475, Tott began the construction of a fortification in Finland called Nyslott or Olofsborg, situated on an islet in the strait between Saimed and Haukivesi though it is unclear whether it was in Swedish or Russian territory. Under these circumstances, the construction led to increased Russian activity in the area. The Swedes had begun requiring a tax for the defense of the east and began equipping troops for this purpose. The commander of these troops was likely the knight Erik Karlsson Vase.

The fighting between the Swedes and Russians was however likely to have only been in smaller patrols, and a peace was eventually signed in 1476.

=== Tott&#x27;s second Russian war ===
The construction of Nyslott continued despite the renewed peace between Russia and Sweden in 1476 and became an issue for the Russians. Erik Axelsson Tott, the commander of Viborg and also responsible for Nyslott, prepares and awaits himself for a large attack by the Russians. Nyslott was at that point extended from having only dirt and wood defenses to stone.

In 1479, the awaited attack occurred, and the Russians launched a raid in the area of Nyslott; however, specific details of the event are not known. In 1480, as revenge for this attack, Tott committed to a revenge attack against the Russians. He had earlier received reinforcements from Sweden and advanced into Russian territory. According to Olaus Petris, the incursion was extremely brutal, quoting that the Swedes &quot;killed both people and animals, men and women, young and old, to several thousands&quot;.

In 1481, Tott died and was succeeded by his brother Lars Axelsson, who continued the conflict until 1482, when he signed a truce which would remain until 1495.

<text>Brian Wilson Presents Smile (also referred to as Smile or the abbreviation BWPS) is the fifth studio album by American musician Brian Wilson, released on September 28, 2004 on Nonesuch. It features all-new recordings of music that he had originally created for &quot;Smile&quot;, an unfinished album by the Beach Boys that he abandoned in 1967. Revisiting &quot;Smile&quot; was an intense emotional undertaking for Wilson, as he had been deeply traumatized by the circumstances that had originally surrounded the project.

Wilson initially agreed to revisit &quot;Smile&quot; in the form of a live concert performance as a follow-up to his 2000–2002 tour for the Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. From October to November 2003, he worked with keyboardist Darian Sahanaja and original lyricist Van Dyke Parks in assembling a three-movement structure for &quot;BWPS&quot; while embellishing the material with newly written lyrics and melodies. Wilson and his band premiered it at the Royal Festival Hall in London on February 20, 2004. Motivated by the positive reception, he then adapted the performance as a studio-recorded solo album. None of the other Beach Boys were involved with &quot;BWPS&quot;, nor with the documentary that covered its making, &quot;Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of Smile&quot;.

&quot;BWPS&quot; was universally acclaimed by critics and peaked at number 13 in the US and number 7 in the UK. It earned Wilson his first Grammy Award, winning in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance for &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s Cow&quot;. In 2011, the album&#x27;s sequencing served as a blueprint for &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;, a compilation dedicated to the original Beach Boys recordings. In 2020, &quot;BWPS&quot; was ranked number 399 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==
In 1967, due to numerous difficulties surrounding the project, Brian Wilson abandoned &quot;Smile&quot;, an unfinished album that he had recorded with his band the Beach Boys, lyricist Van Dyke Parks, and numerous session musicians. The band substituted its release with &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, a downscaled version, and a legend subsequently grew around the original &quot;Smile&quot; recordings. In the 1980s, unreleased material from its recording sessions began circulating widely on bootlegs, which inspired many fans to compile a hypothetical version of the completed album. Among these fans were Los Angeles-based musicians Darian Sahanaja, Probyn Gregory, and Nick Walusko, all of whom later formed the band Wondermints.

In 1995, Wilson reteamed with Parks for the collaborative album &quot;Orange Crate Art&quot;, which provoked speculation regarding a future release of &quot;Smile&quot;. Instead, Wilson indicated that he was more interested in completing a forthcoming collaboration with musician Andy Paley. That year, Paley invited Wilson to a concert at the Morgan-Wixon Theater in Los Angeles, a show which featured the Wondermints performing a rendition of &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. After the concert, Wilson remarked to Paley, &quot;If I&#x27;d had these guys back in &#x27;67, I could&#x27;ve taken &quot;Smile&quot; on the road.&quot;

In late 1998, the Wondermints accepted an offer from Wilson&#x27;s wife Melinda Ledbetter to join Wilson&#x27;s live band, a group that included guitarist Jeffrey Foskett, multi-instrumentalist Scott Bennett, reed player Paul Mertens, bassist Bob Lizik, and backing vocalist Taylor Mills. Their first tour was successful, and from 2000 to 2002, Wilson followed up with another, this time playing the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album in its entirety.

==Announcement==
Wilson had been psychologically scarred by the making of &quot;Smile&quot; and regarded the album as his life&#x27;s greatest failure. Sahanaja recalled, &quot;When I first met Brian, you couldn&#x27;t even mention the words &#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27;; he&#x27;d turn around and walk away or he&#x27;d say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to talk about it.&#x27;&quot; In December 2000, while at a Christmas party at Bennett&#x27;s house, Wilson was playing songs on piano when the wife of biographer David Leaf called out a request for &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;. To the astonishment of everyone present, Wilson began playing and singing the song. He then agreed to perform the song with his band at a forthcoming tribute show held in his honor at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. At the concert, various artists performed renditions of Wilson&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Our Prayer&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, with Wilson&#x27;s band providing accompaniment. A performance of &quot;Cabinessence&quot; was considered, but dropped due to its complexity.

Following the concert, Ledbetter and Sahanaja successfully petitioned Wilson to add &quot;Our Prayer&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; into his regular setlists. &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and a medley of &quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Cabinessence&quot; were also added. Within a few months, Wilson performed &quot;Prayer&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; during his appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. According to Sahanaja, &quot;It was like little baby steps all the way.&quot; While rehearsing for the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; concerts in January 2002, Sahanaja attended a lunch meeting with Wilson, Ledbetter, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; show promoter Glenn Maxx. At one point, someone joked, &quot;The only thing that could ever top this is to do music from &quot;Smile&quot;&quot;. Unusual for Wilson, he did not voice an objection to the idea.

In 2003, during the recording of his forthcoming album &quot;Gettin&#x27; in over My Head&quot;, Wilson permitted his managers to schedule shows that would include the live debut of &quot;Smile&quot;. On May 22, while he was in London to accept an Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement, it was announced that Wilson and his band would perform a live interpretation of &quot;Smile&quot; in February 2004 at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Parks, who had attended the Radio City Music Hall concert, was not originally involved, nor was he contacted about the project beforehand, and only learned about it through the press.

The news elicited some mixed reactions from fans of Wilson who felt that his attempt to complete &quot;Smile&quot; would destroy the legendary quality associated with the project. Sahanaja remembered that, during their meetings over the summer, Wilson did not appear interested in the project. He said, &quot;I knew there were a lot of people who were very familiar with this stuff, and for most of them even touching &quot;Smile&quot; was sacrilege. I was of that same mindset, but then Brian gradually started getting into it.&quot;

==Preparation==

===Planning and collaboration===
The project was not approached as an attempt to complete &quot;Smile&quot;. Initially, the band&#x27;s goal was only to assemble a cohesive live set of &quot;Smile&quot; material that had been released to that point. To assist with the assembly, Sahanaja was assigned the role of &quot;musical secretary&quot; for Wilson and in early autumn 2003, was sent to the Beach Boys&#x27; tape vaults to download select recordings to his laptop. Sahanaja consulted bootlegs that he had amassed since the early 1980s, as well as an archive of literature belonging to David Leaf, which included photocopies of handwritten lyric sheets that were originally given to illustrator Frank Holmes in 1966.

With Pro Tools session files loaded onto his Apple G3 iBook, Sahanaja joined Wilson at his home on numerous occasions to listen to the recordings and determine how they were originally supposed to function together. To relieve Wilson from the burden of deconstructing and reconstructing his own music, Sahanaja handled the task for him by transcribing the recordings as much as he possibly could, then presenting the resultant work back to him for necessary adjustments. At first, Sahanaja presented only the recurring motifs and chord patterns of the songs before moving onto any lyrics. Wilson had resisted listening to the original recordings, but eventually went through with the task. He later said that listening to the recordings &quot;reawakened the bad feelings of the drugs, not the music. The music was good vibes. The drugs were bad vibes. I had a bad flashback, but we got over it right away.&quot;

In Sahanaja&#x27;s recollection, &quot;He&#x27;d be saying, &#x27;Oh yeah, that&#x27;s supposed to be a part of this song,&#x27; or &#x27;Use that bit to connect these two songs here,&#x27; and it was really neat.&quot; However, on another occasion, Sahanaja said that Wilson did not assert his original ideas for the album: &quot;Brian Wilson is not going to tell you in October/November of 2003, &#x27;No, this was supposed to be like this.&#x27; If anything, he was terrified at first, but as he became more comfortable, we just went with his gut. And nine times out of ten, his gut is &quot;Smile&quot;.&quot;

Early in these sessions, the pair were working on the song &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot; when they ran into issues reading the handwriting of its lyric sheet. Wilson swiftly phoned Parks, who he had not spoken to in years, and immediately asked what word came after &quot;cheering&quot;. Parks asked Wilson to fax him the lyric sheet, and within minutes, Parks called back and clarified that the word was &quot;Indians&quot;. After Wilson and Sahanaja finished their work for that day, Wilson called Parks again and had a lengthier conversation, during which Parks accepted the invitation to join the project.

Parks returned to his original role as the project&#x27;s lyricist. He was not involved with the sequencing of the tracks, preferring to leave those decisions to Wilson. In the interest of preserving the &quot;integrity&quot; of their work, Sahanaja took on a less active role, contributing to the discussions only when the songwriters were struggling with &quot;how to pull something off live&quot;. Wilson later stated that he could recall very little of &quot;Smile&quot; until Parks entered the project. Parks himself had not listened to any of the &quot;Smile&quot; music in decades. According to Sahanaja,

Wilson, Parks, and Sahanaja configured the presentation into three movements. The third effectively constituted songs that were leftover from the other two movements, and in Sahanaja&#x27;s description, &quot;the stuff that was the riskiest&quot; from Wilson&#x27;s point of view. Sahanaja said: &quot;At that point, he [Brian] and Van Dyke were talking as if they were finishing &quot;Smile&quot;.&quot;

===Original &quot;Smile&quot; differences===
According to Wilson, &quot;BWPS&quot; reimagined the original &quot;Smile&quot; concept &quot;from scratch&quot;. Asked for a comparison, he responded that the new version was &quot;different, much different. Much more progressive, much happier, much more uplifting.&quot; Parks provided lyrics that had been written in the 1960s but not previously documented, and some that were newly written for the project. He believed that a hypothetical 1967 version of &quot;Smile&quot; would not have been significantly different from their 2004 version.

Sahanaja believed that there were two exceptions in which Wilson clearly recalled ideas that he had originally conceived for the &quot;Smile&quot; album. One was the verse melody of &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot;; the other was the pairing of &quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Look&quot;. Regarding the latter, Sahanaja said that &quot;Brian just butted those two together and said, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s how it goes!&#x27;&quot; When he asked Parks if an idea was part of the original concept, Parks would only respond with, &quot;It was inevitable.&quot;

A number of short, orchestral segues between songs were newly written for the project by Wilson, Parks, Sahanaja, and Paul Mertens. They also wrote a string arrangement for the second part of &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, an idea that Wilson said he originally intended for the piece. Some of the titles of the original tracks were changed, including &quot;Do You Like Worms?&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Roll Plymouth Rock&quot;. Wilson explained that this was because &quot;we wanted something a little more appropriate&quot;. When Wilson was presented &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s Cow&quot;, he began humming the melody from &quot;Fall Breaks and Back to Winter&quot;, which was then incorporated into the piece.

In Wilson&#x27;s words, &quot;We [first] thought of it as 2-movement rock opera. Then we added a third [and] we called it a 3-movement rock opera.&quot; The subtitles for these movements (&quot;Americana&quot;, &quot;Cycle of Life&quot;, and &quot;Spiritual Rebirth—Elements&quot;) were the invention of music writer Peter Reum. In a 2011 interview, Sahanaja stated that Wilson never mentioned an &quot;elemental&quot; concept during these sessions: &quot;whenever I did bring up the concept he didn&#x27;t seem to react to it with any enthusiasm. I brought it up again while Van Dyke was around and didn&#x27;t get a clear reaction from him either.&quot; According to biographer Steven Gaines, Wilson had declared an intention to complete &quot;Smile&quot; in three movements in 1980.

Besides the tracks that made it into the final presentation, nothing else from the original &quot;Smile&quot; sessions was worked on, although some recordings were presented to Wilson for consideration. Among the rejected ideas that Sahanaja played for Wilson was &quot;He Gives Speeches&quot;, &quot;With Me Tonight&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Bald&quot;, and the alternate &quot;rock with me, Henry&quot; version of &quot;Wonderful&quot;.

===Rehearsals===

Rehearsals began in January 2004, at which point Leaf had arrived with a film crew set on documenting the project. Wilson was still intensely troubled by his memories of &quot;Smile&quot; and the prospects of performing it live. He began struggling with a resurgence of auditory hallucinations. Sahanaja recalled that, after the holiday break, when he returned to Wilson&#x27;s house to prepare for the forthcoming vocal rehearsals, &quot;I remember him shaking and he sat down and he started crying and yelling &#x27;I&#x27;m fucked! I&#x27;m fucked!&#x27;&quot; They attempted to work on a few songs before Wilson threw the lyric sheet across the room and began shouting from the other room, &quot;Darian! Darian! They are trying to kill me! They are trying to kill me!&quot;

On the first day of rehearsals, Wilson had a panic attack and drove himself to the emergency room at a nearby hospital, but calmed down within hours. His attendance for the rest of the rehearsal dates remained inconsistent, as he would leave prematurely on some days, and on others, skip them entirely. Sahanaja told biographer Mark Dillon, &quot;There&#x27;s always the question of whether you&#x27;re forcing Brian to do something he doesn&#x27;t want to do. But in the end, do you want a Brian Wilson who just sits at home, watching TV, or should you try to put a spark under him and get him going to the point where it is a productive, positive thing for him?&quot;

==Initial concerts==
===Premiere===

&quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot; premiered at the Royal Festival Hall on February 20, 2004. It was bookended by two setlists consisting of regular Beach Boys hits such as &quot;Sloop John B&quot; and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, lesser-known songs such as &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot; and &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot;, and songs from &quot;Gettin&#x27; in Over My Head&quot;. The first set was played acoustically in the style of &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot;; Wilson sat on a stool surrounded by his supporting band, who provided additional vocals, two guitars, bongos, and an occasional flute or harmonica part.

When &quot;Smile&quot; completed its debut, Wilson received a ten-minute standing ovation before he was able to invite Parks, who was in tears, onstage. According to Sahanaja, &quot;the standing ovation was indescribable. I had never seen anything like it as an audience member or a performer. [...]They wouldn&#x27;t let him speak or say anything. [...] I stepped up to him and said, &#x27;Uh, Brian... I think they like &quot;SMiLE&quot;.&#x27;&quot; For the encore, Parks performed shaker on &quot;Do It Again&quot;. Sahanaja reported that, after the show, Wilson rocked back and forth backstage—out of relief that he had finally conquered his fear of &quot;Smile&quot;—exclaiming &quot;Darian! Darian! We did it! We did it!&quot;

The concerts were repeated at the same venue for every night until February 26, with each playing recorded by engineer Mark Linett for posterity on film and a 48-track Genex hard disk recorder. All the dates were sold-out, with attendees including Paul McCartney, George Martin, and Jason Pierce of Spiritualized. A brief tour followed in England and Europe.

===Reviews===
Critical reaction was highly favorable. &quot;The Guardian&quot; declared that it was &quot;one of the greatest of American symphonies.&quot; John Mulvey wrote in &quot;NME&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s rare that you can honestly say you were present at a moment of genuine historic significance. And it&#x27;s rarer still that the reality of these occasions measures up to the hype.&quot; In March, &quot;GQ&quot; ranked &quot;BWPS&quot; among the &quot;Top Five Gigs of All Time&quot;. Parks attended several more of Wilson&#x27;s shows, commenting, &quot;It&#x27;s absolutely thrilling. I did two shows in London, two in New York and two in LA, and you can&#x27;t help but be engaged in seeing the performance. The audience was very much a part of what the performance was all about.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;The Times&quot;″ Stephen Dalton was skeptical of the album&#x27;s myth and felt that most of the performance &quot;sounded like whimsical juvenilia. It was clearly adventurous for its era but, with the best will in the world, it is not difficult to see why Wilson&#x27;s [...] fellow Beach Boys balked at releasing it.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Jim Irvin was similarly underwhelmed; although he enjoyed the songs, he wrote, &quot;To claim that this show was transcendent is to disregard the figure at its heart, a bewildered-looking man of 61 who barely plays the piano he&#x27;s perched behind. [...] its hard to feel uplifted, as such.&quot; Critic Barney Hoskyns wrote that it was &quot;a pretty magnificent evening&quot;, although Wilson&#x27;s apathetic demeanor resembled that of an autistic person&#x27;s. Hoskyns mused, &quot;As bizarrely not-there as Brian seemed through all of this, he seemed to be enjoying himself as much as he is able to. Occasionally he flapped his arms about, and he made a big point of introducing &#x27;Marcella&#x27; as a real &#x27;rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&#x27; song – as though that were what we secretly craved.&quot;

==Studio recording==

Motivated by the positive reception, Wilson agreed to record a studio version of &quot;Smile&quot; after two weeks of consideration. Recording began on April 13, 2004 with his ten-piece touring band, augmented by a ten-piece string section and an acoustic bassist. The basic tracks were recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in four days, with overdubbing and mixing continuing until July with some stops at engineer Mark Linett&#x27;s Your Place or Mine studio.

When played live, digital keyboards were used to replicate the sound of various instruments such as harpsichord and tack piano, and electric drums were used in place of timpanis. These digital keyboards were kept for the album&#x27;s recording, though a real upright piano and timpani was used. Some alterations were also made to tracks&#x27; specific arrangements, since they had been arranged with an audience in mind, along with the logistics of only having ten performers on stage. Linett explained: &quot;For the studio version of &quot;Smile&quot;, Brian and the band eliminated some of the flourishes that were designed just for live performance and substantially reworked the instrumental arrangements.&quot; Most engineering for the album followed practices that were common during the 1960s, and tracks were recorded and sequenced in discrete sections the same as they would have been on the original &quot;Smile&quot;. The vocals were recorded using a Universal Audio tube mixing console identical to the one used by the Beach Boys at United Western Recorders in the 1960s.

The album was recorded onto a custom Pro Tools HD rig. Mixing was completed in late July, just as the band were to begin their tour of Europe. Wilson mostly avoided the mixing sessions. Linett said, &quot;Brian would come in, make comments, take stuff home, then make more comments. The third time he came in, I gave him a CD and I said: &#x27;Hey, there it is. &quot;Smile&quot;, ready to play on your CD player.&#x27; I swear you could see something change in him. And he&#x27;s been different ever since.&quot; According to Sahanaja, Wilson held the CD to his chest and said, &quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m going to hold this dear to my heart.&#x27; He was trembling.&quot;

==Release==

In an interview from October 2004, Wilson was asked what completing &quot;Smile&quot; had meant to him, and he responded:

On September 28, 2004, &quot;BWPS&quot; was issued on Nonesuch Records. It debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the highest chart position of any album by the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson since 1976&#x27;s &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, and it was the best-selling album on Amazon for two weeks. On September 28, Wilson appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; performing &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;. On October 5, Leaf&#x27;s documentary &quot;Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of Smile&quot; premiered on the Showtime network. The film included interviews with Wilson and dozens of his associates, albeit none of his surviving bandmates from the Beach Boys, who declined to appear in the film. It was later included on the DVD of a &quot;Smile&quot; concert performed in Los Angeles. By February 2005, Nielson Soundscan had reported that the album had sold over 300,000 copies. It was certified platinum in combination with its international sales.

From autumn 2004 to summer 2005, Wilson supported the album with a world tour that included stops in the US, Europe, and Japan. In March 2005, Wilson, Parks, and Leaf held a panel at the annual South by Southwest convention in Austin, Texas to discuss &quot;Smile&quot;. Asked if he would permit the release of the original Beach Boys recordings, Wilson responded, &quot;Never. Those are gone forever. I don&#x27;t want those made public because they bring up bad memories. I don&#x27;t think about the old days anymore. I never do.&quot; Sahanaja told &quot;Australian Musician&quot;, &quot;In six years of touring this is the happiest we&#x27;ve ever seen Brian, I mean consistently happy and it&#x27;s got to be because of the music. [...] Who would have thought … of all things…&quot;Smile&quot;.&quot;

==Contemporary critical reception==
&quot;BWPS&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, &quot;Smile&quot; received an average score of 97 based on 29 reviews, making it the third-highest rated album in the website&#x27;s history.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Robert Christgau, who was skeptical of &quot;Smile&quot; back in the 1960s, praised Parks&#x27; lyrics and wrote, &quot;what elevates them into something approaching a utopian vision is Wilson&#x27;s orchestrations: brief bridge melodies, youthful harmonies [...] and an enthralling profusion of instrumental colors.&quot; Dominique Leone of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; declared, &quot;As the mythical follow-up to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, it delivers, and despite his age, Wilson&#x27;s voice even sounds fantastic, still carrying the weight of these angelic melodies.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Tom Smucker felt that it might go on to be considered &quot;album of the year&quot; and described it as &quot;the first successfully conceptualized Beach Boys release since &quot;Kokomo&quot;, the most moving since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, and the funniest since &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;&quot;.

In Britain, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alexis Petridis wrote that news of the album&#x27;s release caused &quot;an outbreak of mild hysteria&quot; and provoked a journalist from the newspaper to solicit an opinion from the British government, who then supplied a comment from defense secretary Geoff Hoon. Petridis concluded, &quot;Despite the hype, it is hard not to be impressed with the new &quot;Smile&quot;. [...] the songs Wilson wrote for &quot;Smile&quot; still sound like nothing else rock music has ever produced. Its release may not warrant a quote from the defence secretary, but only the hardest heart would not be gladdened by its contents.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot;″s reviewer compared &quot;BWPS&quot; favorably to Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot; (&quot;its interweaved and repeated melodic strands&quot;), Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (&quot;its sheer contemplative beauty&quot;), and the work of George Gershwin and Aaron Copland (&quot;its appropriation of American folk&quot;). In his review for &quot;Mojo&quot;, Mark Paytress rated &quot;BWPS&quot; higher than the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, as well as any &quot;latter-day art-rock classic, say, Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;&quot;. Acknowledging the &quot;issues of authenticity that arise out of this &#x27;reconstruction&#x27;&quot;, he added, &quot;as someone with a small collection of &quot;Smile&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) — and thus with one eyebrow sharply raised — I&#x27;m amazed how easy it is to believe that this is, perhaps, the genuine &quot;Smile&quot;.&quot;

Less favorably, music critic Paul Morley felt that &quot;BWPS&quot; represented &quot;a breathtaking example of ultimately banal thinkers attempting self-consciously to make art, a square version of freaking out, musically sophisticated, aesthetically conservative [...] I needed a quick shower of Ramones, Dre and Hendrix afterwards, just to rinse away the clingy bits of fake myth.&quot; John Bush of AllMusic believed &quot;BWPS&quot; was &quot;a remarkably unified, irresistible piece of pop music&quot;, yet decreed that it was &quot;no musical watershed on par with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; [...] or Wilson&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;&quot;. Writing in his 2005 book about &quot;Smile&quot;, Domenic Priore opined, &quot;The recording sessions for the album at Sunset Sound came and went very quickly, and the mix suffers because of this; the emphasis on bass is not what it should be, and the tracks should breathe more. Some felt that there was too much singing, compared with the instrumental texture of the original tapes.&quot;

&quot;BWPS&quot; received three nominations for the 2005 Grammy Awards, including Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical (for Mark Linett). It won one Grammy, in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance for &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s Cow&quot;. &quot;Smile&quot; also finished in second place in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual critics poll run by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it fifth best album of 2004 and the 25th best album released between 2000 and 2004.

==Beach Boys&#x27; response and lawsuit==
Mike Love gave his thoughts on the album in a November 2004 interview: &quot;I guess it&#x27;s a good thing for Brian to do. A friend sent me a copy, but I haven&#x27;t had time to hear it yet because we&#x27;ve been on tour.&quot; In an earlier interview, he had said he would have no interest in listening to the album and citing the legal concept of &quot;corporate opportunity&quot;, mentioned that it had possibly infringed on the Beach Boys&#x27; intellectual property rights. Love argued that, because the group had collectively paid for the 1960s recording sessions and all contributed work on the original tracks, &quot;I would have thought it would have been more honorable to put it together as the Beach Boys.&quot;

In many interviews he gave around the album&#x27;s release, Wilson disparaged the Beach Boys, calling them inferior to his current band. In a 2007 interview, Love expressed that he was disappointed to hear about Wilson&#x27;s remarks. &quot;I&#x27;m glad that he&#x27;s happy with the people he&#x27;s performing with, but, you know, I think it&#x27;s sad that he thinks that. My personal feeling is that the original group recordings on &quot;Smile&quot; have got to be better.&quot; Bruce Johnston took offense as well, writing in an email to biographer Peter Ames Carlin: &quot;I spent years showing full support for Brian, but now that&#x27;s all changed because of his current point of view.&quot; Johnston said of the album in a 2008 interview, &quot;I think as an exercise in keeping [Wilson] occupied, it&#x27;s interesting. [...] I talk to him every once in a while. But I&#x27;m never going to tell him that I&#x27;ll take &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; over what he&#x27;s doing now.&quot;

One of the promotions for the album was a free CD issued through the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; in September 2004. The 10-track compilation included Beach Boys songs Wilson had recently rerecorded, five of which he coauthored with Love. The &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; distributed 2.6 million copies of the compilation. In November 2005, Love filed a lawsuit in which he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings. Love&#x27;s suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were &quot;no triable issues of material fact&quot;.

Al Jardine said in 2013 that he &quot;didn&#x27;t give it a whole lot of thought; I didn&#x27;t want to go there at that time. They were good enough to send me a copy. So I dropped the needle, as they used to say, and listened to a few cuts, and it was very nice. But there&#x27;s nothin&#x27; like the [vintage recordings].&quot; 

==Retrospective assessments and legacy==
Although critics widely referred to Wilson&#x27;s 2004 version as the &quot;Smile&quot; album completed, many fans disputed the notion. Bootleggers continued to compile their own versions of the Beach Boys&#x27; album. In 2011, &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot; was released containing an approximation of what the band&#x27;s finished album might have sounded like, using &quot;BWPS&quot; as a blueprint. Linett co-produced the compilation with Wilson. According to Sahanaja, Wilson &quot;lobbied hard&quot; for the album&#x27;s sequence to be based on &quot;BWPS&quot;. In a 2015 interview, Wilson stated that he ultimately preferred his solo version.

Reviewing &quot;BWPS&quot; on the tenth anniversary of its release, Chris Shields of the &quot;St. Cloud Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the sequencing raised a question mark or two, and there were mixing quibbles (I would have loved to hear more bass), but [...] [t]he lyrical beauty, the majesty of the music, the shifting (yet somehow fixed) meanings that intertwine throughout it all, still elate me, still fill me with hope and joy.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Sean Murphy opined that the album was &quot;crucial&quot;, but rendered &quot;less significant&quot; with the availability of &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;. Writing for &quot;NewMusicBox&quot;, Frank Oteri called &quot;BWPS&quot; &quot;a wonderful album, but it is also not quite right. It is not and can never be a substitute for &quot;SMiLE&quot;&quot;. Music historian Clinton Heylin, who felt that the original &quot;Smile&quot; recordings failed to live up to the myth, characterized &quot;BWPS&quot; as &quot;a pale shadow full of digital tweaks, and precious little sweet inspiration; showing if anything that there &quot;never&quot; was a realised record&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;BWPS&quot; was named the 88th best album of the decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2010, it was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2020, it was ranked number 399 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The editors wrote, &quot;Close your eyes and you can imagine how it might&#x27;ve changed the world in 1968 , but with Wilson&#x27;s influence still all over scads of indie bands in 2004, it sounds and feels majestically modern.&quot; In 2022, it was ranked number 102 on &quot;Uncut&quot;″s list of the greatest albums released since 1997, as well as number 21 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the greatest concept albums in history.

<text>Put My Dream on This Planet is the 29th album by Jandek. It was his only new release of 2000 (note that there were numerous reissues of the oldest material). The first of three consecutive a capella albums, it is Corwood Industries #0767.

Initially thought by fans to have been recorded on a voice-activated microcassette recorder, Jandek clarified in his 2014 cover interview for &quot;The Wire&quot; that he recorded this album, as well as the two a capella followups, &quot;This Narrow Road&quot; and &quot;Worthless Recluse&quot;, on a standard consumer-grade cassette recorder, and that the pauses in the recording were removed per his request with a noise reduction gate during the mastering stage.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that &quot;Jandek sounds old, with a deep, grainy, Johnny Cash-like voice that appears to be recorded by a portable microphone, as opposed to a crisp studio recording.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; thought that the album &quot;would try the patience of the saints of any faith.&quot;

<doc id="187584" wikidata="Q474100" url="?curid=187584" title="Pyrotechnics">
<text>Pyrotechnics is the science and craft of creating such things as fireworks, safety matches, oxygen candles, explosive bolts and other fasteners, parts of automotive airbags, as well as gas-pressure blasting in mining, quarrying, and demolition. This trade relies upon self-contained and self-sustained exothermic chemical reactions to make heat, light, gas, smoke and/or sound. The name comes from the Greek words &quot;pyr&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) and &quot;tekhnikos&quot; (&quot;made by art&quot;).

Improper use of pyrotechnics could lead to pyrotechnic accidents. People responsible for the safe storage, handling, and functioning of pyrotechnic devices are known as pyrotechnicians.

==Proximate pyrotechnics==
Explosions, flashes, smoke, flames, fireworks and other pyrotechnic-driven effects used in the entertainment industry are referred to as proximate pyrotechnics. Proximate refers to the pyrotechnic device&#x27;s location relative to an audience. In the majority of jurisdictions, special training and licensing must be obtained from local authorities to legally prepare and use proximate pyrotechnics.

Many musical groups use pyrotechnics to enhance their live shows. Pink Floyd were innovators of pyrotechnic use in concerts. For instance, at the climax of their song &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot;, a blast of smoke was set off at the back of the stage. Bands such as the Who, KISS and Queen soon followed with the use of pyrotechnics in their shows. Michael Jackson attempted to use pyrotechnics in a 1984 Pepsi advertisement, where a stray spark caused a small fire in his hair. German industrial metal band Rammstein are renowned for their incorporation of a large variety of pyrotechnics into performances, which range from flaming costumes to face-mounted flamethrowers. Nightwish, Lordi, Sabaton and Parkway Drive are also known for their vivid pyrotechnics in concert. Many professional wrestlers have also used pyrotechnics as part of their entrances to the ring.

Modern pyrotechnics are, in general, divided into categories based upon the type of effect produced or manufacturing method. The most common categories are:

*Airburst – Hanging charges designed to burst into spheres of sparks. Primarily used to provide an effect similar to an aerial shell without producing fallout. May also be designed to launch pieces of confetti or streamers. A plurality of airbursts is usually achieved with a harness.
*Binary powders – Kits divided into separate oxidizer and fuel, intended to be mixed on site before being loaded into hardware.
*Comet (meteor) – Brightly colored burning pellets resembling shooting stars. These are no larger than 50mm for proximate use. Crossette comets carry a small cavity filled with a small amount of burst charge in the middle which causes the stars to split into four pieces. Crossette comets are usually no larger than 45mm for proximate use.
*Flame Mortars – These articles use a smokeless powder-based composition to produce a rising column or a rolling ball of fire in various colors. Duration is typically 5 seconds or less for proximate pyrotechnics, and the diameter is usually 1 to 4 inches.
*Flare – Cylindrical tubes containing a pressed pyrotechnic composition intended to produce a bright flame of various colors. Proximate flares are usually 2 to 6 inches in length and 0.5-1 inches in diameter, and may last 60 seconds or longer.
*Flash Paper/Flash String/Flash Cotton – Stored and transported when wet with either water or alcohol, these are different forms of nitrocellulose which burn with very little smoke or ash, and are popularly used as hand flashes for magicians, amongst other uses.
*Flash Trays – A preloaded tube 6 to 18 inches in length with a slit cut between the two end plugs. Used to produce a fan pattern flash and spray of sparks.
*Flash Pots – Preloaded cylindrical tubes 2 to 4 inches long and 0.5 to 1 inches in diameter used to emit bright flashes of light, often with a bang or spray of sparks.
*Gerbs – Pyrotechnic fountains used to produce a controlled plume of sparks, and may be classified as fast gerbs or duration gerbs depending on the burn duration. Special waterfall gerbs are often used to produce an effect similar to a waterfall, using several hung upside down in a line.
*Line Rockets – A device attached to a line specifically to produce thrust. Usually has a duration of 5 seconds or less. May also produce a whistle effect.
*Ice Fountains – A gerb-type device with no choke specifically used to provide a low-smoke alternative to gerbs, at the cost of lower height.
*Mines – Devices containing multiple stars, propelled into the air using a lift charge. Special mine-comet effects feature both mines and comets in the same article.
*Mortar Hits – Produces a bright flash and a puff of smoke, and may be designed to produce noise in addition to the effect. Concussion mortars are special mortars exclusively used to produce loud bangs, and may be used to accentuate other effects.
*Multi-Shot Devices – Articles used to chain multiple effects together, may be timed or instantaneous.
*Smoke Cartridges – Used to produce a plume of smoke, duration and size vary greatly depending on the device used.
*Smoke Cookies – Compressed discs of pyrotechnic composition used to produce a smoke effect.
*Spark Hits – Used to simulate short circuits in an electrical panel.
*Saxons – Articles that produce revolving showers of sparks, consisting of two gerb-type devices pinned at the center.
*Shock Tubing – A special thermoplastic tube used to simulate lightning strikes and the resulting thunder, using special igniters.
*Strobe Pots – Used to produce multiple flashes of light.
Various ingredients may be added to pyrotechnic devices to provide colour, smoke, noise or sparks. Special additives and construction methods are used to modify the character of the effect produced, either to enhance or subdue the effect; for example, sandwiching layers of pyrotechnic compounds containing potassium perchlorate, sodium salicylate or sodium benzoate with layers that do not creates a fountain of sparks with an undulating whistle.

In general, such pyrotechnic devices are initiated by a remotely controlled electrical signal that causes an electric match, or e-match, to produce ignition. The remote control may be manual, via a switch console, or computer controlled according to a pre-programmed sequence and/or a sequence that tracks the live performance via stage cues.

==Display pyrotechnics==
Display pyrotechnics, also known as commercial fireworks, are pyrotechnic devices intended for use outdoors, where the audience can be further away, and smoke and fallout is less of a concern. Generally the effects, though often similar to proximate pyrotechnics, are of a larger size and more vigorous in nature. It will typically take an entire day to set up a professional fireworks display. This work is normally undertaken on temporarily secured locations by specialist companies employing teams of experienced pyrotechnicians.

In modern times a familiar feature of larger fireworks displays are aerial shells, which commonly appear as large spherical bursts of stars in the sky. The exterior of these shells are commonly made of a hard paper-adhesive layered composite which holds the interior stars arranged around a burst charge, or other pyrotechnic effects. Aerial shells are fired out of mortars from the ground and have internal timing fuses that accurately and reliably position their bursts. A continuous sequence of shells are launched, often with effects artistically choreographed to music and themes, accompanied by various types of ground effects. Modern fireworks displays are commonly executed to a designed program using electrical wiring and ignition linked to an electronic firing system. 

The size of these fireworks can range from 50 mm (2&quot;) to over 600 mm (24&quot;) diameter depending on the type of effect and available distance from the audience. In most jurisdictions, special fireworks training and licensing must be obtained from local authorities to legally prepare and use display pyrotechnics.

==Consumer pyrotechnics==
Consumer pyrotechnics are devices readily available for purchase to the general public with little or no special licensing or training. These items are considered &quot;relatively&quot; low hazard devices but, like all pyrotechnics, can still be hazardous and should be stored, handled and used appropriately. Some of the most common examples of consumer pyrotechnics encountered include recreational fireworks (including whistling and sparking types), model rocket motors, highway and marine distress flares, sparklers and caps for toy guns. Pyrotechnics are also indirectly involved in other consumer products such as powder actuated nail guns, ammunition for firearms, and modern fireplaces. Some types, including bird scarers, shell crackers, whistle crackers and flares, may be designed to be fired from a 12-gauge pistol or rifle.

==Safety==

Pyrotechnics are dangerous and must be handled and used properly. Recently, several high-profile incidents involving pyrotechnics have re-enforced the need to respect these explosives at all times. Proximate pyrotechnics is an area of expertise that requires additional training beyond that of other professional pyrotechnics areas and the use of devices specifically manufactured for indoor, close proximity use. Despite this, accidents can still happen due to the use of low-quality product, or due to an unexpected event, or even due to an error on the part of the operator.

===Homemade devices===

A common low-budget pyrotechnic flash pot is built using modified screw-in electric fuses in a common light fixture. The fuses are intentionally blown, acting as ignitors for a pyrotechnic material.

Homemade devices may fail to include safety features and can provide numerous hazards, including:

*A firing circuit using high-power, non-isolated AC line voltage can be a shock hazard to the operator and bystanders.
*The use of high-current fuses as ignitors can cause main circuit breakers and fuses to trip, due to the sudden inrush of hundreds of amperes through a dead-shorted circuit. Switches used to control ignition may be damaged from the high-current surges.
*There may not be indicators or interlocks preventing premature ignition of the pyrotechnic material. Screwing a powder-loaded fuse into an unknowingly powered socket will result in immediate ignition, injuring the operator.

Commercial flash pots include safety features such as warning pilot lamps, preignition grounding, and safing circuits. They also use isolated and low-voltage power sources, and have keyed power connections to help prevent accidental ignition.

Here, users can share and download files including photos, videos, audio files, books, programs, etc. Users that are actively sharing their files are generally referred to as &#x27;servers&#x27;, whereas users that download without sharing their own files are generally referred to as &#x27;leeches&#x27;. While serving normally implies pirated or questionable material, some channels are used for fully legitimate reasons. There are two styles of servers, Fserves, and serving scripts like OmenServe.

== Fserve type channels ==
Using an Fserve script, a server is set up like an FTP. Using CTCP commands and server triggers, a user can initiate a connection with the server. Once connected, the user will be given access to a server&#x27;s file archive.
*&quot;ex.: &quot;codice_1&quot;&quot;

=== Searching and requesting with Fserves ===
Once a leech has gained access to a server&#x27;s Fserve, they can navigate through folders using commands similar to DOS. Once inside a folder, the user is able to retrieve a listing of what files are found there.
*&quot;ex.: &quot;codice_2&quot; &amp; &quot;codice_3&quot; (to display files)&quot;

To request a file, the user enters a filename from the folder display listing, along with the &quot;codice_4&quot; command.
*&quot;ex.: &quot;codice_5&quot;&quot;

== Serving script type channels ==
Using a serving script, servers have the ability to send files directly to another user using remote commands. The serving script compiles a listing of available files, and also listens for a leech to request a file. Serving scripts also allow for a user to search all of the servers in a channel at the same time with a single command.

=== Searching and requesting with serving scripts ===
A user initiates a search by typing a &#x27;search command&#x27; followed by a &#x27;search string&#x27; within the channel window. Various search commands exist, including &#x27;@find&#x27;, &#x27;@search&#x27;, and &#x27;@seek&#x27;, depending on what serving script is being used. Wildcard characters such as * can also be used in the search string to simplify a search. The search command will then return a list of files to the user&#x27;s query window if any servers have a file that matches the search string.
*&quot;ex.: &quot;codice_6&quot;&quot;

If there are any matches for the user&#x27;s search string, the next step is to request those files from the server. The user can copy and paste the returned match, along with a short trigger command, from the query window directly into the channel window. The request is then placed in a file queue within the serving script, and downloaded on a first-come, first-served basis.
*&quot;ex.: &quot;codice_7&quot;&quot;

Users also have the ability to download the complete archive of a server&#x27;s available files, commonly called a &quot;list&quot; due to the .txt format that the script&#x27;s output code creates. To request a server&#x27;s list, there is a separate &#x27;list trigger&#x27; used.
*&quot;ex.: &quot;codice_8&quot;&quot;

<doc id="187586" wikidata="Q5930" url="?curid=187586" title="Family Guy">
<text>Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series premiered on January 31, 1999, following Super Bowl XXXIII, with the rest of the first season airing from April 11, 1999. The show centers around the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois, their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. Set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, the show exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after he developed two animated films, &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;. MacFarlane redesigned the films&#x27; protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in December 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. &quot;Family Guy&quot; cancellation was announced shortly after the third season had aired in 2002, with one unaired episode eventually premiering on Adult Swim in 2003, finishing the series&#x27; original run. Favorable DVD sales and high ratings from syndicated reruns since then convinced Fox to revive the show in 2004; a fourth season began airing the following year, on May 1, 2005.

Since its premiere, &quot;Family Guy&quot; has received generally positive reviews. In 2009, it was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series had been nominated for the award since &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in 1961. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Family Guy&quot; as the ninth-greatest TV cartoon. The series has also garnered considerable amounts of criticism and controversy, ranging from storylines and character stereotypes, to allegations of racism, homophobia, and misogyny.

Many tie-in media based on the show have been released, including &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot;, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult; and &quot;Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy&quot; (2010), a collection of three episodes parodying the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. A spin-off series, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013.

On January 26, 2023, Fox announced that the series had been renewed for seasons 22 and 23, taking the show through the 2024–25 television season. Season 22 premiered on October 1, 2023. &quot;Family Guy&quot; moved to Wednesday nights beginning March 6, 2024, marking the show&#x27;s first weeknight airings since 2002. 

On December 27, 2024, it was announced that the series would be moving back to Sundays and would air at the 8:00 p.m. timeslot. This would mark the first time &quot;Family Guy&quot; airs at the 8:00 p.m. timeslot since the episode &quot;Brian&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; aired on November 8, 2009. Following the two Hulu specials in late 2024, the remainder of season 23 premiered on February 16, 2025.

==Premise==

===Characters===

The show centers around the adventures and activities of the dysfunctional Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling and clumsy yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; his wife Lois, a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher (in early episodes) who is a member of the affluent Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often bullied teenage daughter who is constantly ridiculed or ignored by the family; Chris, their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent, unathletic, and in many respects a younger version of his father; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who is an adult-mannered evil genius and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic pet dog Brian, although he is still considered a pet in many ways.
Recurring characters appear alongside the Griffin family. These include the family&#x27;s neighbors: sex-crazed airline pilot bachelor Glenn Quagmire; deli owner/mail carrier Cleveland Brown and his wife Loretta (later Donna); paraplegic police officer Joe Swanson, his wife Bonnie, their son Kevin and their baby daughter Susie; neurotic Jewish pharmacist Mort Goldman, his wife Muriel, and their geeky and annoying son Neil, and elderly child molester Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, &quot;Asian reporter&quot; Tricia Takanawa, and &quot;Blaccu-Weather&quot; meteorologist Ollie Williams also make frequent appearances. Actor James Woods guest stars as himself in multiple episodes, as did Adam West, prior to his death.

===Setting===
The primary setting of &quot;Family Guy&quot; is Quahog ( ), a fictional city in Rhode Island that was founded by Peter&#x27;s ancestor, Griffin Peterson. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations. MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as Pawtucket and Buddy Cianci for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with Providence&#x27;s Fox affiliate WNAC-TV, stated that the town is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island.

==Episodes==

==Production==
===Development===
MacFarlane conceived &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. During college, he created his thesis film titled &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;, which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company. In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; titled &quot;Larry and Steve&quot;, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot;.

Executives at Fox saw the &quot;Larry&quot; shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, titled &quot;Family Guy&quot;, based on the characters. Fox proposed that MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short and gave him a budget of $50,000. Several aspects of &quot;Family Guy&quot; were inspired by the &quot;Larry&quot; shorts. While MacFarlane worked on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian. MacFarlane stated that the difference between &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; was that &quot;&quot;Life of Larry&quot; was shown primarily in my dorm room and &quot;Family Guy&quot; was shown after the Super Bowl.&quot; After the pilot aired, the series was given the greenlight. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday-morning cartoons he watched as a child, such as &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot; and &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;.

The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998. &quot;Family Guy&quot; was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show &quot;Mad TV&quot;, but the plan changed, because &quot;MADtv&quot;″s budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that it was the place to create a prime-time animation show. &quot;Family Guy&quot; was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, but the show was not bought until years later, when &quot;King of the Hill&quot; became successful.

===Executive producers===
MacFarlane has served as an executive producer throughout the show&#x27;s entire history. The first executive producers were David Zuckerman, Lolee Aries, David Pritchard, and Mike Wolf. &quot;Family Guy&quot; has had many executive producers in its history, including Daniel Palladino, Kara Vallow, and Danny Smith. David A. Goodman joined the show as a co-executive producer in season three and eventually became an executive producer.

===Writing===

 The first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of &quot;Family Guy&quot; typically starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read.

These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed the funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that it normally takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show&#x27;s initial writers had never written for an animated show, and most came from live-action sitcoms.

MacFarlane explained that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology &quot;Suspense&quot;, which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot; and &quot;Mind Over Murder.&quot; MacFarlane said that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off. For the first few months of production, the writers shared one office, lent to them by the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; production crew.

Credited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot; during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers. Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot; MacFarlane is also a co-creator of &quot;American Dad!&quot; On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Barker had departed &quot;American Dad!&quot; during its run as well, after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co-showrunner over the series.

During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane&#x27;s final approval, which he termed &quot;a colossal dick move&quot; in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;. Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce. Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February 17, 2008. According to MacFarlane, in 2009, it cost about $2 million to make an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;.

During his September 2017 AMA on Reddit, MacFarlane revealed that he had not written for the show since 2010, choosing instead to focus on production and voice acting.

On May 12, 2023, it was announced that the showrunners of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, including Seth MacFarlane, would temporarily leave the show as a result of the 2023 Writers Guild of America Strike. They returned to the show on September 27, 2023, once the strike was declared to be over.

===Voice cast===


Seth MacFarlane voices three of the show&#x27;s main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Stewie Griffin. Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters, he chose to voice them himself, believing it would be easier than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie&#x27;s voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time-only characters, most prominently those of the Griffins&#x27; neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker, and Lois&#x27; father, Carter Pewterschmidt.

Alex Borstein voices Peter&#x27;s wife Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois&#x27; mother, Babs Pewterschmidt. Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on &quot;MADtv&quot;. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was &quot;really sight unseen&quot;. At the time, Borstein was performing in a stage show in Los Angeles. She played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins.

Seth Green primarily voices Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the character Buffalo Bill from the thriller film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; during his audition.

Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert have both voiced Meg Griffin. Chabert left the series after the first season because of time conflicts with schoolwork (at the time) and her role on &quot;Party of Five&quot;. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. Archival recordings of Lacey Chabert&#x27;s voice that she provided as Meg Griffin are used in the tenth season episode &quot;Back to the Pilot&quot; in which Brian and Stewie go back in time to the events of &quot;Death Has a Shadow.&quot;

Mike Henry voices Herbert, Bruce the Performance Artist, Consuela, the Greased-up Deaf Guy, and until 2021, Cleveland Brown. Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design and kept in touch with him after they graduated. A few years later, MacFarlane contacted him about being part of the show; he agreed and came on as a writer and voice actor. During the show&#x27;s first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with season five&#x27;s &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;, he has been credited as a main cast member. On June 26, 2020, after twenty years of voicing the character, Mike Henry announced on Twitter that he was stepping down from voicing Cleveland, stating &quot;persons of color should play characters of color.&quot; On September 25, 2020, it was announced that Arif Zahir would take over as the voice of Cleveland.

Other recurring cast members include Patrick Warburton as Joe Swanson, Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson, John G. Brennan as Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender, Carlos Alazraqui as Jonathan Weed, Adam Carolla and Norm Macdonald as Death, Lori Alan as Diane Simmons, Phil LaMarr as Ollie Williams and Judge Dignified Q. Blackman, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Jerome. Fellow cartoonist Butch Hartman has made guest voice appearances in episodes as various characters. Also, writer Danny Smith voices various recurring characters, such as Ernie the Giant Chicken. Alexandra Breckenridge also appears as many various characters. Adam West appeared as the eponymous Mayor Adam West, until his death in 2017.

Episodes often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest voices star as themselves. Leslie Uggams was the first to appear as herself, in the fourth episode of the first season, &quot;Mind Over Murder&quot;. The episode &quot;Not All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; guest starred the entire cast of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, including Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Wil Wheaton, Marina Sirtis, and even Denise Crosby (season 1 as Tasha Yar), playing themselves; this is the episode with the most guest stars of the seventh season.

===Early history and cancellation===
&quot;Family Guy&quot; officially premiered after Fox&#x27;s broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999, with &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot;. The show debuted to 22 million viewers and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content. The show returned on April 11, 1999, with &quot;I Never Met the Dead Man&quot;. &quot;Family Guy&quot; garnered decent ratings in Fox&#x27;s 8:30 pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;. At the end of its first season, the show ranked No. 33 in the Nielsen ratings, with 12.8 million households tuning in. The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9 pm, on September 23, 1999. &quot;Family Guy&quot; was pitted against NBC&#x27;s &quot;Frasier&quot;, and the series&#x27; ratings declined sharply. Subsequently, Fox removed &quot;Family Guy&quot; from its schedule and began airing episodes irregularly. The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30 pm on Tuesdays, where it was constantly beaten in the ratings by ABC&#x27;s then-new breakout hit &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, coming in at No. 114 in the Nielsen ratings with 6.32 million households tuning in. Fox announced that the show had been canceled in May 2000, at the end of the second season. However, following a last-minute reprieve, on July 24, 2000, Fox ordered 13 additional episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot; to form a third season.

The show returned on November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00 pm. This slot brought it into competition with &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; (a situation that was later referenced in &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;). During its second and third seasons, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show&#x27;s ratings suffered. Upon Fox&#x27;s annual unveiling of its 2002 fall line-up on May 15, 2002, &quot;Family Guy&quot; was absent. Fox announced that the show had been officially canceled shortly thereafter.

===Cult success and revival===
Fox attempted to sell the rights for reruns of the show, but finding networks that were interested was difficult; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights &quot;basically for free&quot;, according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television. &quot;Family Guy&quot; premiered in reruns on Adult Swim on April 20, 2003, and immediately became the block&#x27;s top-rated program, dominating late-night viewing in its time period versus cable and broadcast competition and boosting viewership by 239%. The complete first and second seasons were released on DVD the same week the show premiered on Adult Swim, and the show became a cult phenomenon, selling 400,000 copies within one month. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second-highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. The third-season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show&#x27;s popularity in DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox&#x27;s interest, and, on May 20, 2004, Fox ordered 35 new episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales.

&quot;North by North Quahog&quot;, which premiered May 1, 2005, was the first episode to be broadcast after the show&#x27;s hiatus. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin. MacFarlane believed the show&#x27;s three-year hiatus was beneficial, because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons, &quot;... you see a lot more sex jokes and &quot;bodily function&quot; jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried&quot;. With &quot;North by North Quahog&quot;, the writing staff tried to keep the show &quot;[...] exactly as it was&quot; before its cancellation, and &quot;None of us had any desire to make it look any slicker&quot;. The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers, the show&#x27;s highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode &quot;&quot;.

===Lawsuits===
In March 2007, comedian Carol Burnett filed a $6 million lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming that her charwoman cartoon character had been portrayed on the show without her permission. She stated it was a trademark infringement and that Fox violated her publicity rights. On June 4, 2007, United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson rejected the lawsuit, stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment, citing &quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot; as a precedent.

On October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the song &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, through a parody song titled &quot;I Need a Jew&quot; appearing in the episode &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot;. Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a &quot;thinly veiled&quot; copy of its music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, MacFarlane, and Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program&#x27;s distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that &quot;I Need a Jew&quot; uses the copyrighted melody of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot; On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that &quot;Family Guy&quot; did not infringe on Bourne&#x27;s copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.

In December 2007, &quot;Family Guy&quot; was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;, in which Jesus performs Metrano&#x27;s signature &quot;magic&quot; act involving absurd &quot;faux&quot; magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot;. 20th Century Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit. In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox&#x27;s motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved – &quot;purpose and character of the use&quot;, &quot;nature of the infringed work&quot; and &quot;amount and substantiality of the taking&quot; – counted in Metrano&#x27;s favor, while the fourth – &quot;economic impact&quot; – had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers – not Metrano or his act.
The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.

==Hallmarks==
===&quot;Road to&quot; episodes===

The &quot;Road to&quot; episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes. They are a parody of the seven &quot;Road to ...&quot; comedy films starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. These episodes have always involved Stewie and Brian in some foreign, supernatural or science-fiction location, unrelated to the show&#x27;s normal location in Quahog. The first, titled &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot;, aired on May 30, 2000, during the second season. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate musical numbers, similar to the &quot;Road&quot; films. The episodes contain several trademarks, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom musical cues and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films.

The original idea for the &quot;Road to&quot; episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. The first episode was directed by Dan Povenmire, who would direct the rest of the &quot;Road to&quot; episodes until the episode &quot;Road to Rupert&quot;, at which point he had left the show to create &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; with Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh. Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire&#x27;s role as director of the &quot;Road to&quot; episodes.

The &quot;Road to&quot; episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series, thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves.

===Humor===
&quot;Family Guy&quot; uses the film-making technique of cutaways, which occur in the majority of &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes. Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to social phenomena and/or modern cultural icons.

Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie&#x27;s &quot;super villain&quot; antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality. &quot;Family Guy&quot; often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about the Fox network, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in &quot;North by North Quahog&quot;, the first episode that aired after the show&#x27;s revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been canceled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;Titus&quot;, &quot;Undeclared&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;That &#x27;80s Show&quot;, &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;, &quot;Fastlane&quot;, &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Girls Club&quot;, &quot;Cracking Up&quot;, &quot;The Pitts&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;Get Real&quot;, &quot;FreakyLinks&quot;, &quot;Wanda at Large&quot;, &quot;Costello&quot;, &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, &quot;A Minute with Stan Hooper&quot;, &quot;Normal, Ohio&quot;, &quot;Pasadena&quot;, &quot;Harsh Realm&quot;, &quot;Keen Eddie&quot;, &quot;The $treet&quot;, &quot;The American Embassy&quot;, &quot;Cedric the Entertainer Presents&quot;, &quot;The Tick&quot;, &quot;Luis&quot;, and &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot;. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s hiatus.

The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire&#x27;s &quot;Giggity giggity goo&quot;, Peter&#x27;s &quot;Freakin&#x27; sweet&quot;, Cleveland&#x27;s &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s nasty&quot;, and Joe&#x27;s &quot;Bring it on!&quot; The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode &quot;Big Man on Hippocampus&quot; mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot;, to which Lois replies, &quot;No, Peter, that&#x27;s not your catchphrase.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
In 2016, a &quot;New York Times&quot; study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that, like other satirical comedies, &quot;Family Guy&quot; is most popular in cities. The show&#x27;s popularity was more correlated with support for Hillary Clinton than any other show&quot;. As of 2008, the franchise has generated in total revenue, including from TV syndication, from DVD sales, and from merchandise sales.

===Ratings===
&quot;Family Guy&quot; experienced a significant increase in viewership following its availability on various streaming platforms, with a particularly notable rise in popularity on Hulu. In 2018, it ranked among the most-watched TV series on the streaming service Sling TV. In 2020, Hulu announced that &quot;Family Guy&quot; was one of the top five most-watched non-sports and non-news related live shows on the streaming service. Nielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on U.S. television screens, estimated that the series was watched for 910 million minutes from July 29 to August 4, 2024. The following week, it garnered 881 million minutes of viewing time from August 5 to August 11, 2024, making it the sixth most-streamed television show overall. From August 12 to August 18, 2024, &quot;Family Guy&quot; generated 834 million minutes of viewership, ranking it as the eighth most-streamed television show overall. From August 26 to September 1, 2024, it amassed more than 1 billion minutes of viewing time, securing its position as the third most-streamed series overall.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Family Guy&quot; has received generally positive reviews, particularly for its pop culture references, blue humor, satire, and non-sequitur storytelling. Catherine Seipp of National Review Online described it as a &quot;nasty but extremely funny&quot; cartoon. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a show with an &quot;outrageously satirical family&quot; that &quot;includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; named &quot;Family Guy&quot; the &quot;Show of the Week&quot; on April 21, 2009, hailing it a &quot;pop culture-heavy masterpiece&quot;. Frazier Moore from &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called it an &quot;endless craving for humor about bodily emissions&quot;. He thought it was &quot;breathtakingly smart&quot; and said a &quot;blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal&quot;. He summarized it as &quot;rude, crude and deliciously wrong&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Nancy Franklin said that &quot;Family Guy&quot; is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity. The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. IGN called &quot;Family Guy&quot; a great show and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as &quot;Family Guy&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented that one of the reasons they love the show is because nothing is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of &quot;The TV Critic&quot; praised the series as &quot;a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can&#x27;t do.&quot; &quot;Family Guy&quot; has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.

The series has attracted many celebrities. Robert Downey Jr. telephoned the show production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode&#x27;s creation, as his son is a fan of the show; the producers subsequently created a character for Downey. Lauren Conrad met MacFarlane while recording a &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; clip for the episode &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (season 5, 2006). She has watched &quot;Family Guy&quot; for years and considers Stewie her favorite character. Commenting on his appearance in the episode &quot;Big Man on Hippocampus&quot; (season 8, 2010), actor Dwayne Johnson stated that he was a &quot;big fan&quot; of &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Johnson befriended MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot;. R&amp;B singer Rihanna has admitted to being a fan of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, as has pop singer Britney Spears; she tries to imitate Stewie&#x27;s English accent. Spears, who was mocked for her personal problems in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Britney&#x27;s New Look&quot; in 2008, offered to appear in a cameo to hit back at the similar animated show, but MacFarlane declined, stating that he did not want to start a feud with the series.

===Awards===

&quot;Family Guy&quot; and its cast have been nominated for 27 Emmy Awards, with 8 wins. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie; Murphy and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song &quot;You Got a Lot to See&quot; from the episode &quot;Brian Wallows and Peter&#x27;s Swallows&quot;; Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode &quot;No Chris Left Behind&quot;; and Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;. The show was nominated for eleven Annie Awards, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in 1961. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was almost nominated in 1993, but voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs. The show was nominated for a Grammy in 2011. &quot;Family Guy&quot; has been nominated and has won various other awards, including the Teen Choice Awards and the People&#x27;s Choice Awards. In the 1,000th issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Brian Griffin was selected as the dog for &quot;The Perfect TV Family&quot;.&quot; Wizard Magazine&quot; rated Stewie the 95th-greatest villain of all time. British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; rated &quot;Family Guy&quot; the 45th-best American show in 2009. IGN ranked &quot;Family Guy&quot; number seven in the &quot;Top 100 Animated Series&quot; and number six in the &quot;Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; named it the twelfth-greatest TV show of all time in 2008. In 2005, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 voted &quot;Family Guy&quot; number 5 on their list of the 100 Greatest Cartoons. Brian was awarded the 2009 Stoner of the Year award by &quot;High Times&quot; for the episode &quot;420&quot;, marking the first time an animated character received the honor. In 2004 and 2007, TV Guide ranked &quot;Family Guy&quot; number 12 and number 15 in their list of top cult shows ever. &quot;Family Guy&quot; has garnered six Golden Reel Awards nominations, winning three times. In 2013, TV Guide ranked &quot;Family Guy&quot; the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.

===Criticism and controversy===
One of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;; he called it &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows&quot;. The Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative non-profit watchdog, has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as &quot;Worst TV Show of the Week&quot;. In May 2000, the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show. The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of &quot;Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing&quot; in 2000, 2005, and 2006. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on indecency grounds. Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show of portraying religion negatively, and of being racist. Because of the PTC, some advertisers have canceled their contracts after reviewing the content of the episodes, claiming it to be unsuitable. Critics have compared the show&#x27;s humor and characters with those of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. In &quot;420&quot; (season seven, 2009), Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog; the Venezuelan government reacted negatively to the episode and banned &quot;Family Guy&quot; from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming. Venezuelan justice minister Tareck El Aissami, citing the promotion of the use of cannabis, stated that any cable stations that did not stop airing the series would be fined; the government showed a clip which featured Brian and Stewie singing the praises of marijuana as a demonstration of how the United States supports cannabis use. In &quot;Extra Large Medium&quot; (season eight, 2010) a character named Ellen (who has Down syndrome) states that her mother is the former Governor of Alaska, which strongly implies that her mother is Sarah Palin, the only woman to have served in the office of governor in the state. Sarah Palin, the mother of a child with Down syndrome, criticized the episode in an appearance on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, calling those who made the show &quot;cruel, cold-hearted people&quot;.

==Broadcast and streaming==
In the United States, the show currently airs on Comedy Central, FXX, and Adult Swim. The show was first syndicated to Adult Swim and TBS from 2003 to 2021, sharing the rights to the first fifteen seasons. It was syndicated to various local stations from 2007 to 2024. In April 2019, FX Networks began airing reruns of season 16 on FXX, with season 17 debuting that October, and shared off-network rights to both seasons with sister channel Freeform. After Adult Swim and TBS&#x27; rights expired on September 18, 2021, FXX and Freeform began airing the first fifteen seasons. The show also joined FX&#x27;s lineup that same month.

The show&#x27;s departure from Adult Swim on September 18, 2021, was commemorated with a remembrance bumper created by the network, which played after the final airing (the episode &quot;Stewie is Enceinte&quot;). The bumper showed animations of several Adult Swim characters bidding farewell to &quot;Family Guy&quot;, including shots of Peter crying at the beginning and the Griffin family waving goodbye towards the end. 

Comedy Central began airing the show on September 2, 2024, as part of a non-exclusive licensing deal between Paramount and Disney. Comedy Central debuted the show with an all-day marathon on Labor Day. A similar licensing deal was then struck with Warner Bros. Discovery Networks for the show to return to Adult Swim starting January 1, 2025, with the network planning a 3-day marathon to celebrate.

In the United States, the series is available for streaming exclusively on Hulu. Additionally, Hulu will launch two holiday specials of &quot;Family Guy&quot; in late 2024, marking the first time a new episode of the show airs on a streaming platform; Internationally, &quot;Family Guy&quot; is available to stream on Star on Disney+. The first such special premiered on October 14, 2024. The second special would then air on November 25, 2024.

In addition to Teletoon at Night, the show has been syndicated to TVtropolis (now DTour). As of January 2025, Adult Swim Canada and FXX Canada syndicate the series. Since 2024, CHCH and Citytv share the broadcast rights to the series due to scheduling issues with new episodes streaming the next day on Disney+.

==Franchise==
===Books===

Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One was written by executive story editor Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and actress Alex Borstein. The book was first published on May 8, 2007. The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin covering a portion of her life, spanning from her memories of growing up to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog. Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin. The book covers events featured in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;, with which it shares a title. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 by Orion Books.

A comic book based on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; universe was produced. Published by Titan Comics, edited by Steve White, and illustrated by Anthony Williams and S. L. Gallant, the writing and the illustrations were supervised by the show&#x27;s producers. The first comic book was released on July 27, 2011.

===Live performances===
As promotion for the show and as Newman described &quot;[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans&quot;, Fox organized four &quot;Family Guy Live!&quot; performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot; comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival. The &quot;Family Guy Live!&quot; performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.

At the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in 2007, MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony&#x27;s opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song &quot;The Fellas at the Freakin&#x27; F.C.C.&quot; performed in the episode &quot;PTV&quot;. The song insulted TV shows such as &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, and &quot;Scrubs&quot;, as well as the final scene of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

In 2009, a special televised performance show aired, titled &quot;Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex&#x27;s Almost Live Comedy Show&quot;, in which voice actors Alex Borstein and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of Lady Gaga&#x27;s song &quot;Poker Face&quot; in the voice of Marlee Matlin, who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.

===Film===
In a July 22, 2007, interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although &quot;nothing&#x27;s official.&quot; In &quot;TV Week&quot; on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released &quot;Family Guy&quot; feature film sometime &quot;within the next year.&quot; He came up with an idea for the story, &quot;something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie.&quot; He later went on to say he imagines the film to be &quot;an old-style musical with dialogue&quot; similar to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, saying that he would &quot;really be trying to capture, musically, that feel.&quot; On October 13, 2011, MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a &quot;Family Guy&quot; film had been made, and that it would be written by him and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.

On November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a &quot;Family Guy&quot; film. The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on &quot;Ted 2&quot;.

On August 10, 2018, Fox announced that a live-action/animated film based on the series is in development.

In July 2019, MacFarlane confirmed that there will be a &quot;Family Guy&quot; film.

During PaleyFest in April 2024, MacFarlane revealed that he has known what the plot of the film would be for the past 15 years, but had not had the time to write it.

===Spin-off===

<text>Lamarckism, also known as Lamarckian inheritance or neo-Lamarckism, is the notion that an organism can pass on to its offspring physical characteristics that the parent organism acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime. It is also called the inheritance of acquired characteristics or more recently soft inheritance. The idea is named after the French zoologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829), who incorporated the classical era theory of soft inheritance into his theory of evolution as a supplement to his concept of orthogenesis, a drive towards complexity.

Introductory textbooks contrast Lamarckism with Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection. However, Darwin&#x27;s book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; gave credence to the idea of heritable effects of use and disuse, as Lamarck had done, and his own concept of pangenesis similarly implied soft inheritance.

Many researchers from the 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, but these have all been explained away, either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination or as fraud. August Weismann&#x27;s experiment, considered definitive in its time, is now considered to have failed to disprove Lamarckism, as it did not address use and disuse. Later, Mendelian genetics supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the modern synthesis, and the general abandonment of Lamarckism in biology. Despite this, interest in Lamarckism has continued.

In the 21st century, experimental results in the fields of epigenetics, genetics, and somatic hypermutation demonstrated the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of traits acquired by the previous generation. These proved a limited validity of Lamarckism. The inheritance of the hologenome, consisting of the genomes of all an organism&#x27;s symbiotic microbes as well as its own genome, is also somewhat Lamarckian in effect, though entirely Darwinian in its mechanisms.

==Early history==
===Origins===
The inheritance of acquired characteristics was proposed in ancient times and remained a current idea for many centuries. The historian of science Conway Zirkle wrote in 1935 that:

Zirkle noted that Hippocrates described pangenesis, the theory that what is inherited derives from the whole body of the parent, whereas Aristotle thought it impossible; but that all the same, Aristotle implicitly agreed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, giving the example of the inheritance of a scar, or of blindness, though noting that children do not always resemble their parents. Zirkle recorded that Pliny the Elder thought much the same. Zirkle pointed out that stories involving the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics appear numerous times in ancient mythology and the Bible and persisted through to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;. The idea is mentioned in 18th century sources such as Diderot&#x27;s &quot;D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Zoonomia&quot; (c. 1795) suggested that warm-blooded animals develop from &quot;one living filament... with the power of acquiring new parts&quot; in response to stimuli, with each round of &quot;improvements&quot; being inherited by successive generations.

=== Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis ===

Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; proposed natural selection as the main mechanism for development of species, but (like Lamarck) gave credence to the idea of heritable effects of use and disuse as a supplementary mechanism. Darwin subsequently set out his concept of pangenesis in the final chapter of his book &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot; (1868), which gave numerous examples to demonstrate what he thought was the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Pangenesis, which he emphasised was a hypothesis, was based on the idea that somatic cells would, in response to environmental stimulation (use and disuse), throw off &#x27;gemmules&#x27; or &#x27;pangenes&#x27; which travelled around the body, though not necessarily in the bloodstream. These pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about the characteristics of their parent cell, and Darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in the germ cells where they could pass on to the next generation the newly acquired characteristics of the parents.

Darwin&#x27;s half-cousin, Francis Galton, carried out experiments on rabbits, with Darwin&#x27;s cooperation, in which he transfused the blood of one variety of rabbit into another variety in the expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of the first. They did not, and Galton declared that he had disproved Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis of pangenesis, but Darwin objected, in a letter to the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;, that he had done nothing of the sort, since he had never mentioned blood in his writings. He pointed out that he regarded pangenesis as occurring in protozoa and plants, which have no blood, as well as in animals.

===Lamarck&#x27;s evolutionary framework===


Between 1800 and 1830, Lamarck proposed a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution. He saw evolution as comprising four laws:

# &quot;Life by its own force, tends to increase the volume of all organs which possess the force of life, and the force of life extends the dimensions of those parts up to an extent that those parts bring to themselves;&quot;
# &quot;The production of a new organ in an animal body, results from a new requirement arising. and which continues to make itself felt, and a new movement which that requirement gives birth to, and its upkeep/maintenance;&quot;
# &quot;The development of the organs, and their ability, are constantly a result of the use of those organs.&quot;
# &quot;All that has been acquired, traced, or changed, in the physiology of individuals, during their life, is conserved through the genesis, reproduction, and transmitted to new individuals who are related to those who have undergone those changes.&quot;

===Lamarck&#x27;s discussion of heredity===

In 1830, in an aside from his evolutionary framework, Lamarck briefly mentioned two traditional ideas in his discussion of heredity, in his day considered to be generally true. The first was the idea of use versus disuse; he theorized that individuals lose characteristics they do not require, or use, and develop characteristics that are useful. The second was to argue that the acquired traits were heritable. He gave as an imagined illustration the idea that when giraffes stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees, they would strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes would then have offspring with slightly longer necks. In the same way, he argued, a blacksmith, through his work, strengthens the muscles in his arms, and thus his sons would have similar muscular development when they mature. Lamarck stated the following two laws:

# &quot;Première Loi: Dans tout animal qui n&#x27; a point dépassé le terme de ses développemens, l&#x27; emploi plus fréquent et soutenu d&#x27; un organe quelconque, fortifie peu à peu cet organe, le développe, l&#x27; agrandit, et lui donne une puissance proportionnée à la durée de cet emploi; tandis que le défaut constant d&#x27; usage de tel organe, l&#x27;affoiblit insensiblement, le détériore, diminue progressivement ses facultés, et finit par le faire disparoître.&quot;
# &quot;Deuxième Loi: Tout ce que la nature a fait acquérir ou perdre aux individus par l&#x27; influence des circonstances où leur race se trouve depuis long-temps exposée, et, par conséquent, par l&#x27; influence de l&#x27; emploi prédominant de tel organe, ou par celle d&#x27; un défaut constant d&#x27; usage de telle partie; elle le conserve par la génération aux nouveaux individus qui en proviennent, pourvu que les changemens acquis soient communs aux deux sexes, ou à ceux qui ont produit ces nouveaux individus.&quot;

English translation:

# First Law [Use and Disuse]: In every animal which has not passed the limit of its development, a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional to the length of time it has been so used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity, until it finally disappears.
# Second Law [Soft Inheritance]: All the acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals, through the influence of the environment in which their race has long been placed, and hence through the influence of the predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ; all these are preserved by reproduction to the new individuals which arise, provided that the acquired modifications are common to both sexes, or at least to the individuals which produce the young.

In essence, a change in the environment brings about change in &quot;needs&quot; (&quot;besoins&quot;), resulting in change in behaviour, causing change in organ usage and development, bringing change in form over time—and thus the gradual transmutation of the species. As the evolutionary biologists and historians of science Conway Zirkle, Michael Ghiselin, and Stephen Jay Gould have pointed out, these ideas were not original to Lamarck.

===Weismann&#x27;s experiment===
August Weismann&#x27;s germ plasm theory held that germline cells in the gonads contain information that passes from one generation to the next, unaffected by experience, and independent of the somatic (body) cells. This implied what came to be known as the Weismann barrier, as it would make Lamarckian inheritance from changes to the body difficult or impossible.

Weismann conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 white mice, and those of their offspring over five generations, and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail. In 1889, he stated that &quot;901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ.&quot; The experiment, and the theory behind it, were thought at the time to be a refutation of Lamarckism.

The experiment&#x27;s effectiveness in refuting Lamarck&#x27;s hypothesis is doubtful, as it did not address the &quot;use and disuse&quot; of characteristics in response to the environment. The biologist Peter Gauthier noted in 1990 that:

Ghiselin also considered the Weismann tail-chopping experiment to have no bearing on the Lamarckian hypothesis, writing in 1994 that:

The acquired characteristics that figured in Lamarck&#x27;s thinking were changes that resulted from an individual&#x27;s own drives and actions, not from the actions of external agents. Lamarck was not concerned with wounds, injuries or mutilations, and nothing that Lamarck had set forth was tested or &quot;disproven&quot; by the Weismann tail-chopping experiment.

The historian of science Rasmus Winther stated that Weismann had nuanced views about the role of the environment on the germ plasm. Indeed, like Darwin, he consistently insisted that a variable environment was necessary to cause variation in the hereditary material.

==Textbook Lamarckism==
The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by evolutionary biologists including Ghiselin as a falsified artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought, repeated in textbooks without analysis, and wrongly contrasted with a falsified picture of Darwin&#x27;s thinking. Ghiselin notes that &quot;Darwin accepted the inheritance of acquired characteristics, just as Lamarck did, and Darwin even thought that there was some experimental evidence to support it.&quot; Gould wrote that in the late 19th century, evolutionists &quot;re-read Lamarck, cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics—inheritance of acquired characters—to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself.&quot; He argued that &quot;the restriction of &#x27;Lamarckism&#x27; to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck&#x27;s thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer, and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system.&quot;
==Neo-Lamarckism==

===Context===

The period of the history of evolutionary thought between Darwin&#x27;s death in the 1880s, and the foundation of population genetics in the 1920s and the beginnings of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s, is called the eclipse of Darwinism by some historians of science. During that time many scientists and philosophers accepted the reality of evolution but doubted whether natural selection was the main evolutionary mechanism.

Among the most popular alternatives were theories involving the inheritance of characteristics acquired during an organism&#x27;s lifetime. Scientists who felt that such Lamarckian mechanisms were the key to evolution were called neo-Lamarckians. They included the British botanist George Henslow (1835–1925), who studied the effects of environmental stress on the growth of plants, in the belief that such environmentally-induced variation might explain much of plant evolution, and the American entomologist Alpheus Spring Packard Jr., who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about Lamarck and his work. Also included were paleontologists like Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, who observed that the fossil record showed orderly, almost linear, patterns of development that they felt were better explained by Lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection. Some people, including Cope and the Darwin critic Samuel Butler, felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution, since organisms that acquired new habits would change the use patterns of their organs, which would kick-start Lamarckian evolution. They considered this philosophically superior to Darwin&#x27;s mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures. Lamarckism also appealed to those, like the philosopher Herbert Spencer and the German anatomist Ernst Haeckel, who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process. The German zoologist Theodor Eimer combined Larmarckism with ideas about orthogenesis, the idea that evolution is directed towards a goal.

With the development of the modern synthesis of the theory of evolution, and a lack of evidence for a mechanism for acquiring and passing on new characteristics, or even their heritability, Lamarckism largely fell from favour. Unlike neo-Darwinism, neo-Lamarckism is a loose grouping of largely heterodox theories and mechanisms that emerged after Lamarck&#x27;s time, rather than a coherent body of theoretical work.

===19th century===

Neo-Lamarckian versions of evolution were widespread in the late 19th century. The idea that living things could to some degree choose the characteristics that would be inherited allowed them to be in charge of their own destiny as opposed to the Darwinian view, which placed them at the mercy of the environment. Such ideas were more popular than natural selection in the late 19th century as it made it possible for biological evolution to fit into a framework of a divine or naturally willed plan, thus the neo-Lamarckian view of evolution was often advocated by proponents of orthogenesis. According to the historian of science Peter J. Bowler, writing in 2003:


Scientists from the 1860s onwards conducted numerous experiments that purported to show Lamarckian inheritance. Some examples are described in the table.

===Early 20th century===
A century after Lamarck, scientists and philosophers continued to seek mechanisms and evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Experiments were sometimes reported as successful, but from the beginning these were either criticised on scientific grounds or shown to be fakes. For instance, in 1906, the philosopher Eugenio Rignano argued for a version that he called &quot;centro-epigenesis&quot;, but it was rejected by most scientists. Some of the experimental approaches are described in the table.

===Late 20th century===
The British anthropologist Frederic Wood Jones and the South African paleontologist Robert Broom supported a neo-Lamarckian view of human evolution. The German anthropologist Hermann Klaatsch relied on a neo-Lamarckian model of evolution to try and explain the origin of bipedalism. Neo-Lamarckism remained influential in biology until the 1940s when the role of natural selection was reasserted in evolution as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis.
Herbert Graham Cannon, a British zoologist, defended Lamarckism in his 1959 book &quot;Lamarck and Modern Genetics&quot;. In the 1960s, &quot;biochemical Lamarckism&quot; was advocated by the embryologist Paul Wintrebert.

Neo-Lamarckism was dominant in French biology for more than a century. French scientists who supported neo-Lamarckism included Edmond Perrier (1844–1921), Alfred Giard (1846–1908), Gaston Bonnier (1853–1922) and Pierre-Paul Grassé (1895–1985). They followed two traditions, one mechanistic, one vitalistic after Henri Bergson&#x27;s philosophy of evolution.

In 1987, Ryuichi Matsuda coined the term &quot;pan-environmentalism&quot; for his evolutionary theory which he saw as a fusion of Darwinism with neo-Lamarckism. He held that heterochrony is a main mechanism for evolutionary change and that novelty in evolution can be generated by genetic assimilation. His views were criticized by Arthur M. Shapiro for providing no solid evidence for his theory. Shapiro noted that &quot;Matsuda himself accepts too much at face value and is prone to wish-fulfilling interpretation.&quot;

===Ideological neo-Lamarckism===


A form of Lamarckism was revived in the Soviet Union of the 1930s when Trofim Lysenko promoted the ideologically driven research programme, Lysenkoism; this suited the ideological opposition of Joseph Stalin to genetics. Lysenkoism influenced Soviet agricultural policy which in turn was later blamed for the numerous massive crop failures experienced within Soviet states.

===Critique===
George Gaylord Simpson in his book &quot;Tempo and Mode in Evolution&quot; (1944) claimed that experiments in heredity have failed to corroborate any Lamarckian process. Simpson noted that neo-Lamarckism &quot;stresses a factor that Lamarck rejected: inheritance of direct effects of the environment&quot; and neo-Lamarckism is closer to Darwin&#x27;s pangenesis than Lamarck&#x27;s views. Simpson wrote, &quot;the inheritance of acquired characters, failed to meet the tests of observation and has been almost universally discarded by biologists.&quot;

Zirkle pointed out that Lamarck did not originate the hypothesis that acquired characteristics could be inherited, so it is incorrect to refer to it as Lamarckism:

What Lamarck really did was to accept the hypothesis that acquired characters were heritable, a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted as a matter of course, and to assume that the results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation, thus producing, in time, new species. His individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to the problem of the origin of species of the view that acquired characters were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from the accepted biological hypotheses. He would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in the inheritance of acquired characters is now labeled &quot;Lamarckian,&quot; although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated.

Peter Medawar wrote regarding Lamarckism, &quot;very few professional biologists believe that anything of the kind occurs—or can occur—but the notion persists for a variety of nonscientific reasons.&quot; Medawar stated there is no known mechanism by which an adaptation acquired in an individual&#x27;s lifetime can be imprinted on the genome and Lamarckian inheritance is not valid unless it excludes the possibility of natural selection, but this has not been demonstrated in any experiment.

Martin Gardner wrote in his book &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot; (1957):

A host of experiments have been designed to test Lamarckianism. All that have been verified have proved negative. On the other hand, tens of thousands of experiments— reported in the journals and carefully checked and rechecked by geneticists throughout the world— have established the correctness of the gene-mutation theory beyond all reasonable doubt... In spite of the rapidly increasing evidence for natural selection, Lamarck has never ceased to have loyal followers... There is indeed a strong emotional appeal in the thought that every little effort an animal puts forth is somehow transmitted to his progeny.

According to Ernst Mayr, any Lamarckian theory involving the inheritance of acquired characters has been refuted as &quot;DNA does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA.&quot; Peter J. Bowler has written that although many early scientists took Lamarckism seriously, it was discredited by genetics in the early twentieth century.

==Mechanisms resembling Lamarckism==

Studies in the field of epigenetics, genetics and somatic hypermutation have highlighted the possible inheritance of traits acquired by the previous generation. However, the characterization of these findings as Lamarckism has been disputed.

===Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance===


Epigenetic inheritance has been argued by scientists including Eva Jablonka and Marion J. Lamb to be Lamarckian. Epigenetics is based on hereditary elements other than genes that pass into the germ cells. These include methylation patterns in DNA and chromatin marks on histone proteins, both involved in gene regulation. These marks are responsive to environmental stimuli, differentially affect gene expression, and are adaptive, with phenotypic effects that persist for some generations. The mechanism may also enable the inheritance of behavioral traits, for example in chickens, rats and human populations that have experienced starvation, DNA methylation resulting in altered gene function in both the starved population and their offspring. Methylation similarly mediates epigenetic inheritance in plants such as rice. Small RNA molecules, too, may mediate inherited resistance to infection. Handel and Ramagopalan commented that &quot;epigenetics allows the peaceful co-existence of Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution.&quot;

Joseph Springer and Dennis Holley commented in 2013 that:

Lamarck and his ideas were ridiculed and discredited. In a strange twist of fate, Lamarck may have the last laugh. Epigenetics, an emerging field of genetics, has shown that Lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along. It seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in DNA sequence (genotype) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factors—Lamarck&#x27;s &quot;acquired traits.&quot; Determining which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of the study of genetics, developmental biology, and medicine.

The prokaryotic CRISPR system and Piwi-interacting RNA could be classified as Lamarckian, within a Darwinian framework.
However, the significance of epigenetics in evolution is uncertain. Critics such as the evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations, so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change.

The evolutionary biologist T. Ryan Gregory contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered Lamarckian. According to Gregory, Lamarck did not claim that the environment directly affected living things. Instead, Lamarck &quot;argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less, that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated, and that this difference was then inherited by offspring.&quot; Gregory has stated that Lamarckian evolution in epigenetics is more like Darwin&#x27;s point of view than Lamarck&#x27;s.

In 2007, David Haig wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a Lamarckian element in evolution but the processes do not challenge the main tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis as modern Lamarckians have claimed. Haig argued for the primacy of DNA and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection. Haig has written that there is a &quot;visceral attraction&quot; to Lamarckian evolution from the public and some scientists, as it posits the world with a meaning, in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny.

Thomas Dickens and Qazi Rahman (2012) have argued that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection and do not challenge the modern synthesis. They dispute the claims of Jablonka and Lamb on Lamarckian epigenetic processes.

In 2015, Khursheed Iqbal and colleagues discovered that although &quot;endocrine disruptors exert direct epigenetic effects in the exposed fetal germ cells, these are corrected by reprogramming events in the next generation.&quot; Also in 2015, Adam Weiss argued that bringing back Lamarck in the context of epigenetics is misleading, commenting, &quot;We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works.&quot;

===Somatic hypermutation and reverse transcription to germline===

In the 1970s, the Australian immunologist Edward J. Steele developed a neo-Lamarckian theory of somatic hypermutation within the immune system and coupled it to the reverse transcription of RNA derived from body cells to the DNA of germline cells. This reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the DNA and passed on to subsequent generations.

The mechanism was meant to explain why homologous DNA sequences from the VDJ gene regions of parent mice were found in their germ cells and seemed to persist in the offspring for a few generations. The mechanism involved the somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired antibody gene sequences generated via somatic hypermutation in B-cells. The messenger RNA products of these somatically novel genes were captured by retroviruses endogenous to the B-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the Weismann or soma-germ barrier and reverse transcribe the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line, in the manner of Darwin&#x27;s pangenes.

The historian of biology Peter J. Bowler noted in 1989 that other scientists had been unable to reproduce his results, and described the scientific consensus at the time:

Bowler commented that &quot;[Steele&#x27;s] work was bitterly criticized at the time by biologists who doubted his experimental results and rejected his hypothetical mechanism as implausible.&quot;

===Hologenome theory of evolution===
The hologenome theory of evolution, while Darwinian, has Lamarckian aspects. An individual animal or plant lives in symbiosis with many microorganisms, and together they have a &quot;hologenome&quot; consisting of all their genomes. The hologenome can vary like any other genome by mutation, sexual recombination, and chromosome rearrangement, but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease (resembling Lamarckian use and disuse), and when it gains new kinds of microorganism (resembling Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics). These changes are then passed on to offspring. The mechanism is largely uncontroversial, and natural selection does sometimes occur at whole system (hologenome) level, but it is not clear that this is always the case.

===Baldwin effect===

The Baldwin effect, named after the psychologist James Mark Baldwin by George Gaylord Simpson in 1953, proposes that the ability to learn new behaviours can improve an animal&#x27;s reproductive success, and hence the course of natural selection on its genetic makeup. Simpson stated that the mechanism was &quot;not inconsistent with the modern synthesis&quot; of evolutionary theory, though he doubted that it occurred very often or could be proven to occur. He noted that the Baldwin effect provided a reconciliation between the neo-Darwinian and neo-Lamarckian approaches, something that the modern synthesis had seemed to render unnecessary. In particular, the effect allows animals to adapt to a new stress in the environment through behavioural changes, followed by genetic change. This somewhat resembles Lamarckism but without requiring animals to inherit characteristics acquired by their parents. The Baldwin effect is broadly accepted by Darwinists.

==In sociocultural evolution==
Within the field of cultural evolution, Lamarckism has been applied as a mechanism for dual inheritance theory. Gould viewed culture as a Lamarckian process whereby older generations transmitted adaptive information to offspring via the concept of learning. In the history of technology, components of Lamarckism have been used to link cultural development to human evolution by considering technology as extensions of human anatomy.&#x27;

<text>is a 1950 Japanese &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film directed by Akira Kurosawa from a screenplay he co-wrote with Shinobu Hashimoto. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyō, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura, it follows various people who describe how a samurai was murdered in a forest. The plot and characters are based upon Ryūnosuke Akutagawa&#x27;s short story &quot;In a Grove&quot;, with the title and framing story taken from Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashōmon&quot;. Every element is largely identical, from the murdered samurai speaking through a Shinto psychic to the bandit in the forest, the monk, the assault of the wife, and the dishonest retelling of the events in which everyone shows their ideal self by lying.

Production began in 1948 at Kurosawa&#x27;s regular production firm Toho but was canceled as it was viewed as a financial risk. Two years later, Sōjirō Motoki pitched &quot;Rashomon&quot; to Daiei Film upon the completion of Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Scandal&quot;. Daiei initially turned it down but eventually agreed to produce and distribute the film. Principal photography lasted from July 7 to August 17, 1950, taking place primarily in Kyoto on an estimated budget. When creating the film&#x27;s visual style, Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa experimented with various methods such as pointing the camera at the sun, which was considered taboo. Post-production took only one week and was decelerated by two fires.

&quot;Rashomon&quot; premiered at the Imperial Theatre on August 25, 1950, and was distributed throughout Japan the following day, to moderate commercial success, becoming Daiei&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing film of 1950. Japanese critics praised the experimental direction and cinematography but criticized its adapting of Akutagawa&#x27;s story and complexity. Upon winning the Golden Lion at the 12th Venice International Film Festival, &quot;Rashomon&quot; became the first Japanese film to attain significant international reception, garnering critical acclaim and earning roughly abroad. It later won Best Foreign Language Film at the 24th Academy Awards, and was nominated for Best Film at the 6th British Academy Film Awards.

&quot;Rashomon&quot; is now considered one of the greatest films ever made and among the most influential movies from the 20th century. It pioneered the Rashomon effect, a plot device that involves various characters providing subjective, alternative, and contradictory versions of the same incident. In 1999, critic Andrew Johnston asserted that &quot;the film&#x27;s title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit&quot;.

==Plot==
In Heian-era Kyoto, a woodcutter and a priest, taking shelter from a downpour under the Rashōmon city gate, recount a story of a recent assault and murder. Baffled at conflicting accounts of the same event, the woodcutter and the priest are joined by a commoner. The woodcutter claims he had found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier, alongside the samurai&#x27;s cap, his wife&#x27;s hat, cut pieces of rope, and an amulet. The priest claims he had seen the samurai travel with his wife on the day of the murder. Both testify in court before a policeman presents the main suspect, a captured bandit named Tajōmaru.

In Tajōmaru&#x27;s version of events, he follows the couple after spotting them traveling in the woods. He tricks the samurai into leaving the trail by lying about finding a burial pit filled with ancient artifacts. He subdues the samurai and attempts to rape his wife, who tries to defend herself with a dagger. Tajōmaru then seduces the wife, who, ashamed of the dishonor of having been with two men, asks Tajōmaru to duel her husband so she may go with the man who wins. Tajōmaru agrees; the duel ends with Tajōmaru killing the samurai. He then finds the wife has fled.

The wife, having been found by the police, delivers a different testimony; in her version of events, Tajōmaru leaves immediately after assaulting her. She frees her husband from his bonds, but he stares at her with contempt and loathing. The wife tries to threaten him with her dagger but then faints from panic. She awakens to find her husband dead, with the dagger in his chest. In shock, she wanders through the forest until coming upon a pond and attempts to drown herself but fails.

The samurai&#x27;s testimony is heard through a medium. In his version of events, Tajōmaru asks the wife to marry him after the assault. To the samurai&#x27;s shame, she accepts, asking Tajōmaru to kill the samurai first. This disgusts Tajōmaru, who gives the samurai the choice to let her go or have her killed. The wife then breaks free and flees. Tajōmaru unsuccessfully gives chase. After being set free by an apologetic Tajōmaru, the samurai kills himself with the dagger. Later, he feels someone remove the dagger from his chest, but cannot tell who.

The woodcutter proclaims that all three stories are falsehoods and admits that he saw the samurai killed by a sword instead of a dagger. The commoner pressures the woodcutter to admit that he had seen the murder but lied to avoid getting in trouble. In the woodcutter&#x27;s version of events, Tajōmaru begs the wife to marry him. She instead frees her husband, expecting him to kill Tajōmaru. The samurai refuses to fight, unwilling to risk his life for a ruined woman. Tajōmaru rescinds his promise to marry the wife; the wife rebukes them both for failing to keep their promises. The two men unwillingly enter into a duel; the samurai is disarmed and begs for his life, and Tajōmaru kills him. The wife flees, and Tajōmaru steals the samurai&#x27;s sword and limps away.

The woodcutter, the priest, and the commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a child abandoned in a basket along with a kimono and an amulet; the commoner steals the items, for which the woodcutter rebukes him. The commoner deduces that the woodcutter had lied not because he feared getting in trouble, but because he had stolen the wife&#x27;s dagger to sell for food.

Meanwhile, the priest attempts to soothe the baby. The woodcutter attempts to take the child after the commoner&#x27;s departure; the priest, having lost his faith in humanity after the events of the trial and the commoner&#x27;s actions, recoils. The woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child. Having seen the woodcutter&#x27;s well-meaning intentions, the priest announces that his faith in men has been restored. As the woodcutter prepares to leave, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun.

==Production==
===Development===
According to Donald Richie, Akira Kurosawa began developing the film circa 1948, and both Kurosawa&#x27;s regular production studio Toho and its financing company, Toyoko Company, refused to produce the film, with the latter fearing it would be a precarious production. Following the completion of &quot;Scandal&quot;, Sōjirō Motoki offered the script to Daiei who also initially rejected it.

Regarding &quot;Rashomon&quot;, Kurosawa said: I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.&quot;
As with most films produced in post-war Japan, reports on the budget of &quot;Rashomon&quot; are scarce and differ. In 1952, Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha said that the film&#x27;s production cost was , and suggested that advertising and other expenses brought the overall budget to . The following year, the National Board of Review reported that the spent on Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ikiru&quot; (1952) was over twice the budget of &quot;Rashomon&quot;. According to the UNESCO in 1971, &quot;Rashomon&quot; had a budget of or . Reports on the budget in Western currency vary: &quot;The Guinness Book of Movie Facts and Feats&quot; cited it as , &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Stuart Galbraith IV noted a reputed figure, and a handful of other sources have claimed that it cost as high as . Jasper Sharp disputed the latter number in an article for the BBC, since it would have been equal to at the time of the film&#x27;s production. He added that it &quot;seems highly unlikely given that the 125 million yen, approximately $350,000, that Kurosawa subsequently spent on &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; four years later made this film by far the most expensive domestic production up to this point&quot;.

=== Writing ===
Kurosawa wrote the screenplay while staying at a &quot;ryokan&quot; in Atami with his friend Ishirō Honda, who was scripting &quot;The Blue Pearl&quot; (1951). The pair regularly commenced writing their respective films at 9:00 a.m. and would give feedback on each other&#x27;s work after each completed roughly twenty pages. According to Honda, Kurosawa soon refused to read &quot;The Blue Pearl&quot; after a couple of days but &quot;of course, he still made me read his&quot;.

===Casting===
Kurosawa had initially wanted the cast of eight to consist entirely of previous collaborators, specifically counseling Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura. He also suggested that Setsuko Hara—who had played the lead in &quot;No Regrets for Our Youth&quot; (1946)—portray the wife, but she was not cast since her brother-in-law, filmmaker Hisatora Kumagai, was against it; Hara would subsequently appear in Kurosawa&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1951). Daiei executives then recommended Machiko Kyō, believing she would make the film easier to market. Kurosawa agreed to cast her upon seeing her show enthusiasm for the project by shaving her eyebrows before going for a make-up test.

When Kurosawa shot &quot;Rashomon&quot;, the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls: We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing &quot;Rashomon&quot; every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed.

===Filming===
Due to its small budget the film had only three sets: the gate; the forest scene; and the police courtyard. Filming began on 7 July 1950 and ended on 17 August. After a week&#x27;s work on post-production, it was released in Tokyo on 25 August.

The cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, contributed numerous ideas, technical skill and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.

The use of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in &quot;Rashomon&quot;. According to Donald Richie, the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit is the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.

&quot;Rashomon&quot; had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.

===Lighting===

Robert Altman compliments Kurosawa&#x27;s use of &quot;dappled&quot; light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity. In his essay &quot;Rashomon&quot;, Tadao Sato suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit&#x27;s desires when she sees the sun.

Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato&#x27;s idea in her essay &quot;The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot;.&quot; McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize &quot;good&quot; or &quot;reason&quot; and darkness to symbolize &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;impulse&quot;. She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. McDonald regards it as unfortunate that the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.

===Post-production===
Stanley Kauffmann writes in &quot;The Impact of Rashomon&quot; that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could &quot;cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully as if flying from one piece to another.&quot; Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; Donald Richie says in his essay that &quot;there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves.&quot;

Due to setbacks and some lost audio, Mifune returned to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer Iwao Ōtani added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.

The film was scored by Fumio Hayasaka, who is among the most respected of Japanese composers. At the director&#x27;s request, he scored a bolero for the woman&#x27;s story.

==Allegorical and symbolic content==
The film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her samurai husband through the widely differing accounts of four witnesses, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are mutually contradictory and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television use of the &quot;Rashomon effect&quot; focuses on revealing &quot;the truth&quot; in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa&#x27;s film on the surface.

Due to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, &quot;Rashomon&quot; has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson&#x27;s article, &quot;Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of &quot;Rashomon&quot;&quot; in the December 1954 issue of the &quot;Antioch Review&quot;, is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements. Another allegorical interpretation of the film is mentioned briefly in a 1995 article, &quot;Japan: An Ambivalent Nation, an Ambivalent Cinema&quot; by David M. Desser. Here, the film is seen as an allegory of the atomic bomb and Japanese defeat. It also briefly mentions James Goodwin&#x27;s view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, the film&#x27;s source material, &quot;In a Grove&quot;, was published in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have resulted from Kurosawa&#x27;s additions rather than the story about the conflicting accounts. Historian and critic David Conrad has noted that the use of rape as a plot point came at a time when American occupation authorities had recently stopped censoring Japanese media and belated accounts of rapes by occupation troops began to appear in Japanese newspapers. Moreover, Kurosawa and other filmmakers were not allowed to make &quot;jidaigeki&quot; during the early part of the occupation, so setting a film in the distant past was a way to reassert domestic control over cinema.

==Release==
===Box office===

The premiere of &quot;Rashomon&quot; took place at the Imperial Theatre on August 25, 1950, in Tokyo, and was distributed nationwide by Daiei the next day. It was an instant box office success, leading several theaters to continue to play it for two or three weeks rather than a Japanese film&#x27;s regular one-week theatrical run. Jiji Press reported that the film was Daiei&#x27;s third highest-grossing film released between September 1949 and August 1950, having earned over . In general, the film was Daiei&#x27;s fourth-highest-grossing film of 1950. Donald Richie claimed that it was also one of the top ten highest-earning films in Japan that year.

The film later became Kurosawa&#x27;s first major international hit. It was released theatrically in the United States by RKO Radio Pictures on December 26, 1951, in both subtitled and dubbed versions. In Europe, the film sold tickets in France and Spain, and 8,292 tickets in other European countries between 1996 and 2020, for a combined total of at least tickets sold in Europe. By June 1952, the film had grossed overseas. Later that same year, &quot;Scene&quot; reported that the film had earned () overseas, which was more than what all of the previous Japanese movies released overseas had collectively grossed outside of Japan within the past four years. In 1954, &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; stated that it grossed in 1951, and reached roughly shortly thereafter. According to the National Board of Review, &quot;Rashomon&quot; exceeded in the United States alone.

In 2002, the film grossed $46,808 in the US, with an additional earned $96,568 during 2009 to 2010, for a combined in the United States between 2002 and 2010.

===Venice Film Festival screening===
Japanese film companies had no interest in international festivals and were reluctant to submit the movie because paying for printing and creating subtitles was considered a waste of money. The film was subsequently screened at the 1951 Venice Film Festival at the behest of Italifilm president Giuliana Stramigioli, who had recommended it to the Italian film promotion agency Unitalia Film seeking a Japanese film to screen at the festival. In 1953, Stramigioli explained her reasoning behind submitting the film:

However, Daiei and other Japanese corporations disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa&#x27;s work because it was &quot;not [representative enough] of the Japanese movie industry&quot; and felt that a work of Yasujirō Ozu would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival.

Before it was screened at the Venice festival, the film initially drew little attention and had low expectations at the festival, as Japanese cinema was not yet taken seriously in the West at the time. But once it had been screened, &quot;Rashomon&quot; drew an overwhelmingly positive response from festival audiences, praising its originality and techniques while making many question the nature of truth. The film won both the Italian Critics Award and the Golden Lion award—introducing Western audiences, including Western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa&#x27;s films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor&#x27;s faces.

===Home media===
Kadokawa released &quot;Rashomon&quot; on DVD in May 2008 and Blu-ray in February 2009. The Criterion Collection later issued a Blu-ray and DVD edition of the film based on the 2008 restoration, accompanied by a number of additional features.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
====Japanese reviews====
&quot;Rashomon&quot; was met with mixed reviews from Japanese critics upon its release. When it received positive responses in the West, Japanese critics were baffled: some decided that it was only admired there because it was &quot;exotic&quot;; others thought that it succeeded because it was more &quot;Western&quot; than most Japanese films.

Tadashi Iijima criticized &quot;its insufficient plan for visualizing the style of the original stories&quot;. Tatsuhiko Shigeno of &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; opposed Mifune&#x27;s extensive dialogue as unfitting for the role of a bandit. Akira Iwasaki later cited how he and his contemporaries were &quot;impressed by the boldness and excellence of director Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s experimental approach within this movie, but couldn&#x27;t help but notice that there was some confusion in its expression&quot; adding that &quot;I found it difficult to resonate with the agnostic philosophy that the film contains wholeheartedly&quot;.

In a collection of interpretations of &quot;Rashomon&quot;, Donald Richie writes that &quot;the confines of &#x27;Japanese&#x27; thought could not contain the director, who thereby joined the world at large&quot;. Regarding the film&#x27;s Japanese reception, Kurosawa remarked:

&quot;Japanese are terribly critical of Japanese films, so it is not too surprising that a foreigner should have been responsible for my [film] being sent to Venice. It was the same way with Japanese woodcuts; it was the foreigners who first appreciated them. We Japanese think too little of our own things. Actually, &quot;Rashomon&quot; wasn&#x27;t all that good, I don&#x27;t think. Yet when people have said to me that its reception was just a stroke of luck, a fluke, I have answered by saying that they only say these things because the film is, after all, Japanese, and then I wonder: Why do we all think so little of our own things? Why don’t we stand up for our films? What are we so afraid of?&quot;

====International reviews====
&quot;Rashomon&quot; received mostly acclaim from Western critics.

Ed Sullivan gave the film a positive review in &quot;Hollywood Citizen-News&quot;, calling it &quot;an exciting evening, because the direction, the photography and the performances will jar open your eyes.&quot; He praised Akutagawa&#x27;s original plot, Kurosawa&#x27;s impactful direction and screenplay, Mifune&#x27;s &quot;magnificent&quot; villainous performance, and Miyagawa&#x27;s &quot;spellbinding&quot; cinematography that achieves &quot;visual dimensions that I&#x27;ve never seen in Hollywood photography&quot; such as being &quot;shot through a relentless rainstorm that heightens the mood of the somber drama.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Time&quot; was critical of the film, finding it &quot;draggy&quot; and noted that its score &quot;borrows freely&quot; from Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;.

=== &quot;Boléro&quot; controversy ===
The usage of a musical composition similar to Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; provoked wide controversy, especially in Western countries. Some accused Hayasaka of music plagiarism, including &quot;Boléro&quot;&#x27;s publisher, who sent him a letter of protest after the film&#x27;s French release.

In late 1950, the film was vetoed from &#x27;s selection list for the 4th Cannes Film Festival over concerns about facing copyright issues for the composition.

=== Masaichi Nagata&#x27;s response ===
Daiei&#x27;s president, Masaichi Nagata, was initially critical of the film. Assistant director Tokuzō Tanaka said that Nagata broke the abrupt few minutes of silence following its preview screening at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Kyōbashi by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t really get it, but it&#x27;s a noble photograph&quot;. According to Kurosawa, Nagata had called &quot;Rashomon&quot; &quot;incomprehensible&quot; and loathed it so much that he ended up demoting its producer.

Nagata later embraced &quot;Rashomon&quot; upon it receiving numerous awards and international success. He kept the original Golden Lion that the film received in his office, and had replicas handed to Kurosawa and others who worked on the film. His constant reference to its accomplishments as if he was responsible for the film himself was stated by many. In 1992, Kurosawa remarked that Nagata had cited &quot;Rashomon&quot;&#x27;s cinematographic feats in an interview included for the film&#x27;s first television broadcast without mentioning the names of its director or cinematographer. He reflected being disgusted by the company&#x27;s president taking credit for the film&#x27;s achievements: &quot;Watching that television interview, I had the feeling that I was back in the world of &quot;Rashomon&quot; all over again. It was as if the pathetic self-delusions of the ego, those failings I had attempted to portray in the film, were being exhibited in real life. People do indeed have immense difficulty talking about themselves as they really are. I was reminded once again that the human animal suffers from the trait of instinctive self-aggrandizement.&quot; Some modern sources have erroneously credited Nagata as the film&#x27;s producer.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
===Associated films===
The international success of &quot;Rashomon&quot; led Daiei to produce several subsequent &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films featuring Kyō as the lead. Among these were Kōzaburō Yoshimura&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (1951), Teinosuke Kinugasa&#x27;s &quot;Dedication of the Great Buddha&quot; (1952) and &quot;Gate of Hell&quot; (1953), Kenji Mizoguchi&#x27;s &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953), and Keigo Kimura&#x27;s &quot;The Princess Sen&quot; (1954), all of which received screenings overseas. In 1952, Daiei produced a Western-targeted epic, titled &quot;,&quot; with the intent of obtaining a second Golden Lion. Based on another story by Akutagawa, composed by Hayasaka, and starring Kyō, Mori, Shimura, Katō, and Honma, the film has been described as an inferior imitator of &quot;Rashomon&quot; and has since faded into obscurity. Mifune was also initially going to appear in &quot;Beauty and the Thief&quot; as suggested by a photograph of him taken by Werner Bischof during production in 1951 when the film was allegedly titled &quot;Hokkaido&quot;.

===Cultural impact===
&quot;Rashomon&quot; has been cited as &quot;one of the most influential films of the 20th century&quot;. In the early 1960s, film historians credited &quot;Rashomon&quot; as the start of the international New Wave cinema movement, which gained popularity during the late 1950s to early 1960s. It has since been cited as an inspiration for numerous films from around the world, including &quot;Andha Naal&quot; (1954), &quot;Valerie&quot; (1957), &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; (1961), &quot;Yavanika&quot; (1982), Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996), &quot;Tape&quot; (2001), &quot;Hero&quot; (2002), and &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023).

Various television shows, including &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1971–1979), &quot;Frasier&quot; (1993–2004), and &quot;The Acolyte&quot; (2024) have made episodes inspired by the film. Some have compared &quot;Monster&quot; (2023) to the film; however, director Hirokazu Kore-eda claimed its similarities are merely coincidental. Ryan Reynolds&#x27; initial proposal for &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024) was for it to have a plot similar to &quot;Rashomon&quot;.

In a 1998 issue of &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston wrote: &quot;Rashomon&quot; is probably familiar even to those who haven&#x27;t seen it, since in movie jargon, the film&#x27;s title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit: a story told multiple times from various points of view. There&#x27;s much more than that to the film, of course. For example, the way Kurosawa uses his camera...takes this fascinating meditation on human nature closer to the style of silent film than almost anything made after the introduction of sound.

<text>Vasa (previously Wasa) () is a Swedish warship built between 1626 and 1628. The ship sank after sailing roughly into her maiden voyage on 10 August 1628. She fell into obscurity after most of her valuable bronze cannons were salvaged in the 17th century, until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping area in Stockholm harbor. The ship was salvaged with a largely intact hull in 1961. She was housed in a temporary museum called Wasavarvet (&quot;The Vasa Shipyard&quot;) until 1988 and then moved permanently to the Vasa Museum in the Royal National City Park in Stockholm. As the most visited museum in Scandinavia, the ship is one of Sweden&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions and has been seen by over 45 million visitors since 1961. Since her recovery, &quot;Vasa&quot; has become a widely recognized symbol of the Swedish Empire.

The ship was built on the orders of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus as part of the military expansion he initiated in a war with Poland-Lithuania (1621–1629). She was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626–1627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship. Richly decorated as a symbol of the king&#x27;s ambitions for Sweden and himself, upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world. However, &quot;Vasa&quot; was dangerously unstable, with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull. Despite this lack of stability, she was ordered to sea and sank only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze.

The order to sail was the result of a combination of factors. The king, who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage, was impatient to see her take up her station as flagship of the reserve squadron at Älvsnabben in the Stockholm Archipelago. At the same time the king&#x27;s subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship&#x27;s problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed. An inquiry was organized by the Swedish Privy Council to find those responsible for the disaster, but in the end no one was punished.

During the 1961 recovery, thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around &quot;Vasa&quot;″s hull by marine archaeologists. Among the many items found were clothing, weapons, cannons, tools, coins, cutlery, food, drink and six of the ten sails. The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques, the evolution of sailing rigs, and everyday life in early 17th-century Sweden. Today &quot;Vasa&quot; is the world&#x27;s best-preserved 17th-century ship, answering many questions about the design and operation of ships of this period. The wreck of &quot;Vasa&quot; continually undergoes monitoring and further research on how to preserve her.

== Historical background ==
During the 17th century, Sweden went from being a sparsely populated, poor, and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the major powers in continental politics. Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the Baltic, eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides. This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess, called &quot;stormaktstiden&quot; (&quot;age of greatness&quot; or &quot;great power period&quot;), was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralized government, supporting a highly efficient military organization. Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a fiscal-military state and one of the most militarized states in history.

Gustavus Adolphus (1594–1632) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare. When &quot;Vasa&quot; was built, he had been in power for more than a decade. Sweden was embroiled in a war with Poland-Lithuania, and looked apprehensively at the development of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in present-day Germany. The war had been raging since 1618 and from a Protestant perspective it was not successful. The king&#x27;s plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden&#x27;s interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic.

The Swedish Navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the Bay of Riga was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked. In the Battle of Oliwa in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost. &quot;Tigern&quot; (&quot;The Tiger&quot;), which was the Swedish admiral&#x27;s flagship, was captured by the Poles, and &quot;Solen&quot; (&quot;The Sun&quot;) was blown up by her own crew when she was boarded and nearly captured. In 1628, three more large ships were lost in less than a month. Admiral Klas Fleming&#x27;s flagship &quot;Kristina&quot; was wrecked in a storm in the Gulf of Danzig, &quot;Riksnyckeln&quot; (&quot;Key of the Realm&quot;) ran aground at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and &quot;Vasa&quot; foundered on her maiden voyage.

Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts, which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy. In addition to battling the Polish navy, the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded Jutland. The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king, Christian IV, and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century. However, Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of Copenhagen and Zealand. This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, which would be disastrous for Swedish interests.

Until the early 17th century, the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium-sized ships with a single gundeck, normally armed with 12-pounder and smaller guns; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well-suited for escort and patrol. They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy, which emphasized boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery. The king, who was a keen artillerist, saw the potential of ships as gun platforms, and large, heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power. Beginning with &quot;Vasa&quot;, he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks, outfitted with much heavier guns.

Four such ships were built after &quot;Vasa&quot;: &quot;Äpplet&quot; (&quot;The Apple&quot;), &quot;Kronan&quot; (&quot;The Crown&quot;), &quot;Scepter&quot; and &quot;Göta Ark&quot; (literally &quot;Ark of Götaland&quot;), before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king&#x27;s death in 1632. These ships, especially &quot;Kronan&quot; and &quot;Scepter&quot;, were much more successful, took part in battles, and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s. The second of the so-called &quot;regalskepp&quot; (usually translated as &quot;royal ships&quot;), &quot;Äpplet&quot; was completed in 1629 and is regarded as a sister ship of &quot;Vasa&quot;. The only significant difference between the two was an increase in the width of &quot;Äpplet&quot; by about a meter (3.1 ft). The wreck of &quot;Äpplet&quot;, visibly very similar to &quot;Vasa&quot;, was found in December 2021. &quot;Äpplet&quot;, and other ships, are believed ultimately to have been decommissioned and sunk as underwater barriers against enemy ships.

==Name==
The name &quot;Vasa&quot; is not written anywhere on the ship. Where we would expect to see this on a modern ship (the stern) is a substantial carving of the coat of arms of the House of Vasa. The central heraldic symbol of that is the &quot;vase&quot; which, at the time the ship was built, denoted a sheaf of wheat (or wheatsheaf). It is this main heraldic element that gives the ship her name.

In contemporary documents, the name was most often spelt as &quot;Wasen&quot; or &quot;Wasan&quot;. Swedish spelling was rationalised early in the 20th century and one of these changes was the substitution of the &quot;W&quot; with a &quot;V&quot;. The pronunciation is unchanged. In Swedish, the definite article is the suffix &quot;en&quot;: &quot;the Vasa&quot;. The decision of the Vasamuseet was to follow the usage for warship names in English, which is to have no definite article.

The word &quot;Vasa&quot; was used in the names of at least seven Swedish warships, two built before this ship ( and 1599) and four after, with the most recent built in 1902.

== Construction ==
Just before &quot;Vasa&quot; was ordered, Dutch-born Henrik Hybertsson (&quot;Master Henrik&quot;) was shipwright at the Stockholm shipyard. On 16 January 1625, Master Henrik and business partner Arendt de Groote signed a contract to build four ships, two with a keel of around and two smaller ones of .

Master Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625, purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough-sawn planking in Riga, Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad), and Amsterdam. As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625, Henrik corresponded with the king through Vice Admiral Klas Fleming about which ship to build first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new, medium size as a quick compromise, and he sent a specification for this, a ship which would be long on the keel. Henrik declined, since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship. He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626. Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed; he fell ill in late 1625, and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik &quot;Hein&quot; Jacobsson. He died in the spring of 1627, probably about the same time as the ship was launched.
After launching, work continued on finishing the upper deck, the sterncastle, the beakhead and the rigging. Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry, and material had to be ordered from abroad. In the contract for the maintenance of rigging, French sailcloth was specified, but the cloth for the sails of &quot;Vasa&quot; most likely came from Holland. The sails were made mostly of hemp and partly of flax. The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from Latvia through Riga. The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship.

In the summer of 1628, the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship, Söfring Hansson, arranged for the ship&#x27;s stability to be demonstrated for Vice Admiral Fleming, who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia. Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling, but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips, as he feared the ship would capsize. According to testimony by the ship&#x27;s master, Göran Mattson, Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home. Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship be put to sea as soon as possible.

=== Design and stability ===
There has been much speculation about whether &quot;Vasa&quot; was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gundeck was added late during the build. There is no evidence that &quot;Vasa&quot; was substantially modified after the keel was laid. Ships contemporary to &quot;Vasa&quot; that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections, making the addition readily identifiable, but no such addition can be identified in the hull, nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck.

The king ordered seventy-two 24-pound guns for the ship on 5 August 1626, and this was too many to fit on a single gundeck. Since the king&#x27;s order was issued less than five months after construction started, it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design. The French &quot;Galion du Guise&quot;, the ship used as a model for &quot;Vasa&quot;, according to Arendt de Groote, also had two gundecks. Laser measurements of &quot;Vasa&quot;″s structure conducted in 2007–2011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction, but that the centre of gravity was too high.

There was some vacillation over the exact armament for &quot;Vasa&quot; whilst she was being built. One issue was trying to source enough guns to meet the specification. The major options were a lower gun-deck battery of 24-pounders, with the upper gun-deck being 12-poundersversus having just 24-pounders on both the gun-decks. &quot;Vasa&quot; was actually built with upper gun-deck ports sized for the smaller 12-pounders. The final decision, though, was a total of 56 24-pounders distributed over the two gun-decks. Not every one of these guns had been delivered by the time she sailed, with some empty gun carriages being aboard at the time of the sinking.

&quot;Vasa&quot; was an early example of a warship with two full-length gundecks, and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood. Two gundecks was a much more complicated compromise between seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck. The overall weight distribution, particularly the hull itself, was too top-heavy. This underlying fault was not possible to correct merely by adding more ballast and might have even required a major redesign to correct. Safety margins during the 17th century were also far below anything that would be acceptable today. Combined with the fact that 17th-century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures (to be used as firing platforms), this made &quot;Vasa&quot; a risky undertaking.

=== Armament ===
&quot;Vasa&quot; was built during a time of transition in naval tactics, from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organized ship-of-the-line and a focus on victory through superior gunnery. &quot;Vasa&quot; was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern, which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers she was supposed to carry, but the high-sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimized for boarding. She was neither the largest ship ever built, nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns. What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannons of one side: , excluding &quot;stormstycken&quot;, guns used for firing anti-personnel ammunition instead of solid shot. This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time, perhaps in all of northern Europe, and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built. This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried. By comparison, , a frigate built by the United States 169 years after &quot;Vasa&quot;, had roughly the same firepower, but was over heavier.

The &quot;Constitution&quot;, however, belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the line of battle tactic, where ships fought in a line of ships (or &quot;line ahead&quot;) attempting to present the batteries of one side of each ship toward the enemy. The guns would be aimed in the same direction, and fire could be concentrated on a single target. In the 17th century, tactics involving organized formations of large fleets had still not been developed. Rather, ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups, and focused on boarding. &quot;Vasa&quot;, though possessing a formidable battery, was built with these tactics in mind, and therefore lacked a unified broadside with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction. Rather, the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull, so that the ship bristled with artillery in all directions, covering virtually all angles. The guns facing aft, the stern chasers, were still not on board when the ship sank, however.

Naval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy. Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship. Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of, while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years. In Sweden and many other European countries, a ship would normally not &quot;own&quot; her guns, but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season. Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size. What allowed &quot;Vasa&quot; to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship, but also that the 46 main 24-pounder guns were of a new and standardized lightweight design. These were cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm, under the direction of the Swiss-born founder Medardus Gessus. Two additional 24-pounders, of a heavier and older design, were mounted in the bows as &quot;bow chasers&quot;. Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern, but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships, and &quot;Vasa&quot; waited nearly a year after construction was finished for her armament. When the ship sailed in August 1628, eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered. All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused, but &quot;Vasa&quot;″s guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimeters, and their bores were almost exactly . The remaining armament of &quot;Vasa&quot; consisted of eight 3-pounders, six large-caliber &quot;stormstycken&quot; (similar to what the English called howitzers) for use during boarding actions, and two 1-pound falconets. Also included on board were of gunpowder and over 1,000 shot of various types for the guns.

The gundecks of &quot;Vasa&quot; are not parallel to the waterline, but follow the natural of the hull; this curve can be clearly seen in some of the photographs taken inside the ship. By the middle of the 17th century, warships had the gundeck set parallel to the waterline. &quot;Vasa&quot;″s arrangement avoids any of the gunports having to be cut through the structural s, which also follow this curve. The later layout means that the lower gundeck gunports are a consistent amount above the waterline, avoiding the weight of guns and structure of that deck towards the bow and stern being unnecessarily high.

===Sailing rig===
Generally, masts, sails and rigging, if not lost in the original wrecking event, are much more exposed to contemporary salvage, degradation or loss than the lower hull components that usually make up the remains of wrecks. With &quot;Vasa&quot;, virtually all of the lower fore and main masts have survived, much of the bowsprit and two yards which are likely derived from the ship. To this are added the six sails (out of a complement of ten) that were not set on the maiden voyage, but stored below in the sailroom, the 412 gun tackle and rigging blocks (plus 143 pieces) recovered out of a possible outfit of about 600, the deadeyes used to adjust the tension in the shrouds, of which 125 were recovered, parrel ribs and trucks, and ropes. By comparison, the Red Bay wreck 24M (sunk, probably, 1565) yielded 48 standing blocks (equivalent to deadeyes) and 24 running blocks whilst the (sunk 1545) produced only blocks that were stored below decksand the recovered sail has yet to be investigated. Neither of these had surviving masts, with their size only being estimated from the dimensions of the s and steps. &quot;Vasa&quot;″s sailing rig finds easily outnumber the aggregate total of finds from these two wrecks plus those from &quot;La Belle&quot; (sunk 1686) and &quot;Santo Antonio de Tanna&quot; (sunk 1697).

====Masts and yards====

&quot;Vasa&quot; had three masts: a foremast towards the bow of the ship, a mainmast near the middle and a mizzen mast towards the aft of the ship. The fore- and mainmasts were built in three sections: a lower mast that was stepped on the stem and keel at the bottom of the ship&#x27;s hull and passed through each of the decks; a topmast that was attached to the lower section; and a topgallant mast at the top. The top and topgallant masts were both salvaged soon after the sinking while most of the lower sections of the main- and foremasts largely survived to be salvaged in modern times. The mizzen mast consisted of only two sections: a mizzen, which was stepped on the upper gundeck, followed by a mizzen topmast. The bowsprit was stepped against the front of the lower foremast through the bowsprit bitts, a heavy timber frame located on the upper gundeck. The bowsprit served as a point of attachment for several of the major stays that held up much of the standing rig. At the outer end of the bowsprit there was a spritsail topmast with a mast head to carry a flagstaff.

The foremast was made from a single pine tree with additional material to make the and the that were used to attach the s. The lower mainmast was assembled as a &quot;made mast&quot; from a number of pieces of timber that reinforced a central core, rather than from a single tree. A single-tree mast was the preferred choice at the time and was much stronger structurally. The shipyard in Stockholm had at least indirect access to timber from western Sweden at the time. &quot;Gothenburg masts&quot; were considered among the best in Europe, but this source was not fully utilized by the Swedish navy until later in the 17th century. The made mast used for &quot;Vasa&quot; was most likely supplied by Amsterdam-based merchants who dominated the European timber market at the time.

====Sails====
When &quot;Vasa&quot; sank she only had four of her complement of ten sails bent onto the yards. The others were below deck in the sail room, neatly folded, tied and coiled, and placed in two large heaps. The weight of this mound of canvas presented problems to the excavators, but it probably contributed substantially to the survival of the sail cloth, which fared better towards the centre of the heaps. The larger heap had to be carefully cut into two pieces so that it could be manoeuvred out of the sail room.

The recovered sails consisted of the spritsail, spritsail topsail, fore topgallant, main course, main topgallant and the mizzen topsail. There was also a bonnet for the mizzen and a set of sails for a ship&#x27;s boat.

====Chainwales====
The s on &quot;Vasa&quot; are positioned above the gunports for the upper gundeck. This was the typical Dutch arrangement for a ship with two decks until the 1620s. Thereafter, Dutch shipyards used a lower attachment point, between the two rows of gunports, as was already done in other European shipyards.

The alignment of the chains that pass over the chainwales can be detected in the marks left in the wood (even though the iron components have corroded away). These alignments can be extrapolated to follow the route of each to the top of each lower mast, but with one exception at each chainwale. This non-conforming position would be suitable for a topmast . This extra rigging component had recently been introduced in European shipyards, with the earliest known instance in 1611. Giving greater support to the topmast with a backstay allowed the topsail to take a role as the main working sail on each mast. As square rig evolved, the topsail became the first square sail to be set and the last to be furled. Before this change, the was the first sail to be set and the last to be taken in, with topsails simply providing extra sail area in lighter winds. This is a substantial change in sail-handling technique. The sails set on &quot;Vasa&quot; at the time of her loss conform with this interpretation of the chainwalesthat &quot;Vasa&quot; was preferentially using topsails over courses. &quot;Vasa&quot; also has the main topsail halyard knighthead positioned a distance aft of the foot of the mast and angled to point at the main-topmast head. This gives further support to the main topmast, with the halyard having a secondary role as a backstay.

====Blocks and deadeyes====

Blocks, or pulleys, are a means of redirecting the path of a rope or providing a mechanical advantage, either on its own or in combination with other blocks, to increase the force applied. The majority of blocks have a sheave which rotates on an axlethe rope that goes through the block fits into a groove cut in the sheave. The load in the rope is transferred from the axle to the shell of the block, which, at the time of &quot;Vasa&quot;, has a rope strop (usually) or wrought iron strap which goes around the shell and is used to fasten the block to another object. More rarely, a block does not have a sheave. It is then termed a &quot;dead block&quot;.

Deadeyes are used in the standing rigging. These are the pieces of wood that, operating in pairs, allow adjustment of the length of shrouds or stays. A lanyard passes through a number of holes in each pairtightening the lanyard shortens the distance between the pair of deadeyes. Since natural fibre ropes can change in length depending on the amount of moisture in them, the standing rigging of a 17th-century ship needed much more adjustment than a more modern sailing vessel.

===Steering===

Vasa was steered with a whipstaff (as opposed to a wheel, which started to be used in the next century). This is a vertical lever that passes through a sliding bearing in the deck (the &quot;rowle&quot;) and operates on the end of the helm (or ), which in turn is attached to the top of the . The steering position (the &quot;steerage&quot;) is immediately in front of the entrance to the great cabin, on the upper gundeck. It occupies a double-height space, with of headroom to accommodate the length of the whipstaff. There are balustraded openings through which the helmsman has some view of the sails. The addition of a step across the width of the steerage suggests that this visibility had not turned out as planned and needed some last-minute adjustment. The helm is located a deck below, in the gunroom, which is the aftermost compartment on the lower gundeck. It passes through an opening in the stern to connect to the top of the rudder head.

Vasa represents the only complete surviving and investigated example of a whipstaff steering system. Study of this has changed the presumptions of how effective this method was, as a number of replicas of ships have been built with a whipstaff, and the system has been found to be fully effective.

In operation, the steering system of Vasa was able to apply 23 degrees of angle to the rudder. This is limited by the width of the hull structure where the helm moves from side to side in the gunroom. This angle is totally sufficient to steer the ship, as amounts greater than this create a lot of extra drag without increasing the turning moment significantly. At low angles, the whipstaff acts as a lever on the helm. At greater angles it works more as a push stick (rather like the tiller extension on a modern sailing dinghy).

The steerage compartment was equipped with a bittacle, a wooden cabinet which stood against the forward bulkhead on the centre-line. It has space for two compasses, one on each side of a central light. Each compass can be viewed through a glass window. This allows the helmsman to see the course being steered whichever side of the whipstaff they are standingthis type of steering requires the operator to be much more mobile than with a steering wheel, so a single compass would be ineffective. Given the limited visibility from the steering position, the compasses and a view of some of the sails were the only means of staying on the course ordered from the con position on the deck above. The option of steering with reference to a distant landmark or another ship is not available.

The whipstaff started to be replaced with wheel steering sometime in the 18th century, though the precise date of this changeover is unknown.

=== Ornamentation ===

As was the custom with warships at the time, &quot;Vasa&quot; was decorated with sculptures intended to glorify the authority, wisdom and martial prowess of the monarch and also to deride, taunt and intimidate the enemy. The sculptures made up a considerable part of the effort and cost of building the ship. The symbolism used in decorating the ship was mostly based on the Renaissance idealization of Roman and Greek antiquity, which had been imported from Italy through German and Dutch artists. Imagery borrowed from Mediterranean antiquity dominates the motifs, but also include figures from the Old Testament and even a few from ancient Egypt. Many of the figures are in Dutch grotesque style, depicting fantastic and frightening creatures, including mermaids, wild men, sea monsters and tritons. The decoration inside the ship is much sparser and is largely confined to the steerage and the great cabin, at the after end of the upper gundeck.

Residues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship. The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors. The sides of the beakhead (the protruding structure below the bowsprit), the bulwarks (the protective railing around the weather deck), the roofs of the quarter galleries, and the background of the after upper works were all painted red, while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors, and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasized with gold leaf. Previously, it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded, and this is reflected in many paintings of &quot;Vasa&quot; from the 1970s to the early 1990s, such as the lively and dramatic drawings of Björn Landström or the painting by Francis Smitheman. In the late 1990s, this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship&#x27;s decoration by maritime painter Tim Thompson and the 1:10 scale model in the museum. &quot;Vasa&quot; is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early Baroque art but rather &quot;the last gasps of the medieval sculpture tradition&quot; with its fondness for gaudy colors, in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar.
The sculptures are carved out of oak, pine or linden, and many of the larger pieces, like the huge long figurehead lion, consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts. Close to 500 sculptures, most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead, are found on the ship. The figure of Hercules appears as a pair of pendants, one younger and one older, on each side of the lower stern galleries; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero, who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th-century European art. On the stern are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images. A particularly popular motif is the lion, which can be found as mascarons originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors, grasping the royal coat of arms on either side, the figurehead, and even clinging to the top of the rudder. Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures (though only 19 have actually been found) that depicted Roman emperors from Tiberius to Septimius Severus.

Overall, almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler. The only actual portrait of the king is located at the very top of the stern. Here he is depicted as a young boy with long, flowing hair, being crowned by two griffins representing the king&#x27;s father, Charles IX.
A team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures, most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants. No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided, but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists, Mårten Redtmer, is clearly identifiable. Other accomplished artists, like Hans Clausink, Johan Didrichson Tijsen (or &quot;Thessen&quot; in Swedish) and possibly Marcus Ledens, are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time &quot;Vasa&quot; was built, but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures.

The artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably, and about four distinct styles can be identified. The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is Mårten Redtmer, whose style has been described as &quot;powerful, lively and naturalistic&quot;. He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures. These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces: the figurehead lion, the royal coat of arms, and the sculpture of the king at the top of the stern. Two of the other styles are described as &quot;elegant ... a little stereotyped and manneristic&quot;, and of a &quot;heavy, leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style&quot;, respectively. The fourth and last style, deemed clearly inferior to the other three, is described as &quot;stiff and ungainly&quot; and was done by other carvers, perhaps even apprentices, of lesser skill.

== Maiden voyage ==
=== Sinking ===

On 10 August 1628, Captain Söfring Hansson ordered &quot;Vasa&quot; to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at Älvsnabben. The day was calm, and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest. The ship was warped (hauled by anchor) along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor, where four sails were set, and the ship made way to the east. The gun ports were open, and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm.

As &quot;Vasa&quot; passed under the lee of the bluffs to the south (now called Södermalm), a gust of wind filled her sails, and she heeled suddenly to port. The sheets were cast off, and the ship slowly righted herself as the gust passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a gap in the bluffs, an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto her port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck. The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship&#x27;s minimal righting ability, and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold. The ship swiftly sank to a depth of only from shore. Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts, which were still above the surface. Many nearby boats rushed to their aid, but despite these efforts and the short distance to land, 30 people reportedly perished with the ship. &quot;Vasa&quot; sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds, if not thousands, of mostly ordinary Stockholmers who had come to see the ship set sail. The crowd included foreign ambassadors, in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; allies and enemies.

=== Inquest ===
The Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss, telling him of the sinking, but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland. &quot;Imprudence and negligence&quot; must have been the cause, he wrote angrily in his reply, demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished. Captain Söfring Hansson, who survived the disaster, was immediately taken for questioning. Under initial interrogation, he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober.

A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the Royal Palace on 5 September 1628. Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses. Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm, Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm. The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk. Whoever the committee might find guilty for the fiasco would face a severe penalty.

Surviving crew members were questioned one by one about the handling of the ship at the time of the disaster. Was she rigged properly for the wind? Was the crew sober? Was the ballast properly stowed? Were the guns properly secured? However, no one was prepared to take the blame. Crewmen and contractors formed two camps; each tried to blame the other, and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed.

Next, attention was directed to the shipbuilders. &quot;Why did you build the ship so narrow, so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized?&quot; the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson. Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson (the original shipbuilder, recently deceased), who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king. Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by after taking over responsibility for the construction, but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening.

In the end, no guilty party could be found. The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was &quot;Only God knows&quot;. Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments, and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified. In the end, no one was punished or found guilty for negligence, and the blame effectively fell on the dead Henrik Hybertsson.

== &quot;Vasa&quot; as a wreck ==
Less than three days after the disaster, a contract was signed for the ship to be raised. However, those efforts were unsuccessful. The earliest attempts at raising &quot;Vasa&quot; by English engineer Ian Bulmer resulted in righting the ship but also got her more securely stuck in the mud, which was one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery. Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today, but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise &quot;Vasa&quot; more than 300 years later. Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck, and ropes attached to several anchors were sent down and hooked to the ship. The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe, the ropes tightened, and the water pumped out. The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters. The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level. Even if the underwater weight of &quot;Vasa&quot; was not great, the mud in which she had settled made her sit more securely on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome.

More than 30 years after the ship&#x27;s sinking, in 1663–1665, Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns. With a simple diving bell, the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them. Such activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time. However, &quot;Vasa&quot; did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns. The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century. In 1844, the navy officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship, claiming he had located her. Fahnehjelm was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations. There were dives made on the wreck in 1895–1896, and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920, but this was turned down. In 1999, a witness also claimed that his father, a petty officer in the Swedish navy, had taken part in diving exercises on &quot;Vasa&quot; in the years before World War I.

=== Deterioration ===

In the 333 years that &quot;Vasa&quot; lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor (called Stockholms ström, &quot;the Stream&quot;, in Swedish), the ship and her contents were subject to several destructive forces, first among which were decomposition and erosion. Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the beakhead and much of the sterncastle together, and this included all of the ship&#x27;s wooden sculptures. Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking, and only large objects, such as anchors, or items made of cast iron, such as cannonballs, survived.

Organic materials fared better in the anaerobic conditions, and so wood, cloth and leather are often in very good condition, but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water, so that some are barely recognizable. Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected, so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding. Of the human remains, most of the soft tissue was consumed, leaving only the bones, which were often held together only by clothing, although in one case, hair, nails and brain tissue survived.

The parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries, suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water, unless they were disturbed by outside forces.
Eventually the entire sterncastle, the high, aft portion of the ship that housed the officers&#x27; quarters and held up the transom, gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures. The quarter galleries, which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle, collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations.

Human activity was the most destructive factor, as the initial salvage efforts, the recovery of the guns, and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks. Peckell and Treileben broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below. Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing, such as the life-size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of Septimius Severus that adorned the port side of the beakhead.

Since &quot;Vasa&quot; lay in a busy shipping channel, ships occasionally dropped anchor over her, and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle, probably in the 19th century. Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually entails blasting of bedrock, and the resulting tonnes of rubble were often dumped in the harbor; some of this landed on the ship, causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck.

=== &quot;Vasa&quot; rediscovered ===
In the early 1950s, amateur archaeologist Anders Franzén considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold brackish waters of the Baltic because, he reasoned, they were free from the shipworm &quot;Teredo navalis&quot;, which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer, saltier seas. Franzén had previously been successful in locating wrecks such as &quot;Riksäpplet&quot; and &quot;Lybska Svan&quot;, and after long and tedious research he began looking for &quot;Vasa&quot; as well. He spent many years probing the waters without success around the many assumed locations of the wreckage. He did not succeed until, based on accounts of an unknown topographical anomaly just south of the Gustav V dock on Beckholmen, he narrowed his search.

In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-powered coring probe, he located a large wooden object almost parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The location of the ship received considerable attention, even if the identification of the ship could not be determined without closer investigation. Soon after the announcement of the find, planning got underway to determine how to excavate and raise &quot;Vasa&quot;. The Swedish Navy was involved from the start, as were various museums and the National Heritage board, representatives of which eventually formed the &quot;Vasa&quot; Committee, the predecessor of the &quot;Vasa&quot; Board.

=== Recovery ===

A number of possible recovery methods were proposed, including filling the ship with ping-pong balls and freezing her in a block of ice, but the method chosen by the Vasa Board (which succeeded the Vasa Committee) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking. Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings, which were taken to a pair of lifting pontoons at the surface. The work under the ship was extremely dangerous, requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high-pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge, all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tonnes of mud-filled ship overhead. A persistent risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel, trapping him underneath the wreckage. The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside. Despite the dangerous conditions, more than 1,300 dives were made in the salvage operation without any serious accidents.

Each time the pontoons were pumped full, the cables tightened and the pontoons pumped out, the ship was brought a meter closer to the surface. In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from a depth of in the more sheltered area of Kastellholmsviken, where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift. Over the course of a year and a half, a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship, and made the hull as watertight as possible. The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids, a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed, and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged. The final lift began on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, &quot;Vasa&quot; was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years. Press from all over the world, television cameras, 400 invited guests on barges and boats, and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface. The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V dry dock on Beckholmen, where the ship was floated on her own keel onto a concrete pontoon, on which the hull still stands.

From the end of 1961 to December 1988, &quot;Vasa&quot; was housed in a temporary facility called Wasavarvet (&quot;The Vasa Shipyard&quot;), which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship. A building was erected over the ship on her pontoon, but it was very cramped, making conservation work awkward. Visitors could view the ship from just two levels, and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of meters, which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship. In 1981, the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed, and a design competition was organized. The winning design, by the Swedish architects Månsson and Dahlbäck, called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal, industrial style. Ground was broken in 1987, and &quot;Vasa&quot; was towed into the half-finished Vasa Museum in December 1988. The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990.

== Archaeology ==
&quot;Vasa&quot; posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists. Never before had a four-storey structure, with most of its original contents largely undisturbed, been available for excavation. The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties. The ship had to be kept wet in order that she not dry out and crack before she could be properly conserved. Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge-covered mud that could be more than deep.

In order to establish find locations, the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams, the decking and by a line drawn along the centre of the ship from stern to bow. For the most part, the decks were excavated individually, though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously.

=== Ship structure ===
&quot;Vasa&quot; had four preserved decks: the upper and lower gundecks, the hold and the orlop. Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation, the archaeologists had to work quickly, in 13-hour shifts during the first week of excavation. The upper gundeck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961, and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck, but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse.

The decks below were progressively less disturbed. The gundecks contained not just gun carriages, the three surviving cannons, and other objects of a military nature, but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking. These included a wide range of loose finds, as well as chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes, tools and materials for mending, money (in the form of low-denomination copper coins), privately purchased provisions, and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea.

=== Finds ===
Most of the individual finds on board are of wood, testifying not only to the simple life on board, but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century. The lower decks were primarily used for storage, and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder, coils of anchor cable, iron shot for the guns, and the personal possessions of some of the officers. On the orlop deck, a small compartment contained six of the ship&#x27;s ten sails, rigging spares, and the working parts for the ship&#x27;s pumps. Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship&#x27;s carpenter, including a large tool chest.

After the ship herself had been salvaged and excavated, the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963–1967. This produced many items of rigging as well as structural timbers that had fallen off, particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle. Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud, along with the ship&#x27;s anchors and the skeletons of at least four people. The last object to be brought up was the longboat, called &quot;esping&quot; in Swedish, found lying parallel to the ship and believed to be towed by &quot;Vasa&quot; when she sank.

Many of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered, but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts, and others had their own stories to tell. Among the best-known of these was a statue of 20th-century Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi, which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto University) the night before the final lift.

== Causes of sinking ==

&quot;Vasa&quot; sank because she had very little initial stability—resistance to heeling under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. This was due to the distribution of mass in the hull structure, and to the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board placing a lot of weight too high in the ship. This put the centre of gravity very high relative to the centre of buoyancy, thus making the ship readily heel in response to little force, and not providing enough righting moment for her to become upright again.

The guns weighed little over , about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship, not enough in themselves to cause the ship to capsize. The reason for the high centre of gravity was the hull construction. The part of the hull above the waterline was too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks was higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, tall, making the weight of the decks and the guns higher than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers were over-dimensioned and more closely spaced than required for the loads they carried, contributing too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.

During construction both Swedish feet (of 29.69 cm) and Amsterdam feet (of 28.31 cm) were in use by different teams. Four rulers used by the workmen who built the ship have been found; two were calibrated in Swedish feet, of 12 Swedish inches, and the other two were calibrated in Amsterdam feet, of 11 Amsterdam inches. The use of different units of length on the two sides of the vessel caused the ship to be heavier on the port side.

Although the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future, and 17th-century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed, the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other. In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough &quot;belly&quot; to carry the heavy upperworks. When other ships that predated stability calculations were found to lack stability, remedial action could be taken to increase the beam. This could involve adding an extra layer of planking below the waterline. More drastically, the process of furring could be used: planking was removed and extra pieces of wood were added to the frames to increase the molded breadth. Then the planking was replaced.

&quot;Vasa&quot; might not have sunk when she did if the ship had sailed with the gunports closed. Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally sailed with the lowest tier closed, since the pressure of wind on the sails would often push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water. For this reason the gunport covers were made with a double lip designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water. Captain Söfring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water, but by then it was too late. If he had done it before he sailed, &quot;Vasa&quot; might not have sunk on that day.

== Conservation ==

Although &quot;Vasa&quot; was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea, she would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry. The large bulk of &quot;Vasa&quot;, over of oak timber, constituted an unprecedented conservation problem. After some debate on how to best preserve the ship, conservation was carried out by impregnation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a method that has since become the standard treatment for large, waterlogged wooden objects, such as the 16th-century English ship &quot;Mary Rose&quot;. &quot;Vasa&quot; was sprayed with PEG for 17 years, followed by a long period of slow drying, not entirely complete by 2011.

The reason that &quot;Vasa&quot; was so well-preserved was not just that the shipworm that normally devours wooden ships was absent, but also that the water of Stockholms ström was heavily polluted until the late 20th century. The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving. This, and &quot;Vasa&quot; being newly built and undamaged when she sank, contributed to her conservation. However, some properties of the water were harmful. Chemicals present in the water around &quot;Vasa&quot; had penetrated the wood, and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had corroded away. Once the ship was exposed to the air, reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds. In the late 1990s, spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on &quot;Vasa&quot; and some of the associated artefacts; these turned out to be sulfate-containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when sulfides reacted with atmospheric oxygen. The salts on the surface of &quot;Vasa&quot; and objects found in and around her are not a threat in themselves despite the discoloring, but if they are from inside the wood, they may expand and crack the timber from inside. As of 2002, the amount of sulfuric acid in &quot;Vasa&quot;&#x27;s hull was estimated to be more than , and more is continually being created. Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another of acid at a rate of about per year; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely.

While most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for &quot;Vasa&quot;&#x27;s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at Luleå University of Technology, has proposed another mechanism with her colleague Börje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with PEG in an acidic environment can generate formic acid and eventually liquify the wood. &quot;Vasa&quot; was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low (acidic) pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.
The museum is constantly monitoring the ship for damage caused by decay or warping of the wood. Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old oak of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength, and the cradle that supports the ship is not well suited to the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. &quot;The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again&quot;, states Magnus Olofson from the &quot;Vasa&quot; Museum. An effort to secure &quot;Vasa&quot; for the future is under way, in cooperation with the Royal Institute of Technology and other institutions around the globe.

To deal with the problem of the inevitable deterioration of the ship, the main hall of the &quot;Vasa&quot; Museum is kept at a temperature of and a humidity level of 53%. Different methods have been tried to slow destruction by acidic compounds. Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of nitrogen gas, to prevent further reactions between sulfides and oxygen. The ship herself has been treated with cloth saturated in a basic liquid to neutralize the low pH, but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced. The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank, but were replaced with modern ones that were galvanized and covered with epoxy resin. Despite this, the newer bolts also started to rust and were releasing iron into the wood, accelerating the deterioration.

Between 2011 and 2018, the Vasa Museum and the Swedish materials technology group Alleima undertook a long-term research and development project to replace the galvanised bolts with specially designed high alloy stainless steel substitutes, made up of eight components. The steel from which the replacement bolts were manufactured, designated as SAF 2707 HD, is corrosion-resistant, can withstand exposure to the harshest environments, and is normally used in the oil-and-gas industry.

The Museum also announced at the end of 2023 that it would be building a replacement cradle and new internal support skeleton for the &quot;Vasa&quot; at a total cost of SEK 150 million, and was seeking funding from donors and sponsors. Researching the project, and work on construction drawings, had already taken four years; test operations on full-scale models had also been carried out. The project itself, anticipated to take about a further four years, was scheduled to begin in spring 2024. A consequence of this work is that the interior of the ship will have many support structures added to it, so impairing the visual impression of the lower decks and interior spaces. Therefore a visual record has been made of the appearance of the inside of the ship before the start of this work.

== Legacy ==
Within 20 years of the sinking of &quot;Vasa&quot;, Sweden ceased using Dutch shipwrights and instead employed English expertise. Whilst it is suggested this change was due to King Karl X Gustav being impressed by an English-built ship that he saw, it is likely that the design processes used in English shipyards fitted better with the Swedish state as customer. In contrast to the older traditional methods used by the Dutch, English shipwrights put plans for a new ship on paper and built models for discussion with those paying for construction.

In the 20th century, &quot;Vasa&quot; became a popular and widely recognized symbol for a historical narrative about the Swedish &quot;stormaktstiden&quot; (&quot;the Great Power-period&quot;) in the 17th century, and about the early development of a European nation state. Within the disciplines of history and maritime archaeology the wrecks of large warships from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of past greatness of the state of Sweden. Among these wrecks, &quot;Vasa&quot; is the best-known example, and has become recognized internationally, not least through intentional use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad.

The name &quot;Vasa&quot; has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance, and these are usually described, explained and valued in relation to &quot;Vasa&quot; herself. The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl-Olof Cederlund, who has been active in the various &quot;Vasa&quot;-projects, has described the phenomenon as &quot;regalskepps-syndromet&quot;, &quot;the royal ship syndrome&quot; (after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy). He associates the &quot;syndrome&quot; to a nationalist aspect of the history of ideas and traditional perceptions about hero-kings and glory through war.

The focus of this historical theory lies on the &quot;great periods&quot; in &quot;our [Swedish] history&quot; and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the Viking Age in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman Antiquity in the Western world in general. Cederlund has stressed the ritualized aspects of the widely publicized salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with &quot;a temple in the Classical sense of the word&quot;. The placement of the museum on Djurgården, traditional crown property, and its focus on &quot;the King&#x27;s ship&quot; has led him to suggest a description of it as &quot;The Temple of the Royal Ship&quot;.

=== Literature and popular culture ===

&quot;Vasa&quot;″s unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars, tourists, model builders, and authors. Though historically unfounded, the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganized affair (dubbed &quot;the &quot;Vasa&quot;-syndrome&quot;) has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organize a successful business. In &quot;The Tender Ship&quot;, Manhattan Project engineer Arthur Squires used the &quot;Vasa&quot; story as an opening illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.
The Vasa Museum has co-sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship, both by documentary filmmaker Anders Wahlgren. The second version was shown in the museum and released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages. In late 2011, a third &quot;Vasa&quot;-film premiered on Swedish television, with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget (with over 7.5 million kronor provided by SVT).

An educational computer game was made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th-century ship construction and stability. Several mass-produced model kits and countless custom-built models of the ship have been made. In 1991, a pastiche reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650-passenger sightseeing ship. &quot;Vasa&quot; has inspired many works of art, including a gilded Disney-themed parody of the pilaster sculptures on the ship&#x27;s quarter galleries.

Being a popular tourist attraction, &quot;Vasa&quot; is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T-shirts, mugs, refrigerator magnets, and posters. Commercially produced replicas of many of the objects found on the ship belonging to people on board, such as drinking glasses, plates, spoons, and even a backgammon game, have been made.

<doc id="187607" wikidata="Q1076912" url="?curid=187607" title="Rashōmon (short story)">
<text>is a short story by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa based on tales from the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;.

The story was first published in 1915 in &quot;Teikoku Bungaku&quot;. Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950) is in fact based primarily on another of Akutagawa&#x27;s short stories, &quot;In a Grove&quot;; only the film&#x27;s title and some of the material for the frame scenes, such as the theft of a kimono and the discussion of the moral ambiguity of thieving to survive, are borrowed from &quot;Rashōmon&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The story recounts the encounter between a servant and an old woman in the dilapidated Rashōmon, the southern gate of the then-ruined city of Kyoto, where unclaimed corpses were sometimes dumped. The current name of the gate in the story, but not the plot, comes from the Noh play &quot;Rashōmon&quot; (c. 1420).

The man, a lowly servant recently fired, is contemplating whether to starve to death or to become a thief to survive in the barren times. He goes upstairs, after noticing some firelight there, and encounters a woman who is stealing hair from the dead bodies on the second floor. He is disgusted, and decides then that he would rather take the path of righteousness even if it meant starvation. He is furious with the woman.

But the old woman tells him that she steals hair to make wigs, so she can survive. In addition, the woman who she is currently robbing cheated people in her life by selling snake meat and claiming it was fish. The old woman says that this was not wrong because it allowed the woman to survive — and so in turn this entitles her to steal from the dead person, because if she doesn&#x27;t, she too will starve. The man responds: &quot;You won&#x27;t blame me, then, for taking your clothes. That&#x27;s what I have to do to keep from starving to death&quot;. He then brutally robs the woman of her robe and disappears into the night.

==Popular culture==
The story itself also plays a part in the 1999 movie &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;, directed by Jim Jarmusch.

The story is the inspiration for an instrumental rock tune of the same name composed by Japanese instrumental guitarist Takeshi Terauchi and originally played by Japanese instrumental rock group Takeshi Terauchi &amp; Blue Jeans on their 1972 album, &quot;Rashomon&quot;.

The manga &quot;Bungo Stray Dogs&quot; features a character named after Akutagawa with heavy references to Rashōmon.

The story is assigned for Modern Japanese high school coursework and quoted in the manga &quot;After the Rain&quot;.

The 2017 graphic novel &quot;Rashomon: A Commissioner Heigo Kobayashi Case&quot; by Victor Santos is also inspired from the short stories of Akutagawa and the eponymous movie of Kurosawa as well as by the &quot;forty-seven rōnin&quot; episode, rendered in the eponymous book by Jirō Osaragi.

<doc id="187608" wikidata="Q1507085" url="?curid=187608" title="Konjaku Monogatarishū">
<text>, also known as the , is a Japanese collection of over one thousand tales written during the late Heian period (794–1185). The entire collection was originally contained in 31 volumes, of which 28 remain today. The volumes cover various tales from India, China and Japan. Detailed evidence of lost &quot;monogatari&quot; exist in the form of literary critique, which can be studied to reconstruct the objects of their critique to some extent.

==Title==
Each tale in the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; starts with the phrase (lit. now long ago), which in its Japanese reading is pronounced &quot;ima wa mukashi&quot;. The Sino-Japanese reading of this phrase is &quot;konjaku&quot;, and it is from the Chinese-style reading that the collection is named. The &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; is commonly known by the shorter name &quot;Konjaku Monogatari&quot;. Since it is an anthology rather than a single tale, however, the longer title is more accurate.

==Structure==
The &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; is divided according to the region of the text. The first five volumes, the section, contain tales set in India. The next five volumes, the section, contain tales set in China. The remainder of the anthology, the section, contains tales from Japan.

It is important to note that the arrangement of the stories is in parallel to how Buddhism travelled to Japan. The collection emphasizes the path that Buddhism took to Japan in order to further understand what Buddhism means to Japan. First, Buddhism leaves India and becomes very popular in China. As many things have been borrowed from the Chinese, Buddhism then travels to Japan. Each move leads to a morphing of the basics of this religion so by that time it arrived in Japan, it became a new form of Buddhism for the Japanese.

==Contents==
The subject-matter is largely drawn from Buddhist and popular folklore. The anthology contains no mythology, and references to Shinto-related themes are notably few. The Buddhist tales cover a wide range of topics; both historical tales about the development, transmission and spread of Buddhism along with dogmatic tales which emphasize karmic retribution. The folkloric tales mostly depict encounters between human beings and the supernatural. The typical characters are drawn from Japanese society of the time — nobility, warriors, monks, scholars, doctors, peasant farmers, fishermen, merchants, prostitutes, bandits, beggars, widows. Their supernatural counterparts are oni and tengu.

==Date and authorship==
The work is anonymous. Several theories of authorship have been put forward: one argues that the compiler was Minamoto no Takakuni, author of &quot;Uji Dainagon Monogatari&quot;; another suggests the Buddhist monk Tobane Sōjō, and a third one proposes a Buddhist monk living somewhere in the vicinity of Kyoto or Nara during the late Heian period. So far no substantive evidence has emerged to decide the question and no general consensus has formed.

The date of the work is also uncertain. From the events depicted in some of the tales it seems likely that it was written down at some point during the early half of the 12th century, after the year 1120.

==Suzuka Manuscript==
The oldest extant copy of the Konjaku Monogatarishū is the Suzuka Manuscript (). Designated as a National Treasure in 1996, it was assembled by a Shinto priest named Tsuretane Suzuka in the Kamakura period (1185–1333). The manuscript was then brought to Kyoto University by a descendant who was a librarian at the university for donation and archiving. The manuscript has been scanned and made available in digital format on the internet.

==Animals in &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;==
In this work, specific human traits and characteristics such as the ability to think, feel and speak in a human form of cognition are assigned to various types of animals. By assigning human traits to the animals and through the utilization of these anthropomorphic animals, the authorship was more effectively able to communicate the various motifs, which impart a variety of moral teachings. To be able to implement such a paradigm, the authorship would have utilized pre-conceived common traits which were attributable to specific animals. The animals and their respective traits would have been common and implicit knowledge in ancient Japan and therefore known ubiquitously. The types of tales in &quot;Konjaku&quot; which include the use of anthropomorphic animals can be broadly classified into categories, in which a particular moral is accentuated.

==Significance==
Many of the tales which appear in the Konjaku are also found in other collections, such as ghost story collections. All these tales, having passed into the common consciousness, have been retold many times over the succeeding centuries. Modern writers have adapted tales from the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;: a famous example is Akutagawa Ryūnosuke&#x27;s &quot;In a Grove&quot; (well known in the West from Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Rashomon&quot;). Other authors who have written stories based on tales from the Konjaku include Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki and Hori Tatsuo.

The setsuwa (&quot;spoken story&quot;) in &quot;Konjaku Monogatari Shū&quot; has two main purposes: religious and secular. The religious aspect is important in leading the reader into a deeper understanding of Buddhism and what it means to the Japanese people. These stories try to appeal to average people of the time by presenting Buddhism in a simple yet meaningful way, one that people from any background can understand. In these tales both the reward for faith and the punishment for sin will be immediate. The secular aspect of these tales is that they can entertain an audience as well as provide enjoyment for an individual reader.

A cryptic line in Akutagawa&#x27;s classic short story &quot;Rashōmon&quot; says 「旧記の記者の語を借りれば、『頭身の毛も太る』ように感じたのである。」 (&quot;To borrow a phrase from the writers of the chronicles of old, he felt as if &#x27;even the hairs on his head and body had grown thick&#x27;.&quot;) This is a reference to a line from the &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;, the last part figuratively meaning that &quot;he was scared; he felt as if his hair was standing on end&quot;.

<doc id="187610" wikidata="Q210601" url="?curid=187610" title="House of Vasa">
<text>The House of Vasa or Wasa was a royal house that was founded in 1523 in Sweden. Its members ruled the Kingdom of Sweden from 1523 to 1654 and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1587 to 1668. Its agnatic line became extinct with the death of King John II Casimir Vasa in 1672.

The Vasa dynasty descended from a 14th-century Swedish noble family, tracing agnatic kinship to Nils Kettilsson (Vasa) (), the of &quot;Tre Kronor&quot; Castle in Stockholm. Several members held high offices during the 15th century. In 1523, after the Stockholm bloodbath and the abolition of the Kalmar Union, Gustav Eriksson (Vasa) became King Gustav I of Sweden and the royal house was founded. His reign is sometimes referred to as the beginning of the modern Swedish state, which included the King&#x27;s break with the Catholic Church during the Protestant Reformation and the foundation of the Church of Sweden.

However, his eldest son and successor Erik XIV of Sweden was overthrown by Gustav&#x27;s younger son, King John III of Sweden. John III married a Catholic Polish-Lithuanian princess, Catherine Jagiellon, leading to the House of Vasa becoming rulers of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Their Catholic son Sigismund III Vasa, then ruler of a short-lived Polish–Swedish union, was usurped in 1599 by John&#x27;s Protestant brother King Charles IX of Sweden in the War against Sigismund. The dynasty was then split into a Protestant Swedish branch and a Catholic Polish-Lithuanian one, which contended for crowns in subsequent wars.

The involvement of the famous Protestant general and King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in the Thirty Years&#x27; War gave rise to the saying that he was the incarnation of &quot;the Lion of the North&quot; (). Yet, notably, his daughter and heiress Queen Christina of Sweden (1632–1654) abdicated in 1654 after converting to Catholicism, and emigrated to Rome, where she was hosted by the Papacy. In the Commonwealth, John II Casimir Vasa abdicated in 1668. With his death, the royal House of Vasa became extinct in 1672, though the current King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, is descended from Gustav I through his paternal great-grandmother, Victoria of Baden, a descendant of Gustav I&#x27;s great-great-grandson Adolphus Frederick II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

== Kingdom of Sweden ==
=== Gustav I of Sweden ===
Gustav Eriksson, a son of Cecilia Månsdotter Eka and Erik Johansson Vasa, was probably born in 1496. The birth most likely took place in Rydboholm Castle, northeast of Stockholm, the manor house of the father, Erik. The newborn got his name, Gustav, from Erik&#x27;s grandfather Gustav Anundsson.
Since the end of the 14th century, Sweden had been a part of the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Norway. The Danish dominance in this union occasionally led to uprisings in Sweden. During Gustav&#x27;s childhood, parts of the Swedish nobility has tried to make Sweden independent from the union. Gustav and his father Erik supported the party of Sten Sture the Younger, regent of Sweden from 1512, and its struggle against the Danish King Christian II. Following the battle of Brännkyrka in 1518, where Sten Sture&#x27;s troops beat the Danish forces, it was decided that Sten Sture and King Christian would meet in Österhaninge for negotiations. To guarantee the safety of the king, the Swedish side sent six hostages to be kept by the Danes for as long as the negotiations lasted. However, Christian did not show up for the negotiations, violated the deal with the Swedish side, and took the hostages to Copenhagen. The six hostages were Hemming Gadh, Lars Siggesson (Sparre), Jöran Siggesson (Sparre), Olof Ryning, Bengt Nilsson (Färla) – and Gustav Eriksson.

==== Election as king ====
The election of Gustav Eriksson as a regent made many Swedish nobles, who had so far stayed loyal to King Christian, switch sides. Some noblemen, still loyal to the king, chose to leave Sweden, while others were killed. As a result, the Swedish Privy Council lost old members who were replaced by supporters of Gustav Eriksson. Most fortified cities and castles were conquered by Gustav&#x27;s rebels, but the strongholds with the best defenses, including Stockholm, were still under Danish control. In 1522, after negotiations between Gustav Eriksson&#x27;s faction and Lübeck, the Hanseatic city joined the war against Denmark. The winter of 1523 saw their joint forces attack the Danish and Norwegian areas of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän. During this winter, Christian II was overthrown and replaced by Frederick I. The new king openly claimed the Swedish throne and had hopes Lübeck would abandon the Swedish rebels. The German city, preferring an independent Sweden to a strong Kalmar Union dominated by Denmark, took advantage of the situation and put pressure on the rebels. The city wanted privileges on future trade as well as guarantees regarding the loans they had granted the rebels. The Privy Council and Gustav Eriksson knew the support from Lübeck was absolutely crucial. As a response, the council decided to appoint Gustav Eriksson king.

The ceremonial election of Gustav as king of Sweden took place when the leading men of Sweden met in Strängnäs in June 1523. When the councilors of Sweden had chosen Gustav as king, he met with the two visiting councilors of Lübeck. The German representatives supported the appointment without hesitation and declared it an act of God. Gustav stated he had to bow to what was described as the will of God. In a meeting with the Privy Council, Gustav Eriksson announced his decision to accept. In the following ceremony, led by the deacon of Strängnäs, Laurentius Andreae, Gustav swore the royal oath. The next day, bishops and priests joined Gustav in Roggeborgen where Andreae raised the holy sacrament above a kneeling Gustav Eriksson. Flanked by the councilors of Lübeck, Gustav Eriksson was brought to Strängnäs Cathedral where the king sat down in the choir with the Swedish privy councilors on one side, and the Lübeck representatives on the other. After the hymn &quot;Te Deum&quot;, Andreae proclaimed Gustav Eriksson king of Sweden. He was, however, still not crowned. In 1983, in remembrance of the election of Gustav as Swedish king on 6 June, that date was declared the National Day of Sweden.

=== Eric XIV of Sweden ===
Eric XIV was born at Tre Kronor on 13 December 1533. Before the age of two, he lost his mother. In 1536, his father, Gustav Vasa, married Margaret Leijonhufvud (1516–51), a Swedish noblewoman. He was crowned as Eric XIV, but was not necessarily the 14th king of Sweden named Eric. He and his brother Charles IX (1604–11) adopted regnal numbers according to Johannes Magnus&#x27;s partly fictitious history of Sweden. There had, however, been at least six earlier Swedish kings with the name of Eric, as well as pretenders about whom very little is known.

In domestic politics, Eric&#x27;s ambitions were strongly opposed by the Swedish nobility, including his half-brother, the later John III of Sweden (1537–92). John was the Duke of Finland and was married to a Polish-Lithuanian princess, which made him favourable in Poland-Lithuania. John pursued an expansionist policy in Livonia (present-day Estonia, Latvia, and the northern part of Lithuania) which led to contention between the brothers. In 1563, John was seized and tried for high treason by Eric&#x27;s order.

In the fall of 1568, the dukes and the nobles rebelled, and Eric was dethroned. He was then imprisoned by Duke John, who took power. Eric&#x27;s most trusted counsellor, Jöran Persson (1530–68), took much of the blame for the actions directed against the nobility during Eric XIV&#x27;s reign and was executed shortly after John III ascended to the throne.

=== John III of Sweden ===
John further initiated peace talks with Denmark and Lübeck to end the Scandinavian Seven Years&#x27; War, but rejected the resulting Treaties of Roskilde (1568) where his envoys had accepted far-reaching Danish demands. After two more years of fighting, this war was concluded without many Swedish concessions in the Treaty of Stettin (1570). During the following years he defeated Russia in the Livonian War, and regained Narva by the Treaty of Plussa in 1583. His foreign policy was affected by his connection to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; his son Sigismund III Vasa was made king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1587.

In January 1569, John was recognized as king by the same &quot;riksdag&quot; that forced Eric XIV off the throne. But this recognition was not without influence from John; Duke Karl received confirmation on his dukedom without the restrictions of his power that the Arboga articles imposed. The nobility&#x27;s power and rights were extended and their responsibilities lessened.

John was still concerned about his position as king as long as Eric was alive. In 1571 he ordered Erik&#x27;s guards to kill him if there was any suspicion of an escape attempt. It is possible this is how Eric died in 1577.

== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
Sigismund III Vasa was born when his parents, John III and Catherine Jagiellon, were held prisoner by John&#x27;s brother King Eric XIV, but John replaced Eric in 1568. Sweden had become Protestant, but young Sigismund was raised Catholic. His Polish-Lithuanian connection came through his mother, daughter of Sigismund I the Old, and the Jagiellonian dynasty had ruled
Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania and finally the joint Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth since 1386. Sigismund was elected King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587.

From that time his official name and title became &quot;Sigismund III, by the grace of God, king of Poland, grand duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, Livonia and also hereditary king of the Swedes, Goths and Wends&quot;; after his father died in 1592, he added &quot;hereditary king of the Swedes, Goths, and Vandals&quot;.
* Royal titles in Latin: &quot;Sigismundus Tertius Dei gratia rex Poloniæ, magnus dux Lithuaniæ, Russiæ, Prussiæ, Masoviæ, Samogitiæ, Livoniæque, necnon Suecorum, Gothorum Vandalorumque hæreditarius rex.&quot;
* English translation: &quot;Sigismund III, by the grace of God, king of Poland, grand duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Prussia, Masovia, Samogitia, Livonia, and also hereditary king of the Swedes, Goths and Vandals.&quot;

=== Opposition to Sigismund ===
However, as was often the case with the Polish-Lithuanian electoral monarchy, the outcome was strongly contested by the &quot;losers&quot; and a faction of the Commonwealth&#x27;s nobility backed Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria. Upon hearing of his election, King Sigismund slipped through the clutches of the Protestants in Sweden and landed in Poland on 7 October. He immediately agreed to give up several royal privileges to the &quot;Sejm&quot; (parliament) of the Commonwealth in the hope of winning over some of his enemies and settling the disputed election. Lesser Prussian Treasurer Jan Dulski proclaimed him king on behalf of the Crown Marshal Andrzej Opaliński. On 27 December, he was crowned in Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. It seemed that the issue of who would be King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania had been settled when Maximilian III invaded at the head of his army to claim his crown. The hostilities did not last long as Hetman Jan Zamoyski at the head of a Polish-Lithuanian army loyal to King Sigismund met and successfully defeated the Austrian troops at the Battle of Byczyna and took Maximilian III as prisoner of war. However, at the request of Pope Sixtus V, King Sigismund III released Maximilian who surrendered his claim to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1589. King Sigismund also tried to maintain peace with his powerful neighbor by marrying Archduchess Anna of Austria in 1592. It was always his intention to be allied with Catholic Austria against the Protestant forces that were tearing Christendom apart.

=== Polish–Swedish union ===
After the death of John III of Sweden, his son Sigismund succeeded to the throne of Sweden. Sigismund at that time was already the elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (since 1587). Sigismund certainly valued the Swedish throne and upon learning about the death of his father, and the pretensions to the throne of his uncle, Duke Charles of Södermanland, he asked the Sejm (Commonwealth&#x27;s parliament) for permission to leave the Commonwealth and go to Sweden, where he could secure the Swedish crown. The Sejm gave him permission, and on 3 August 1593, Sigismund, accompanied by his wife, Anna of Habsburg, and other followers, departed for Sweden.

The agreement of 19 February seemed to have calmed the situation; Sigismund was crowned in Uppsala Cathedral and became the king of Sweden. The Kingdom of Sweden was now in a personal union with Poland-Lithuania. In July, Sigismund left Sweden in the hands of the regency council and returned to the Commonwealth. Sweden was to be ruled jointly by the Privy Council of Sweden and Sigismund&#x27;s uncle Duke Charles.

Sigismund, however, reneged on his earlier promises, opening Catholic schools, and giving Catholics prominent posts. Charles in turn did not give up on acquiring the Swedish throne and pursued his own political agenda. The new Riksdag he summoned at Arboga in 1597 – again despite the King&#x27;s orders – saw few participants, and only one from the Privy Council. Even so, Duke Charles did not achieve support for his military action, but initiated it nonetheless. Parts of southern Sweden were successfully taken. Several of the Privy Council members fled to the Commonwealth to convince Sigismund to take counteractions. Sigismund sent a diplomatic mission, in an attempt to solve the conflict by negotiations. Charles at first looked ready to negotiate but in fact he was playing for time, trying to confirm his power at another Riksdag (in Arboga), recruiting peasants for his army, and isolating Sigismund&#x27;s followers.

=== War against Sigismund ===

In 1598, the Sejm gave Sigismund the go-ahead to wage a military campaign against his opponents in Sweden; however it refused to give him significant support. Sigismund&#x27;s army was composed mostly of mercenaries (Germans and Hungarians), supported by a relatively small Polish force (although with some artillery).

Sigismund&#x27;s campaign was poorly planned. He was unable to coordinate his troop movements with his supporters, particularly Fleming who was supposed to attack Charles from Finland. After initial successes (the taking of Kalmar and defeating Charles&#x27; troops at Stegeborg), Sigismund&#x27;s forces were defeated on September 25, 1598, at the Battle of Stångebro, (also known as the battle of Linköping). Sigismund was captured and forced to hand over some of his followers such as the Chancellor of Sweden, Erik Larsson Sparre, (1550–1600). In May 1599, Charles&#x27; forces captured the last fortress held by Sigismund, Kalmar. On July 24, 1599, the Riksdag in Stockholm officially dethroned Sigismund. The new King of Sweden was Charles IX of Sweden, and the Polish–Swedish union was dissolved after barely seven years of existence. In March 1600, some of Sigismund&#x27;s supporters were executed, including five senators in an event known as the Linköping Bloodbath.

== Tsardom of Russia ==
=== Polish–Russian War (1609–1618) ===
The &quot;Dimitriads&quot; and the Polish–Russian War of 1609–1618 took place in the early 17th century as a sequence of military conflicts and eastward invasions carried out by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, or the private armies and mercenaries led by the magnates (the Commonwealth aristocracy), when the Russian Tsardom was torn by a series of civil wars, the time most commonly referred to in the Russian history as the Time of Troubles, sparked by the Russian dynastic crisis and overall internal chaos. The sides and their goals changed several times during this conflict: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was not formally at war with Russia until 1609, and various Russian factions fought amongst themselves, allied with the Commonwealth and other countries or fighting against them. Sweden also participated in the conflict during the course of the Ingrian War (1610–1617), sometimes allying itself with Russia, and other times fighting against it. The aims of the various factions changed frequently as well as the scale of the parties&#x27; goals, which ranged from minor border adjustments to imposing the Polish Kings or the Polish-backed impostors&#x27; claims to the Russian throne and even the creation of a new state by forming a union between the Commonwealth and Russia.

=== Russian homage in 1611 ===
The war can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, certain Commonwealth&#x27;s &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility), encouraged by some Russian boyars (aristocracy), but without the official consent of the Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke Sigismund III Vasa, attempted to exploit Russia&#x27;s weakness and intervene in its civil war by supporting the impostors for the tsardom, False Dmitriy I and later False Dmitriy II, against the crowned tsars, Boris Godunov and Vasili Shuiski. The first wave of the Polish-Lithuanian intervention began in 1605 and ended in 1606 with the death of False Dmitri I. The second wave started in 1607 and lasted until 1609, when Tsar Vasili made a military alliance with Sweden. In response to this alliance, the Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke Sigismund III decided to intervene officially and to declare war upon Russia, aiming to weaken Sweden&#x27;s ally and to gain territorial concessions.

Hetman of the Crown Stanisław Żółkiewski held a triumphal entry by the Kraków suburb of the Royal Palace, leading with him the prisoners: the Russian tsar Wasyl IV Szujski, his brothers: Dimitri Szujski with his wife - Grand Duchess Ekaterina Grigoryevna, daughter Grigory Malyuta Skuratov and Ivan Shuysky Mikhail Shein, and Filaret, the non-canonical Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. After early Commonwealth victories (Battle of Klushino), which culminated in Polish-Lithuanian forces entering Moscow in 1610, Sigismund&#x27;s son, Prince Władysław IV Vasa, was briefly elected tsar.

=== Władysław IV Vasa as tsar ===
With the intensification of the Polish-Lithuanian intervention in Russia, in 1609, the royal family moved to their residence in Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. There he witnessed the fire of Vilnius, an event which even required the royal family to evacuate their residence in the Vilnius Castle. Later that year, Władysław, aged 15, was elected as tsar by the aristocratic council known as the Seven Boyars, who overthrew Tsar Vasili Shuisky during the Polish–Russian War and the Time of Troubles. His election was ruined by his father, Sigismund, who aimed to convert Muscovy&#x27;s population from Orthodox Chrisity to Catholicism. Sigismund refused to agree to the boyar&#x27;s request to send prince Władysław to Moscow and his conversion to Orthodoxy. Instead, Sigismund proposed that he should reign as a regent in Muscovy instead.[9] This unrealistic proposal led to a resumption of hostilities. Briefly, beginning in 1610, Władysław struck Muscovite silver and gold coins (Kopek) in the Russian mints in Moscow and Novgorod with his titulary Tsar and Grand Prince Vladislav Zigimontovych of all Russia.

Władysław tried to regain the tsar&#x27;s throne himself, organizing a campaign in 1616. Despite some military victories, he was unable to capture Moscow. The Commonwealth gained some disputed territories in the Truce of Deulino, but Władysław was never able to reign in Russia; the throne during this time was instead held by tsar Michael Romanov. He held on to the title, without any real power, until 1634. Likely, the failure of this campaign showed Władysław the limits of royal power in Poland-Lithuania, as major factors for the failure included significant autonomy of the military commanders, which did not see Władysław as their superior, and lack of funds for the army, as the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth refused to subsidize the war.

== Elective-hereditary monarchy in Poland–Lithuania ==
=== Silver Age ===
The election sejm of 1632 eventually concluded in the election of Władysław; he had no serious other contenders. The decision on who would be the Commonwealth&#x27;s next king was reached on 8 November, but as the &quot;pacta conventa&quot; were not yet ready, the official announcement was delayed until 13 November. In the &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, Władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment; to find a way to fund a naval fleet; to maintain current alliances; not to raise armies, give offices or military ranks to foreigners, negotiate peace treaties or declare war without the Sejm&#x27;s approval; not to take a wife without the Senate&#x27;s approval; to convince his brothers to take an oath to the Commonwealth; and to transfer the profits from the Royal Mint to the Royal Treasury rather than to a private treasury. When the election result had been announced by the Crown Grand Marshal, Łukasz Opaliński, the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;), who had taken part in the election, began festivities in honor of the new king, which lasted three hours. Władysław was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków on 6 February in the following year.

Władysław IV owed nominal allegiance to the Imperial Habsburgs as a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. His relationship with the Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite potential lure of territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that he likely lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult.[42] From 1636 onward, for the next few years, Władysław strengthened his ties with the Habsburgs.

In the meantime, Władysław still tried to take a leading role in European politics, and negotiate a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years&#x27; War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty&#x27;s power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm.

Władysław used the title of the King of Sweden although he had no control over Sweden and never set foot in that country.

=== John II Casimir Vasa ===
John Casimir for most of his life remained in the shadow of his older half-brother, Władysław IV Vasa. He had few friends among the Polish nobility. Unfriendly, secretive, dividing his time between lavish partying and religious contemplation, and disliking politics, he did not have a strong power base nor influence at the Polish court, instead supporting unfavorable Habsburg policies. He did, however, display talent as a military commander, showing his abilities in the Smolensk War against Muscovy (1633).

==== The Deluge ====
In 1648, John Casimir was elected by the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to succeed his half-brother on the Polish-Lithuanian throne. The reign of the last of the Vasas in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth would be dominated by the Russo-Polish War of 1654–67, followed by the war with Sweden (&quot;The Deluge&quot;), the scene for which had been set by the Commonwealth&#x27;s two previous Vasa kings. Most of Poland was invaded by the Swedish army during the Deluge without much of a fight, due to the conspiratorial complicity of Polish and Lithuanian governors and nobility. In the course of a few years, the Commonwealth rose to force the Swedes out of Poland and Lithuania, ending the short-lived intrusions and campaigns, however, at a high cost. Most of the cities and towns in the Commonwealth were sacked, plundered and some were burnt to the ground, mostly by the retreating enemy units. Although the reign of John Casimir is remembered to be one of the most disastrous and perhaps most unsuccessful in the history of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, he is often referred to as the &quot;warrior king&quot; that fought bravely to save his nation and his people.

In 1660, John II Casimir was forced to renounce his claim to the Swedish throne and acknowledge Swedish sovereignty over Livonia and the city of Riga in modern-day Latvia. John Casimir had married his brother&#x27;s widow, Marie Louise Gonzaga, who was a major support to the King. Marie Louise suddenly died in 1667 and this may have caused the monarch&#x27;s early political decline.

==== Abdication and death ====
On 16 September 1668, grief-stricken after the death of his wife in the previous year, John II Casimir abdicated the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and returned to France, where he joined the Jesuits and became abbot of Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. Following his abdication Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki (Michael I) was elected the new king and was crowned on September 29, 1669. Before his death John Casimir intended to return to Poland, however shortly before the journey in Autumn 1672 he fell dangerously ill to the news of the fall of Kamieniec Podolski, which was seized by the Ottomans. He then turned to Pope Clement X to ask for assistance for the Commonwealth in a defensive war against the Turks. The French, who were secretly in contact with him during his stay in the abbey, were astonished by such a great affection of the king to remember the loss of his kingdom, and so concerned about the loss of only one city. Nevertheless, distressed and seriously ill John II Casimir died shortly after the unexpected Turkish invasion of Commonwealth on December 16, 1672, from apoplexy and was buried inside the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. His heart was interred in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

== Continuation in Sweden ==

=== Charles IX of Sweden ===

The Riksdag at Linköping, 24 February 1604 declared that Sigismund abdicated the Swedish throne, that duke Charles was recognized as the sovereign. He was declared king as Karl IX (anglicized as Charles IX). Charles&#x27;s short reign was one of uninterrupted warfare. The hostility of the Commonwealth and the breakup of Russia involved him in overseas contests for the possession of Livonia and Ingria, the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611) and the Ingrian War, while his pretensions to claim Lappland brought upon him a war with Denmark in the last year of his reign.

In all these struggles, he was more or less unsuccessful, owing partly to the fact that he and his forces had to oppose superior generals (e.g. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Christian IV of Denmark) and partly to sheer ill-luck. Compared with his foreign policy, the domestic policy of Charles IX was comparatively unimportant. It aimed at confirming and supplementing what had already been done during his regency. He did not officially become king until 22 March 1604. The first deed in which the title appears is dated 20 March 1604; but he was not crowned until 15 March 1607.

=== Gustav II Adolf Vasa ===
Gustavus Adolphus was born in Stockholm as the oldest son of Duke Charles of the Vasa dynasty and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. At the time, the King of Sweden was Gustavus Adolphus&#x27; cousin Sigismund. The staunch Protestant Duke Charles forced the Catholic Sigismund to let go of the throne of Sweden in 1599, a part of the preliminary religious strife before the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and reigned as regent before taking the throne as Charles IX of Sweden in 1604. Crown Prince Gustav Adolph had Gagnef-Floda in Dalecarlia as a duchy from 1610. Upon his father&#x27;s death in October 1611, a sixteen-year-old Gustavus inherited the throne (declared of age and able to reign himself at seventeen as of 16 December), as well as an ongoing succession of occasionally belligerent dynastic disputes with his Polish-Lithuanian cousin. Sigismund III wanted to regain the throne of Sweden and tried to force Gustavus Adolphus to renounce the title.

In a round of this dynastic dispute, Gustavus invaded Livonia when he was 31, beginning the Polish-Swedish War (1625–1629). He intervened on behalf of the Lutherans in Germany, who opened the gates to their cities to him. His reign became famous from his actions a few years later when in June 1630 he landed in Germany, marking the Swedish Intervention in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Gustavus intervened on the anti-Imperial side, which at the time was losing to the Holy Roman Empire and its Catholic allies; the Swedish forces would quickly reverse that situation.

Gustavus was married to Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, the daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, and chose the Prussian city of Elbing as the base for his operations in Germany. He died in the Battle of Lützen in 1632. His early death was a great loss to the Lutheran side. This resulted in large parts of Germany and other countries, which had been conquered for Lutheranism, to be reconquered for Catholicism (via the Counter-Reformation). His involvement in the Thirty Years&#x27; War gave rise to the saying that he was the incarnation of &quot;the Lion of the North&quot;, or as it is put in German &quot;der Löwe von Mitternacht&quot;.

==== Thirty Years&#x27; War ====
Gustav II Adolf&#x27;s success in making Sweden one of the great powers of Europe, and perhaps the most important power in the Thirty Years&#x27; War after France and Spain, was due not only to his military brilliance, but also to important institutional reforms in Sweden&#x27;s government. The chief among these reforms was the institution of the first Parish registrations, so that the central government could more efficiently tax and conscript its populace.

Gustavus Adolphus was an extremely able military commander. His innovative tactical integration of infantry, cavalry, logistics and particularly his use of artillery, earned him the title of the &quot;Father of Modern Warfare&quot;. Future commanders who studied and admired Gustav II Adolf include Napoleon I of France and Carl von Clausewitz. His advancements in military science made Sweden the dominant Baltic power for the next one hundred years (&quot;see Swedish Empire&quot;). He is also the only Swedish monarch to be styled &quot;the Great&quot;. This decision was made by the Swedish Estates of the Realm, when they convened in 1633. Thus, by their decision he is officially, to this day, to be called Gustaf Adolf the Great (&quot;Gustavus Adolphus Magnus&quot;).

Gustavus Adolphus was the main figure responsible for the success of Swedish arms during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and led his nation to great prestige. As a general, Gustavus Adolphus is famous for employing mobile artillery on the battlefield, as well as very aggressive tactics, where attack was stressed over defense, and mobility and cavalry initiative were emphasized.

=== Christina, Queen of Sweden ===
Christina was the only surviving legitimate child of King Gustav II Adolph and his wife Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. At the age of six she succeeded her father on the throne upon his death at the Battle of Lützen, and began ruling when she reached the age of 18.

Christina is remembered as one of the most educated women of the 1600s. She was fond of paintings, books, manuscripts, and sculptures. With her interest in religion, philosophy, mathematics and alchemy, she attracted many scientists to Stockholm, wanting the city to become the &quot;Athens of the North&quot;. She was intelligent, fickle and moody; she rejected the sexual role of a woman. She caused a scandal when she decided not to marry and in 1654 when she abdicated her throne. She changed her name to Kristina Augusta Wasa and converted to Catholicism, adopting the name Christina Alexandra.

At the age of 28 the &quot;Minerva of the North&quot; moved to Rome. The Pope described Christina as &quot;a queen without a realm, a Christian without faith, and a woman without shame&quot;. Notwithstanding all that, she became a leader of the theatrical and musical life and protected many Baroque artists, composers, and musicians.

== Swedish noblemen ==
*Johan Kristiernsson Vasa of Örby in the province of Uppland
*Erik Johansson Vasa (1470–1520), Privy Councillor, lord of Rydboholm Castle in the Roslagen

== Regents of Sweden ==
* Kettil Karlsson (c. 1433–1465), Bishop of Linköping, reigned as Lord Protector and Regent of Sweden 1464–1465

== Monarchs of Sweden ==
*Gustav I (born 1496, reigned 1523–1560)
*Eric XIV (reigned 1560–1568)
*John III (reigned 1568–1592)
*Sigismund (reigned 1592–1599)
*Charles IX (reigned 1599–1611; officially became king in March 1604)
*Gustavus Adolphus (Gustav Adolf the Great) (reigned 1611–1632)
*Christina (reigned 1632–1654)

In 1654 Christina, the daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, the Protestant Champion of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, abdicated, converted to Catholicism and left the country. The throne passed to her half-cousin Charles X of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, a cadet branch of the Wittelsbachs.

The kings of the house of Holstein-Gottorp, which produced the kings of Sweden from 1751 to 1818, emphasized their Vasa descent through a female line. The current ruling house of Bernadotte similarly claims a Vasa mantle: Charles XIV was an adopted son of Charles XIII; his son Oscar I married a Vasa descendant Josephine of Leuchtenberg; their grandson Gustav V married Victoria of Baden who was a great-grandchild of Gustav IV Adolf of the house Holstein-Gottorp.

== Monarchs of Poland and Lithuania ==
*Sigismund III Vasa (1587–1632)
*Władysław IV (1632–1648)
*John II Casimir (1648–1668)

John III of Sweden married Catherine Jagiellon, the sister of Sigismund II Augustus. When Sigismund II died without issue, the son of John III of Sweden and Catherine Jagiellon was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania as Sigismund III in 1587. On John&#x27;s death, Sigismund also gained the Swedish throne.

However, Sigismund was Catholic, which ultimately led to his losing the throne in Sweden. His Lutheran uncle Charles IX succeeded him. We thus have two Houses of Vasa from this point onwards: the senior, Catholic branch ruling in Poland and Lithuania, and the cadet, Protestant branch ruling in Sweden. This arrangement led to numerous wars between the two states. After John, the Polish-Lithuanian Vasas died out. See also Rulers of Poland and Rulers of Lithuania.

==Development of the Vasa Arms==
See: Category:Coats of arms of the House of Vasa 

The document shown on the external link from the Swedish National Archives was signed and sealed by Kristiern Nilsson (Vasa) from Öland and his son Kristiern and provides the oldest known version from Sweden of what would become the coat of arms of the Vasa family. The gallery below shows the seal(s) in more detail and later seals.

The coat of arms carried by the family during the Middle Ages have been interpreted in many different ways; they have, among other things, been suggested to represent helmet tilts, building iron, spears with a lily hilt, a fleur-de-lis tipped stave, chess rooks or the tip of a halberd.

Drots (a medieval Swedish type of justice minister) Kristiern Nilsson moved the medieval coat of arms to the right (heraldic left), while the Swedish Chief Minister Kettil Karlsson (Vasa) moved the coat of arms straight vertically.

After Gustav Eriksson had become king, the coat of arms was changed in the 1540s to a black vase on a golden shield, which in the 16th century was understood as a sheaf of grain or a fascine. The king later merged his paternal coat of arms with his mother&#x27;s coat of arms (for the Ekaätten) through the vase received golden tincture, and on a twice-cut shield in blue, silver and red (the place of the colors alternating at the beginning). Why the king created this coat of arms is unknown, but it has been suggested that the ancient noble house of Eka, which was very prominent in the last two centuries of the Middle Ages, gave the king more glory than the rather anonymous origins and arms of his paternal lowly ancestors. The last time something similar happened was when Valdemar, Jarl Birger&#x27;s son, chose to bear his mother&#x27;s coat of arms, the royal Danish leopards instead of his father&#x27;s lion, and it has been speculated in retrospect whether Valdemar considered the coat of arms of the royal Valdemarans to have higher status and prestige than his father&#x27;s lion.

Gustav Vasa&#x27;s son Erik XIV used for a time a so-called coat of arms: a four-part shield with the coat of arms of the Vasa family as a heart shield, field 1 three crowns, field 2 the coat of arms of Bjälboätten, field 3 the coat of arms of Norway and field 4 the coat of arms of Denmark. This was introduced after Denmark adopted the shield with three crowns in the national shield, to show that after Sweden&#x27;s liberation from the Kalmar Union, they still claimed that Sweden would obey Denmark.

The Vasa coat of arms was set as an inescutcheon into the Swedish National Coat of arms (see below) when the Vasa&#x27;s reigned both in Sweden. Since 1810 it has been impaled on the left with the Bernadotte arms on the right as part of the inescutcheon in the Swedish national coat of arms, after the Bernadotte family&#x27;s first king in Sweden, Karl XIV Johan, was adopted by Karl XIII to show their descent from the Vasa. During the Swedish-Norwegian Union between 1818 and 1905, the coat of arms was also included in Norway&#x27;s coat of arms as an inescutcheon shield. When the Vasa reigned in Poland-Lithuania, the Vasa arms were used in the inescutcheon of the Polish national coat of arms by the three kings who belonged to the Vasa dynasty, Johan III&#x27;s son Sigismund, and Sigismund&#x27;s two sons Władysław IV Vasa and Johan II Casimir.

<text>The Final Countdown is a 1980 American science fiction war film about a modern nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that travels through time to the day before the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Produced by Peter Douglas and Lloyd Kaufman (founder of Troma Entertainment) and directed by Don Taylor (his final directing role), while Kaufman also served as an associate producer and had a minor acting role. The film contains an ensemble cast starring Kirk Douglas, Martin Sheen, James Farentino, Katharine Ross, Ron O&#x27;Neal and Charles Durning.

The film was produced with the cooperation of the United States Navy&#x27;s naval aviation branch and the United States Department of Defense. It was set and filmed on board (CVN-68), filming operations of the modern nuclear warship, which had been launched in the early 1970s. &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was a moderate success at the box office. The film has later developed a cult following over the years.

==Plot==
In 1980, the aircraft carrier departs Naval Station Pearl Harbor for naval exercises in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The ship takes on a civilian observer, Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) — a systems analyst for Tideman Industries working as an efficiency expert for the U.S. Department of Defense — on the orders of his reclusive employer, Mr. Tideman, whose secretive major defense contractor company designed and built the nuclear-powered warship.

Once at sea, the &quot;Nimitz&quot; encounters a mysterious electrically-charged storm-like vortex. While the ship passes through it, radar and other equipment become unresponsive, and everyone aboard falls into agony. Initially unsure of what has happened to them and having lost radio contact with U.S. Pacific Fleet Command at Pearl Harbor, Captain Yelland (Kirk Douglas), commander of the aircraft carrier, fears that there may have been a nuclear strike on Hawaii or the continental United States. He orders general quarters and launches a RF-8 Crusader reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft returns after photographing Pearl Harbor, but the images show an intact row of U.S. Pacific fleet battleships, of which several were destroyed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

When a surface contact is spotted on radar, Yelland launches two ready alert Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighter jets from VF-84 to intercept. The patrol witnesses a civilian wooden yacht being strafed and destroyed by two Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot; fighters, killing three of the five crew members. The F-14s are ordered to drive off the Zeros without firing, but when the Zeros inadvertently head towards the &quot;Nimitz&quot;, Yelland gives clearance to shoot them down. The &quot;Nimitz&quot; rescues survivors from the yacht: prominent U.S. Senator Samuel Chapman (Charles Durning), his aide Laurel Scott (Katharine Ross), her dog Charlie, and one of the two downed Zero pilots (Soon-tek Oh). Commander Owens (James Farentino), an amateur historian, recognizes Chapman as a politician who could have been Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate (and his potential successor) during his final re-election bid, had Chapman not disappeared shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack.

When a Grumman E-2 Hawkeye scouting aircraft discovers the Japanese fleet task force further north in unpatrolled waters, poised to launch its attack on Pearl Harbor, the &quot;Nimitz&quot; crew realizes that they have been transported back in time to the day before the attack. Yelland has to decide whether to destroy the Japanese fleet and alter the course of history or to stand by and allow history to proceed as they know it. The American civilians and the Zero pilot are kept isolated. Still, while being questioned, the Japanese pilot forcibly obtains an M-16 rifle from one of the guards, kills two of the other U.S. Marine guards, and takes Scott, Owens, and Lasky hostage. He threatens to kill them unless he is given access to a radio to warn the Japanese fleet about the &quot;Nimitz&quot;. Lasky tells Commander Owens to recite and describe the secret plans for the Japanese attack; the dumbfounded Japanese pilot is overcome and shot and killed by the other U.S. Marines of the on-board detachment on &quot;Nimitz&quot;. In the aftermath, Scott and Owens develop an attraction for each other.

Chapman is outraged that Yelland knows of the impending Japanese attack but has not told anyone else, and rebuffs Yelland&#x27;s claim that the &quot;Nimitz&quot; is capable of handling any attack. An attempt to warn Pearl Harbor by radio fails as the Navy has no carrier &quot;Nimitz&quot; and considers it a prank call. Chapman then demands to be taken to Pearl Harbor to warn the naval authorities in person. Yelland agrees in front of Chapman, but instead then orders Owens to fly the civilians and sufficient supplies via helicopter to an isolated Hawaiian island (Puʻuwai, Hawaii), assuming they will eventually be rescued. When they arrive, Chapman realizes he has been tricked and uses a flare gun to force the pilot to fly to Pearl Harbor. During a struggle with another crew member, the flare gun discharges, destroying the craft and stranding Scott and Owens on the island. The &quot;Nimitz&quot; launches a massive strike force against the incoming Japanese fleet, but right after that, the time vortex storm returns. After a futile attempt to outrun the storm, Yelland recalls the strike force, and the ship and its aircraft safely return to 1980, leaving the past relatively unchanged. Upon the return of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; to Pearl Harbor, Pacific Fleet admirals board the ship to investigate the &quot;Nimitz&quot;″s unexplained disappearance. Lasky leaves the ship with Scott&#x27;s dog, Charlie, and encounters the mysterious Mr. Tideman face-to-face. Tideman is revealed to be a much older Owens. He and his wife, Laurel Scott, invite Lasky to join them as they have &quot;a lot to talk about&quot;.

==Production==

Peter Douglas was the driving force behind &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. With a limited budget and a promising script, he was able to attract interest from the U.S. Navy. Officials from the Department of Defense offered full cooperation after seeing a script, but insisted that for safety and operational readiness, the film schedule would be dependent on the &quot;on location&quot; naval consultant, William Micklos. Principal photography took place at Naval Air Station Key West, Naval Station Norfolk, and off the Florida Keys, over two five-week periods in 1979. Scenes at Pearl Harbor consisted of mainly stock footage with most of &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; exteriors shot on the &quot;Nimitz&quot; while at sea, and at drydock for interiors. During operations, an emergency landing took place with the production crew allowed to film the recovery of the aircraft on the &quot;Nimitz&quot;; the sequence appeared in the final film.

Crew members of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; were used as extras, a few with speaking parts; a total of 48 of the crew appear as &quot;actors&quot; in the final credits. The difficulties in filming a modern jet fighter were soon apparent when the first setup to record an F-14 takeoff at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, resulted in both camera and operator being pitched down a runway.

Dissension in the production crew led to major changes during location shooting, with a number of the crew being fired and replaced. Taylor&#x27;s direction was considered workmanlike, as he had a reputation for bringing projects in on time and on budget, but suggestions from U.S. naval aviators were ultimately incorporated into the shooting schedules with the &quot;B&quot; crew placed in charge of all the aerial sequences that became the primary focus of the film.

In order to film the aerial sequences, Panavision cameras were mounted on naval aircraft while camera-equipped aircraft and helicopters were leased from Tallmantz Aviation, including a Bell 206 Jet Ranger helicopter, a Learjet 35, and a B-25 bomber converted into a camera platform. Three Mitsubishi A6M Zero replicas, originally built for the film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), were flown by pilots from the Confederate Air Force, now called the Commemorative Air Force. Two of the replicas were featured in a dogfight with F-14 Tomcats; it was the first time such a dissimilar engagement had appeared in film, with the &quot;totally different speeds...environments and weaponry&quot; of the aircraft causing extreme challenges for the jet pilots.

In one scene where an F-14 &quot;thumps&quot; a Zero by flying under and streaking upward in front of the slower aircraft, the resultant &quot;jet blast&quot; of turbulent air was so intense that the yokes of both of the Zeros in the scene were violently wrenched out of the pilots&#x27; hands and caused both aircraft to momentarily tumble out of control. The lead pilot&#x27;s headset, along with his watch, were ripped off and out of the open canopy of his Zero, resulting in a few anxious moments as the F-14 pilots were unable to establish contact. During a scene when a Zero fires on an F-14, in order to get on the &quot;six&quot; of the low and slow Zero—that is, to bring one&#x27;s aircraft directly behind the target aircraft in a position corresponding to six o&#x27;clock on an analog clock face—the jet fighter did a low pull up that ended just above the ocean in a screaming recovery. At one point during filming, one of the Tomcat aircrews held up a profane sign addressed at Katharine Ross in retaliation for the actress denying a request from the VF-84 pilots to meet her in a hotel the previous day. The shot made it into the dailies and reportedly infuriated Ross.

During the climactic attack on Pearl Harbor, scenes reproduced in monochrome from &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; featured Aichi D3A Val dive bombers, Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bombers.

==Release==
&quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was released to theaters in the United States on August 1, 1980. A novelization by Martin Caidin, based on the screenplay, was released in the same month and largely dovetailed with the film presented on screen (the novelization ending with Lasky accompanying Tideman/CDR Owens and Laurel to their home, where it is revealed that the time travel phenomenon explored in the film had an extraterrestrial origin that is not further expanded upon).

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on March 30, 2004. It was later released by Blue Underground on a two-DVD set (with both full-screen and widescreen formats) and a special two-disc limited edition set with a hologram cover. Each DVD edition was accompanied by special featurettes, including a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary and a commentary track by the producer and other studio principals. These THX certified releases also feature a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX audio track, as well as a DTS 6.1 ES audio track. On November 4, 2008, a high-definition two-disc Blu-ray set was released, but lacked some of the earlier background materials. A 4K Ultra High-Definition disc set was released in May 2021 as a limited edition with some additional special features, a copy of the film on Blu-ray disc and a copy of John Scott&#x27;s original motion picture score on CD.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;The Final Countdown&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 52% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered it more of an interesting, behind-the-scenes tour of &quot;Nimitz&quot;: &quot;We see planes landing and taking off with beautiful precision and, just to let us know that things don&#x27;t always run smoothly on &quot;Nimitz&quot;, we also see one plane, which has lost its landing hook, landing safely anyway because of the ship&#x27;s emergency gear&quot;. Roger Ebert commented that &quot;logic doesn&#x27;t matter in a &quot;Star Wars&quot;(-like) movie&quot;. He went on to clarify: &quot;Unfortunately, the movie makes such a mess of it that the biggest element of interest is the aircraft carrier itself&quot;. Later reviews concentrated on the intriguing aspect of the time travel story, again stressing that the military hardware was the real star. The U.S. Navy sponsored the film premiere and exploited the film as a recruiting tool to the extent that the theatrical poster appeared in U.S. Navy recruiting offices shortly after the film&#x27;s release. Ebert and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their &quot;dogs of the year&quot; in a 1980 episode of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, which surprised some readers of Ebert&#x27;s column because he gave the film an unimpressed but hardly rancorous 2 stars out of 4 and praised some elements of the production (particularly the details about life on board the aircraft carrier).

Christopher John reviewed &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #5 and commented that &quot;there is nothing wrong with what is on the screen in &quot;Final Countdown&quot;; what is on the screen, however, is only half of the film. Maybe someday, like &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, someone will go back and put in the missing half-hour of this movie&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed $3.25 million in its opening weekend from 681 screens and earned a total of $16.6 million in the United States and Canada.

The film made $3 million in Germany.

==Awards==
* Nominee, Best Science Fiction Film of Year—Saturn Award (Peter Vincent Douglas)
* Nominee, Best Actor—Saturn Award (Kirk Douglas)
* Winner, Golden Screen Award (German box office award)

<doc id="187622" wikidata="Q214866" url="?curid=187622" title="Great Hanshin earthquake">
<text>The Great Hanshin Earthquake occurred on January 17, 1995, at 05:46:53 JST in the southern part of Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, including the region known as Hanshin. It measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum intensity of 7 on the JMA Seismic Intensity Scale (XI–XII on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale). The tremors lasted for approximately 20 seconds. The focus of the earthquake was located 17 km beneath its epicenter, on the northern end of Awaji Island, 20 km away from the center of the city of Kobe.

At least 5,000 people died as a result of this earthquake; about 4,600 of them were from Kobe. Among major cities, Kobe, with its population of 1.5 million, was the closest to the epicenter and hit by the strongest tremors. This was Japan&#x27;s second deadliest earthquake in the 20th century after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which claimed more than 105,000 lives.

==Earthquake==
Most of the largest earthquakes in Japan are caused by subduction of the Philippine Sea plate or Pacific plate, with mechanisms that involve either energy released within the subducting plate or the accumulation and sudden release of stress in the overlying plate. Earthquakes of these types are especially frequent in the coastal regions of northeastern Japan.

The Great Hanshin earthquake belonged to a third type, called an &quot;inland shallow earthquake&quot;. Earthquakes of this type occur along active faults. Even at lower magnitudes, they can be very destructive because they often occur near populated areas and because their hypocenters are located less than 20 km below the surface. The Great Hanshin earthquake began north of the island of Awaji, which lies just south of Kobe. It spread toward the southwest along the Nojima Fault on Awaji and toward the northeast along the Suma and Suwayama faults, which run through the center of Kobe. Observations of deformations in these faults suggest that the area was subjected to east–west compression, which is consistent with previously known crustal movements. Like other earthquakes recorded in western Japan between 1891 and 1948, the 1995 earthquake had a strike-slip mechanism that accommodated east–west shortening of the Eurasian plate due to its collision with the Philippine Sea plate in central Honshu.

The Mj 7.3 earthquake struck at 05:46:53 JST on the morning of January 17, 1995. It lasted for 20 seconds. During this time the south side of the Nojima Fault moved 1.5 meters to the right and 1.2 meters downwards. There were four foreshocks, beginning with the largest (Mj 3.7) at 18:28 on the previous day.

===Intensity===
It was the first time that an earthquake in Japan was officially measured at a seismic intensity (&quot;shindo&quot; in Japanese) of the highest Level 7 on the scale of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). After the earthquake, seismic intensity observation in Japan was fully mechanized (from April 1996) and JMA seismic intensity Levels 5 and 6 were each divided into 2 levels (from October 1996).

An on-the spot investigation by JMA concluded that tremors by this earthquake were at seismic intensity of Level 7 in particular areas in northern Awaji Island (now Awaji City) and in the cities of Kobe, Ashiya, Nishinomiya and Takarazuka.

Tremors were valued at seismic intensity of Levels 4 to 6 at observation points in Kansai, Chūgoku, Shikoku and Chūbu regions:

===Damage===
Damage was widespread and severe. Structures irreparably damaged by the earthquake included nearly 400,000 buildings, numerous elevated road and rail bridges, and 120 of the 150 quays in the port of Kobe. The quake triggered approximately 300 fires, which raged over large portions of the city. Disruptions of water, electricity and gas supplies were common. Residents feared returning home because of aftershocks that lasted several days (74 of which were strong enough to be felt).

The majority of deaths (over 4,000) occurred in cities and suburbs in Hyōgo Prefecture. A total of 68 children under the age of 18 were orphaned, while 332 children lost one parent.
One in five of the buildings in the worst-hit areas were completely destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. About 22% of the offices in Kobe&#x27;s central business district were rendered unusable, and over half of the houses in that area were deemed unfit for occupancy. Although some were destroyed and others suffered severe damage, high-rise buildings that were built in compliance with the 1981 building code suffered to a lesser extent. Those that were not constructed to these standards suffered serious structural damage, such as traditional houses which had heavy tiled roofs that could weigh as much as two tons, intended to resist the frequent typhoons plaguing Kobe, but were only supported by a light wooden frame. When these wood supports gave way, the roof would crush the unreinforced walls and floors in a pancake collapse. Newer homes have reinforced walls and lighter roofs to avoid this, but are thusly more susceptible to typhoons.

The damage to highways and subways was the most graphic image of the earthquake, and images of the collapsed elevated Kobe Route of the Hanshin Expressway appeared on front pages of newspapers worldwide. Most people in Japan believed those structures to be relatively safe from earthquake damage because of the steel-reinforced concrete design. Although the initial belief was that construction had been negligent, it was later shown that most of the collapsed structures were constructed properly according to the building codes in force in the 1960s. The steel-reinforcement specifications in the 1960s regulations had already been discovered to be inadequate and revised several times, the latest revision being in 1981, which proved effective but only applied to new structures.

Ten spans of the Kobe Route elevated expressway were knocked over in three locations across Kobe and Nishinomiya, blocking a link that carried 40% of Osaka-Kobe road traffic. Half of the elevated expressway&#x27;s piers sustained some damage. The entire route was not reopened until September 30, 1996. Three bridges on the less heavily used Route 2 were damaged, but the highway was reopened well ahead of Route 3 and served as one of the main intercity road links for a time. The Meishin Expressway was only lightly damaged, but was closed during the day until February 17, 1995, so that emergency vehicles could easily access the hardest-hit areas to the west. It was not until July 29 that all four lanes were opened to traffic along one section. Many surface highways were clogged for some time due to the collapse of higher-capacity elevated highways.

Most railways in the region were damaged. In the aftermath of the earthquake, only 30% of the Osaka-Kobe railway tracks were operational. Daikai Station on the Kobe Rapid Railway line collapsed, bringing down part of National Route 28 above it. Wooden supports collapsed inside supposedly solid concrete pilings under the tracks of the Sanyo Shinkansen high-speed rail line, causing the entire line to shut down. 58 train cars were at Ishiyagawa Depot of the Hanshin Electric Railway when it collapsed, which rendered 24 of them damaged beyond repair. The railways rebounded quickly after the quake, reaching 80% operability in one month. The Kobe Municipal Subway resumed operation the day after the earthquake with limited service between and stations (along with the Hokushin Kyuko Electric Railway between and ). Service resumed across the entire line on February 16, 1995, with full service resuming a month later after repairs were completed. Trains continued to operate with speed restrictions until July 21, 1995.

Artificial islands, such as the modern Rokkō Island and especially Port Island in Kobe, suffered severe subsidence due to liquefaction. Water breaking through the surface and flooding those islands was initially believed to have seeped in from the sea, but in fact had been forced out of the soil used to build the islands. The newly completed artificial island supporting Kansai International Airport was not significantly affected, due it being further from the epicenter, and because it was built to the latest standards. The Akashi Kaikyō Bridge, under construction near the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter, was undamaged but was reportedly lengthened by a full meter due to horizontal displacement along the activated tectonic fault.

===Nomenclature===
Outside Japan the earthquake and disaster are commonly referred to as the Kobe earthquake; in Japan, the earthquake and the disaster caused by it is called , often shortened to ( &quot;Hanshin&quot; refers to the area encompassing Osaka and Kobe). In the scientific literature the earthquake itself is called the , the name given to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency the week after the main shock.

==Other aspects==
The quake ravaged many of the facilities of what was then the world&#x27;s sixth-largest container port and the source of nearly 40% of Kobe&#x27;s industrial output.

The sheer size of the earthquake caused a major decline in Japanese stock markets, with the Nikkei 225 index plunging by 1,025 points on the day following the quake. This financial damage was the immediate cause for the collapse of Barings Bank due to the actions of Nick Leeson, who had speculated vast amounts of money on Japanese and Singaporean derivatives. Discussions of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Lost Decade&quot; tend towards purely economic analysis, and neglect the impact of the earthquake on the Japanese economy which at the time was already suffering from recession.

Despite this devastation in a big production center, the local economy recovered very quickly. Even though less than half the port facilities had been rebuilt by that stage, within a year import volumes through the port had recovered fully and export volumes were nearly back to where they would have been without the disaster. Less than 15 months after the earthquake, in March 1996, manufacturing activity in greater Kobe was at 98% of its projected pre-quake level.

===Volunteerism===

The fact that volunteers from all over Japan converged on Kobe to help victims of the quake was an important event in the history of volunteerism in Japan. The year 1995 is often regarded as a turning point in the emergence of volunteerism as a major form of civic engagement.

In December 1995, the government declared January 17 a national &quot;Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Day&quot;, and the week from January 15 to 21 a national &quot;Disaster Prevention and Volunteerism Week&quot;, to be commemorated with lectures, seminars, and other events designed to encourage voluntary disaster preparedness and relief efforts.

===Disaster planning===
The earthquake proved to be a major wake-up call for Japanese disaster prevention authorities. Japan installed rubber blocks under bridges to absorb the shock and rebuilt buildings further apart to prevent collateral damage. The national government changed its disaster response policies in the wake of the earthquake, and its response to the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake was significantly faster and more effective. The Ground Self-Defense Forces were given automatic authority to respond to earthquakes over a certain magnitude, which allowed them to deploy to the Niigata region within minutes. Control over fire response was likewise handed over from local fire departments to a central command base in Tokyo and Kyoto.

In response to the widespread damage to transportation infrastructure, and the resulting effect on emergency response times in the disaster area, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport began designating special disaster prevention routes and reinforcing the roads and surrounding buildings so as to keep them as intact as possible in the event of another earthquake. Hyōgo&#x27;s prefectural government invested millions of yen in the following years to build earthquake-proof shelters and supplies in public parks.

===Memorials===

The Kobe Luminarie is an event held for approximately two weeks every December. A street leading from the Daimaru store in Motomachi to Higashi Yuenchi Park (next to Kobe city hall) is decorated with arches of multicoloured lights that were donated by the Italian government. Amongst the commemorative events held on the anniversary of the earthquake, large &quot;1.17&quot; digits are illuminated in Higashi Yuenchi Park in the early hours of January 17 each year.

==Response==
Approximately 1.2 million volunteers, including foreigners, were involved in relief efforts during the first three months following the earthquake. Retailers such as Daiei and 7-Eleven used their existing supply networks to provide necessities in affected areas, while NTT and Motorola provided free telephone service for victims. 
The organized crime Yamaguchi-gumi &quot;yakuza&quot; syndicate was actively involved in the relief effort from the beginning, distributing substantial amounts of food and supplies to needy victims. Aid provided by the Yamaguchi-gumi was particularly crucial in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, due to the failure of the Japanese government to organize effective relief to the area initially.

Local hospitals struggled to keep up with demand for medical treatment, largely due to collapsed or obstructed &quot;lifelines&quot; (roads) that kept supplies and personnel from reaching the affected areas. People were forced to wait in corridors due to the overcrowding and lack of space. Some people had to be operated on in waiting rooms and corridors.

To help speed the recovery effort, the government closed most of the Hanshin Expressway network to private vehicles from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm daily and limited traffic to buses, taxis and other designated vehicles. To keep the light rail system running even though it had quite severely damaged sections, shuttle buses were commissioned to transfer patrons to stations around damaged sections.

<text>Great White is an American hard rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1977. The band peaked with several albums during the mid-to-late 1980s, including the platinum-selling records &quot;Once Bitten&quot; (1987) and &quot;...Twice Shy&quot; (1989), and those albums&#x27; singles &quot;Rock Me&quot; and &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot; received considerable airplay through radio and MTV. They charted two Top 40 hit singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot; and &quot;The Angel Song.&quot; They continued to release new material into the 1990s. The band is named after both the shark with the same name, and guitarist Mark Kendall&#x27;s former stage nickname.

Great White disbanded in 2001, with several members releasing solo material. By the following year, however, Mark Kendall had joined up with lead singer Jack Russell&#x27;s solo touring band, and the group began performing as Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White, which also made headlines when, in 2003, their show pyrotechnics set a Rhode Island nightclub on fire, leading to the deaths of 100 people, including band member Ty Longley. In 2006, following a brief hiatus, the official Great White reformed with other members of the classic lineup joining Russell and Kendall. After more than three decades as their singer, Russell left the band in 2011 and again began touring with a backing band under the name Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White, until Russell&#x27;s retirement and death in 2024. Great White has since continued on without Russell, who was first replaced by XYZ vocalist Terry Ilous, who stayed in the band until 2018 when Mitch Malloy replaced him. Malloy left in 2022 and was replaced by Andrew Freeman, later followed by Brett Carlisle the same year.

== History ==

=== Early career and first two albums (1977–1986) ===
Vocalist Jack Russell met guitarist Mark Kendall in 1977, and Kendall asked Russell to join his band. They decided to form a band together and they called it Highway later changing it to Livewire and then played one final show as Wires. Then in 1979, Russell was arrested for shooting a live-in maid in a botched robbery attempt, and sentenced to eight years in prison. The band went its separate ways and Kendall was left to start over. He recruited bassist Don Costa (later a one-time member of Ozzy Osbourne and also briefly in W.A.S.P.) and drummer Tony Richards (later a member of W.A.S.P.). They auditioned several singers including John Bush from Armored Saint. They then got a singer named Butch Say whose style was similar to that of Rob Halford, but finally settled on a female singer Lisa Baker. The name they decided to go with was Dante Fox. They played their first gig in 1979 with singer Lisa Baker and played around Orange County and the Los Angeles area for six months with Lisa, until she joined George Lynch&#x27;s band Xciter and Butch rejoined briefly. Later they found out that Russell was released from prison after serving only 18 months of his sentence and Russell talked Kendall into an audition and he got in the band by a two to one band vote. They played their first gig with Russell at The Troubadour in Hollywood, California.

After recording several demos, the band chose as manager Alan Niven, who had worked for the independent distributor Greenworld in Torrance, California, and had dealt with Mötley Crüe&#x27;s debut self-release. Niven suggested the name change from Dante Fox after seeing Kendall stick his head out of a car window while driving by the Troubador and some kid in the crowd said &quot;there goes Great White&quot;. Kendall got the nickname due to his naturally white-blonde hair, white Fender Telecaster guitar, white jumpsuit, and white Capezio shoes. In 1982, the members by this time (as Costa and Richards had left) were Mark Kendall, Jack Russell, drummer Gary Holland, and bassist Lorne Black. They were soon in the studio and they recorded and released a 5-song EP, &quot;Out of the Night&quot;, on the independent label Aegean formed by Niven. Niven then convinced the Los Angeles radio station KMET to begin adding songs from the EP to its playlist in heavy rotation. KLOS-FM soon did the same. The band suddenly went from drawing 100 people to a local club to drawing thousands in L.A. concert halls such as Perkins Palace in Pasadena, The Palace in Hollywood and the Country Club in Reseda. As an unsigned act, Great White headlined at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia playing to 6,250 people. Near the end of 1983, EMI America signed the band and subsequently released Great White&#x27;s eponymous debut album in early 1984. The band immediately toured the UK supporting Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Slide It In&quot; tour and the entire US and Canada opening for Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; tour. They also supported Kiss on their &quot;Lick It Up&quot; tour. &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;, their follow-up independent release, marked the arrival of drummer Audie Desbrow after the firing of Holland on December 27, 1984. By the time Capitol Records signed the band and reissued &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;, keyboardist-guitarist Michael Lardie, who had played on that album as a session musician, had come aboard as a full member. After the release of &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;, Great White hit the road with Dokken for 5 shows and was on the verge of even bigger success.

=== Mainstream success (1987–1992) ===
The band hit the mainstream in 1987 when they released their third album &quot;Once Bitten&quot;, accompanied by the hits &quot;Rock Me&quot;, &quot;Save Your Love&quot; and &quot;Lady Red Light&quot;, all of which received significant airplay on mainstream rock radio stations such as KNAC and Z Rock. The model Tracy Martinson appeared on the cover of the album and also appeared in the video for &quot;Save Your Love&quot;. In late 1987, Great White parted ways with bassist Lorne Black and replaced him with Tony Montana (Tony Cardenas). &quot;Once Bitten...&quot; was certified platinum in April 1988, and a year-long tour in support of the album cemented Great White&#x27;s popularity worldwide, performing with Guns N&#x27; Roses, Twisted Sister, Whitesnake, David Lee Roth and TNT, and appearing on several dates as part the European Monsters of Rock tour in the summer of 1988 with several acts such as Kiss, Iron Maiden, Guns N&#x27; Roses, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Helloween, Anthrax and Testament.

The band followed up with &quot;...Twice Shy&quot; in 1989. The album included their biggest hit, &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot;, a cover of a UK hit single by Ian Hunter; this is Great White&#x27;s only single to date that has achieved gold certification. The model Bobbie Brown (also known for being in Warrant&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; video) appeared in the video for &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot;. Other songs from the album, including &quot;The Angel Song&quot;, &quot;House of Broken Love&quot;, &quot;Mista Bone&quot; and &quot;Move It&quot;, received significant attention as well, through radio airplay or otherwise. &quot;...Twice Shy&quot; was certified platinum in July 1989, then double platinum in September two months later, and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album was supported by a successful world tour that saw Great White performing at arenas and stadiums, including sharing the stage with Bon Jovi, Ratt, Tesla, Kix, Warrant, Badlands and Britny Fox, and supporting Alice Cooper on his &quot;Trash&quot; tour.

In 1990, the band featured in the heavy metal video series &quot;Hard &#x27;N&#x27; Heavy&quot; containing music, concert footage and interviews. The video included Slash and Duff McKagan from Guns N&#x27; Roses appearing with the band at a Children of the Night Benefit concert in L.A., the performance helping to raise money for housing abused homeless children. Both bands shared the same manager, Alan Niven, at the time.

The band continued into the next decade performing the song &quot;House of Broken Love&quot; at the American Music Awards in January 1990. In March, Great White embarked on their first tour of Japan. They returned to the United States for the Memorial Day weekend festival dubbed The World Series of Rock, which featured Whitesnake, Skid Row, Bad English, and Hericane Alice. Great White recorded two more albums for Capitol Records, &quot;Hooked&quot;, which was certified gold, and &quot;Psycho City&quot;. In support of &quot;Hooked&quot;, Great White did a tour as opener for the German metal band Scorpions and traveled to Europe and Japan. During this tour Mark Kendall was hospitalized for a hiatal hernia for 3 weeks and then returned. Guitarist Al Pitrelli was asked to fill in for Mark during his absence. &quot;Psycho City&quot; was followed by a US tour with Kiss.

=== Years of commercial decline and disbandment (1993–2001) ===
Capitol issued the compilation &quot;The Best of Great White: 1986–1992&quot; in 1993, when Great White had already departed the label to begin work on their next studio release, &quot;Sail Away&quot;. Before the release of the album, Great White spent seven months on the road headlining clubs. According to Lardie, it was &quot;the longest stint we ever did without a break&quot;. Great White kept up the pace once &quot;Sail Away&quot; was released on Zoo Records in 1994, touring the US several times over the following year and a half. Their next release, &quot;Let It Rock&quot;, was released in 1996 through yet another label, Imago Records.

In 1999, the band released &quot;Can&#x27;t Get There from Here&quot; and embarked on a tour with Ratt, Poison, and L.A. Guns. The album featured the single &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stoned&quot;, which managed to chart at No. 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

In a memo dated January 20, 2000, Mark Kendall announced he was taking a hiatus from Great White. Shortly thereafter both Audie Desbrow and Sean McNabb left Great White. Russell would continue to tour with only Michael Lardie staying. Desbrow, clearly very unhappy with the financial state of the band and Russell&#x27;s relapse in addiction, posted a tirade on his website lambasting Jack Russell while claiming to have been &quot;fired&quot; from Great White. Meanwhile, it was rumored that Sean McNabb was fired for going to management and asking to see the accounting books, though this was debunked by Desbrow, who stated that both he and McNabb had done so several times before getting fired. McNabb would later on state that his reason for being fired was because of his own addiction problems. The band announced plans to begin work on a new album in late 2000. Early in the process, some of the new songs were played for John Kalodner at Columbia Records. It was mutually agreed that the band needed a break and wanted to do outside projects. Kendall went on to make two solo albums. They subsequently left Columbia Records, curtailing any further work on the new album. On November 5, 2001, Jack Russell (following the death of his father) announced the end of Great White, stating that he was moving on, and that Great White would play a final string of dates, the final show on December 31, 2001, at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana, California. Both Kendall and McNabb appeared for the farewell show (though they had already re-joined in August), recorded for a live CD titled &quot;Thank You...Goodnight!&quot; released by Knight Records. The live album includes two new tracks, &quot;Back to the Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Play On&quot; from their discontinued studio sessions, both of which would ultimately wind up on their reunion album &quot;Back to the Rhythm&quot; in 2007.

=== Reunion, the Station nightclub fire incident and aftermath (2002–2009) ===
By late 2002, following a relatively unsuccessful change in music direction with his second solo album, Jack Russell contacted Kendall, who was struggling with irrelevancy. Kendall agreed to play some dates with Russell&#x27;s band. Billed as &quot;Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White&quot;, the tour was to consist primarily of classic songs from the Great White catalog with some of Russell&#x27;s solo work mixed in. Eventually, more dates were added and the tour extended through the early months of 2003.

The band returned to the national spotlight on February 20, 2003. At the beginning of a Great White performance at The Station night club in Rhode Island, pyrotechnics used by the band&#x27;s crew created a spray of sparks that ignited the makeshift and unapproved, unlisted foam soundproofing material affixed to the walls and ceiling around the stage. The soundproofing material was installed to help alleviate area neighbor noise complaints before the fire. One hundred people, including guitarist Ty Longley died in the fire that followed. Their son Acey Ty Christopher Longley was born in the summer of 2003. and is also a musician, running a charity called B.E.A.T.S. (Bringing Everyone A Tremendous Smile) for children in his father&#x27;s memory. Approximately 115 survivors were badly burned, maimed, and permanently disfigured. In 2008, Jack Russell Touring INC., agreed to pay $1 million to survivors and victims&#x27; relatives of the fire while admitting to no wrongdoing. This amount also covers former tour manager Daniel Biechele along with the band members, record label, and management as it existed at the time of the fire. The settlement was the maximum allowed under the band&#x27;s insurance plan. On the second anniversary of the fire, Jack Russell and Mark Kendall, along with Jack Russell&#x27;s attorney, Ed McPherson, appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; with three of the victims of the fire and the father of Ty Longley, to discuss some of the healing that had taken place over the previous two years and some of the permanent scars that remained. Victims had previously received $3.8 million raised by United Way of America.

Though the media referred to the band as Great White following the tragedy in Rhode Island, the band was still officially performing under the name Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White at the time of the incident. Before the fire, the band&#x27;s official website posted a message stating that Great White had not re-formed.

Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White played their first full show following the Rhode Island tragedy on July 22, starting a benefit tour for the survivors and victims of the fire. The band toured until 2005 to raise funds for the Station Family Fund, which had been set up to help the victims of the tragedy. In late 2005, citing &quot;medical reasons&quot;, the band canceled the second half of their summer tour. The &quot;medical reasons&quot; were claimed to have been related to Russell&#x27;s relapses in alcohol and cocaine. This was the end of this version of Great White, as Jack Russell entered rehabilitation and did not perform again until 2007. Russell used the year of 2006 to get sober and get a facelift that was detailed on &quot;Extra&quot;. Russell later referred to this incarnation of Great White as &quot;Fake White&quot;, saying &quot;It still sounded like Great White, but not – almost like we were doing a cover of ourselves.&quot;

Talk of a reunion of Great White began in a 2004 interview, where Jack Russell told Metal Express Radio: &quot;I spoke with Michael [Lardie], we threw that around a bit, and thought that sounds like a cool idea, it&#x27;d be fun. I&#x27;m pretty positive it&#x27;s gonna happen... probably next year ... We talked to some other people, and [former drummer] Audie [Desbrow] would not be a person I would want to play with ever again in my life. There were some bridges burned there that I just can&#x27;t forgive, and I&#x27;m a very forgiving person. I just can&#x27;t let that one go. I have to stand up for myself...&quot; Russell&#x27;s stance towards Desbrow had significantly changed by 2006 when he told Mitch Lafon: &quot;I talked to Michael Lardie the other day and he is into doing it. I just want to get hold of Tony Montana and Audie Desbrow. I think that would be very special for our 25th anniversary tour to have the same guys... we haven&#x27;t played together in a very long time.&quot; Later in 2006, guitarist Mark Kendall officially announced that Great White had re-formed. The re-formed lineup of Russell, Kendall, Lardie, McNabb and Desbrow (the lineup from 1996-2000) played their first date together in more than 5 years on January 27, 2007, at the Keyclub in Hollywood performing in the Harpseals.org Benefit Concert for the Seals 2007. The band continued to tour throughout the rest of the year.

In 2008, bassist Sean McNabb left Great White to concentrate on a career in theater and acting. McNabb was promptly replaced with Scott Snyder (Ramos, Accomplice). McNabb then joined the band Dokken.

Great White released their album &quot;Rising&quot; on March 13, 2009, in Europe via Frontiers Records, and on April 21 in the US through Shrapnel Records. They then embarked on a supporting tour.

=== Split with Jack Russell and rotating singers (2010–present) ===
In 2010, Jani Lane of Warrant began filling in for Jack Russell, while Russell recuperated from surgery after suffering a perforated bowel. Terry Ilous (XYZ) replaced Jack Russell for several shows, beginning with a show at the Brixton South Bay in Redondo Beach, during August 2010, while Paul Shortino (Rough Cutt, Quiet Riot, King Kobra) filled in for Russell when Great White performed at Stockholm Rock Out Festival in September.

By 2011, Great White was touring regularly with Ilous fronting the band, as they continued waiting for Russell to fully recover and return as lead singer. The band appeared to be on good terms with Russell even as late as August 2011, when Kendall stated in an interview that the group were still actively awaiting his return to the stage, further indicating that Russell was not only supportive of the current situation, but even checking in with Ilous on occasion to give the latter encouragement and thank him for doing such a great job singing Great White&#x27;s songs. However, Kendall did also state during this interview that while he and his bandmates were eager for Russell to rejoin, they did want to make sure the time was right and that &quot;when he&#x27;s back[,] he&#x27;s back all the way.&quot; A later interview with Kendall provided additional detail, indicating that the band had initially hoped Russell would rejoin by the early summer of 2011, but that he was not in any condition to return at that time. Kendall also mentioned that the band had several stipulations that Russell would need to meet to return to the lineup, and that Russell himself had set a new target return date of February 2012, meaning he would not be performing with Great White for the remainder of 2011.

Before the year&#x27;s end, however, Russell had apparently become impatient or disenchanted with this arrangement. In December 2011, just days after informing the band that (on advice from his doctor) he would not be able to rejoin by the February target date, he obtained a licensing agreement from Great White, and formed a new incarnation of Great White with a brand-new lineup under the name of Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White. The other band members immediately voiced their surprise and strong objection to this move and said that &quot;Jack Russell does not have the right to start his own Great White or use the name without our names in the lineup. We will litigate any promoter that books &#x27;Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White&#x27; or uses any logo featuring the name Great White.&quot; In September 2013, the parties finally reached an agreement in Federal Court that legally Jack Russell will turn all his rights to the &quot;Great White&quot; name over to Kendall, Lardie, and Desbrow. They in turn leased a way for Russell to make a living using the name Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White with his own band, while the other original members would continue to tour with Terry Ilous, using the official name Great White.

On March 18, 2012, Great White announced their first new album with Ilous, &quot;Elation&quot;, to be released in May that year, along with a live album (&quot;Great White: 30 years – Live On the Sunset Strip&quot;) and a concert DVD of the band&#x27;s 30th-anniversary show at the Key Club in Hollywood on March 22.

Meanwhile, Russell continued to front his own version of the group as Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White. In July 2013, bassist Dario Seixas (Who had been in the band when Russell formed his separate band) left the group and was replaced by Great White&#x27;s former bassist Tony Montana, who returned to a Great White–associated lineup after an absence of more than 20 years.

Lorne Black, Great White&#x27;s original bassist, who performed and recorded with the group up through the &quot;Once Bitten&quot; album, died on September 27, 2013. He was 50 years old.

In a November 2015 interview with &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, Michael Lardie stated that Great White was &quot;hoping to get into the studio in February or March to at least flesh out some ideas&quot; for their next album. In October 2016, it was reported that Great White would enter WireWorld Studio in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, on January 2, 2017, to begin recording their new album with producer Michael Wagener, whose collaboration with the band dates back to their 1983 EP &quot;Out of the Night&quot; and 1984 self-titled debut album. On June 2, 2017, Great White released their most recent studio effort, &quot;Full Circle&quot;, on Bluez Tone Records, with Wagener as the producer. The song &quot;Big Time&quot; was released as the first single and video. This was the last studio effort featuring Terry Ilous on lead vocals before his replacement in 2018 by Mitch Malloy.

Meanwhile, Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White released the single &quot;Hard Habit&quot; on December 19, 2014.
On July 19, 2016, the group signed with Frontiers Music. The first single with Frontiers, &quot;Blame It On The Night&quot;, was released November 30, 2016. The second single &quot;She Moves Me&quot; was released on December 14, 2016. On January 5, 2017, they premiered their third single &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here&quot;. Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White released the music video for the song &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; on January 18, 2017. The debut album &quot;He Saw It Comin&quot;&#x27; released on January 27, 2017.

In February 2017, it was announced that Great White would appear at Rockingham Festival 2017, to be held at Nottingham Trent University, UK, between October 20 and 22, 2017, the band scheduled to appear on Sunday 22nd. In late June, it was announced that Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White would celebrate the 30th anniversary of 1987&#x27;s &quot;Once Bitten&quot; by announcing a tour and a new acoustic album titled &quot;Once Acoustically Bitten&quot;, which was released on July 14, 2020. They performed material from both albums with the former being performed in its entirety on some shows. Before the tour, the band previewed material from the acoustic album on June 29 at the Guitar Center in Los Angeles.

On July 9, 2018, Great White announced that they had parted ways with Terry Ilous as their singer, a situation that he was not aware of until he found out &quot;through an e-mail and the Internet&quot;, and he was replaced by Mitch Malloy. Guitarist Mark Kendall later claimed that one of the reasons the band had parted ways with Ilous was because the chemistry &quot;wasn&#x27;t working&quot;, and added that they &quot;were kind of growing apart from Terry a little bit — not really for any reason. Nothing like big fights or anything.&quot;

On July 9, 2020, amidst growing COVID-19 numbers, Great White played an outdoor show in Malloy&#x27;s birthplace, Dickinson, North Dakota, as part of &quot;First on First Dickinson Summer Nights&quot;. While numerous events have been imposing restrictions, such as wearing masks and social distancing, &quot;First on First&quot; has no such rules in place. The concert did draw attention for the lack of safety measures during the pandemic, after which the band released a public apology statement.

On May 31, 2022, Great White announced they had parted ways with Mitch Malloy and replaced him with vocalist Andrew Freeman of Last in Line, and shortly thereafter, the band embarked on its first major tour with Freeman. The new lineup also intends to work on new music in the future. On October 19, it was announced that Brett Carlisle (who filled in for Freeman a month prior on several dates) was the new vocalist of the band, due to Freeman&#x27;s commitment with Last in Line.

On July 17, 2024, Jack Russell announced that he was retiring from touring, following &quot;a recent diagnosis of Lewy body dementia and Multiple system atrophy&quot; from May of that year. He died nearly a month after the announcement, on August 7, 2024, at the age of 63.

<text>Joseph &quot;King&quot; Krol (February 20, 1919 – December 16, 2008) was a Canadian football quarterback, running back, defensive back, and placekicker/punter from 1942 to 1953 and 1955. Considered as possibly the most versatile player in Canadian football history as a triple-threat to pass, run, and kick, he was one of Canada&#x27;s greatest athletes and also famously known as a &quot;Gold Dust Twin&quot; for his teamwork with Royal Copeland. Joe Krol was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. After suffering from a fall in his apartment, Krol died in a Toronto hospital on December 16, 2008.

== Early life ==
Krol was born on February 20, 1919, in Hamilton, Ontario. He was commonly nicknamed &quot;King&quot;. He said in 1999, &quot;My parents are Polish and the name was actually Krul. I guess in Polish, Krol means king. It also means rabbit, but I think I prefer king.&quot;

Krol began playing Canadian football in high school at Kennedy Collegiate Institute in Windsor, Ontario in 1932, with which he won several secondary school championships. He went to the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario and played Intercollegiate Football for the Western Ontario Mustangs from 1938 to 1942 including the Intercollegiate championship in 1939.

== Professional career ==
Krol joined the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, an Ontario Rugby Football Union precursor to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, following university in 1942. In the 1943 season, he led the Flying Wildcats to a surprise victory to win his first of six Grey Cups. His performance, with a 30-yard pass for a touchdown, a field goal, and a rouge, made him the star of the game. The Wildcats returned to the Grey Cup final in the 1944 season but lost. In that game, Krol fumbled the ball to the St. Hyacinthe-Donnacona Navy team after a hard hit on a run in the second quarter. Krol went on to play two games with the Detroit Lions in 1945 before joining the Toronto Argonauts for the remainder of the 1945 Canadian football season. The Canadian Press voted him Canada&#x27;s male athlete of the year in 1946 and 1947.

Krol won six Grey Cups, five with the Toronto Argonauts. His No. 55 jersey is one of only four that has been retired by the Boatmen. He was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s top athlete in 1946. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1963 and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.

Krol and Royal Copeland (Argonauts and Calgary Stampeders 1944–1956) became known as the &quot;Gold Dust Twins&quot;. Although official statistics were not kept for the Eastern teams until 1954, according to the 2001 &quot;Unofficial Canadian Football Encyclopedia&quot;, Krol completed ten passes for 147 yards and threw four touchdowns during the 1946 season.

In November 2006, Krol was voted one of the CFL&#x27;s top 50 players (No. 46) in a poll conducted by Canadian sports network TSN.

Joe Krol was also one of the owners of the Mercury Night club with Harry Eckler of the Softball Canada Hall of Fame and Sam Luftspring of the Boxing Hall of Fame.

<text>Russell Stanley Jackson (born July 28, 1936) is a former professional Canadian football player. Jackson spent his entire 12-year professional football career with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He is a member of the Order of Canada, the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, and has been described as the best Canadian-born quarterback to play in the CFL. In 2006, Jackson was voted one of the CFL&#x27;s Top 50 players (#8) of the league&#x27;s modern era by Canadian sports network TSN, the highest-ranked Canadian-born player on the list.

==Early life and university career==
Jackson went to Westdale Secondary School in Hamilton, Ontario. After a stellar college career as both a basketball and football player, he graduated from McMaster University in 1958 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. He was the McMaster nominee for a Rhodes Scholarship, but did not pursue an interview for the scholarship, deciding to play professionally.

==Professional career==
Jackson was drafted in the first round, sixth overall, by the Ottawa Rough Riders in the 1958 CFL draft as a halfback. In his rookie year, he also played quarterback and eventually became the starter and led the Rough Riders to three Grey Cup victories (48th, 56th, and 57th Grey Cups).

Jackson was the dominant CFL quarterback of the 1960s. Referred to as the &quot;Y. A. Tittle of the North&quot;, he was honoured many times during his CFL career. He won the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award in the 1963, 1966, and 1969 seasons. He was also a four-time winner of the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Canadian Award (1959, 1963, 1966, 1969). He was a six-time Eastern Conference All-Star quarterback (1962, 1963, 1966–1969) and the CFL All-Star quarterback in the 1966, 1968, and 1969 seasons.

Russ Jackson was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1973. Many consider him one of the best Canadian-born players to play in the CFL, while most consider him to be the best Canadian to play the quarterback position. In November 2006, Jackson was voted one of the CFL&#x27;s top 50 players (No. 8) of the league&#x27;s modern era by Canadian sports network TSN., the only Canadian-born player in the Top 10.

Jackson ended his career with 24,593 passing yards, with 1,356 completions on 2,530 attempts (53.6%), 124 interceptions, 185 touchdowns, and an efficiency rating of 91.2. He was also a mobile quarterback, gaining 5,045 yards on the ground on 738 rushes, with 54 touchdowns. Among the few Canadian-born quarterbacks to play in the CFL, Jackson is the only one to pass for over 10,000 yards.

He holds the record for throwing the most passing touchdowns in a Grey Cup game with four (set in the 1969 game) and highest career passer rating in Grey Cup games with 118.4.

&quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; sports editor Eddie MacCabe wrote a biography for Jackson&#x27;s career in Ottawa, titled &quot;Profile of a Pro: The Russ Jackson Story&quot; and first published in 1969.

==Career statistics==
==Post-football playing career==
===Teaching===
After retiring from football, Jackson returned to teaching, having been a mathematics teacher from 1959 to 1961 and head of the Department of Mathematics at Rideau High School in Ottawa, Ontario from 1961 to 1966. He was the principal of Canterbury High School in Ottawa from 1973 to 1975. He later became a vice-principal and principal at secondary schools in Ottawa and Mississauga. He also became principal at Brampton Centennial Secondary School, John Fraser and T.L. Kennedy secondary schools.

===Broadcasting===
Jackson served as colour commentator for the CFL on CBC broadcasts from 1971 to 1973 and again from 1977 to 1980. From 1996 to 2001, Jackson was the colour commentator CHML-AM&#x27;s coverage of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

===Coaching===
Jackson briefly left teaching in 1975, spending two years as head coach of the Toronto Argonauts. Jackson compiled a 12–18–2 regular season record in two seasons as the Argos&#x27; head coach, not reaching the playoffs in either season. Jackson was replaced by Leo Cahill, in his second tenure as the Argos&#x27; head coach, prior to the 1977 CFL season.

===Honours===
Jackson is an Officer of the Order of Canada and was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in law by McMaster University in 1989. He was added to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2012.

In 1986, the Russ Jackson Award was created in his honour to recognize the university football player who best exhibits athletic ability, academic achievement, and devoted citizenship.

Russ Jackson was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

<text>The &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;, &quot;Revolution of &#x27;94&quot;, or &quot;Gingrich Revolution&quot; are political slogans that refer to the Republican Party&#x27;s (GOP) success in the 1994 U.S. midterm elections, which resulted in a net gain of 54 seats in the House of Representatives, and a pick-up of eight seats in the Senate. It was led by Newt Gingrich.

==History==
Rather than campaigning independently in each district, Republican candidates chose to rally behind a single national program and message fronted by Georgia congressman and House Republican whip Newt Gingrich. They alleged that President Bill Clinton was not the &quot;New Democrat&quot; he claimed to be during his 1992 campaign, but was a &quot;tax and spend&quot; liberal. The Republicans offered an alternative to Clinton&#x27;s policies in the form of the Contract with America.

The gains in seats in the mid-term election resulted in the Republicans gaining control of both the House and the Senate in January 1995. Republicans had not held the majority in the House for 40 years, since the 83rd Congress (elected in 1952). From 1933 to 1995, Republicans had controlled both House and Senate for only four years. From 1933 into the early 1970s, most white conservatives in the South belonged to the Democratic Party, and created the Solid South bloc in Congress. Most African Americans in the South were disenfranchised in those years, based on anti-Black laws and subjective administration of voter registration practices.

By the mid-1990s, white conservatives from the South joined Republicans in other parts of the country, leading to the change in Congress. Large Republican gains were made in state houses as well when the GOP picked up twelve gubernatorial seats and 472 legislative seats. In so doing, it took control of 20 state legislatures from the Democrats. Prior to this, Republicans had not held the majority of governorships since 1970. In addition, this was the first time in 50 years that the GOP controlled a majority of state legislatures.

Discontent with Democratic candidates was foreshadowed by a string of elections after 1992, including Republicans winning the mayoralties of New York and Los Angeles in 1993. In that same year, Christine Todd Whitman won the New Jersey governorship. Bret Schundler became the first Republican mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, which had been held by the Democratic Party since 1917.

Republican George Allen won the 1993 Virginia gubernatorial election, and Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison won a U.S. Senate seat from the Democrats in the 1993 special election. Republicans also picked up three congressional seats from Democrats in Oklahoma and Kentucky in May 1994.

On November 9, 1994, the day after the election, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, a conservative Democrat, changed parties, becoming a Republican; on March 3, 1995, Colorado Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell switched to the Republican side as well, increasing the GOP Senate majority.

== Effect ==
When the 104th United States Congress convened in January 1995, House Republicans voted former Minority Whip Newt Gingrich—the chief author of the Contract with America—to become Speaker of the House. The new senatorial Republican majority chose Bob Dole, previously Minority Leader, as Majority Leader. Republicans pursued an ambitious agenda, but were often forced to compromise with Democratic president Bill Clinton, who wielded veto power.

The 1994 election also marked the end of the conservative coalition, a bi-partisan coalition of conservative Republicans and Democrats (often referred to as &quot;boll weevil Democrats&quot;, for their association with the South). This white conservative coalition had often managed to control Congressional outcomes since the end of the New Deal era.

== Pick-ups ==
Numerous Republican freshmen entered Congress. Of the 230 Republican House members of the 104th Congress, almost a third were new to the House. In the Senate, 11 of 54 (20%) Republicans were freshmen.

<doc id="187635" wikidata="Q1824959" url="?curid=187635" title="Lili (1953 film)">
<text>Lili is a 1953 American film released by MGM. It stars Leslie Caron as a touchingly naïve French girl whose emotional relationship with a carnival puppeteer is conducted through the medium of four puppets. The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, and was also entered in the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. It was later adapted for the stage under the title &quot;Carnival!&quot; (1961).

&quot;Lili&#x27;s&quot; screenplay, written by Helen Deutsch, was based on a short story and treatment titled &quot;The Seven Souls of Clement O&#x27;Reilly&quot; written by Paul Gallico, which in turn was based upon &quot;The Man Who Hated People,&quot; a short story by Gallico that appeared in the October 28, 1950 issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. After the film&#x27;s success, Gallico expanded his story into a 1954 novella entitled &quot;Love of Seven Dolls&quot;.

==Plot==

Naive country girl Lili arrives in a provincial town in hopes of locating an old friend of her late father, only to find that he has died. A local shopkeeper offers her employment, then tries to take advantage of her. She is rescued by a handsome, smooth-talking, womanizing carnival magician, Marc, whose stage name is Marcus the Magnificent. Lili is infatuated with him and follows him to the carnival, where on learning that she is 16, he helps her get a job as waitress. Lili is fired on her first night when she spends her time watching the magic act instead of waiting tables. When Lili consults the magician for advice, he tells her to go back to where she came from. Homeless and heartbroken, she contemplates suicide, unaware that she is being watched by the carnival&#x27;s puppeteer Paul. He strikes up a conversation with her through his puppets—a brash red-haired boy named Carrot Top, a sly fox, Reynardo, a vain ballerina, Marguerite, and a cowardly giant, Golo. Soon, a large group of carnival workers is enthralled watching Lili&#x27;s interaction with the puppets, as she is seemingly unaware that there is a puppeteer behind the curtain. Afterwards, Paul and his partner Jacquot offer Lili a job in the act, talking with the puppets. She accepts, and her natural manner of interacting with the puppets becomes the most valuable part of the act.

Paul was once a well-known dancer, but suffered a leg injury in World War II. He regards the puppet show as far inferior to his old career, which embitters him. Lili refers to him as &quot;the Angry Man&quot;. Although he falls in love with Lili, he can only express his feelings through the puppets. Fearing rejection due to his physical impairment, he keeps his distance by being unpleasant to her. Lili continues to dream about the handsome magician, wishing to replace his assistant Rosalie.

Soon, Marcus receives an offer to perform at the local casino and decides to leave the carnival, to the joy of Rosalie, who announces to everyone that she is his wife. Lili is heartbroken and innocently invites Marc to her trailer. His lecherous plans are interrupted by Paul, and he leaves. When Lili finds Marc&#x27;s wedding ring in the seat cushions and tries to chase him, Paul stops her, calls her a fool, and slaps her.

Two impresarios from Paris who have been scouting the show come to see Paul and Jacquot. They recognize Paul as the former dancer and tell him that his act with Lili and the puppets is ingenious. Paul is ecstatic about this and the offer, but Jacquot tells the agents that they will have to let them know. He then tells Paul that Lili is leaving.

Lili takes the wedding ring to Marc and tells him that every little girl has to wake up from her girlish dreams. She has decided to leave the carnival. On her way out, she is stopped by the voices of Carrot Top and Reynardo, who ask her to take them with her. As they embrace her, she finds they are shaking. She remembers somebody is behind the curtain and pulls it away to see Paul. Instead of telling her how he feels, he tells her of the agents&#x27; offer. She confronts him about the difference between his real self, seemingly incapable of love, and his puppets. Paul tells her he is the puppets, a creature of many facets and many flaws. He concludes by telling her, &quot;This is business.&quot; &quot;Not any more,&quot; retorts Lili, who walks away.

Walking out of town, she imagines that the puppets, now life-sized, have joined her. As she dances with each puppet in turn, they all turn into Paul. Coming back to reality, Lili runs back to the carnival and into Paul&#x27;s arms. They kiss passionately as the puppets applaud.

==Production==
===Puppets===
Walton and O&#x27;Rourke, famous in puppeteering circles, made the puppets. They mostly worked in cabarets and did not appear on television. &quot;Lili&quot; is among the few known filmed records of their work which also includes the Walter Lantz cartoon and live action short film, &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: Puppet Show&quot; (1936).

Walton and O&#x27;Rourke manipulated Marguerite and Reynardo, George Latshaw was responsible for Carrot Top, and Wolo Von Trutzschler handled Golo the Giant. Burr Tillstrom was approached to create puppets for the film, but turned it down.

===Music===
The score was composed by Bronisław Kaper and conducted by Hans Sommer, with orchestrations by Robert Franklyn and Skip Martin. Kaper&#x27;s music received the Oscar for &quot;Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture.&quot;

Lyrics for the song &quot;Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo&quot; were written by Helen Deutsch for her previously published short story &quot;Song of Love&quot;. Kaper&#x27;s setting of the song was performed by Caron and Mel Ferrer in the film; the performance was released on record and reached number 30 in the American charts.

Four excerpts from the score were first issued by MGM Records at the time of the film&#x27;s release. The complete score was issued on CD in 2005, on &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; records.

==Responses and box-office==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; included it in its 2004 &quot;Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made,&quot; as did Angie Errigo and Jo Berry in a 2005 compilation of &quot;Chick Flicks: Movies Women Love.&quot;

Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film at its opening, had nothing but praise for the movie, rejoicing that &quot;at last Leslie Caron&#x27;s simplicity and freshness...have been captured again in the film.&quot; He showered other encomia on Caron, calling her &quot;elfin&quot;, &quot;winsome&quot;, the &quot;focus of warmth and appeal&quot;, praising her &quot;charm, grace, beauty, and vitality.&quot; He said screenwriter Helen Deutsch had &quot;put together a frankly fanciful romance with clarity, humor, and lack of guile,&quot; and admires the choreographer, sets, music, and title song.

The film was not universally liked, though; Pauline Kael called it a &quot;sickly whimsy&quot; and referred to Mel Ferrer&#x27;s &quot;narcissistic, masochistic smiles.&quot;

According to MGM records, the film earned $2,210,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $3,183,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $1,878,000, making it MGM&#x27;s most popular musical of the year.

==Source text and sequel==
===&quot;The Man Who Hated People&quot; (short story)===
&quot;The Man Who Hated People&quot; appeared in the October 28, 1950 issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. It is lighter in tone than other versions of the story. In particular, the abuse heaped by the puppeteer on the innocent &quot;girl&quot; is emotional and verbal. Unlike the novel &quot;The Love of Seven Dolls,&quot; the short story does not even hint at physical or sexual abuse.

The story opens in a New York City television studio where Milly, a &quot;sweet-faced girl with [a] slightly harassed expression,&quot; is about to make her farewell appearance on the &quot;Peter and Panda&quot; show.

Peter and Panda are part of an ensemble of puppets; they are a leprechaun and a panda respectively; other puppets include Arthur, a &quot;raffish crocodile;&quot; Mme Robineau, a French lady &quot;of indeterminate age with dyed hair;&quot; Doctor Henderson, a penguin; and Mr Tootenheimer, a toymaker. They are all operated by a single puppeteer, named Crake Villeridge. Despite being a puppet show, it has, like the real-life &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; TV show, a huge audience of all ages. Also like &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;, there is no script: &quot;it&#x27;s all ad-libbed&quot;. (In fact, the illustration included with the story features the actual stage used for &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;.) At the end of the show, &quot;millions watching felt a sense of loss as though a family close to them were breaking up.&quot;

Milly has been with the show two years, and, as in other versions of the story, she interacts in a spontaneous way directly with the personae of the puppets. In a flashback, during her audition, she had met and talked to the puppets before meeting any human being. Not realizing that this encounter was her audition, she is surprised when a station representative meets her and tells her &quot;Your performance this afternoon came closest to what [Mr Villeridge] wants.&quot; She says &quot;But it actually wasn&#x27;t a performance&quot;, and is told &quot;Exactly. The first time you start giving a performance, you&#x27;re through.&quot;

Villeridge, we learn, is French Canadian, and had once been headed for a serious career as a hockey player. In an accident, two men &quot;skated over the side of his face,&quot; ending his hockey career, and seriously and permanently disfiguring him.

She soon learns that Villeridge is emotionally an abuser. She loves the on-air performances, loves the puppets and their personalities, and finds Mr Tootenheimer, the wise old toymaker, particularly comforting, but she hates Villeridge and what he does to her in rehearsal and after the show. He shouts at her, demeans her, criticizes everything she has done, and humiliates her in front of the staff. When she meets a nice man named Fred Archer and believes she is &quot;a little in love&quot; with him, she decides she can no longer stand Villeridge and his tyrannical ways. She announces that she is marrying Archer and gives notice.

After her farewell show, she changes into her street dress. She waits for everyone else to leave the studio, afraid of encountering Villeridge, who &quot;might be waiting for her with one last attack.&quot; As she leaves, she hears the voice of Arthur, the puppet, who says, &quot;I stayed behind. Milly, take me with you.&quot; Soon she is talking to Arthur and the other puppets. Mr Tootenheimer, the &quot;old philosopher&quot;, explains to her that every man is composed of many things, and that the puppets represent aspects of Villeridge&#x27;s real personality:

:And if a man who has been cut and scarred and is ashamed of his appearance, who loved you from the first time his eyes rested upon your face, could be a brutal fool, believing that if you could be made to love all of the things he really was, you would never again recoil from the things he seemed to be.

Millie cries &quot;Crake! Crake! come to me.&quot; They embrace, and Milly decides to say goodbye to &quot;the outside world—reality—Fred Archer&quot; and live with Villeridge and his created &quot;Never-Never Land of the mind.&quot;

===&quot;Love of Seven Dolls&quot;===
&quot;In Paris in the spring of our times, a young girl was about to throw herself into the Seine.&quot; Thus opens the novella from which the film &quot;Lili&quot; and the musical &quot;Carnival&quot; was drawn.

The Paul Gallico short story from which &quot;Lili&quot; was adapted was published in expanded form in 1954 as &quot;Love of Seven Dolls&quot;, a 125-page novella. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the book opens &quot;Those audiences still making their way to see &quot;Lili&quot; may now read the book from which this motion picture was adapted.&quot; The original short story was clearly based on the popular television puppet show &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;, as it takes place in a television studio (not a carnival as in the film and book), and has many characters based on the Kuklapolitans. The novella was more mystical and magic than the short story. Brettonais from the village of Plouha...&quot;Wretched though she was, some of the mystery of that mysterious land still clung to her...the gravity of her glance, the innocence and primitive mind...there were dark corners of Celtic brooding...a little scarecrow.&quot;

Gallico&#x27;s book is far darker in tone. In the book, the girl&#x27;s nickname is Mouche (&quot;fly&quot;) rather than Lili. The puppeteer is named Michel Peyrot, stage name Capitaine Coq, rather than Paul Berthalet.

The puppeteer&#x27;s assistant is a &quot;primitive&quot; Senegalese man named Golo, rather than the movie&#x27;s amiable Frenchman, Jacquot. He shares with Mouche a sense of primitive magic, and with her believes in the reality of the puppets.

The first four puppets she meets correspond closely to those in the film and are a youth named Carrot Top; a fox, Reynardo; a vain girl, Gigi; and a &quot;huge, tousle-headed, hideous, yet pathetic-looking giant&quot; Alifanfaron. The latter two are named &quot;Marguerite&quot; and &quot;Golo&quot; in the movie (i.e. the name of the puppeteer&#x27;s assistant in the book becomes the name of a puppet in the movie). The book includes three additional puppets: Dr. Duclos, a penguin who wears a pince-nez and is a dignified academic; Madame Muscat, &quot;the concierge&quot;, who constantly warns Mouche that the others are &quot;a bad lot&quot;; and Monsieur Nicholas, &quot;a maker and mender of toys&quot; with steel-rimmed spectacles, stocking cap, and leather apron.

The core of both book and movie is the childlike innocence of Mouche/Lili and her conviction that she is interacting directly with the puppets themselves, which have some kind of existence separate from the puppeteer. This separation is explicit in the book. It says that Golo was &quot;childlike...but in the primitive fashion backed by the dark lore of his race&quot; and looked upon the puppets &quot;as living, breathing creatures&quot;, but &quot;the belief in the separate existence of these little people was even more basic with Mouche for it was a necessity to her and a refuge from the storms of life with which she had been unable to cope.&quot;

In the movie, the puppeteer, Paul Berthalet, is gruff, unhappy, and emotionally distant. Although Lili refers to him as &quot;the Angry Man&quot;, he is not very cruel or menacing. His bitterness is explained by his identity as a former ballet dancer, disabled by a leg injury and &quot;reduced&quot; to the role of puppeteer.

Gallico&#x27;s Peyrot, however, is more vicious. No ballet dancer, he was &quot;bred out of the gutters of Paris&quot; and by the age of fifteen was &quot;a little savage practiced in all the cruel arts and swindles of the street fairs and cheap carnivals.&quot; He has &quot;the look of a satyr.&quot; &quot;Throughout his life no one had ever been kind to him, or gentle, and he paid back the world in like. Wholly cynical, he had no regard for man, woman, child, or God ... He would, if he could, have corrupted the whole world.&quot;

In both book and movie, Mouche/Lili is tempted by a superficial attraction to a handsome man—an acrobat named Balotte in the book, the magician Marc in the movie—but returns to the puppeteer. In the movie, Marc&#x27;s relation with Lili is exploitative. In the book, however, Peyrot is the exploitative and abusive one, and the relationship with BalottMouche &quot;passed in that moment over the last threshold from child to womanhood&quot; and knew &quot;the catalyst that could save him. It was herself.&quot; She tells Peyrot &quot;Michel...I love you. I will never leave you.&quot; Peyrot does not respond, but he weeps; Mouche holds his &quot;transfigured&quot; head and knows &quot;they were the tears of a man...who, emerging from the long nightmare, would be made forever whole by love.&quot; If this is a happy ending, it is not the simple happy ending of the movie.

Reviewing the book on its publication, Andrea Parke says Gallico creates &quot;magic...when he writes the sequences with Mouche and the puppets.&quot; But &quot;when he writes the love story of Mouche as the ill-treated plaything of the puppet master, the story loses its magic. The mawkish realism of the passages has an aura of bathos that is not only unreal but unmoving.&quot;

<doc id="187636" wikidata="Q1122534" url="?curid=187636" title="Mogambo">
<text>Mogambo is a 1953 Technicolor adventure/romantic drama film directed by John Ford and starring Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, and Grace Kelly, and featuring Donald Sinden. Shot on location in Equatorial Africa, with a musical soundtrack consisting entirely of actual African tribal music recorded in the Congo, the film was adapted by John Lee Mahin from the play &quot;Red Dust&quot; by Wilson Collison. The picture is a remake of &quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932), which was set in Vietnam and also starred Gable in the same role.

Although the original trailer for the film claimed that &quot;Mogambo&quot; meant &quot;the greatest,&quot; in fact, the word has no meaning at all. Producer Sam Zimbalist came up with the title by altering the name of the &quot;Mocambo&quot;, a famous Hollywood nightclub.

==Plot==

New York socialite Eloise &quot;Honey Bear&quot; Kelly arrives at a remote African outpost, looking for a rich maharaja acquaintance, only to find he has cancelled his trip owing to unrest in his realm. While waiting for the next river boat out, she spars with hardworking big game hunter and wild animal catcher Victor Marswell from the United States, who initially views her as disreputable. Marswell&#x27;s business partner is plucky Englishman and big game hunter John Brown-Pryce, known as &quot;Brownie.&quot; &quot;Brownie&quot; is sympathetic to Kelly, and believes that her &quot;scars aren&#x27;t visible, but they&#x27;re there.&quot; Marswell also has a semi-hostile relationship with his employee, the gruff Russian Leon Boltchak. Kelly and Marswell later develop a mutual attraction and make love. Then the river boat brings London couple Donald Nordley and his wife Linda. Honey Bear takes the steamer out with the British skipper at Marswell&#x27;s urging, although she would prefer to stay with Marswell and he expresses some regret at their parting. The Nordleys wish to go on safari to record the cries of gorillas. Marswell declines to guide them there due to the difficulties involved and insists that they be guided on the agreed route by his assistant, despite the Nordleys&#x27; protests. Honey Bear rejoins the group after the steamer suffers engine failure and subsequently runs aground.

Marswell rescues Linda from a panther, and Honey Bear sees that they are attracted to one another. After Marswell talks to Linda privately, he agrees to take the Nordleys into gorilla country, while also taking Honey Bear part of the way to join the district commissioner, who can then take her back to civilization. However, they find the commissioner mortally wounded by recently belligerent Samburu tribesmen. With reinforcements days away, the small party narrowly escapes, taking the commissioner with them. Meanwhile, a serious romance is developing between Marswell and Linda. Only Donald is blind to the situation. Marswell plans to tell him about how he and Linda feel, but has second thoughts after realizing how much Donald loves his wife and perhaps how she would be better off remaining with him. The situation is aggravated when Marswell reluctantly shoots a gorilla to save Donald, blowing a chance to capture a baby gorilla. Marswell goes back to camp, depressed, and begins drinking heavily in his tent. Honey Bear joins him.

When Linda appears, she finds them cuddling. Marswell decides he can fix everything by making Linda hate him and makes a show of this cuddling followed by dismissive remarks about Linda&#x27;s infatuation with &quot;the White Hunter&quot; to enrage her. Unfortunately, his ploy works too well when Linda shoots him with his own pistol, wounding him in the arm. Honey Bear lies to the others, telling them that Marswell had been making advances to Linda for some time, finally forcing Linda to shoot him in his drunken state. The next day, the party breaks camp to head back, leaving Marswell behind to try to capture young gorillas to pay for the safari. Marswell, acknowledging to himself his feelings for Honey Bear, asks her to stay and then proposes to her, but she rebuffs him. As the canoes set off, however, she suddenly jumps into the water and wades her way back to him.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1946, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported MGM was considering remaking &quot;Red Dust&quot; with Marilyn Maxwell as a possible star. In March 1948, Marie McDonald reportedly screen tested for the Jean Harlow part. In May 1949, Maxwell and Gene Kelly were being considered for lead roles.

The studio had a great deal of success with color remakes of older films shot on location overseas, including &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1950) and &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951). In August 1951, MGM announced it would make &quot;Mogambo&quot;, shot on location in Africa. The producer would be Sam Zimbalist who had made &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, and the star would be Clark Gable.

In February 1952, Zimbalist scouted locations in Africa for six weeks. In June, John Ford agreed to direct.

===Casting===
Shelley Winters was mentioned as a possible co-star. Patricia Neal also was discussed. In June 1952, Ava Gardner signed.

Grace Kelly was not the first choice for the role of Linda Nordley. Gene Tierney withdrew because she did not want to leave Aly Khan in Paris.

===Shooting===
Gable arrived in Kenya on 1 November 1952 and was given an armed guard due to the Mau Mau Uprising.

Filming started 17 November. It was done on location in Okalataka, French Congo; Mount Kenya, Thika, Kenya — Mt Longonot, and Lake Naivasha, both in the Kenyan Rift Valley and Fourteen Falls near Thika are seen as backdrops — Kagera River, Tanganyika; Uganda. Samburu were filmed in front of Mount Sabachi near Archer&#x27;s Post and Isiolo. Interiors were shot at the MGM-British Studios, in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England.

Frank Allen and his wife were guides during the six week-safari that constituted location filming.

The shoot was difficult. There was a rumor Clark Gable was going to be assassinated by the Mau Mau, so John Ford moved a location. Two of the crew were revealed to be Mau Mau. The unit was plagued by rain and had a deleterious effect on the already poor quality of the roads. Three of the crew were killed in road accidents, including assistant director John Hancock.

Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios, recalled:&quot;Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them were Viscount Mandeville and Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally - sometimes very sadistically. In Ford&#x27;s eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled out in front of the entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford&#x27;s brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford&#x27;s grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight.

Before leaving camp on the first morning [of shooting] I had been told to report to the hair-dressing departments tent, where I found the make-up men armed with electric clippers: &#x27;I have to remove the hair from your chest.&#x27; &#x27;Whatever for?&#x27; I asked, &#x27;Orders.&#x27; It transpired that Clark [Gable], whose chest was completely devoid of hair, had always insisted that no other actor should appear on film exposing a hirsute breast. This included any member of the crew not wearing a shirt as well. He considered it a slight on his masculinity. We now had to return to the MGM Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day&#x27;s work I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading &quot;BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK&quot;. He was as good as his word - for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour.&quot;

===Post-production===
The music featured in the film was performed by local native tribes (except for Gardner accompanied by player piano), unusual for Hollywood, and the film records a traditional Africa and safari style.

Francoist Spanish censors would not allow adultery to be shown onscreen. For this reason, they changed the relationship of the characters of Linda Nordley (Kelly) and Donald Nordley (Sinden) from wife and husband to sister and brother in the dubbed version released in Spain, thus necessitating the removal of a bedroom scene in which only one bed is present.

==Reception==
The film was a hit — according to MGM records it made $4,576,000 in the US and Canada and $3,692,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,026,000.

In his October 2, 1953 review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther observes that the film “has a great deal more to do with the low-down romantic maneuvering of two colorful and popular stars than with the thrills of adventuring in Africa, …Some handsome color shots of open country are slipped in from time to time, ... But the interest is basically centered in the civilized stalking of the stars. And it is meant as no insult to Mr. Gable to say that he is the most important gorilla bagged. In the advancement of the romance, which itself is hot stuff, for what it is, several capable actors do entertaining jobs. Mr. Gable is beautifully commanding, in his vicious, sardonic way, and Miss Gardner, as we say, is as enticing as any calculated vampire can be. …Grace Kelly as the stuffy English dame, Donald Sinden as her pip-pip hubby and Eric Pohlmann as a hand are all right, too. The trouble is simply that more of them meant less of the animals.” The movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall.

James Bacon, writing a capsule review for the AP&#x27;s Bob Thomas&#x27; Hollywood on September 16, 1953, had a similar reaction: “It seems everybody both here and around the country has been hoping Clark Gable would get a good picture. King Gable actually hasn&#x27;t had one good movie since his return from World War II service. He&#x27;s got it now in &quot;Mogambo,&quot; even though it&#x27;s a remake of &quot;Red Dust&quot; one of his greatest hits of the &#x27;30s. Gable is virile as ever and makes lusty love to Ava Gardner as well as he did to Jean Harlow when he was a much younger man.”

It has a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews.

==Awards and honors==
Grace Kelly won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the film was nominated for two Oscars: Best Actress (Gardner) and Best Supporting Actress (Kelly). The film also was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film.

<doc id="187638" wikidata="Q470139" url="?curid=187638" title="Maggie McNamara">
<text>Marguerite McNamara (June 18, 1928 – February 18, 1978) was an American stage, film, and television actress and model from the United States. McNamara began her career as a teenage fashion model. She first came to public attention as Patty O&#x27;Neill in the 1951 national tour of F. Hugh Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; which ran concurrently with the original Broadway production. In 1952 she succeeded Barbara Bel Geddes in that role in the Broadway production. Both productions were directed by Otto Preminger, and Preminger also directed McNamara in that role in the controversial 1953 film adaptation of that work. She earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her role in the film.

She appeared in only three films after &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;, with her last being &quot;The Cardinal&quot; in 1963. After five guest-starring roles in television series in the early 1960s, she retired from acting. For the remainder of her life, she worked as a typist in New York City. On February 18, 1978, McNamara died of an intentional barbiturate overdose at the age of 49.

==Early life==
McNamara was born in New York City, one of four children of Timothy and Helen (née Fleming) McNamara. Her father was of Irish descent while her mother was born in England to Irish parents. McNamara had two sisters, Helen and Cathleen, and a brother, Robert. Her parents divorced when she was nine years old.

She attended Textile High School in New York. As a teenager, McNamara was discovered when modeling agent John Robert Powers saw photos of her taken at a friend&#x27;s home. With her mother&#x27;s encouragement, McNamara signed with his agency and, while still in high school, began working as a teen model. She was one of the most successful teen models of the time and appeared in &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;. McNamara later commented on her modeling days:

I was terribly shy, and I used to work on myself to keep from showing it. When I was facing a camera, I pretended that neither it nor the photographer were there. I played a game with myself according to the clothes I was wearing...You have to feel right in what you are wearing, to have it look right. Just as each period has its own fashion, each person has his own style. When you find it, I think you should stay with it. When I was modeling I had to dress exactly as &quot;Vogue&quot; wanted the picture to be. But any good quality becomes something else when it is overdone, and I feel that this applies to being too clothes conscious. I don&#x27;t care what the fashion dictator says. I will not follow if it&#x27;s not right for me. But your overall impression consists of more than clothes. Your grooming, posture, the sound of your voice, and your perfume play a part in the total picture you create.

In April 1950, McNamara appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine for a second time. After seeing her on the cover, producer David O. Selznick offered her a film contract. She turned it down and continued to model while studying dance and acting.

==Career==

McNamara made her professional stage debut on January 29, 1951, at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey as Una Brehony in the United States premiere of Michael J. Molloy&#x27;s comedy &quot;The King of Friday&#x27;s Men&quot;. Directed by John Burrell, the play had enjoyed a lengthy run previously under Burrell&#x27;s direction at the Abbey Theatre for the National Theatre of Ireland. The production moved to Broadway&#x27;s Playhouse Theatre; marking McNamara&#x27;s Broadway debut on February 21, 1951. Short lived, it ran for just four performances. 

McNamara next portrayed Alice in George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; at the Lenox Hill Playhouse in late March and April 1951. Soon after, she appeared as Patty O&#x27;Neill in the national touring production of &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; which began its run in Detroit on April 20, 1951, under the direction of Otto Preminger. Written by F. Hugh Herbert, the play was already a Broadway hit starring Barbara Bel Geddes as Patty O&#x27;Neill under Preminger&#x27;s direction. McNamara left the national tour to take over the role of Patty O&#x27;Neill on Broadway in June 1952. 

In 1953, McNamara went to Hollywood to reprise her role in Preminger&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;. The film was highly controversial at the time due to its sexual themes and frank dialogue (the play and the film contain the words &quot;virgin&quot;, &quot;pregnant,” “mistress”, and &quot;seduce&quot;). As a result, the film failed to secure the seal of approval from the MPAA. United Artists, who produced &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;, decided to release the film anyway. It was promptly banned in Kansas, Maryland and Ohio and given a &quot;Condemned&quot; rating by the National Legion of Decency. Despite the controversy, the film was a success and earned $3.5 million at the box office. While box office returns were strong, &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; received mixed reviews. McNamara&#x27;s performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and a BAFTA nomination for Most Promising Newcomer to Film.
After filming, McNamara signed with 20th Century Fox and was cast in the 1954 romantic drama film &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;. The film was generally well received and helped to boost McNamara&#x27;s popularity. The following year, she co-starred opposite Richard Burton in the biographical film &quot;Prince of Players&quot;. Although McNamara&#x27;s career started well, she made only one more film after &quot;Prince of Players&quot;. Part of the reason why her career stalled has been attributed to her refusal to move to Los Angeles. She also reportedly refused to do publicity for her films or pose for the cheesecake shots that studios generally expected their female stars to do. Her career troubles were furthered by emotional problems. In his 1977 memoir, director Otto Preminger wrote that, &quot;Maggie suffered greatly after becoming a star. Something went wrong with her marriage to director David Swift. She suffered a nervous breakdown.&quot;

After 1955, McNamara did not accept any screen roles for the remainder of the decade. In 1962, she returned to acting in the Broadway play &quot;Step on a Crack&quot;. Later that year, she performed in a production of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; with Darren McGavin at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in Florida. She had previously worked with McGavin on a one-night only performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. The following year, Otto Preminger cast her in a small role in &quot;The Cardinal&quot;. It proved to be her final film role. In 1963, McNamara turned to television. She guest starred on an episode of &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and starred as the title character in the Season 5 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Ring-a-Ding Girl&quot;. McNamara&#x27;s last onscreen appearance was in the July 1964 episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; entitled &quot;Body in the Barn&quot;, opposite Lillian Gish.

==Personal life==
In March 1951, McNamara married actor and director David Swift. The couple had no children and later divorced (Swift remarried in 1957). McNamara never remarried. After her divorce, she had a relationship with screenwriter Walter Bernstein.

==Later years and death==
After her last onscreen role in 1964, McNamara fell out of public view. For the remaining 15 years of her life, she worked temp jobs as a typist to support herself. Her obituary noted she had been writing scripts, including one titled &quot;The Mighty Dandelion&quot;, which had been purchased by a production company at the time of her death.

On February 18, 1978, McNamara was found dead on the couch of her apartment in New York City. She had deliberately taken an overdose of sleeping pills and tranquilizers, and left a suicide note on her piano. According to police reports, she had a history of mental illness, and friends reported that she had suffered from severe depression.
She is interred in Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.

<text>The Moon Is Blue is a 1953 American romantic comedy film produced and directed by Otto Preminger and starring William Holden, David Niven, and Maggie McNamara. Written by F. Hugh Herbert and based on his 1951 play of the same title, the film is about a young woman who meets an architect on the observation deck of the Empire State Building and quickly turns his life upside down. Herbert&#x27;s play had also been a huge success in Germany, and Preminger decided to simultaneously film in English and German, using the same sets but different casts. The German-language film version is &quot;Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach&quot;.

==Plot==
A comedy of manners, the film centers on virtuous actress Patty O&#x27;Neill, who meets playboy architect Donald Gresham at the top of the Empire State Building and accepts his invitation to join him for drinks and dinner in his apartment. There she meets Donald&#x27;s upstairs neighbors, his ex-fiancée Cynthia Slater and her father, roguish David Slater.

Both men are determined to seduce the young woman, but they quickly discover that Patty is more interested in engaging in spirited discussions about the pressing moral and sexual issues of the day than in surrendering her virginity to either of them. After resisting their amorous advances throughout the night, Patty leaves. The next day she returns to the Empire State Building, where she finds Donald, who has missed her and worried all night about her. He declares his love for her and proposes marriage to her.

==Cast==
* William Holden as Donald Gresham
* David Niven as David Slater
* Maggie McNamara as Patty O&#x27;Neill
* Tom Tully as Michael O&#x27;Neill, Patty&#x27;s father
* Dawn Addams as Cynthia Slater, David&#x27;s daughter
* Fortunio Bonanova as Television Performer
* Gregory Ratoff as Taxi Driver
: Hardy Krüger and Johanna Matz, the stars of the German version, appear as the young tourist couple waiting to use the coin-operated telescope at the top of the Empire State Building, cameo roles which Holden and McNamara play in the German version.

==Play==

Otto Preminger had staged the 1951 Broadway production of F. Hugh Herbert&#x27;s play at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre, with Barbara Bel Geddes, Donald Cook, and Barry Nelson in the lead roles. It had a successful run of 924 performances, from March 8, 1951 (almost the worst year on record for the Broadway stage, according to &quot;The Billboard&quot;) until May 30, 1953.

A third, West Coast, touring company announced shows at the La Jolla Playhouse from July 1 through July 6, 1952, starring David Niven and Diana Lynn, and continuing on a tour scheduled to include Los Angeles (Biltmore), San Bernardino, San Francisco, and other cities joining the Chicago touring company.

On July 8, 1952, producer/director Otto Preminger opened the West Coast production at the United Nations Theater in San Francisco for a three-month run, with David Niven as David Slater, Diana Lynn as Patty O&#x27;Neill, and Scott Brady as Donald Gresham in the lead roles.

==Production==
Preminger contracted with United Artists to finance and distribute a screen adaptation over which he would have complete control. Preminger cast David Niven over the objection of studio executives, who felt that the actor&#x27;s career was in decline. He deferred his producer&#x27;s and director&#x27;s salaries in exchange for 75% of the film&#x27;s profits.

Maggie McNamara, who appeared as Patty O&#x27;Neill in the Chicago production of the play, and briefly in New York, received her first screen role and the film&#x27;s last casting.

Herbert&#x27;s play had been a huge success in Germany, and Preminger decided to film multiple-language versions simultaneously in English and German (&quot;Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach&quot;), using the same sets but different casts. The director estimated this method would increase the filming schedule by only eight to ten days and production costs by only 10 to 15 percent. The budget for both films was $373,445. It is estimated that deferred costs came to nearly $500,000 but in return United Artists gave the producers Herbert and Preminger 75% of the profits, 20% of which they gave to William Holden.

== Motion Picture Production Code objections ==
Herbert&#x27;s play was first submitted to the MPAA/PCA for approval by Paramount Pictures in 1951, with Samuel J. Briskin as producer. On June 26, 1951, the office of MPAA censor Joseph Breen sent a letter back, stating that the script was unacceptable under the Motion Picture Production Code. Later, on July 13, 1951, the office of Joseph Breen contacted Herbert and advised him his screenplay was in violation of the Production Code because of its &quot;light and gay treatment of the subject of illicit sex and seduction.&quot; On December 26, Preminger submitted a revised draft of the script which, due to numerous lines of dialogue exhibiting &quot;an unacceptably light attitude towards seduction, illicit sex, chastity, and virginity&quot;, was rejected on January 2, 1952. Contrary to later legend, the words &quot;virgin&quot;, &quot;mistress&quot;, and &quot;pregnant&quot;, all of which had been in the original play&#x27;s dialogue, were not singled out as objectionable. On January 6, Preminger and Herbert advised the Breen office they disagreed with its decision and would film the screenplay without further changes.

In a display of solidarity, United Artists heads Arthur B. Krim and Robert S. Benjamin amended their contract with Preminger and deleted the clause requiring him to deliver a film that would be granted a Production Code seal of approval. After ten days of rehearsals for each of his casts, Preminger began principal photography of both English- and German-language versions of the film on January 21, filming an English scene and then its German equivalent in quick succession. Preminger later stated he much preferred &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; to &quot;Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach&quot; because he felt that the psychology of the plot did not translate well. Filming was completed in twenty-four days and it previewed in Pasadena on April 8. Two days later, Breen notified Preminger the film would not be approved. Outraged at Breen&#x27;s &quot;unwarranted and unjustified attack&quot; on &quot;a harmless story&quot;, the director joined forces with UA executives to appeal the decision with the MPAA board of directors, who ruled against them.

== Distribution ==
United Artists decided to release the film without the PCA seal of approval, the first major American film to do so, initially in major urban markets where they hoped its success would encourage exhibitors in rural areas to book the film. The film premiered for an &quot;adults only&quot; audience at the Woods Theatre in Chicago on June 22 and opened at the United Nations Theater in San Francisco on June 25. On June 30, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that three major nationwide theater chains were willing to exhibit the film, and it went into general release on July 8, and was in the top five box-office successes of that week. (In its year-end report, &quot;Variety&quot; said the film had ranked #15 at the box office with a gross of $3.5 million.)

It was banned in Jersey City, New Jersey as &quot;indecent and obscene&quot;. Theaters in many small towns in the United States restricted audiences to men or women separately. Kansas, Maryland and Ohio also banned the film, and Preminger and United Artists decided to bring suit in a Maryland court. On December 7, 1953, Judge Herman Moser reversed the State Censor Board. In his ruling, he called the film &quot;a light comedy telling a tale of wide-eyed, brash, puppy-like innocence.&quot; Preminger and UA then appealed in Kansas (&quot;Holmby Productions, Inc. v. Vaughn&quot;), but the Supreme Court of Kansas upheld the state board of review&#x27;s decision to ban the film. Determined to win, the director and studio took their case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which overturned the finding of the Kansas Supreme Court on October 24, 1955.
&quot;the question here is neither one of great art nor even of particularly good taste. It is rather a question of whether American movies are continually to be hamstrung by rules that confine picture themes, picture morals, and picture language to what is deemed fit for children, or for childlike mentalities.— &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, 27 June 1953.&quot;

The film&#x27;s success was instrumental in weakening the influence of the Production Code. On June 27, 1961, the PCA granted both &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), Preminger&#x27;s similarly controversial release, the seals of approval they initially withheld.

==Critical reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed it &quot;is not outstanding, either as a romance or as film. The wit of Mr. Herbert . . . is turned almost wholly on his freeness with the startling idea or phrase, as glibly tossed off (for the most part) by a young lady who appears a wide-eyed child. And Otto Preminger&#x27;s lifting of the play from the stage to the screen is much too rigidly respectful of its conversational form. As a consequence, the movement is restricted and the talk is exceedingly long. At times, it gets awfully tedious, considering its limited range.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an entertaining adult comedy&quot;, which &quot;constantly reminds of its origin, being more a filmed play than a motion picture. But it&#x27;s still entertaining theatre, whether behind the footlights or on celluloid.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;vastly amusing adult entertainment&quot;, adding that &quot;even though the material is spicy and has its delicate moments, it has been handled so adroitly that it is always amusing without ever becoming offensive.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;Flip, frolicsome fun&quot;, adding, &quot;Otto Preminger&#x27;s direction of Herbert&#x27;s own screen play follows the stage action fairly closely, resulting in occasionally static splotches but the feel of flip sophistication is achieved.&quot; Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;this film is likely to induce a goodly share of laughter and have a special appeal to feminine audiences&quot;, but thought it &quot;talks too much for complete satisfaction as a picture.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;deftly constructed and moves along at a bright, brisk pace, peppered with some remarkably funny dialog, which sends audiences into such guffaws that some of the best lines are drowned in a sea of laughter.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; faulted the film for &quot;all sorts of slowdowns ... to permit the principals to give out with their views on life, love and so on. However, as the photograph of a pleasant little comedy, the picture has some merit.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;quite pleasant entertainment;&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine also found the film to be pleasant.

The Catholic Legion of Decency gave the movie a &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Condemned&quot; rating, despite giving the original play a milder &quot;B&quot;, &quot;Unobjectionable for adults&quot; rating. The Catholic Parent-Teacher League condemned the movie. Francis Cardinal Spellman of New York and James Francis Cardinal McIntyre of Los Angeles urged Catholics to avoid the film.

Cardinal Spellman denounced the film on 24 June 1953 as &quot;an occasion of sin&quot; violating &quot;standards of morality and decency.&quot; He said, &quot;This picture was avowedly produced in defiance of the system of self-regulation which the motion picture industry itself has maintained for more than two decades. The producer refused to make any revision of the film and openly spurns the code of the American motion picture industry. I call the attention of Catholics to the pledge of the Legion of Decency, which emphasizes the obligation to avoid attendance at theatres that flaunt indecency by exhibiting such a picture.&quot;

In 1992 the Pacific Film Archive called it &quot;an innocuous sex comedy that talks about bedding down but never turns a sheet&quot; and observed: &quot;the furor surrounding the film leaves the impression that a full-scale orgy had occurred.&quot;

In his review of the DVD release of the film, Tim Purtell of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the film a &quot;trifle&quot; that &quot;seems overly talky and slight&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 46% rating based on nine reviews.

==Awards and nominations==
==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; in 2006.

== In popular culture ==
In 1982, the film was the focus of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode, &quot;The Moon Is Not Blue&quot;. Having heard of the film&#x27;s controversy, Hawkeye Pierce and B.J. Hunnicutt attempt to get a copy of the film shipped to the 4077th in Korea. But when they finally see the film, Hawkeye and B.J. are greatly disappointed as they expected sexually explicit content rather than a few mildly risqué comments. Hawkeye complains that he has never seen a cleaner movie in his life, and when Father Mulcahy points out that one of the characters did say &quot;virgin&quot;, Hawkeye responds, &quot;That&#x27;s because everyone &quot;was&quot;!&quot; 

Otto Preminger&#x27;s brother Ingo Preminger was producer of the theatrical version of &quot;MASH&quot;. In reality, &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; was released nineteen days before the armistice for the Korean War was signed.

<text>Burr: A Novel is a 1973 historical novel by Gore Vidal that challenges the traditional Founding Fathers iconography of United States history, by means of a narrative that includes a fictional memoir by Aaron Burr, in representing the people, politics, and events of the U.S. in the early 19th century. It was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1974. 

&quot;Burr&quot; is chronologically the first book of the seven-novel series &quot;Narratives of Empire&quot;, with which Vidal examined, explored, and explained the imperial history of the United States; chronologically, the six other historical novels of the series are &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1984), &quot;1876&quot; (1976), &quot;Empire&quot; (1987), &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1990), &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (2000).

== Description ==

&quot;Burr&quot; portrays the eponymous anti-hero as a fascinating and honorable gentleman, and portrays his contemporary opponents as mortal men; thus, George Washington is an incompetent military officer, a general who lost most of his battles; Thomas Jefferson is a fey, especially dark and pedantic hypocrite who schemed and bribed witnesses in support of a false charge of treason against Burr, to whom he almost lost in the 1800 United States presidential election; and Alexander Hamilton is a bastard-born, over-ambitious opportunist whose rise was by General Washington&#x27;s hand, until being fatally wounded in the 1804 Burr–Hamilton duel.

The enmities were established when, despite Burr&#x27;s initial victory in the voting, the presidential election of 1800 was a tied vote in the Electoral College, between him and Thomas Jefferson. To break the tied electoral vote, the House of Representatives—dominated by Alexander Hamilton—voted thirty-six times, until they elected Jefferson, and by procedural default named Burr as the vice president.

The contemporary story of political intrigue occurs from 1833 to 1840, in the time of Jacksonian democracy, years after the treason trial. The narrator is Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler, an ambitious young man working as a law clerk in Aaron Burr&#x27;s New York City law firm. Charlie Schuyler is not from a politically-connected family, and is ambivalent about politics and about how law is practiced. Hesitant about taking the examination for admission to the bar, Schuyler works as a newspaper reporter while dreaming of becoming a successful writer so that he can emigrate to Europe.

Important to the intrigues of the plotters are the allegation that Vice President Martin Van Buren is the bastard son of Aaron Burr; the veracity or falsity of that allegation; and its usefulness in high-government politics. Because Van Buren is a strong candidate for the 1836 United States presidential election, his political enemies, especially newspaper publisher William Leggett, enlist Schuyler to glean personally embarrassing facts about Van Buren from the aged Burr, a septuagenarian in 1834.

Tempted with the promise of money, Schuyler considers authoring a pamphlet &quot;proving&quot; that Vice President Van Buren is Burr&#x27;s son, which will end Van Buren&#x27;s career. He becomes torn between honoring Burr, whom he admires, and betraying Burr for the cash that will enable him to take the woman he loves to Europe. At story&#x27;s end, Schuyler has learned more than he expected about Burr, Van Buren, and his own character.

As in the novels &quot;Messiah&quot; (1954), &quot;Julian&quot; (1964), and &quot;Creation&quot; (1981), the colonial people, their times, and the places of &quot;Burr&quot; (1973) are presented through the memoirs of a character in the tale. Throughout the story, the narrative presents thematic parallels to &quot;The Memoirs of Aaron Burr&quot; (1837), co-written with Matthew Livingston Davis. Many of the incidents in &quot;Burr&quot; are historical: Thomas Jefferson was a slaver who fathered children with some of his slave women; the Continental Army General James Wilkinson was a double agent for the Kingdom of Spain; Alexander Hamilton regularly was challenged to duels; and Aaron Burr was tried for and acquitted of treason, consequent to the Burr Plot (1807).

In the &quot;Afterword&quot; to &quot;Burr&quot;, Vidal states that, in most instances, the actions and words of the historical characters represented are based upon their personal documents and historical records. Moreover, besides challenging the traditionalist, mythical iconography of the Founding Fathers of the United States, the most controversial aspect of the novel &quot;Burr&quot; is the unsubstantiated claim that Alexander Hamilton gossiped about Burr and his daughter, Theodosia, practicing incest—which character assassination supposedly led to their duel; killing Hamilton ended the public life of Aaron Burr.

== Narrative frame ==
The novel comprises two storylines. One gives us Charles Schuyler&#x27;s personal and professional perspectives on early mid-19th-century New York, and his coming to know the titular character Aaron Burr in his later, quieter years. The other gives us, by means of Burr&#x27;s recollections as read and recorded by Schuyler, his experience of late eighteenth century British colonial life and the independence struggle or &quot;Revolution&quot; (in the section called 1833); and most substantially, his experience of life in post-Independence New York and his participation in the political development of the American Republic (through the main section of the novel, 1834), thus:
; 1834
* Chapter Ten: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — One
* Chapter Eleven: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Two
* Chapter Twelve: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Three, and Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Four
* Chapter Thirteen: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Five

* Chapter Twenty-one: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Twelve
* Chapter Twenty-five: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Thirteen
* Chapter Twenty-seven: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Fourteen
* Chapter Twenty-eight: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Fifteen
* Chapter Thirty-two: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Sixteen
* Chapter Thirty-four: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Seventeen
* Chapter Thirty-six: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Eighteen

; 1835
* Chapter Two: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Nineteen
* Chapter Five: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Twenty
* Chapter Seven: Memoirs of Aaron Burr — Twenty-one

== List of characters ==
Vidal notes in the novel&#x27;s afterword that each character named therein &quot;actually existed,&quot; with the exception of its narrator, Charlie Schuyler, and William de la Touche Clancey, a thinly veiled satire of longtime Vidal critic William F. Buckley Jr. The sections of the novel that deal with the narrator&#x27;s activity in the 1830s (as opposed to Burr&#x27;s reminiscences of his adventures in the American Revolution through his trial for treason) focus on the political life of New York City during the end of the administration of President Andrew Jackson.

==Reception==
In his review for The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt lauded the novel as a &quot;a tour de force of historical imagination&quot;, praising the plot as a &quot;clever piece of machinery&quot; whilst noting the &quot;rather far-fetched and clumsy denouement&quot;. Writing in the same publication, George Dangerfield took issue with Vidal&#x27;s heavy use of historical details, opining the novel &quot;is far, far better when it is simply being a fantasy&quot;.

Kirkus Reviews praised the novel as &quot;a clever book&quot;, noting the timeliness of its iconoclastic treatment of certain Founding Fathers &quot;considering our mood of national discontent&quot; amid the then-ongoing Watergate scandal.
