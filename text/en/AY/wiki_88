<text>Tafl games (), also known as hnefatafl games, are a family of ancient Northern European strategy board games played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers. Names of different variants of tafl include hnefatafl, tablut, tawlbwrdd, brandubh, Ard Rí, and alea evangelii. Games in the tafl family were played in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Britain, Ireland, and Sápmi. Tafl gaming was eventually supplanted by chess in the 12th century, but the tafl variant of the Sámi people, tablut, was in play until at least the 18th century. The rules for tablut were written down by the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus in 1732, and these were translated from Latin to English in 1811. All modern tafl games are based on the 1811 translation, which had many errors. New rules were added to amend the issues resulting from these errors, leading to the creation of a modern family of tafl games. In addition, tablut is now also played in accordance with its original rules, which have been retranslated.

==Etymology==
English has borrowed the term from (; ), a generic term referring to board games.

 (roughly , plausibly realised as ), became the preferred term for the game in Scandinavia by the end of the Viking Age, to distinguish it from other board games, such as (chess), (tables) and (fox games), as these became known. The specific name possibly arose as meaning &quot;board game of the fist&quot;, from (&quot;fist&quot;) + , where &quot;fist&quot; referred to the central king-piece.

The precise etymology is not entirely certain but certainly referred to the king-piece, and several sources refer to as &quot;king&#x27;s table&quot;. In Anglo-Saxon England, the term also referred to many board games. It is not known if the Anglo-Saxons had a specific name for the game or if they generically referred to it as in the way that modern people might refer to &quot;cards&quot;.

Several games may be confused with games, due to the inclusion of the word in their names or other similarities. is the Old Norse name for fox and geese, a game dating from at least the 14th century. It is still known and played in Europe. is the Old Norse name for tables (the medieval forerunner of backgammon). is the Old Norse name for chess. or (Modern Irish: ) was played in Ireland. The Welsh equivalent was and the Breton equivalent ; all terms mean &quot;wood-sense&quot;. This popular medieval game was played with equal forces on each side and thus was not a variant, but rather may have been the medieval descendant of the Roman game or .

==Variants==
The only variant of tafl where a relatively unambiguous has survived into modern times is tablut, the Sámi variant of the game, which was recorded by Linnaeus during his expedition to Lapland in 1732.

As for the medieval game, no complete, unambiguous description of the rules exists, but the king&#x27;s objective was to escape to (variously) the board&#x27;s periphery or corners, while the greater force&#x27;s objective was to capture him. Although the size of the board and the number of pieces varied, all games involved a distinctive 2:1 ratio of pieces, with the lesser side having a king-piece that started in the centre.

There is some controversy over whether some tafl games (i.e. Hnefatafl and Tawlbwrdd) may have employed dice.
===Alea evangelii===
&quot;Alea evangelii&quot;, which means &quot;game of the gospels&quot;, was described, with a drawing, in the 12th-century Corpus Christi College, Oxford manuscript 122, from Anglo-Saxon England. It was played on the intersections of a board of 18×18 cells. The manuscript describes the layout of the board as a religious allegory, but it is clear that this was a game in the Tafl family.

===Ard Rí===

Ard Rí (Gaelic for &#x27;High King&#x27;) was a Scottish tafl variant played on a 7×7 board with a king and eight defenders against sixteen attackers. This is the least documented of the known tafl variants. One of the generally accepted rules, the king escaping to any edge square and not just to any corner square, gives the defending side an insurmountable advantage. This advantage is so strong that the game is solved, with the king always able to escape and thus the defender will always win.

===Brandubh===

Brandubh (or brandub) () was the Irish form of tafl. From two poems it is known that it was played with five men against eight, and that one of the five was a &quot;Branán&quot;, or chief. A number of 7×7 boards have been found, the most famous being the elaborate wooden board found at Ballinderry in 1932, featuring holes for pegged pieces, possibly to allow for portability of the game. The name &quot;brandubh&quot; means &quot;black raven&quot;.

Original rules were not found, but using these 7×7 boards, the text of the two poems and the tablut rules as a basis, the World Tafl Federation was able to reconstruct balanced rules validated by several tests.

Despite its small size board and the speed of the games, Brandubh offers an undeniable tactical and strategic exercise where the first mistake very often leads to defeat. The small number of pieces means that each of them must often simultaneously defend and attack: it is therefore easy to forget one of these tasks if one focuses too much on the other. As in the great games of Tafl, sacrifices are useful, especially for the defenders, but with only four pieces, it is important not to weaken the king too early in the game.

===Hnefatafl===

Hnefatafl (sometimes now referred to as &quot;Viking chess&quot;) was a popular game in medieval Scandinavia and was mentioned in several of the Norse sagas. Some of these saga references have contributed to controversy over the possible use of dice in playing hnefatafl. The rules of the game were never explicitly recorded, and only playing pieces and fragmentary boards are extant, so it is not known for sure how the game was played. If dice were in fact used, nothing has been recorded about how they were employed. Archaeological and literary sources indicate hnefatafl may have been played on a 13×13 or an 11×11 board.

Hnefatafl became a popular game in Northern Europe during the Viking era (end of the 8th century to 1000 CE), a turbulent time full of conflicts. When chess became a popular game during the Middle Ages, the rules of hnefatafl were forgotten over time. Hnefatafl was particularly popular in Nordic countries and followed the Viking civilization to other parts of Europe, primarily to the British Isles and the Viking country of Garðaríki in what is now part of Russia.

The game developed differently at different locations. Archaeologists have found editions in places such as Ireland and Ukraine. Hnefatafl literally translates to &quot;fist table&quot;, from the Old Norse (equivalently in modern Icelandic) &quot;hnef&quot;, &#x27;fist&#x27;, and &quot;tafl&quot;, &#x27;table&#x27;.

====Modern hnefatafl====
The rules for Norse tafl were lost, but in the 1900s attempts were made to reconstruct the game based on the rules for the Sámi tafl game tablut. The rules for tablut had been written down in the 1700s, and translated from Latin to English in the 1800s (see ). Unfortunately, the rules were poorly translated from Latin and gave unbalanced , mainly due to the mistaken idea that the king must be surrounded on four sides to be captured – instead of two. Different innovations were made to create a game that favoured the defender side less, such as limiting the king&#x27;s escape possibilities to the corners (instead of the entire edge of the board), making the king &quot;weaponless&quot; (unable to participate in capture), making the initial starting points of the attackers inaccessible for the king, and making it easier to capture the king against the corner fields of the board.

Today, many different versions of modern hnefatafl are in play – both online and on physical boards that are sold commercially. One variant used in tournaments is Copenhagen hnefatafl, which also features a &quot;shield wall&quot; mechanism to capture several soldiers at once, and an &quot;exit fort&quot; rule that enables the king to escape on the edge while otherwise being limited to escape in the corners.

===Tablut===

This variant, from Sápmi, is the best documented historical tafl variant. It is unique among tafl games in that it is known to have still been played in the 18th century. It may also have survived into the late 19th century. P. A. wrote that the Sámi played a chess-like game where the pieces were called &quot;Swedes and Russians&quot;, which follows Sámi tafl terminology.

Carl Linnaeus recorded the rules of tablut and a drawing of the board and pieces in his journal, during his 1732 &quot;Expedition to Lapland&quot; where he travelled in the area of the Lule Sámi – along the Lule River on the Swedish side of the border, and in Salten on the Dano-Norwegian side of the border.

The game may have been called something other than tablut by the Sámi, since the word (also rendered ) simply means &quot;to play board games&quot;. Linnaeus likely misunderstood the word describing the general activity as the name of the game. However, tablut has been established as its modern name, since no other name for it is known. For the same reason, another traditional Sámi board game is today called or which similarly just means &quot;game board&quot; and &quot;playing a board game&quot;.

The game was played on a 9×9 mat of embroidered reindeer hide. In his diary, , Linnaeus explained that the players referred to the defending pieces as &quot;Swedes&quot; and the attacking pieces as &quot;Muscovites&quot;. The name of the latter pieces reflect the Grand Duchy of Moscow, a regional rival of Sweden. Linnaeus does not describe the pieces as being differently colored, but his drawing shows that one side&#x27;s pieces are distinguished by being notched (the Muscovites). This way of distinguishing board game pieces is known from other traditional Sámi board games (cf. Sáhkku and Dablo).

 was translated into English in 1811 by James Edward Smith. The translation of the tablut rules (which was done by a Swedish merchant in London, Carl Troilius) had many errors which would become an issue not only for playing tablut, but also for the subsequent attempts to reconstruct other historic tafl games on the basis of the tablut rules. The central mistake in Troilius&#x27; translation is that according to these rules, four attackers are always needed to capture the king, whereas the original rules only demand two, except in special cases. The following rules are based on the modern translations of John C. Ashton (2007), Nicolas Cartier (2011) and Olli Salmi (2013):

====Setup====

*The game is played on a 9×9 board. Initial setup is as shown.
*The king (, modern Lule Sámi ) starts on the central square or castle (Latin: ).
*The eight defenders, called &quot;Swedes&quot;, start on the eight squares adjoining the , in the form of a cross.
*The sixteen attackers, called &quot;Muscovites&quot;, start in groups of four at the centre of each edge of the board, in direct contact with the Swedish &quot;cross&quot;.

====Goal====
*The Swedes win if the king escapes to any of the fields at the edge of the board.
*The Muscovites win if they capture the king.

====Movement and capture====
*Any piece may move any number of vacant spaces in any straight line [←↑→↓], but not diagonally. (Cf. the rook in chess.)
*No piece may ever pass over another piece in its path.
*A player captures an enemy piece and removes it from the board by moving a piece so that the enemy piece becomes surrounded on two opposite sides (horizontally or vertically – not diagonally) by two friendly pieces. The king is also captured in this way, except in a few select cases where he is protected by the castle. A piece may move between, or stop in-between, two enemy pieces without being captured.

====Capturing around the castle====
*When the castle is not occupied by the king, it is &quot;hostile&quot; to all soldiers – attackers and defenders. This means that an enemy soldier may be captured by pinning it (horizontally or vertically) between one of one&#x27;s own piece and the castle.
*If the king is on a square adjoining the castle (horizontally or vertically) he must be surrounded on the three remaining sides by his enemies to be captured.
*If the king is inside the castle, he is not captured until he is surrounded on all four sides.
*If the king is in the castle and surrounded on three sides by attackers, but protected by a defender on the last side, it is possible to capture the last defender by pinning it between an attacker piece and the occupied castle.
*The latter is the only situation in which the attackers may capture a defender against the occupied castle. The defenders may capture an attacker between one of their own and the occupied castle, since the king then participates in capturing.

====Moving through the castle====
*The only unclarity in the modern translation of the tablut rules concerns the castle. Resultantly, tablut is currently played in two variants: In one variant, the castle cannot be entered by any piece, not even the king, once the king has left it. In another variant, the king may re-enter the castle, and both attackers and defenders may pass through it but not stop in it.

====Warning rules====
*If the king should ever have an unimpeded path to the edge of the board, he must call out (modern spelling: ), meaning &quot;opening&quot; or &quot;hole&quot;, and if he has two paths of escape, then he must call out (modern spelling. ) (cf. &quot;check&quot; and &quot;checkmate&quot; in chess).

===Tawlbwrdd===

This variant (pronounced ) was played in Wales. It is described as being played with 8 pieces on the king&#x27;s side and 16 on the attacker&#x27;s side. The rules were taken from an incomplete account of the game by Robert ap Ifan, with a drawing in a manuscript dated 1587, and the gaps were filled in by using Tablut rules. His version was played on an 11×11 board with 12 pieces on the king&#x27;s side and 24 pieces on the opponent&#x27;s side. His passage states:

The above tawlbwrdd should be played with a king in the centre and twelve men in the places next to him, and twenty-four men seek to capture him. These are placed, six in the centre of each side of the board and in the six central positions. And two move the men in the game, and if one [piece] belonging to the king comes between the attackers, he is dead and is thrown out of the game, and the same if one of the attackers comes between two of the king&#x27;s men in the same manner. And if the king himself comes between two of the attackers, and if you say &#x27;Watch your king&#x27; before he moves to that space, and he is unable to escape, you capture him. If the other says &#x27;I am your liegeman&#x27; and goes between two, there is no harm. If the king can go along the [illegible] line, that side wins the game.
===Other modern games in the tafl family===
Certain modern board games not generally referred to as &quot;tafl&quot;, &quot;tablut&quot; or &quot;hnefatafl&quot; have nevertheless been based on tablut rules, or the rules of other tafl games reconstructed on the basis of tablut. They bear significant resemblance to the other tafl games, but with some important differences.

Around 1960, Milton Bradley published &quot;Swords and Shields&quot;, which was essentially Tablut as recorded by Linnaeus and erroneously translated by Troilius, but with the Swedes transformed into shields (with a king shield) and the Muscovites transformed into swords.

&quot;Breakthru&quot; was developed in the 1960s as part of the 3M bookshelf game series. It features tafl-like symmetry, but with twelve defenders plus one &quot;flagship&quot; (cf. &quot;king&quot;) pitted against twenty attackers upon a tiered board, so that the objective of the defenders is to escort the flagship from the centre to the outer zone of the board. Apart from the distinction of the inner zone and outer zone, there are no distinctive spaces on the Breakthru board. Breakthru also features a distinctive double move, whereas no evidence points to such a move in any of the historical games.

&quot;Thud&quot;, a modern game inspired by a series of fantasy novels by Terry Pratchett (which in turn were inspired by the historical tafl games, as reflected in the game&#x27;s Dwarfish name, &quot;Hnaflbaflsniflwhifltafl&quot;), also features the general symmetry of tafl games, although it is played on an octagonal board with only eight defenders pitted against thirty-two attackers. Thud also features a &quot;Thudstone&quot; (cf. &quot;konakis&quot;), but no kingpiece. There are also important differences in the moves and attacks in Thud.

==Balance of play==

There have long been controversies concerning imbalance of the game, as rules for certain modern tafl games strongly favor the defenders. This imbalance results from a mistranslation of Linnaeus&#x27; rules for tablut, a Sámi tafl game from the 1700s, which were subsequently used as the basis for reconstructions of rules for medieval tafl. Newer translations of Linnaeus&#x27; tablut rules reveal a balanced game. After this change, tablut can be said to be slightly in favor of the attackers rather than the defenders: according to statistics, the attackers overall win marginally more often (on average 9% more).

Several rule modifications can produce more balanced play than in the mistranslation of the tablut rules. These include a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), escape to the corners (rather than to the edges), or hostile attacker camps (the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant attacker camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.

One such solution is by bidding: Players take turns bidding on how many moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15 turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14 turns, and the first player, more confident in his ability to escape in 13 rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king&#x27;s side. If that player does not escape within 13 turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.

==In saga literature==

Hnefatafl was mentioned in several of the medieval sagas, including &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, &quot;Friðþjófs Saga&quot;, &quot;the Saga of Hervör and Heidrek&quot;, and others. These three period treatments of Hnefatafl offer some important clues about the game, while numerous other incidental references to &quot;Hnefatafl&quot; or &quot;Tafl&quot; exist in saga literature. Sagas help indicate the widespread use of board games just by mentioning them—although rituals varied in the Viking period from region to region, there were some underlying basics to culture. The fact that the sagas mention board games indicates this use because the sagas are read and understood by a very large audience.

In &quot;Orkeyinga saga&quot;, the notability of Hnefatafl is evident in the nine boasts of Jarl Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, who tops his list with skill at &quot;Tafl&quot;. In &quot;Friðþjófs Saga&quot;, a conversation over a game of Hnefatafl reveals that the king&#x27;s men are red and the attackers white, and that the word &quot;hnefi&quot; does indeed refer to the kingpiece. The most revealing – and yet most ambiguous – clues to Hnefatafl lie in a series of riddles posed by a character identified as Odin in disguise (see Gestumblindi) in &quot;the Saga of Hervör and Heidrek&quot;.

One riddle, as stated in Hauksbók, refers to &quot;the &quot;weaponless&quot; maids who fight around their lord, the [brown/red] ever sheltering and the [fair/white] ever attacking him&quot;, although there is controversy over whether the word &quot;weaponless&quot; refers to the maids or, as in other versions, to the king himself, which may support the argument that a &quot;weaponless king&quot; cannot take part in captures (see Balance of play above). One may also note that the assignment of the colours of brown or red to the defenders and fair or white to the attackers is consistent with &quot;Friðþjófs Saga&quot;.

Another of Gestumblindi&#x27;s riddles asks, &quot;What is that beast all girded with iron, which kills the flocks? He has eight horns but no head, and runs as he pleases.&quot; Here, it is the answer that is controversial, as the response has been variously translated as: &quot;It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name of a bear and runs when he is thrown&quot;; or, &quot;It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked.&quot; The first problem is in translating the word &quot;húnn&quot;, which may refer to a die (as suggested by the former translation), the &quot;eight horns&quot; referring to the eight corners of a six-sided die and &quot;the flocks&quot; that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose. Alternatively, &quot;húnn&quot; may refer to the king, his &quot;eight horns&quot; referring to the eight defenders, which is more consistent with the latter translation, &quot;He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked.&quot; Ultimately, the literary references prove inconclusive on the use of dice in Hnefatafl.

==In archeological finds==
There have been many archeological discoveries of tafl games and gaming pieces found in various Warrior Burials. One example was a wooden board and a single gaming piece made of horn found in a ship burial at Gokstad in southeastern Norway. Another example was twenty-two gaming pieces made of whalebone found in Orkney.

Some finds have occurred in religious sites. A gaming board dated to the 8th century or earlier, was dug up in 2018 at the site of the later Scottish Monastery of Deer. As another example, a small worked glass piece was discovered in 2019 on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, target of a famous Viking raid in 793 A.D. The piece was blue in colour, with swirls etched into the glass, and was topped with small white glass droplets, thought to symbolise a crown. The piece, thought to be a gaming piece for Hnefatafl or a related game, came from a trench that has been dated to the eighth to ninth centuries.

The material used to make both the board game and the gaming pieces has varied: from walrus ivory to bone to amber to wood.

In some boat burials there have been wooden board games found. There have been very few actual boards found in these burials, implying that having these board games included was extremely rare. However, this is believed to be due to wood readily being destroyed by cremation fires or decaying over time.

==Legacy==
The first major attempt to revitalize tafl was the publication of &quot;The Viking Game&quot; in 1981. This was essentially the Sámi game tablut of the 1700s, as mistranslated by Troilius in 1811, and with the modern innovation that the king&#x27;s escape possibilities were limited to the corners. The latter was done in order to compensate for the imbalanced gameplay resulting from the notion that the king must be surrounded on all four sides. In &quot;The Viking Game&quot; the pieces drawn by Linnaeus, which reflected traditional Sámi game piece design (see: Tablut), had been replaced by pieces influenced by Norse medieval aesthetics. The game booklet did not inform players that the rules were drawn from the Sámi game tablut, and claimed that &quot;hnefatafl&quot; was last played &quot;in Lapland in 1732&quot;. The Sámi game terminology such as &quot;raichi&quot;, &quot;tuichu&quot; and &quot;konokis&quot; was also not included in the booklet.

This game did much to spark the interest in tafl games, and also began the modern evolution of the game as players attempted to remedy the game which was still unbalanced in the king&#x27;s favor.

In 2008, Hnefatafl was revived by Peter Kelly in the island of Fetlar in Shetland, where the annual World Quickplay Hnefatafl Championships are now held each summer under the auspices of the Fetlar Hnefatafl Panel. The term &quot;quickplay&quot; refers to the time limit of ten seconds per move, marked by the sounding of a gong. The Fetlar rules were for some time the standard in international hnefatafl play, but have since largely been superseded by Copenhagen Hnefatafl, which builds on Fetlar Hnefatafl.

After the rules for tablut were retranslated and published online (2007–2013), this historical game has also gained in popularity. A tournament was held in England in 2017.

Tafl games can be played online on sites similar to Chess.com. Aage Nielsen created his site in 1998, and currently hosts the World Tafl Federation Hnefatafl Championship Tournament. Another Hnefatafl game site was launched in 2014, by Jacob Teal and John Carlyle. Variants of tafl playable online today include Copenhagen Hnefatafl, Tablut, and many others.

== World Tafl Federation ==
In August 2011 the association &#x27;World Tafl Federation&#x27; was formed, with Tim Millar – Chairman and Adam Bartley – Vice Chairman. Since 2011 the World Tafl Federation has been holding annual world hnefatafl championships.

<doc id="197118" wikidata="Q449580" url="?curid=197118" title="Lynne Thigpen">
<text>Cherlynne Theresa Thigpen (December 22, 1948 – March 12, 2003) was an American actress of stage and screen. She was known for her role as &quot;The Chief&quot; of ACME Crimenet in the game show &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; and various spinoffs, and for her role as &quot;Luna&quot; (The Moon) in the Playhouse Disney children&#x27;s series &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot;. For her varied television work, Thigpen was nominated for six Daytime Emmy Awards. She won a Tony Award in 1997 for portraying Dr. Judith Kaufman in &quot;An American Daughter&quot;, and also played Ella Farmer on &quot;The District&quot; (2000–2003). Thigpen first gained attention for her role in the 1971 off-Broadway musical &quot;Godspell&quot;. Thigpen&#x27;s character is named Lynne, and she sang &quot;O Bless the Lord, My Soul&quot; in the musical. Thigpen reprised her role as Lynne in the 1973 film adaptation, which she starred in alongside David Haskell and Victor Garber.

==Early life and education==
Thigpen was born in the Chicago suburb of Joliet, Illinois to George and Celia (Martin) Thigpen. She obtained a degree in teaching. She taught high school English briefly while studying theatre at the University of Illinois on an acting fellowship.

==Career==
===Stage===

Thigpen moved to New York City in 1971 to begin her career as a stage actress. She had a long and prolific theater career and appeared in numerous musicals including &quot;Godspell&quot;, &quot;The Night That Made America Famous&quot;, &quot;The Magic Show&quot;, &quot;Working&quot;, &quot;Tintypes&quot;, and &quot;An American Daughter&quot; (for which she won her Tony Award for her portrayal of Dr. Judith Kaufman in 1997).

In 1994, Thigpen originated a role in an Adrienne Kennedy short play &quot;Motherhood 2000&quot;, while in 1995, she served as associate artistic director of the acclaimed off-Broadway theater, Circle Repertory Company, while Austin Pendleton served as artistic director.

===Film===

Her first feature film role was as Lynne in &quot;Godspell&quot; (1973), co-starring opposite Victor Garber and David Haskell. Thigpen also portrayed a radio DJ (shown only from the nose down) in Walter Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979), and Leonna Barrett, the mother of an expelled student, in &quot;Lean on Me&quot; (1989), the story of American high school principal Joe Louis Clark. She had a role in the remake of &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000) as the mother of a murder victim, and played the Second President of the World Congress in &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999). Her last film, &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, was released a month after her death and paid tribute to her in the end credits.

===Television===
Thigpen was most known to television audiences for playing &quot;The Chief&quot; in the PBS children&#x27;s geography game show &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, which involved education, humor, and an occasional musical performance. She also reprised her role as The Chief in the successor show &quot;Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;. She also played Luna in the television show &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; and also appeared in many other television series during her career, most notably in a recurring role as Grace Keefer on the ABC daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot; and a supporting role as Ella Mae Farmer, a crime analyst for the Washington, D.C., police department, on the CBS crime drama &quot;The District&quot;. She guest-starred in episodes of &quot;Gimme A Break!&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and was a regular cast member on the short-lived NBC sketch comedy series &quot;The News Is the News&quot;.

===Audio productions===

She appeared in radio skits of the Garrison Keillor program &quot;The American Radio Company of the Air&quot;. Her voice was also heard on over 20 audio books, primarily works with socially relevant themes.

=== Computer games ===

In her association with the &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; television show, Thigpen reprised her role as The Chief in three related computer games. Two were released in 1996: &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (a reboot of the original 1985–1992 game) and &quot;Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; The following year, a video game counterpart to the TV series&#x27; successor show, &quot;Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego,&quot; was released, titled &quot;Carmen Sandiego&#x27;s Great Chase Through Time&quot;. Thigpen recorded hundreds of QuickTime videos for cut-scenes in the games, and generally received praise for her performances in them; in reviewing the 1997 game, David Colker of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; enjoyed the &quot;on-screen presence of actress Lynne Thigpen&quot;, noting that she &quot;brings a winning presence to her role,&quot; while Debbie Maria Leon of the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the urgency of the [confident Chief&#x27;s] voice [gives] enough oomph to make [the player] go scurrying to restore history&quot;.

=== Personal life ===

According to Thigpen, she was a practicing Methodist and a lifelong liberal Democrat. In addition, she never married nor had any children due to the fact that she had no desire to have those titles in her life and did not want to bear the commitments that came with them.

==Death==
Thigpen died of a cerebral hemorrhage on March 12, 2003, in her Marina del Rey, California, home, outside of Los Angeles, after complaining of headaches for several days. The coroner&#x27;s autopsy found &quot;acute cardiac dysfunction, non-traumatic systemic and spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage, and hemorrhage in the brain.&quot; Thigpen was entombed at Elmhurst Cemetery in her hometown of Joliet, Illinois.

===Response and legacy===
Following Thigpen&#x27;s death, the remaining three episodes of the third season of &quot;The District&quot; killed off her character, Ella Mae Farmer.

Thigpen&#x27;s family and friends established a non-profit foundation, The Lynne Thigpen–Bobo Lewis Foundation, to help young actors and actresses learn to survive and succeed in New York theater and to mentor the next generation of Broadway stars.

Thigpen was posthumously nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for voicing Luna the moon in &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot;, but lost to Jeff Corwin for his eponymous wildlife reality series &quot;The Jeff Corwin Experience&quot;. Her final film, &quot;Anger Management&quot;, was dedicated to her memory. An elementary school in Thigpen&#x27;s hometown of Joliet, Illinois, was named for her.

<text>The Battle of the Gabbard, was a naval battle fought from 2 to 3 June 1653 during the First Anglo-Dutch War. It took place near the Gabbard shoal off the coast of Suffolk, England, between fleets of the Commonwealth of England and the Dutch Republic. It resulted in a significant English victory.

==Battle==
The English fleet had 100 ships commanded by Generals at Sea George Monck and Richard Deane and Admirals John Lawson and William Penn. The Dutch had 98 ships under Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp and Vice-admiral Witte de With, divided in five squadrons. On 2 June 1653 the Dutch attacked but were beaten back because the English employed line-of-battle tactics, making the Dutch pay a high price for attempting to board. The Dutch fleet, consisting of lighter ships, was severely damaged and lost two ships.

Tromp&#x27;s fleet was organized mostly for mélée fighting. His ships were crewed with a much greater proportion of soldiers for that purpose than the English, whose methods employed the use of superior heavy guns and with musketry fire. That could overwhelm the enemy’s upper decks, with attention aimed at officers, followed up with grappling and boarding, with the objective of leaving relatively few crewmen below deck who would be committed to manning the cannons. Tromp also relied far more on the use of fireships to finish off damaged or inoperable ships, relying on his superior seamanship and experience to out- maneuver the English so as to concentrate his whole strength against a single division.

On 3 June the English were joined by Admiral Robert Blake, but Tromp decided to try again a direct attack though his ships were practically out of ammunition. A sudden lull however made his ships sitting ducks for the superior English guns. The Dutch were routed, the English chasing them until well in the evening, capturing many Dutch ships. The battle ended with the Dutch losing a total of twenty ships, of which nine were sunk and eleven captured. The English lost no ships, but Deane was killed. Tactically this was the worst defeat in Dutch naval history with the exception of the Battle of Lowestoft. Strategically the defeat threatened to be disastrous.

The victory meant that the English control over the English Channel, regained by the Battle of Portland in March after it had been lost in the Battle of Dungeness, was now extended to the North Sea. After the battle, the English imposed a blockade on the Dutch coast, capturing many merchant ships and crippling the Dutch economy . The fleets met again on 29–31 July 1653 (8–10 August 1653 Gregorian calendar) at the Battle of Scheveningen.

Reports of the battle were read in London with great exclamation. The victorious battle was the first great naval action which England had fought since the reign of Elizabeth I.

<text>Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si), sometimes also known as microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si), is a form of porous silicon. It is an allotropic form of silicon with paracrystalline structure—is similar to amorphous silicon (a-Si), in that it has an amorphous phase. Where they differ, however, is that nc-Si has small grains of crystalline silicon within the amorphous phase. This is in contrast to polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) which consists solely of crystalline silicon grains, separated by grain boundaries. The difference comes solely from the grain size of the crystalline grains. Most materials with grains in the micrometre range are actually fine-grained polysilicon, so nanocrystalline silicon is a better term. The term Nanocrystalline silicon refers to a range of materials around the transition region from amorphous to microcrystalline phase in the silicon thin film. The crystalline volume fraction (as measured from Raman spectroscopy) is another criterion to describe the materials in this transition zone.

nc-Si has many useful advantages over a-Si, one being that if grown properly it can have a higher electron mobility, due to the presence of the silicon crystallites. It also shows increased absorption in the red and infrared wavelengths, which make it an important material for use in a-Si solar cells. One of the most important advantages of nanocrystalline silicon, however, is that it has increased stability over a-Si, one of the reasons being because of its lower hydrogen concentration. Although it currently cannot attain the mobility that poly-Si can, it has the advantage over poly-Si that it is easier to fabricate, as it can be deposited using conventional low temperature a-Si deposition techniques, such as PECVD, as opposed to laser annealing or high temperature CVD processes, in the case of poly-Si.

==Uses==
The main application of this novel material is in the field of silicon thin film solar cells. As nc-Si has about the same bandgap as crystalline silicon, which is ~1.12 eV, it can be combined in thin layers with a-Si, creating a layered, multi-junction cell called a tandem cell. The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nanocrystalline Si.

A few companies are on the verge of commercializing silicon inks based on nanocrystalline silicon or on other silicon compounds. The semiconductor industry is also investigating the potential for nanocrystalline silicon, especially in the memory area.

==Thin-film silicon==
Nanocrystalline silicon and small-grained polycrystalline silicon are considered thin-film silicon.

<doc id="197132" wikidata="Q83275" url="?curid=197132" title="Ziya Gökalp">
<text>Mehmet Ziya Gökalp (born Mehmed Ziya, 23 March 1876 – 25 October 1924) was a Turkish sociologist, writer, poet, and politician. After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution that reinstated constitutionalism in the Ottoman Empire, he adopted the pen name Gökalp (&quot;celestial hero&quot;), which he retained for the rest of his life. As a sociologist, Ziya Gökalp was influential in the negation of Islamism, pan-Islamism, and Ottomanism as ideological, cultural, and sociological identifiers. In a 1936 publication, sociologist Niyazi Berkes described Gökalp as &quot;the real founder of Turkish sociology, since he was not a mere translator or interpreter of foreign sociology&quot;.

Gökalp&#x27;s work was particularly influential in shaping the reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk; his influence figured prominently in the development of Kemalism, and its legacy in the modern Republic of Turkey. Influenced by contemporary European thought, particularly by the sociological view of Émile Durkheim, Gökalp rejected both the Ottomanism and Islamism in favor of Turkish nationalism. He advocated a Turkification of the Ottoman Empire, by promoting Turkish language and culture to all Ottoman citizenry. He found Greeks, Armenians and Jews to be a undesirable foreign body in the national Turkish state. His thought, which popularized Pan-Turkism and Turanism, has been described as a &quot;cult of nationalism and modernization&quot;. His nationalist ideals espoused a de-identification with Ottoman Turkey&#x27;s nearby Arab neighbors, instead advocating for a super-national Turkish (or pan-Turkic) identity with &quot;a territorial Northeast-orientation [to] Turkic peoples&quot;.

==Early life==
Mehmet Ziya was born in Diyarbakır of the Ottoman Empire on 23 March 1876 to Muhammad Tefvik Bey and Zeliha Hanım. He was the second son of the family. He, specifically his maternal family, was of Kurdish origin by some sources. Ziya described his paternal family as Syrian Turkmen. His father was an Ottoman bureaucrat and responsible for publishing the Salname of Diyarbakır. He had a close relationship with his uncle, who would have liked to have seen Ziya marry his daughter. His uncle was religious and opposed Ziya&#x27;s interactions with Abdullah Cevdet, who was an atheist. Diyarbakır was a &quot;cultural frontier&quot;, having been ruled by Arabs and Persians until the 16th century, and featuring &quot;conflicting national traditions&quot; among the local populations of Turks, Kurds, and Armenians. This cultural environment has often been suggested to have informed his sense of national identity; later in his life, when political detractors suggested that he was of Kurdish extraction, Gökalp responded that while he was certain of patrilineal Turkish racial heritage, this was insignificant: &quot;I learned through my sociological studies that nationality is based solely on upbringing.&quot;

Gökalp attempted suicide in early 1895 after an existential crisis caused by his discovery of materialism. Cevdet, who was a doctor, rescued him, which he would lament later as Gökalp became a Turkist ideologue. After attending primary and secondary education in Diyarbakır, he settled in Istanbul, in 1895. There, he attended veterinary school and became involved in underground revolutionary nationalist politics for which he served ten months in prison. He developed relationships with many figures of the revolutionary underground in this period, abandoned his veterinary studies, and became a member of the underground revolutionary group, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP).

==Career==
The revolutionary currents of Constantinople at the time were extremely varied; the unpopularity of the Abdul Hamid II regime had by this time awakened diverse revolutionary sentiment in Constantinople. He inaugurated the first CUP office in Diyarbakır in July 1908. In September 1909 he moved to Selanik, where he became a member of the CUP Central Committee in 1910. There he cofounded a literary and cultural journal, &quot;Genç Kalemler&quot;. While residing in Salonika, Talaat Pasha was often a guest in his house, where they delved into political discussions. It was also during his stay in Selanik that he began using the penname Gökalp and his future role within the CUP was to be determined. In 1912, he moved back to Constantinople, as did the CUP. Gökalp was one of the regular contributors of the political magazine &quot;İslam Mecmuası&quot; from 1914 to 1918 and the military journal &quot;Harp Mecmuası&quot; between 1915 and 1918.

After World War I, he was arrested for his involvement in the Committee of Union and Progress and exiled to Malta for two years between 1919 and 1921.

While exiled on Malta, he continued to write and consolidate his ideas and drafted his &quot;Principles of Turkism&quot;, published in 1923. He returned to Turkey in the spring of 1921, but was not given back his chair at the University of Istanbul. He settled in his hometown of Diyarbakır where he taught sociology and psychology at a secondary school and teacher&#x27;s seminary. He began publishing a small weekly newsletter, &quot;Küçük Mecmua&quot;, which slowly became influential and led to contributions in the major daily newspapers of Istanbul and Ankara. At the end of 1922, Gökalp was invited to direct the department of publication and translation at the Ministry of Education. He was selected to serve as a member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey until his death in 1924, and he served on the Committee for Education which reformed the school system, curriculum and textbooks according to his guidance. He emphasized that the education provided should include Turkism, Modernism and Islamism. Besides Turkish culture and language, he advocated for the inclusion of Persian and Arabic language, the Quran and mathematics, physics and some European languages in the curriculum. Additionally, he participated in the drafting of the 1924 constitution.

Ziya Gökalp was the owner of land which included 5 villages in the northeast of Diyarbakır.

==Personal life and death==
Ziya Gökalp was married, and his daughter was named Hürriyet as a reference to the revolution of the Committee of Union and Progress in 1908. He died on 25 October 1924 in Istanbul, where he went to rest after a short illness in 1924.

== Ideology ==
Gökalp&#x27;s work, in the context of the decline of the Ottoman Empire, was instrumental in the development of Turkish national identity, which he himself referred to even then as &quot;Turkishness&quot;. He believed that a nation must have a &quot;shared consciousness&quot; in order to survive, that &quot;the individual becomes a genuine personality only as he becomes a genuine representative of his culture&quot;. He believed that a modern state must become homogeneous in terms of culture, religion, and national identity. This conception of national identity was augmented by his belief in the primacy of Turkishness, as a unifying virtue. In a 1911 article, he suggested that &quot;Turks are the &#x27;supermen&#x27; imagined by the German philosopher Nietzsche&quot;.His major sociological work was interested in differentiating &quot;Avrupalılık&quot; (&quot;Europeanism&quot;, the mimicking of Western societies) and &quot;Modernlik&quot; (&quot;Modernity&quot;, taking initiative); he was interested in Japan as a model in this, for what he perceived to be its having modernized without abandoning its innate cultural identity. Gökalp suggested that to subordinate &quot;culture&quot; (non-utilitarianism, altruism, public-spiritedness) to &quot;civilization&quot; (utilitarianism, egoism, individualism) was to doom a state to decline: &quot;civilization destroyed societal solidarity and morality&quot;.

Informed by his reading of Émile Durkheim, Gökalp concluded that Western liberalism, as a social system, was inferior to solidarism, because liberalism encouraged individualism, which in turn diminished the integrity of the state. Durkheim, whose work Gökalp himself translated into Turkish, perceived religion as a means of unifying a population socially, and even &quot;religion as society&#x27;s worship of itself&quot;. Durkheim&#x27;s assertion that the life of the group was more important than the life of the individual, this was a concept readily adopted by Gökalp. A well-known newspaper columnist and political figure, Gökalp was a primary ideologue of the Committee of Union and Progress. His views of &quot;nation&quot;, and the ways in which they have informed the development of the modern Turkish state, have made for a controversial legacy. Many historians and sociologists have suggested that his brand of nationalism contributed to the Armenian genocide. His conception of nation was of a &quot;social solidarity&quot; that necessitated &quot;cultural unity&quot;. &quot;Geographic nationalism&quot;, in which everyone living under one political system was a part of the nation, was unacceptable to Gökalp, who conceived of a nation as linguistically and culturally unified. Finally, merely to believe one was a part of a nation, this was not enough, either; one cannot choose to belong to the nation, in his view, as membership in the nation is involuntary.

===&quot;The Principles of Turkism&quot;===
His 1923 &quot;The Principles of Turkism&quot;, published just a year prior to his death, outlines the expansive nationalist identity he had long popularized in his teachings and poetry. The nationalism he espouses entails &quot;a nation [that] is not a racial or ethnic or geographic or political or volitional group but one composed of individuals who share a common language, religion, morality, and aesthetics, that is to say, who have received the same education&quot;.

He proceeds to lay out the three echelons of pan-Turkist identity that he envisions:
* the Turks in the Republic of Turkey, a nation according to cultural and other criteria;
* the Oghuz Turks, referring also to the Turkmens of Azerbaijan, Iran and Khwarizm who... essentially have one common culture which is the same as that of the Turks of Turkey—all these four forming Oghuzistan;
* more distant, Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the Yakuts, Kirghiz, Uzbeks, Kipchaks and Tatars, possessed of a traditional linguistic and ethnic unity, having affinity—but not identity—with the Turkish culture.

The second stage was &quot;Oghuzism&quot;, and the final stage would be the &quot;Turanism&quot; that he and other nationalist poets had been promoting since before World War I. While this broad conception of &quot;Turkishness&quot;, of pan-Turkism, often embraced what Gökalp perceived to be ethnic commonality, he did not disparage other races, as some of his pan-Turkist successors later did.

Stating that the Turkic peoples in old ages were both feminists and democrats, he said that the Pan-Turkism movement and feminism were born together. He based its origins by referring to Shamanism. He described his anti-war attitude on the grounds that the gods of Turkic mythology were also the gods of peace and tranquility.

=== Turkification, Islamization and Westernization ===
For Gökalp the end of the Ottoman Empire marked the end of Pan-Islamism for Turks, who then should concentrate on nationalism but without rejecting their Islamic heritage, which was an integral part of the Turkish identity, nor Western modernity, which he deemed necessary for Turks to compete with other major geopolitical powers, ultimately for Gökalp Turkification, Islamization and Westernization were all legitimate interconnected phenomena as &quot;these three components of the Turkish nation were both complementary and distinct from each other&quot;, as Ahmet Seyhun writes before summarizing Gökalp&#x27;s position: &quot;By Turkifying their culture, the Turks would return to their ancestral ethnic norms. By Islamization, they declare their loyalty to their religion, Islam. Moreover, the author argues that their nationality and their religion would not prevent the Turks to be a part of the Western civilization.&quot;

===Sufism===

Alp Eren Topal, a scholar from Bilkent University, while trying to showcase the originality of Gökalp, and not as someone who only &quot;repeated&quot; European ideas, also talks of the much-neglected influence of Sufism on the thinker: being &quot;a big influence throughout his education and growth&quot;, he lauded its &quot;military&quot; lexicon and came to admire the solidarity found in the Sufi orders, &quot;particularly the Naqshbandiyya&quot;, which not only had spiritual influence, but also a role in the modernization of the Ottoman Empire, while he also appreciated the metaphysics of medieval Andalusian thinker Ibn &#x27;Arabi, saying that his idealism, as system of thought, was superior to that of George Berkeley or Immanuel Kant – who, he says, recycled ideas already known to Ibn &#x27;Arabi, but without taking them too far –, and, far from being &quot;Gnosticism-mysticism or pantheism&quot;, his ideas were pretty contemporary, resonating with those of moderns like Alfred Fouillée, Jean-Marie Guyau, Nietzsche, and William James, concluding that &quot;in all its progression idealist philosophy has not surpassed &#x27;Arabî’s absolute and perfect idealism&quot;.

===Poetic works===
In addition to his sociological and political career, Gökalp was also a prolific poet. His poetic work served to complement and popularize his sociological and nationalist views. In style and content, it revived a sense of pre-Islamic Turkish identity. The protagonist in his &quot;Kızılelma&quot;, the &quot;ideal woman&quot;, suggests: &quot;The people is like a garden, / we are supposed to be its gardeners! / First the bad shoots are to be cut / and then the scion is to be grafted.&quot; She is the teacher at &quot;Yeni Hayat&quot; (&quot;New Life&quot;), where Eastern and Western ideals meet and form a &quot;new Turkish World&quot;.

His poetry departs from his more serious sociological works, though it too harnesses nationalist sentiment: &quot;Run, take the standard and let it be planted once again in Plevna / Night and day, let the waters of the Danube run red with blood...&quot; Perhaps his most famous poem was his 1911 &quot;Turan&quot;, which was first published in &quot;Genç Kalemler&quot; and served to complement his Turanist intellectual output: &quot;For the Turks, Fatherland means neither Turkey, nor Turkestan; Fatherland is a large and eternal country--Turan!&quot; During the First World War, his &quot;Kızıl Destan&quot; (&quot;Red Epic&quot;) called for destroying Russia in the interest of pan-Turkism.

==Legacy==
Ziya Gökalp has been characterized as &quot;the father of Turkish nationalism&quot;, and even &quot;the Grand Master of Turkism&quot;. His thought figured prominently in the political landscape of the Republic of Turkey, which emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire around the time of his death. His influence resonated in diverse ways. For instance, his &quot;Principles of Turkism&quot; had contended that Ottoman classical music was Byzantine in origin; this led to the state briefly banning Ottoman classical music from the radio in the 1930s, because Turkish folk music alone &quot;represented the genius of the nation&quot;.

For popularizing pan-Turkism and Turanism, Gökalp has been viewed alternately as being racist and expansionist, and anti-racist and anti-expansionist. These opposite readings of his legacy are not easily divisible into proponents and detractors, as nationalist elements in Turkey (such as the &quot;Nationalist Movement Party&quot;) have appropriated his work to contend that he supported a physical realization of Turanism, rather than a mere ideological pan-Turkist kinship. Some readings of Gökalp contend, to the contrary, that his Turanism and pan-Turkism were linguistic and cultural models, ideals from which a post-Ottoman identity could be derived, rather than a militant call for the physical expansion of the Republic of Turkey.

Although he often held quite different ideas, Arab nationalist Sati al-Husri was profoundly influenced by Gökalp.

It is claimed that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk once said &quot;Father of my meat and bones is Ali Riza Efendi and father of my thought is Ziya Gökalp&quot;.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was put in jail for having recited a poem by Gökalp in 1997, the poem being considered to be &quot;Islamist&quot; in nature and thus threatening the country&#x27;s secularism.

Gökalp&#x27;s opinion of the Armenian genocide was that &quot;there was no Armenian massacre, there was a Turkish-Armenian arrangement. They stabbed us in the back, we stabbed them back&quot;. This view was widely held among the Young Turks.

The house where he was born has been converted into the Ziya Gökalp Museum in 1956.

<text>Yusuf Akçura (; ; 2 December 1876 – 11 March 1935) was a prominent Turkish politician, writer and ideologist of ethnic Tatar origin. He developed into a prominent ideologue and advocate of Pan-Turkism during the early republican period, whose writings became widely read and who became one of the leading university professors in Istanbul.

== Biography ==

He was born in Simbirsk, Russian Empire to a Tatar family and lived there until he and his mother emigrated to the Ottoman Empire when he was seven. He received primary and secondary education in Constantinople and entered the Harbiye Mektebi (Military College) in 1895. He took up a post in the Erkân-i Harbiye (General Staff Course), a prestigious training programme for the Ottoman military. But in 1896 he was accused of belonging to the Young Turk movement and was exiled to Trablusgarb in Fezzan, Ottoman Libya.

He escaped exile in 1899 and made his way to Paris where he began to emerge as a staunch advocate of Turkish nationalism and Pan-Turkism. There he contributed to &quot;Meşveret&quot;, a periodical published by the exiled members of the Committee of Union and Progress. He returned to Russia in 1903, settling in Zöyebașı beside Simbirsk and began to write extensively on the topic. He garnered most attention for his 1904 work &quot;Üç Tarz-ı Siyaset&quot; (Three Types of Policy), which was originally printed in the Cairo-based magazine &quot;Türk&quot;. The work encouraged the formation of an Ottoman Nation with a citizenship based on Islam and compared such a nation with Germany, Switzerland and France which according to him had also emerged from different races. Further on, he demanded to abandon the multi-ethnic concept of the Ottoman Empire and to focus on the assimilation of the non-Turks. He was one of the co-founders of the Ittifaq al-Muslimin, a Muslim party in Russia. In 1908 he returned to Istanbul where his ideas began to gain more interest after the Young Turk Revolution and the proclamation of the Second Constitutional Era. In 1911 he founded the Türk Yurdu Association together with Ahmet Ağaoğlu, Ali Hüseynzade and others. In November 1911 The association began to publish a magazine bearing its name, &quot;Türk Yurdu&quot;, which sought to become the intellectual force behind Turkish nationalism. In June 1911, he became a leading force within the Turkish Hearths, acting as their Vice-President. 

In 1915 he founded again with Ahmet Ağaoğlu and Ali Hüseynzade the Turco-Tatar Committee (TTC) in Istanbul which had the aim to defend the rights of the Turco-Tatar Muslims in Russia. In June 1916 the TTC sent a delegation to the Conference of Nationalities, but it could not present a united resolution. Every delegate had to represent his nation. Akçura therefore spoke for the Tatars and demanded the same civil, politic and religious rights as the Russian Orthodox and the right to teach in their native tongue. In July 1916 he visited Zurich and made contact with Vladimir Lenin. He wanted to know what the fate of the Turkic peoples would await from the leader of the revolutionaries. In Summer 1917 he was given the task to negotiate the liberation of the Ottoman prisoners in Russia by the Ottoman Red Crescent. He therefore first travelled to Denmark, Sweden and stayed about one year in Russia.

After having accomplished his mission for the Ottoman Red Crescent, he returned to Turkey and joined the newly founded party &quot;Milli Türk Fırkası&quot; in October 1919. Differing from the regime somewhat, he defined the Turkish identity in purely ethnic terms and came to look outside the borders of the country for a kinship with other Turkic peoples. He also called for creation of a national economy and a move away from Islamic values (an area in which he clashed with Ziya Gökalp, as Akçura wanted a secular Turkey, fearing that Pan-Islamism would hinder nationalist development), meaning that he was largely sympathetic to Kemal Atatürk. In 1923 he was elected MP for Istanbul, which he stayed until 1934, when he was elected MP for Kars. In 1932 he became president of the Turkish Historical Society.

He died in Istanbul in 1935. He was laid to rest at the Edirnekapı Martyr&#x27;s Cemetery in Istanbul.

<text>The sand martin (Riparia riparia), also known as collared sand martin or common sand martin, and in the Americas as the bank swallow, is a migratory passerine bird in the swallow family Hirundinidae. It has a wide range in summer, embracing practically the whole Holarctic area, from Europe, across Asia to the Pacific Ocean, and throughout North America. It winters in eastern and southern Africa, southern Asia, and South America.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and originally named &quot;Hirundo riparia&quot;; the description consisted of the simple &quot;H[irundo] cinerea, gula abdomineque albis&quot; (&quot;an ash-grey swallow, with white throat and belly&quot;) and the type locality was simply given as &quot;Europa&quot;, subsequently refined to refer to Linnaeus&#x27;s homeland of Sweden. The specific name means &quot;of the riverbank&quot;; it is derived from the Latin &quot;ripa&quot; &quot;riverbank&quot;.

There are three or four weakly-defined subspecies:
* &quot;R. r. riparia&quot; (syn. &quot;R. r. dolgushini, R. r. innominata, R. r. kolymensis&quot;). Breeds Europe, western Asia, North America; winters Africa, South America.
* &quot;R. r. taczanowskii&quot;. Doubtfully distinct from &quot;R. r. ijimae&quot; and often included in it. Breeds eastern mainland Asia; winters southern Asia.
* &quot;R. r. ijimae&quot;. Breeds Sakhalin, Kuril Islands, and Japan; winters southeast Asia.
* &quot;R. r. shelleyi&quot; (syn. &quot;R. r. eilata&quot;). Slightly smaller and paler than &quot;R. r. riparia&quot;. Breeds Egypt, on passage in southern Israel; wintering area not reported, presumably Africa.

The pale martin &quot;Riparia diluta&quot; of northern India and southeastern China was formerly sometimes included as another subspecies within sand martin. It is smaller, and has paler grey-brown upperparts and a less distinct breast band. It winters in Pakistan, southern India and Sri Lanka.

==Description==
The sand martin is brown above, white below with a narrow brown band on the breast; the bill is black, the legs brown. The young have rufous tips to the coverts and margins to the secondaries.

Its brown back and breast band, white throat, small size and quick jerky flight separate it from similar swallows, such as the common house martin (&quot;Delichon urbicum&quot;), the American cliff swallow (&quot;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota&quot;) and the tree swallow (&quot;Tachycineta bicolor&quot;). The other species of &quot;Riparia&quot; are more similar; the sand martin generally only occurs them in the wintering range, though there is breeding range overlap with pale martin in central Asia, with both species sharing mixed colonies without interbreeding. The banded martin (&quot;Neophedina cincta&quot;) of sub-Saharan Africa is very similar in plumage pattern, but is markedly larger, nearly double the weight.

Measurements:
* Length: 
* Wingspan: 
* Weight: (to before migration)

The song is a continuous gravelly twittering when the birds are on the wing and becomes a conversational undertone after they have settled in the roost. The harsh alarm is heard when a passing falcon, crow or other suspected predator requires combined action to drive it away.

==Ecology==

Linnaeus already remarked on this species&#x27; breeding habits: &quot;Habitat in Europae collibus arenosis abruptis, foramine serpentino&quot; (&quot;it lives in Europe, in winding holes in sheer sandy hills&quot;). It has been observed that sand martins favour loess as a particular type of ground to nest in. Sand martins are generally found near larger bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes or even the ocean, throughout the year.

In Britain, the sand martin is the first of its family to appear on its breeding grounds, arriving from the middle of March, a week or two in advance of the barn swallow. In northern Ohio, they arrive in numbers by mid-April, about 10 days earlier than they did 100 years ago. At first, they flit over the larger bodies of water alone, in search of early flies. Later parties accompany other swallow species, but for a time, varying according to weather, the birds remain at these large waters and do not visit their nesting haunts. The sand martin departs early, at any rate from its more northerly haunts. In August, the gatherings at the nightly roost increase enormously, though the advent and departure of passage birds causes great irregularity in numbers. They are essentially gone from their breeding range by the end of September.

Their food consists of small insects, mostly gnats and other flies whose early stages are aquatic.

The sand martin is sociable in its nesting habits; from a dozen to many hundred pairs will nest close together, according to available space. The nests are at the end of tunnels ranging from a few inches to three or four feet in length, bored in sand or gravel. The actual nest is a litter of straw and feathers in a chamber at the end of the burrow; it soon becomes a hotbed of parasites. Four or five white eggs are laid about mid-late May, and a second brood is usual in all but the most northernly breeding sites.

Globally, it is not rare and classified as a species of least concern (but noted to be decreasing) by the IUCN. It does have some national and local protections, as certain populations have declined or face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. In Canada, it is listed as Threatened under Schedule 1 of the federal &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot; (SARA) due to the loss of 98% of its Canadian population over the past 40 years. They are considered threatened in California, where populations exist in the Sacramento Valley and at two coastal sites, Año Nuevo State Park and Fort Funston.

<text>AWB is the second studio album by the Scottish funk and soul band Average White Band, released in August 1974.

&quot;AWB&quot; topped Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums and Black Albums charts. Its million-selling single &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot; knocked Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot; out of #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. In Canada, the album was #2 for 3 weeks to Elton John&#x27;s Greatest Hits.

A 2004 expanded re-issue from Sony/Columbia in the UK includes a bonus CD with several demo session recordings made before the group joined Atlantic Records – taken from the so-called &quot;Clover Sessions,&quot; recorded at Clover Studios, Los Angeles, CA, in 1973. This album was eventually released as &quot;How Sweet Can You Get?&quot;

<text>Georgy Timofeyevich Beregovoy (, ; 15 April 1921 – 30 June 1995) was a Soviet cosmonaut who commanded the space mission Soyuz 3 in 1968. From 1972 to 1987, he headed the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.

At the time of his space flight, Beregovoy was 47 years of age: he was the earliest-born human to go to orbit, being born three months and three days earlier than the second earliest-born man in orbit – John Glenn, but later than X-15 pilot Joe Walker who made 2 (or 3, according to USAF definition) suborbital space flights.

==Background==
Beregovoy was born on 15 April 1921 in Fedorivka, Poltava Oblast, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Ukraine). His father worked as a telegraph operator on the railways. He had two older brothers; the eldest, Viktor, also became a pilot and the younger, Mikhail, an officer in the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Viktor was caught in the Great Purge of the late 1930s, and was arrested and executed in 1938. He was subsequently rehabilitated. Georgy graduated from a school in 1938 at Yenakieve, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. He joined the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) in 1941, and was soon assigned to a ground-attack unit flying the Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Shturmovik&quot;. He flew some 185 combat sorties during the course of World War II and rose quickly through the ranks, finishing the war as a captain and squadron commander. His corps commander was then-colonel Nikolai Kamanin, a celebrated polar aviator and a future head of the cosmonaut training in the Soviet space program, which would turn important later.

Following the war, he became a test pilot, and over the next sixteen years test-flew some sixty different aircraft, rising to the rank of colonel and the position of deputy chief of the air force&#x27;s flight-testing department. In 1962, he applied and was accepted for cosmonaut training, sponsored by his former WWII commander, General Kamanin, who was the head of the cosmonaut training at the time.

In 1956 he graduated from the Air Force Academy.

==Cosmonaut career==

In 1965, Colonel Beregovoy was scheduled to fly the following year in Voskhod 3, but the mission was never launched.

On 25 October 1968 Beregovoy took the Soyuz 3 into outer space: he orbited the Earth for almost four days at an altitude of up to 252 km. As part of his mission, Beregovoy twice maneuvered his craft into rendezvous positions with the uncrewed Soyuz 2 satellite but was unable to establish a direct physical link to the craft before returning on 30 October 1968.

Nonetheless, Beregovoy&#x27;s flight was in some ways an encouraging success for the Soviet crewed space program, and the colonel was celebrated as a hero upon his return. Soyuz 3 was Beregovoy&#x27;s only spaceflight and soon after it he retired from active duty, having been promoted to Major General.

==Later life==
At a public ceremony in honor of the Soviet cosmonaut team, Beregovoy was lightly wounded during the 1969 assassination attempt upon Leonid Brezhnev.

In October 1969, Konstantin Feoktistov and Georgi Beregovoi traveled as guests of NASA throughout the US, visiting any city they chose and the Disneyland amusement park in California - they were joined on the trip by US astronauts as hosts, including Eugene Cernan, Neil Armstrong and others. Kirk Douglas and others hosted receptions for them in Hollywood - they were protected by Special Agents of the US State Department on request of NASA. Almost every place they went when accompanied by Eugene Cernan, if a band was present the song &quot;Fly Me To The moon&quot; was played - when they visited Disney Park they enjoyed the ride Trip To The Moon, then joked with the US Astronauts that they went to Disneyland and not the moon. It was a trip that all enjoyed and international friendships were made.

Beregovoy took up a position at the Centre for Cosmonaut Training, and in 1972 was made Director of that facility.

He is a consultant for the film directed by Arvazd Peleshyan &quot;Our Century&quot; (1983).

After retirement, Beregovoy became a Soviet parliament member representing the Donbas region of the Ukrainian SSR. In this capacity, he reportedly helped Viktor Yanukovych to start a new life, getting his two criminal convictions expunged from the court records. Many years later, Yanukovych became prime minister and then president of modern independent Ukraine.

Georgy Beregovoy died during heart surgery on 30 June 1995, and is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

==Honours and awards==
Beregovoy was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union twice, the first time on 26 October 1944, for his military service during World War II, and a second time for his space flight. He was the only Soviet cosmonaut who undertook space flight being the Hero of the Soviet Union (the highest Soviet distinction) for a previous achievement unrelated to space travel.

At the Federation&#x27;s 62nd general conference held in Helsinki, Finland, Beregovoy was awarded the first &quot;Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal&quot; for achievements in space; Finnish President Urho Kekkonen was the honorary presenter on July 14, 1968. The award was a new design created in memory of Gagarin who had died the previous March, and it continues to be awarded to this day.

<text>Australian Securities Exchange Ltd (ASX) is an Australian public company that operates Australia&#x27;s primary securities exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange (sometimes referred to outside of Australia as, or confused within Australia as, the Sydney Stock Exchange, a separate entity). The ASX was formed on 1 April 1987, through incorporation under legislation of the Australian Parliament as an amalgamation of the six state securities exchanges, and merged with the Sydney Futures Exchange in 2006.

Today, ASX has an average daily turnover of A$4.685 billion and a market capitalisation of around A$1.6 trillion, making it one of the world&#x27;s top 20 listed exchange groups, and the largest in the southern hemisphere.

ASX Clear is the clearing house for all shares, structured products, warrants and ASX Equity Derivatives.

== Overview ==

;Regulation

The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) has responsibility for the supervision of real-time trading on Australia&#x27;s domestic licensed financial markets and the supervision of the conduct by participants (including the relationship between participants and their clients) on those markets. ASIC also supervises ASX&#x27;s own compliance as a public company with ASX Listing Rules.

ASX Compliance is an ASX subsidiary company that is responsible for monitoring and enforcing ASX-listed companies&#x27; compliance with the ASX operating rules.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has oversight of the ASX&#x27;s clearing and settlement facilities for financial system stability.

;Products

Products and services available for trading on ASX include shares, futures, exchange traded options, warrants, contracts for difference, exchange-traded funds, real estate investment trusts, listed investment companies and interest rate securities.

The biggest stocks traded on the ASX, in terms of market capitalisation, include BHP, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Telstra, Rio Tinto, National Australia Bank and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group.

The major market index is the S&amp;P/ASX 200, an index made up of the top 200 shares in the ASX. This supplanted the previously significant All Ordinaries index, which still runs parallel to the S&amp;P ASX 200. Both are commonly quoted together. Other indices for the bigger stocks are the S&amp;P/ASX 100 and S&amp;P/ASX 50.

== History ==


The origins of the ASX date back to the mid-1800s when six separate exchanges were established in Australia&#x27;s state capital cities of Melbourne, Victoria, (1861), Sydney, New South Wales (1871), Hobart, Tasmania (1882), Brisbane, Queensland (1884), Adelaide, South Australia (1887) and Perth, Western Australia (1889, the Stock Exchange of Perth). A further exchange in Launceston, Tasmania, merged into the Hobart exchange.

In November 1903 the first interstate conference was held to coincide with the Melbourne Cup. The exchanges then met on an informal basis until 1937 when the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE) was established, with representatives from each exchange. Over time the AASE established uniform listing rules, broker rules, and commission rates.

Trading was conducted by a call system, where an exchange employee called the names of each company and brokers bid or offered on each. In the 1960s this changed to a post system. Exchange employees called &quot;chalkies&quot; wrote bids and offers in chalk on blackboards continuously, and recorded transactions made.

The ASX (Australian Stock Exchange Limited) was formed in 1987 by legislation of the Australian Parliament which enabled the amalgamation of six independent stock exchanges that formerly operated in the state capital cities. After demutualisation, the ASX was the first exchange in the world to have its shares quoted on its own market. The ASX was listed on 14 October 1998. On 7 July 2006 the Australian Stock Exchange merged with SFE Corporation, holding company for the Sydney Futures Exchange.

=== Timeline of significant events ===
1861: Ten years after the official advent of the Gold Rush, Australia&#x27;s first stock exchange was formed in Melbourne. In the 1850s Victoria was Australia&#x27;s gold mining centre, its population increasing from 80,000 in 1851 to 540,000 in 1861.

1871: Thirty years after it lit the first gas street light in Sydney, the Australian Gas Light Company took its place in history again, becoming the second company to list on the Sydney Stock Exchange.

1885: Two years after the Broken Hill Mining Company (private company) was established by a syndicate of seven men from the Mount Gipps Station, the company was incorporated to become the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP). In 1885, BHP listed on the Melbourne Stock Exchange.

1937: The Australian Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE) was established in 1937. Since 1903 the state stock exchanges had met on an informal basis, but in 1936 Sydney took the lead in formalising the association. Initially this involved the exchanges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Sydney. Melbourne and Perth joined soon after. Through the AASE the exchanges gradually brought in common listing requirements for companies and uniform brokerage and other rules for stockbroking firms. They also set the ground rules for commissions and the flotation of government and semi-government loan raisings.

1938: Publication of the first share price index.

1939: Sydney Stock Exchange closed for the first time due to the declaration of World War II.

1960: Sydney Futures Exchange began trading as Sydney Greasy Wool Futures Exchange (SGWFE). Its original goal was to provide Australian wool traders with hedging facilities in their own country. SGWFE offered a single contract of greasy wool that by the end of the year had traded 19,042 lots.

1969–1970: The Poseidon bubble (a mining boom triggered by a nickel discovery in Western Australia) caused Australian mining shares to soar and then crash, prompting regulatory recommendations that ultimately led to Australia&#x27;s national companies and securities legislation.

1976: The Australian Options Market was established, trading call options.

1980: The separate Melbourne and Sydney stock exchange indices were replaced by Australian Stock Exchange indices.

1984: Brokers&#x27; commission rates were deregulated. Commissions have gradually fallen ever since, with rates today as low as 0.12% or 0.05% from discount internet-based brokers.

1984: Sydney Stock Exchange closed due to heavy rain and flooding on 9 November 1984 with 70 millimetres of rain falling in one half-hour. All trading on the floor of the Sydney Exchange was suspended throughout Friday. Damage totaled $2 million and repairs took more than six months, with new carpet laid and cables and computers replaced.

Stockbrokers who had taken advantage of joint access were able to trade on the Melbourne Stock Exchange. And, with the Sydney trading floor closed by floodwaters, the Melbourne Exchange enjoyed its busiest trading day for the year. After that episode a back-up site was established outside the Sydney CBD.

1987: The Australian Stock Exchange Limited (ASX) was formed on 1 April 1987, through incorporation under legislation of the Australian Parliament. The formation of the national stock exchange involved the amalgamation of the six independent stock exchanges that had operated in the states&#x27; capital cities.

Launch of the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It was a far cry from the original system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It was replaced by the &#x27;post&#x27; system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on &#x27;posts&#x27; or &#x27;boards&#x27;. &#x27;Chalkies&#x27; were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1987.

1990: A warrants market was established.

1993: Fixed-interest securities were added (see Interest rate market below). Also in 1993, the FAST system of accelerated settlement was established, and the following year the CHESS system (see Settlement below) was introduced, superseding FAST.

1994: The Sydney Futures Exchange announced trading in futures over individual ASX stocks. The ASX responded with the Low Exercise Price Option or LEPO (see below). The SFE went to court, claiming that LEPOs were futures and therefore that the ASX could not offer them. The court held they were options and so LEPOs were introduced in 1995.

1995: Stamp duty on share transactions was halved from 0.3% to 0.15%. The ASX had agreed with the Queensland State Government to locate staff in Brisbane in exchange for the stamp duty reduction there, and the other states followed suit so as not to lose brokerage business to Queensland. In 2000 stamp duty was abolished in all states as part of the introduction of the GST.

1996: The exchange members (brokers etc.) voted to demutualise. The exchange was incorporated as ASX Limited and in 1998 the company was listed on the ASX itself, with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission enforcing the listing rules for ASX Limited.

1997: Electronic trading commences as the option market moves from floor to screen. A phased transition to the electronic CLICK system for derivatives began.

1998: ASX demutualised to become a listed company. It was the first exchange in the world to demutualise and list on its own market, a trend that has been imitated by several other exchanges over the years. The Australian Mutual Provident Society began in 1849 as an organisation offering life insurance. Now known as AMP it became a publicly listed company on the ASX in 1998.

2000: In October, ASX acquires a 15% stake in the trading and order management software company IRESS (formerly BridgeDFS Ltd).

2001: Stamp duty on marketable securities abolished.

2006: The ASX announced a merger with the Sydney Futures Exchange, the primary derivatives exchange in Australia.

== Trading systems ==

ASX Group has two trading platforms – ASX Trade, which facilitates the trading of ASX equity securities and ASX Trade24 for derivative securities trading.

All ASX equity securities are traded on screen on ASX Trade. ASX Trade is a NASDAQ OMX ultra-low latency trading platform based on NASDAQ OMX&#x27;s Genium INET system, which is used by many exchanges around the world. It is one of the fastest and most functional multi-asset trading platforms in the world, delivering latency down to ~250 microseconds.

ASX Trade24 is ASX global trading platform for derivatives. It is globally distributed with network access points (gateways) located in Chicago, New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Melbourne. It also allows for true 24-hour trading, and simultaneously maintains two active trading days which enables products to be opened for trading in the new trading day in one time zone while products are still trading under the previous day.

;Opening times

The normal trading or business days of the ASX are week-days, Monday to Friday. ASX does not trade on national public holidays: New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January), Australia Day (26 January, and observed on this day or the first business day after this date), Good Friday (that varies each year), Easter Monday, Anzac day (25 April), King&#x27;s Birthday (June), Christmas Day (25 December) and Boxing Day (26 December).

On each trading day there is a pre-market session from 7:00am to 10:00am Sydney time and a normal trading session from 10:00am to 4:00pm Sydney time. The market opens alphabetically in Single-price auctions, phased over the first ten minutes, with a small random time built in to prevent exact prediction of the first trades. There is also a single-price auction between 4:10pm and 4:12pm to set the daily closing prices.

== Settlement ==

Security holders hold shares in one of two forms, both of which operate as uncertificated holdings, rather than through the issue of physical share certificates:

* Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (CHESS). The investor&#x27;s controlling participant (normally a broker) sponsors the client into CHESS. The security holder is given a &quot;holder identification number&quot; (HIN) and monthly statements are sent to the security holder from the CHESS system when there is a movement in their holding that month.
* Issuer-sponsored. The company&#x27;s share register administers the security holder&#x27;s holding and issues the investor with a security-holder reference number (SRN) which may be quoted when selling.

Holdings may be moved from issuer-sponsored to CHESS or between different brokers by electronic message initiated by the controlling participant.

== Short selling ==
Short selling of shares is permitted on the ASX, but only among designated stocks and with certain conditions:

* ASX trading participants (brokers) must report all daily gross short sales to ASX. The report will aggregate the gross short sales as reported by each trading participant at an individual stock level.
* ASX publishes aggregate gross short sales to ASX participants and the general public.

Many brokers do not offer short selling to small private investors. LEPOs can serve as an equivalent, while contracts for difference (CFDs) offered by third-party providers are another alternative.

In September 2008, ASIC suspended nearly all forms of short selling due to concerns about market stability during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The ban on covered short selling was lifted in May 2009.

Also, in the biggest change for ASX in 15 years, ASTC Settlement Rule 10.11.12 was introduced, which requires the broker to provide stocks when settlement is due, otherwise the broker must buy the stock on the market to cover the shortfall. The rule requires that if a Failed Settlement Shortfall exists on the second business day after the day on which the Rescheduled Batch Instruction was originally scheduled for settlement (that is, generally on T+5), the delivering settlement participant must either:
* close out the Failed Settlement Shortfall on the next business day by purchasing the number of Financial Products of the relevant class equal to the shortfall; or
* acquire under a securities lending arrangement the number of Financial Products of the relevant class equal to the shortfall and deliver those Financial Products in Batch Settlement no more than two business days later.

== Options ==

Options on leading shares are traded on the ASX, with standardised sets of strike prices and expiry dates. Liquidity is provided by market makers who are required to provide quotes. Each market maker is assigned two or more stocks. A stock can have more than one market maker, and they compete with one another. A market maker may choose one or both of:

* Make a market continuously, on a set of 18 options.
* Make a market in response to a quote request, in any option up to 9 months out.

In both cases there is a minimum quantity (5 or 10 contracts depending on the shares) and a maximum spread permitted.

Due to the higher risks in options, brokers must check clients&#x27; suitability before allowing them to trade options. Clients may both take (i.e. buy) and write (i.e. sell) options. For written positions, the client must put up margin.

== Interest rate market ==
The ASX interest rate market is the set of corporate bonds, floating rate notes, and bond-like preference shares listed on the exchange. These securities are traded and settled in the same way as ordinary shares, but the ASX provides information such as their maturity, effective interest rate, etc., to aid comparison.

== Futures ==

The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) was the 10th largest derivatives exchange in the world, providing derivatives in interest rates, equities, currencies and commodities. The SFE is now part of ASX and its most active products are: 
*SPI 200 Futures – Futures contracts on an index representing the largest 200 stocks on the Australian Stock Exchange by market capitalisation.
*AU 90-day Bank Accepted Bill Futures – Australia&#x27;s equivalent of T-Bill futures.
*3-Year Bond Futures – Futures contracts on Australian 3-year bonds.
*10-Year Bond Futures – Futures contracts on Australian 10-year bonds.

The ASX trades futures over the ASX 50, ASX 200 and ASX property indexes, and over grain, electricity and wool. Options over grain futures are also traded.

== Market indices ==

The ASX maintains stock indexes concerning stocks traded on the exchange in conjunction with Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s. There is a hierarchy of index groups called the S&amp;P/ASX 20, S&amp;P/ASX 50, S&amp;P/ASX 100, S&amp;P/ASX 200 and S&amp;P/ASX 300, notionally containing the 20, 50, 100, 200 and 300 largest companies listed on the exchange, subject to some qualifications.

== Sharemarket Game ==
The ASX Sharemarket Game gives members of the public and secondary school students the chance to learn about investing in the sharemarket using real market prices. Participants receive a hypothetical $50,000 to buy and sell shares in 150 companies and track the progress of their investments over the duration of the game.

== Merger talks with SGX ==
In 2010 the ASX was in merger talks with Singapore Exchange (SGX). While there was an initial expectation that the merger would have created a bourse with a market value of US$14 billion, this was a misconception; the final proposal intended that the ASX and SGX bourses would have continued functioning separately. The merger was blocked by Treasurer of Australia Wayne Swan on 8 April 2011, on advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board that the proposed merger was not in the best interests of Australia.

<text>Cabramatta, also abbreviated as Cabra, is a suburb in South Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Cabramatta is located south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Fairfield.

Cabramatta has been a melting pot for Southeast Asian and European peoples in the latter half of the 20th century. Initially, since the 1980s, Cabramatta has been a centre and community for the Vietnamese, as well as many residents from other Asian origins. Because of its high Vietnamese population, the suburb has earned the nickname &#x27;Little Saigon&#x27;.

==Cabramatta==

===History: European settlement and Asian immigration===
In 1795, an early settler named Hatfield called the area &#x27;Moonshine Run&#x27; because it was so heavily timbered that moonshine could not penetrate. The name Cabramatta first came into use in the area in the early 19th century when the Bull family named a property they had purchased &#x27;Cabramatta Park&#x27;. When a small village formed nearby in 1814, it took its name from that property. A township grew from this village, and a railway was built through Cabramatta in the 1850s. It was used for loading and unloading freight and livestock. The railway station was not open for public transport until 1856; a school was established in 1882, and a post office in 1886. Cabramatta remained a predominantly agricultural township.

It developed a close community relationship with neighbouring Canley Vale, and until 1899, they shared a common municipality. In 1948, Cabramatta&#x27;s local government merged with the neighbouring City of Fairfield, and today remains governed by the Fairfield City Council. It evolved into a Sydney suburb in the mid 20th century, partly as the result of a major state housing project in the nearby Liverpool area in the 1960s that in turn swallowed Cabramatta. The presence of a migrant hostel alongside Cabramatta High School was decisive in shaping the community in the post-war period. In the first phase, large numbers of post-war immigrants from Europe passed through the hostel and settled in the surrounding area during the 1950s and 1960s. They satisfied labour demand for surrounding manufacturing and construction activities, and eventually gave birth to a rapidly growing population in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The entrepreneurs were developing local enterprises.

In the 1980s, Cabramatta and the surrounding Fairfield area was characterised by a diversity of Australian-born children having migrant parents. Cabramatta High School was statistically the most diverse and multicultural school in Sydney, and a study showed that only 10% of children had both parents born in Australia. While many other parts of Sydney had their particular ethnic flavour, Cabramatta was something of a melting pot.

During the 1980s, many of these migrant parents and their children – now young adults – were to settle and populate new housing developments in surrounding areas such as Smithfield and Bonnyrigg that were, until that time, market gardens or semi-rural areas owned by the previous generation. In the 1960s and 1970s, the migrant hostel – along with its peer in Villawood – hosted a second wave of migration: this time from south-east Asia as a result of the Vietnam War. During the 1980s, Cabramatta was transformed into a thriving Asian community, displacing many of the previous migrant generation. The students of local Cabramatta High School represented all manner of people with Asian or European descent. By the early 1980s migration to Cabramatta declined, and as a result the migrant hostel and its many hundreds of small empty apartments lay prey to vandalism. Only the language school remained: it continued to teach English as a Second Language, until the entire hostel site was demolished and redeveloped into residential housing. A walk through the hostel before its demolition would have revealed closed and boarded-up corrugated iron buildings once home to kitchens, washing facilities, administration and so forth.

==Central business district (CBD)==
Freedom Plaza is located within the Cabramatta CBD and forms the pedestrian mall between John Street and Arthur Street. The Pai Lau or gateway forms the main ornamental feature of Freedom Plaza and symbolises harmony and multiculturalism. It was opened in 1991 by Nick Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales at the time, as part of Lunar New Year celebrations.

Dutton Plaza, a three-storey building located centrally within the Cabramatta CBD, was opened in June 2016. The Fairfield City Council funded and owned retail development replaced an existing Council owned at-grade car park and amenities building, with all income from the new development to be invested in community projects. The development comprises 31 retail premises and amenities on the ground floor, four offices on the first floor, and 275 car spaces on the first and second floors. The public open space fronting the main entrance on the eastern side of the plaza was named Gough Whitlam Place, in honour of Gough Whitlam who represented Cabramatta as the Member for Werriwa from 1952 to 1978.

In addition to plazas, the suburb features a number of arcades and lanes that contain retail stores, eateries and cafes. Such passageways include Belvedere Arcade, Dutton Lane, Ingal Way and Viet Hoa Arcade, among others.

The main public park in Cabramatta is Cabravale Park, which mainly fronts Railway Parade, but is also bordered by Park and McBurney Roads and Bartley Street. Cabravale Park contains children&#x27;s play equipment, fitness equipment, a basketball court and seating. The park underwent a major upgrade in 2009 as part of Fairfield City Council&#x27;s Parks Improvement Program. The park also serves as a war memorial. A heritage-listed bandstand, built in 1922 to honour the soldiers who lost their lives fighting in the First World War, is located near the centre of the park. The Vietnam War Comradeship Memorial, a monument containing a fountain and pond centred upon a bronze statue of two soldiers, is located near the main entrance of the park on Railway Pde. The monument was built to commemorate the comradeship between Australian and Vietnamese soldiers during the Vietnam War.

<doc id="197158" wikidata="Q383946" url="?curid=197158" title="Lao people">
<text>The Lao people are a Tai ethnic group native to Southeast Asia, primarily inhabiting Laos and northeastern Thailand. They speak the Lao language, part of the Kra–Dai language family, and are the dominant ethnic group in Laos. Significant Lao communities also reside in Thailand’s Isan region, where they form a regional majority, as well as in smaller numbers in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. 

Culturally and linguistically, the Lao share close ties with other Tai peoples, particularly the Thai. The Isan people of Thailand, for instance, are ethnically Lao but nationally Thai. Theravada Buddhism is central to Lao identity, shaping cultural practices and social norms, though animist traditions persist, especially in rural communities. This syncretism reflects a blend of indigenous beliefs and Buddhist influences.

Historically, the terms &quot;Lao&quot; and &quot;Laotian&quot; were used ambiguously in Western contexts. Before Laos gained independence from France in 1953, both terms often referred broadly to all inhabitants of the region. Post-independence, &quot;Lao&quot; typically denotes the ethnic group, while &quot;Laotian&quot; refers to any citizen of Laos, regardless of ethnicity. However, inconsistent usage persists internationally, with some sources conflating the terms. The Lao people trace their historical roots to the Lan Xang Kingdom (14th–18th century), a major Southeast Asian power that solidified their cultural and political identity.

==Names==
The etymology of the term &quot;Lao&quot; remains uncertain, although it is potentially connected to ethnic groups identified as the &quot;Ai Lao&quot; (Lao: , Thai: อ้ายลาว, , Vietnamese: Ai Lao) mentioned in Han dynasty historical records residing in what is now Yunnan Province. Tribes descended from the Ai Lao included the Tai tribes that migrated to Southeast Asia.

According to the French linguist Michel Ferlus (2009), the ethnonym and autonym of the Lao people (ລາວ); nationality of the inhabitants of Laos is formed by the monosyllabization of the Austroasiatic etymon for &#x27;human being&#x27; *k.raw. The peoples named Lao (lǎo 獠), supposed to be the ancestors of Lao and some other Tai-Kadai populations, settled in the upper Tonkin and in parts of Yúnnán and Guìzhōu during the Táng times:

This reconstruction of the pronunciation for the phonogram 獠 confirms that &#x27;Lao&#x27; originates in the etymon *k.raːw.

The English word &quot;Laotian&quot;, used interchangeably with Lao in most contexts, comes from French &quot;laotien/laotienne&quot;. The dominant ethnicity of Northeastern Thailand who descend from the Lao are differentiated from the Lao of Laos and by the Thais by the term Isan people or &quot;Thai Isan&quot; (Lao: , Isan: ไทยอีสาน, ), a Sanskrit-derived term meaning &quot;northeast&quot;, but &#x27;Lao&#x27; is still used.

==Subdivisions of the Lao people==
In Laos, little distinction is made between the Lao and other closely related Tai peoples with mutually intelligible languages who are grouped together as &quot;Lao Loum&quot; or &#x27;Lowland Lao&#x27; (Lao: &quot;láːu lūm &quot;, Thai: ลาวลุ่ม, IPA: laːw lum). Most of these groups share many common cultural traits and speak dialects or languages that are very similar, with only minor differences in tones, vocabulary, and pronunciation of certain words, but usually not enough to impede conversation, but many of these groups, such as the Nyaw and Phuthai consider themselves distinct, and often have differences in clothing that distinguish them.

==History==

===Tai Migration Period===


Early Chinese records employed the term Yue to denote the non-Han Chinese people south of the Yangtze. During the Spring and Autumn period (770-475 BC), the term was applied to a state on the southeast coast which was destroyed in 334 BC as the Han Chinese moved across the Yangtze and into the south. Subsequently, the term “Hundred Yue” was applied generically to the subjugated non-Han Chinese peoples in the south, with modifiers to denote groups in different locations or with some other distinguishing characteristics (Phomphan 1988). The term Yue fades from usage around 0 AD as the Chinese gained more knowledge of the southern peoples and began using other descriptors (Barlow 2001, chs. 1–2; Taylor 1983, 41–4). None of the modern terms used for Tai groups can be detected in these descriptors except Lao or Ai Lao people, which was applied to a variety of groups, mostly Hill-dwellers (Taylor 1983, 172; Cholthira 2001, 22–4).

This indicates that the Lao are at the very least a Proto-Tai group; perhaps even that all Tai groups are actually subgroups of these ancient Lao people, as there are no descriptors to indicate the existence of any group called Tai living south of the Yangtze, subsequently the first references of a group called Tai appeared in the 13th centuries, no such references of a group called or calling themselves Tai seem to exist.

Other indicators that these early Proto-Tai groups called themselves Lao people can be seen in the Chronicles of the Tai Dam or Black Tai people, “Returning along Mae Nam Taav (The Red river) as promised, the expedition passed through near today’s border of China and Vietnam, To mark their arrival, they named the area Lao Cai, which means “where the Lao passed over.” Lao Cai is now a province in Northwest Vietnam. Also, about 5 kilometers north of Lao Cai, there is a town still named “Lao Phan” which means “where the Lao passed through.” Some Tai people still live there” (G.E. Hall, A History of SEA (1981))

According to a shared legend amongst various Tai tribes, a possibly mythical king, Khun Borom Rachathiriat of Mueang Then (, เมืองแถน, ) begot several sons that settled and ruled other mueang, or city-states, across South-East Asia and southern China. Descended from ancient peoples known to the Chinese as the Yue and the Ai Lao, the Tai tribes began migrating into Southeast Asia by the beginning of the 1st millennium, but large-scale migrations took place between the 7th and 13th centuries AD, especially from what is now Sipsongbanna, Yunnan Province and Guangxi. The possible reasons that actuated Tai migration include migratory pressures stemmed from Han Chinese expansionism, Mongol invasions and incursions into Southeast Asia, the area&#x27;s temperate climate and suitable land for wet rice cultivation, in addition to the fall of states that the Tais inhabited. According to linguistic and other historical evidence, Tai-speaking tribes migrated southwestward to the modern territories of Laos and Thailand from Guangxi sometime between the 8th–10th centuries.

The Tai assimilated or driven out indigenous Austroasiatic Mon–Khmer peoples, and settled on the fringes of the Indianized kingdoms of the Mon and Khmer Empire. The blending of peoples and the influx of Indian philosophy, religion, language, culture and customs via and alongside some Austroasiatic element enriched the Tai peoples, but the Tais remained in contact with the other Tai mueang.

===Lanxang===
The Tai states took advantage of the waning Khmer Empire and emerged independent. The Lao reckon the beginnings of their national history to this time, as many important monuments, temples, artwork, and other aspects of classical Lao culture harken back to this time period. From this point, one can refer to the Tai states of the Chao Phraya River valley as Siam and, albeit quite anachronistically, Lan Xang as Laos.

The Kingdom of Lanxang, the &quot;Land of One Million Elephants&quot;, began in 1354 AD, when Somdej Phra Chao Fa Ngum (1354 - 1373 AD) returned to Mueang Sua (, เมืองซวา), thence renamed &quot;Xieng Thong&quot; (, เชียงทอง) and now known as Luang Prabang. From this base Lan Xang extended its sphere of influence to all of modern-day Laos and the Khorat Plateau of Thailand as well as parts of Sipsongbanna in southern China, Sip Song Chau Tai in northwestern Vietnam, Kengtung in Myanmar, and Stung Treng in Cambodia.

The powerful Kingdom of Lan Xang had wealth and influence due to the location of its capital along the Silk Route and also serving as the center of Buddhism in Southeast Asia. The kingdom prospered with riverine traffic along the Mekong and overland caravan routes to the ports of Siam, which had emerged as a bustling entrepôt of sea-borne trade, and to southern China and other Tai mueang. The first Western visitors during the reign of Phra Chao Sourigna Vongsa (, พระเจ้าสุริยวงศาธรรมิกราช) (1634–1697 AD) noted how the kingdom prospered off exports of gold, benzoin resin, lac and lacquer ware, medicinal herbs, ivory, silk and silk clothing, and wood. Numerous temples, especially in Xieng Thong (now Luang Phrabang) and Vientiane, attest this.

During this time, the legends of Khun Borom were recorded on palm-leaf manuscripts and the Lao classical epic Sin Xay was composed. Therevada Buddhism was the state religion, and Vientiane was an important city of Buddhist learning. Cultural influences, besides Buddhism, included the Mon outposts later assimilated into the kingdom and the Khmer. A brief union of the crowns of Lannathai and Lanxang under Phra Chao Sai Sethathirath (, พระเจ้าไชยเชษฐาธิราช) (1548–1572 AD) introduced some architectural and artistic developments. The libraries of Lannathai were copied, including much religious literature. This may have led to the adoption, or possibly re-adoption, of the Mon-based Tua Tham, or &#x27;dharma script&#x27; for religious writings.

The kingdom split into three rival factions, ruling from Luang Phra Bang, Vientiane, and Champasak (, จำปาศักดิ์). The kingdoms quickly fell under Siamese rule. The remnants of Lan Xang received their final blows in the 18th and 19th centuries, during the campaigns of Taksin, and retribution for the Laotian Rebellion of Chao Anouvong (, เจ้าอนุวงศ์) against Siamese rule during the reign of Rama III. During both these periods, Vientiane and other cities were looted and their Buddha images and artwork moved to Thailand. 
The cities and much of the population was forcibly removed and settled in the lesser populated regions of Isan and central Thailand and others were enslaved to do corvée projects, resulting in Lao arts and language finding their way into Central Thailand. By the time the French reached Laos in 1868, they found only a depopulated region with even the great city of Vientiane disappearing into the forest.

===Lao after Lanxang===

====Lao in Laos====

The area of Laos, then annexed by Siam, was explored by the French and, under Auguste Pavie, the French were keen to control the Mekong. The French, as overlords of Vietnam, wanted all the tributaries of Vietnam, including the remnant territories of Lanxang. This led to French gunboat diplomacy and border skirmishes known as the Franco-Siamese conflict of 1893, which forced Siam to cede its claims to most of what constitutes modern-day Laos.

The French prevented and preserved the Lao from becoming a regional sub-category of the Thai nation, much like their brethren in Isan, also known as the &#x27;North-Eastern Thai&#x27;. Like former historical rivalries between the kings of Luang Phrabang, Champasak and Vientiane, post-independence Laos was quickly divided between the royalists under Prince Boun Oum of Champasak (, เจ้าบุญอุ้ม ณ จำปาศักดิ์), the neutralists under Prince Souvanna Phouma (, เจ้าสุวรรณภูมา), and the communist Pathet Lao (, ประเทศลาว, pá tʰêːt lá:w) under his half-brother Prince Souphanouvong (, เจ้าสุภานุวงศ์). These internal divisions, with the Cold War and the region quickly being drawn into the Vietnam War, led to a protracted battle for government control that would not end until the communist victory in 1975.

The Laotian Civil War was disastrous for the country; however, over the years the country has since relaxed many of its restrictions, which has opened up the country to trade and business resulting in Laos notably having the second fastest growing economy in Asia in recent years.

Laos has garnered several famous tourism awards by successfully promoting its northern city, Luang Prabang, as the newest tourist destination including serving as a religious hub where tourists may participate in almsgiving during morning procession of Lao Buddhist monks.

====Lao in Thailand====

Although parts of Isan were settled and were part of Lanxang, many of the Lao were forcibly settled in the lesser populated southern and western regions or sent to boost the populations of Lao mueang loyal to the Siamese. The area was relatively isolated from the rest of Thailand by the Petchabun mountains until the beginning of the 20th century, when a direct rail link was built to Nakhon Ratchasima. The region&#x27;s isolation from Central Thailand and the large population of people in Isan, who were still attached to their cultural heritage, helped preserve Lao culture.

Though Isan is a multi-ethnic region containing a mixture of Lao, Vietnamese, Cham, Mon, Khmer, and other Tai groups, it is majority Lao, and the Central Thais&#x27; perceived threat of Lao cultural and political dominance in the Isan region resulted in various Thaification policies being enacted to finally integrate the multi-ethnic Isan people into Thailand. Since Lao dominance was seen as the greatest threat in the region, &#x27;Lao&#x27; was removed as a category in the census, and heavy-handed policies were enacted. References to Lao people or its past were removed and the language was banned from schools and books, erasing Lao influence and impact to the country.

Although the region remains mainly agricultural and poorer compared to other regions of Thailand, and many leave the region to find work in Vientiane, Bangkok or abroad, the region has enjoyed a renewed interest in traditional culture which is quite distinct although similar to Thai culture. The region is becoming increasingly more urban, and many large cities have sprung up. Due to the large population and Isan&#x27;s important function as a voting bloc in elections, more attention to improving the region&#x27;s infrastructure, business and education has come from the national government although poverty and regionalism are still impediments to Isan&#x27;s development.

In recent times, Lao popular media, including Lao music and television, has found its way back into the Isan region since Lao TV satellite signal is reachable in Isan. With the rediscovered interest in Lao pop music, Lao concerts are not only held in Laos, but also in Isan region of Thailand, thus, continually garnering new Thai fans of Lao pop music. Thailand&#x27;s national channels have also broadcast Lao media throughout Thailand, as well as Thai media in Laos, resulting in Tai populations located in the other regions of Thailand (northern, central, and southern) discovering a renewed kinship with the people of Laos.

Historically, Laotians living in other regions of Thailand, such as the capital Bangkok, have experienced massive immigration from Vientiane after Anouvong&#x27;s Rebellion (1828) during the King Rama III&#x27;s reign, these Laotians have completely blended with the Thais nowadays. In the King Rama IV&#x27;s reign, it was recorded that there are about one million Laotians throughout Thailand. Only in Bangkok, there are approximately 200,000 Laotians. The Lao communities in Bangkok include Bang Yi Khan and Bang Sai Kai on the Thonburi side as well as Bang Khun Phrom on the Phra Nakhon side (Bangkok core). The Laotians who living in Bang Sai Kai still inherit some traditions or cultures from their ancestors.

==Geographical distribution==
There are around 3.6 million Laotians in Laos, constituting approximately 68% of the population (the remainder are largely hill tribe people). The ethnic Lao of Laos form the bulk of the &quot;Lao Loum&quot; (&quot;Lowland Laotians&quot;) (Lao: , Thai: ลาวลุ่ม, IPA: laːw lum). Small Lao communities exist in Thailand and Cambodia, residing primarily in the former Lao territory of Stung Treng (Xieng Teng in Lao), and Vietnam.

There are a substantial number of Lao overseas, numbering over 500,000 people. Laotian migration outside of Indochina first occurred during French colonialism in Laos that started in the early 20th century. Lao students and workers came to France during this period, including members of the Lao royal family, and some resettled there permanently. However, most Lao migrants were refugees who fled Laos after the Laotian Civil War (part of the greater Vietnam War) and from the new communist Pathet Lao government. Primary places of asylum for the Lao refugees included the United States, France, Canada and Australia. Other countries such as France, Japan, Argentina, and Singapore also took in Laotian refugees.

The 2010 United States census reported over 200,000 Americans of Lao descent in the country, a figure which excludes Hmong and Mien, but may include individuals of Tai Dam, Khmu, and other descent in addition to the Lao due to confusions between national and ethnic identity. A 2012 estimate counted about 140,000 ethnic Laotians living in France, with over half of the population living in Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France area.

There are approximately 20 million &quot;Lao Isaan&quot; in Thailand, residing mainly on the Khorat Plateau in northeastern Thailand and in and around Bangkok. The government of Thailand has historically discouraged the &quot;Lao Isaan&quot; from identifying as or being identified as &quot;Lao&quot;.

==Language==
The Lao language is a tonal, analytic, right-branching, pronoun pro-drop language of the Tai–Kadai language family, closely related to Thai and other languages of Tai peoples. Most of the vocabulary is of native Tai origin, although important contributions have come from Pali and Sanskrit as well as Mon–Khmer languages. The alphabet is an indic-based alphabet. Although the Lao have five major dialects, they are all mutually intelligible and Lao people believe they all speak variations of one language.

===Lao in Laos===

The Lao language () is the official language of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic and its official script is the Lao alphabet. As the dominant language of most of the Lao Loum and therefore most of the Lao population, the language is enshrined as the dominant language of education, government, and official use. Numerous minority languages are spoken by roughly half the population, and include languages of the Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian and Hmong–Mien language families. Although spelling is not fully uniform, despite several reforms to move the language closer to phonetical systems, it has helped stabilise the language. No official standard exists, but the dialect of Vientiane is considered de facto official.

===Lao in Thailand===

The boundaries of Lao dialects also extend into the North-East of Thailand, known as Isan, but the Lao spoken in Thailand as a whole can be differentiated by adoption of much Thai vocabulary and code-switching. The language is not taught or used in schools, government, and most media outlets. Thaification policies removed the alphabet and now the language is written in the Thai alphabet, if at all, and the name changed to Isan to sever the political connection with Laos. Despite this, the Lao language is spoken by 20 million people, almost a third of the population of Thailand, and is the primary language of 88% of Isan households. It continues to serve as an important regional language and a badge of Isan (hence Lao) identity, but it is experiencing a decline in the advance of Thai.

==Religion==

Religion in Laos is highly syncretic, and has drawn from three primary sources. While most Lao people claim to be Theravada Buddhists, many traditions are derived from Animist practices.

===Buddhism===

Buddhism (, พระพุทธศาสนา, ) is the most popular and state religion in Laos, practised by 67% of the country, and nearly all of the ethnic Lao. The numbers may be much higher, as Buddhism has also influenced many other ethnic groups that are generally considered animist. It is also the predominant religion of Isan and most of the nations beyond Laos&#x27; frontiers. Of these, most are of the Therevada Sect (, เถรวาท, ) although historical influences of Mahayana Buddhism remain and it is the main sect of Vietnamese and Chinese minorities that have settled amongst the Lao and it has become syncretic with animistic practices.

The temple in a Lao community is the centre of community affairs, where villagers gather to discuss concerns or ask monks for their wisdom and guidance, and most men are expected to enter the monastery at some point to further their religious knowledge and make merit.

Paramount to religious living are the five Buddhist precepts (, , เบญจศีล, ), viz., to abstain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication. Lao cultural and behavioural traits that stem from Buddhist belief include tolerance, respect for elders and family hierarchy, selflessness, detachment to worldly good and concerns, caring for younger siblings, politeness, self-negation, and modesty. Basic beliefs include rebirth and karma.

Important holidays related to Buddhism include Boun Phra Vet (, บุญพระเวส, ), Magha Puja (, มาฆบูชา), Songkhan (, สงกรานต์), Vesak (, วิสาขบูชา), Vassa (, วันเข้าพรรษา), Wan Awk Pansa ( วันออกพรรษา), Kathina, (, กฐิน). In addition to these days, the Buddhist sabbath days (, วันพระ, ), during the phases of the moon, and temple fairs are also regular times to visit the temples, pray, ask advice of the monks for spiritual concerns, and donate food, money, or help out with temple chores, known in Lao as &quot;tambun&quot; (, ทำบุญ, ).

===Laotian folk religion===

Laotian folk religion is the indigenous religion of most of the Mon–Khmer and more recent Hmong–Mien and Tibeto-Burman minorities, as well as the traditional religion of the Tais before Buddhism, although some Tai tribes to this day are still folk religious. For the ethnic Lao, animism has become interwoven with Buddhism and some Hindu elements. Despite suppression at various points in time, it continues to be a large part of Lao religious tradition.
A variety of gods ( ผี, ) are worshiped as tutelary deities of buildings or territories, of natural places, things or phenomena; they are also ancestral spirits and other spirits that protect people, and include malevolent spirits. Guardian deities of places, such as the &quot;phi wat&quot; (, ผีวัด) of temples and the &quot;lak mueang&quot; (, หลักเมือง, ) of towns are celebrated with communal gatherings and offerings of food. Gods of Hindu derivation are included in the pantheon. Gods are ubiquitous, and some of them are connected with the universal elements: heaven, earth, fire, and water. Lao people also believe in thirty-two spirits known as &quot;khwan&quot; (, ขวัญ, ) that protect the body, and &quot;baci&quot; ( , บายศรี, ) ceremonies are undertaken during momentous occasions or times of anxiety to bind the spirits to the body, as their absence is believed to invite illness or harm.

Spirit houses, while common in Thailand are rare in Laos, owing to prohibitions on the worship of spirits in the reign of King Photisarath (16th century). In modern Laos, to a very limited extent the practice of spirit houses has been reimported from Thailand. Offerings of flowers, incense, and candles are given, and the spirits are consulted during changes or times of hardness for protection and assistance. Natural deities include those that reside in trees, mountains, or forests. Guardian spirits of people often include ancestors or angelic-beings who arrive at various points in life, better known as &quot;thewada&quot;. Malevolent spirits include those of people who were bad in past lives or died of tragic deaths, such as the ghastly &quot;phi pob&quot; (, ผีปอบ) and the vampirical &quot;phi dip&quot; (, ผีดิบ). The &quot;phi&quot; also include the indigenous, non-Hindu gods, the &quot;phi thaen&quot; (, ผีแถน).

&quot;Mophi&quot; (mo-phi หมอผี), &quot;tellers&quot;, are locally trained shamans, specialists in the rituals and in communication with their personal spirits and gods in general. Using trances, sacred objects imbued with supernatural power, or &quot;saksit&quot;, possessions, and rituals like &quot;lam phi fa&quot; (, ลำผีฟ้า, ) or &quot;baci&quot;, the shaman is often consulted during times of trouble, hauntings, and illness or other misfortune that might be caused by malevolent or unhappy spirits. They are also usually present during religious festivals.

===Hinduism===
Hinduism was the primary influence over much of the Khmer Empire, and examples of Hindu themes can be found on their temples from that era such as Vat Phou. Temples were often built over the sites of ancient Hindu shrines, and statues or motifs of Hindu gods are commonly found outside temples. Although important influences can be traced to Hindu rituals, the Lao people are not as overtly influenced by Hinduism as their neighbours the Tai Thai.

The Lao have adopted and adapted the Ramayana into the local version, known as Phra Lak Phra Ram (, พระลักษมณ์พระราม, ). The Lao version was interwoven with the Lao creation myth and is also, mistakenly, thought of as a Jataka story so is held in high esteem. Many court dances were based on the events of the story. Hinduism blended easily into both animism and Buddhism, so many Hindu gods are considered &quot;phi thaen&quot; and Buddhist monks have incorporated much of Brahmanic rituals. Peculiar to Lao people are reverence for Nāgas, snake-like demigods that rule the waterways.

==Culture==

===Lao cuisine===

The cuisine of Laos is similar to other regional cuisines such as Thai and Cambodian cuisines, but has several unique distinguishing traits. Lao cuisine&#x27;s most famous dishes are larb and green &quot;Papaya salad&quot;, both originated in Laos. The cuisines of the Lao in Laos and Isan have diverged only minutely, with the key differences is that Lao cuisine lacks the influences of Thai cuisine and Isan cuisine lacks many of the French influences in Laos. Rice is the staple, and the main variety is glutinous rice or &quot;khao nio&quot; (, ข้าวเหนียว, ), which is also a feature on Isan and Northern Thai tables since both have been influenced by Lao cuisine. Although sometimes replaced by noodles or other, less popular varieties of rice, it is commonly served with an accompaniment of various dips and sauces, raw vegetables, and several dishes that are shared together. Many dishes are very spicy, fired by the numerous varieties of chili peppers and made pungent by the strong herbs and fermented fish sauces.

The tropical climate and mountainous areas gives Laos a wide variety of climates and also a rich bounty of edibles, so much of traditional Lao cuisine is composed of vegetables and herbs gathered from the wild, weeds from the rice fields, as well as vegetable plots. A rich plethora of vegetable and fruit varieties are grown, including cucumbers, gourds, cabbage, snakebeans, winged beans, yams, water spinach, mangoes, pomelos, papayas, and sugarcane. Raw vegetables often accompany a meal to help cool the tongue. The most popular meat is freshwater fish, which is also used to make two flavourings, fish sauce (, ; &quot;Nampla&quot;) and padaek (, ; &quot;Pla ra&quot;). Other common meats include pork, chicken, duck, beef, eggs, water buffalo. Protein intake includes a wide range of delicacies, including lizards, insects, frogs, and wild deer that also come from the forests. Common beverages are tea, coffee, and alcohol, including the native rice wine, &quot;lao lao&quot; (, เหล้าลาว, ). The cuisine is noted for its use of mint and dill, relatively rare in surrounding cuisines.
Laos has been generally a very rural country, and most of the people support themselves by agriculture, with rice being the most important crop. As inhabitants of river valleys and lowlands that have been long-settled, ethnic Lao do not practise swidden agriculture like upland peoples.
The traditional folk music is &quot;lam lao&quot; (, ลำลาว, ), although it is also known as morlam (Lao: , หมอลำ, ) which is the preferred term in Isan language. Artists from Thailand are also popular in Laos and vice versa, which has re-enforced Lao culture in Isan despite heavy Thaification. The music is noted for the use of the khene (Lao: , Isan: แคน, ) instrument.

<text>The King Oscar export brand was founded in 1902 when King Oscar II, ruler of Sweden and Norway, gave – one of Norway&#x27;s leading canning companies at the time, &quot;special royal permission&quot; to use his name and likeness on a line of sardine products.

Over the years, the King Oscar brand expanded into new markets, introduced new product lines, and was eventually acquired by several different parent companies as the sardine canning industry evolved in Norway. Today, King Oscar AS is owned by Thai Union Group, one of the largest seafood producers in the world.

== History ==
In 1880, Norwegian fish canneries began exporting sardines. At the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago in 1893, the Norwegian exhibition included smoked sardines.

In 1903, a year after royal permission had been granted, Chr. Bjelland &amp; Co. first began exporting the King Oscar brand of sardines to the United States, and by 1920, the brand was established in the USA and British markets. In 1965, the company started exporting their sardines to Japan.

Chr. Bjelland &amp; Co. produced a ten-minute film called &quot;Sardine fishing&quot; in 1909 to market the brand; this was the first Norwegian commercial. The company also used the slogan &quot;Out to conquer the world.&quot;

In 1950, various King Oscar brisling sardine products were accorded kosher certification.

In 1981, eleven Norwegian canneries merged to form a single company, Norway Foods, which acquired the King Oscar brand. Norway Foods was in turn acquired by Rieber &amp; Søn ASA in 1996. Over the following years, the brand was introduced to various western and eastern European countries, select countries in Asia, to Australia, and South Africa.

In 2008, King Oscar&#x27;s central production facilities were moved to a company-owned facility in Gniewino, Poland. The company continues to maintain a production facility in Svolvær, Norway.

King Oscar AS became the new owner of the brand in 2009. The company was purchased by Procuritas Capital Investments in 2010, and by Thai Union Group in 2014.

== Products ==
While brisling sardines have always been the company&#x27;s flagship product, King Oscar produces a widening variety of seafood products. For the USA, the product range includes brisling sardines, skinless &amp; boneless sardines, salmon, mackerel, kipper snacks or traditionally smoked herring, and anchovies. In other parts of the world, the product range includes tuna, cod, and other specialty items, as well as fish salads and fish pâtés.

Vladimir Aleksandrovich Shatalov ({{langx|ru|Владимир Александрович Шаталов}}; December 8, 1927 – June 15, 2021) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew three space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 4 (1969), Soyuz 8 (1969), and Soyuz 10 (1971). From 1987 to 1991, he headed the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Lieutenant General, Soviet Air Force (1975).

==Early life==
Vladimir Shatalov was born on December 8, 1927, in Petropavlovsk, {{Interlanguage link|Akmolinsk Governorate|ru|Акмолинская губерния}}, Kazak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (now Petropavl, North Kazakhstan Region, Republic of Kazakhstan). His father, Aleksandr Borisovich Shatalov (1890–1970), was a railway engineer and an early recipient of the Hero of Socialist Labour. His mother, Zoya Vladimirovna Shatalova (&quot;née&quot; Nikolskaya; 1900–1980), was a housewife. 

In 1941, Shatalov graduated from the 6th Grade Secondary School No.4 in Leningrad. During his school years, Shatalov was engaged in aircraft modeling in the Pioneers Palace. In 1941, he took part in the Defense of Leningrad for a month and a half, along with his father at the &quot;Svyazrem-1&quot; repair and restoration train. He helped to build the &quot;Road of Life&quot; across the frozen Lake Ladoga. This was the only route into the city during the bitter winters. Shatalov went back to Petropavlovsk, where his family left for evacuation. In 1943, Shatalov graduated from the seven-year school in Petropavlovsk.

== Early career ==
In early 1945, Shatalov graduated from the 6th Voronezh Air Force Special School, which he was evacuated to Karaganda, followed by Lipetsk. In July 1945, Shatalov entered the 8th Military Aviation School for initial training of pilots. However, in August 1945, the school had closed. Shatalov continued his studies at the Kachinsk Military Aviation School, which was situated in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast at the time. In 1949, Shatalov graduated from college with first category and became a pilot. From September 7, 1949, Shatalov served as an instructor pilot, and from June 14, 1951, served as an instructor pilot in piloting techniques of the 706th Training Aviation Regiment of the Kachinsk MAS. From December 12, 1951, Shatalov served as an instructor pilot for the combat use of the 706th TAR.

In 1956, Shatalov graduated from the Command Faculty of the Air Force Academy. From November 1956, Shatalov served as deputy squadron commander, then later — squadron commander, and from May 1960 — deputy commander of an aviation regiment in combat units of the Air Force. From February 1961, Shatalov served as a senior inspector-pilot of the combat training department of the 48th Air Army of the Odessa Military District. Shatalov was a master on multiple aircraft, mostly the Yak and MiG aircraft. The total flight time by the time of enrollment in the cosmonaut corps was more than 2,500 hours.

== Cosmonaut career ==
Shatalov had dreams of flying even higher, but was worried he may be too old to train as a cosmonaut. When Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space in April 1961, he was a full seven years younger. However, in 1962 Shatalov was asked to nominate the five best pilots under his command for consideration as cosmonauts, and put his own name forward at the top of the list. He passed the medical exam and then the interview in Moscow, which included Gargarin himself on the panel. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force No.14 on January 10, 1963, Shatalov was enrolled in the Cosmonaut Training Center as a listener-cosmonaut. From January 1963 to January 1965, Shatalov underwent general space training. He studied the systems, design and operating rules of the spacecraft Vostok 3A, Voskhod, Voskhod 2, and Soyuz. On January 13, 1965, after passing the exams, Shatalov was qualified as an Air Force cosmonaut. On January 23, 1965, 
Shatalov was appointed cosmonaut of the 2nd Detachment (Military Space Programs).

Shatalov was in space three times. He made his first flight on January 14, 1969, on the Soyuz-4 spacecraft. It was the first to carry out manual rendezvous and docking with Soyuz-5. With his participation, for the first time in the world, an experimental space station was created and the transition through open space of cosmonauts Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov from the Soyuz-5 spacecraft to the Soyuz-4 was carried out. There was no internal connecting corridor between the two craft, and so the crew had to step into space using handrails on the craft in order to carry out the transition. For his part in this feat, he was made a Hero of the Soviet Union and awarded The Order of Lenin.

==Later life==

<doc id="197179" wikidata="Q181497" url="?curid=197179" title="Sexual dimorphism">
<text>Sexual dimorphism is the condition where sexes of the same species exhibit different morphological characteristics, including characteristics not directly involved in reproduction. The condition occurs in most dioecious species, which consist of most animals and some plants. Differences may include secondary sex characteristics, size, weight, color, markings, or behavioral or cognitive traits. Male-male reproductive competition has evolved a diverse array of sexually dimorphic traits. Aggressive utility traits such as &quot;battle&quot; teeth and blunt heads reinforced as battering rams are used as weapons in aggressive interactions between rivals. Passive displays such as ornamental feathering or song-calling have also evolved mainly through sexual selection. These differences may be subtle or exaggerated and may be subjected to sexual selection and natural selection. The opposite of dimorphism is &quot;monomorphism&quot;, when both biological sexes are phenotypically indistinguishable from each other.

==Overview==
===Ornamentation and coloration===
Common and easily identified types of dimorphism consist of ornamentation and coloration, though not always apparent. A difference in the coloration of sexes within a given species is called sexual dichromatism, commonly seen in many species of birds and reptiles. Sexual selection leads to exaggerated dimorphic traits that are used predominantly in competition over mates. The increased fitness resulting from ornamentation offsets its cost to produce or maintain, suggesting complex evolutionary implications, but the costs and evolutionary implications vary from species to species.

The peafowl constitute conspicuous illustrations of the principle. The ornate plumage of peacocks, as used in the courting display, attracts peahens. At first sight, one might mistake peacocks and peahens for completely different species because of the vibrant colours and the sheer size of the male&#x27;s plumage; the peahen is of a subdued brown coloration. The plumage of the peacock increases its vulnerability to predators because it is a hindrance in flight, and it renders the bird conspicuous in general. Similar examples are manifold, such as in birds of paradise and argus pheasants.

Another example of sexual dichromatism is that of nestling blue tits. Males are chromatically more yellow than females. It is believed that this is obtained by the ingestion of green Lepidopteran larvae, which contain large amounts of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. This diet also affects the sexually dimorphic colours in the human-invisible ultraviolet spectrum. Hence, the male birds, although appearing yellow to humans, actually have a violet-tinted plumage that is seen by females. This plumage is thought to be an indicator of male parental abilities. Perhaps this is a good indicator for females because it shows that they are good at obtaining a food supply from which the carotenoid is obtained. There is a positive correlation between the chromas of the tail and breast feathers and body condition. Carotenoids play an important role in immune function for many animals, so carotenoid dependent signals might indicate health.

Frogs constitute another conspicuous illustration of the principle. There are two types of dichromatism for frog species: ontogenetic and dynamic. Ontogenetic frogs are more common and have permanent color changes in males or females. &quot;Ranoidea lesueuri&quot; is an example of a dynamic frog with temporary color changes in males during the breeding season. &quot;Hyperolius ocellatus&quot; is an ontogenetic frog with dramatic differences in both color and pattern between the sexes. At sexual maturity, the males display a bright green with white dorsolateral lines. In contrast, the females are rusty red to silver with small spots. The bright coloration in the male population attracts females and is an aposematic sign to potential predators.

Females often show a preference for exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristics in mate selection. The sexy son hypothesis explains that females prefer more elaborate males and select against males that are dull in color, independent of the species&#x27; vision.

Similar sexual dimorphism and mating choice are also observed in many fish species. For example, male guppies have colorful spots and ornamentations, while females are generally grey. Female guppies prefer brightly colored males to duller males.

In redlip blennies, only the male fish develops an organ at the anal-urogenital region that produces antimicrobial substances. During parental care, males rub their anal-urogenital regions over their nests&#x27; internal surfaces, thereby protecting their eggs from microbial infections, one of the most common causes for mortality in young fish.

==Plants==
Most flowering plants are hermaphroditic but approximately 6% of species have separate males and females (dioecy). Sexual dimorphism is common in dioecious plants and dioicous species.

Males and females in insect-pollinated species generally look similar to one another because plants provide rewards (e.g. nectar) that encourage pollinators to visit another similar flower, completing pollination. &quot;Catasetum&quot; orchids are one interesting exception to this rule. Male &quot;Catasetum&quot; orchids violently attach pollinia to euglossine bee pollinators. The bees will then avoid other male flowers but may visit the female, which looks different from the males.

Various other dioecious exceptions, such as &quot;Loxostylis alata&quot; have visibly different sexes, with the effect of eliciting the most efficient behavior from pollinators, who then use the most efficient strategy in visiting each gender of flower instead of searching, say, for pollen in a nectar-bearing female flower.

Some plants, such as some species of &quot;Geranium&quot; have what amounts to serial sexual dimorphism. The flowers of such species might, for example, present their anthers on opening, then shed the exhausted anthers after a day or two and perhaps change their colours as well while the pistil matures; specialist pollinators are very much inclined to concentrate on the exact appearance of the flowers they serve, which saves their time and effort and serves the interests of the plant accordingly. Some such plants go even further and change their appearance once fertilized, thereby discouraging further visits from pollinators. This is advantageous to both parties because it avoids damaging the developing fruit and wasting the pollinator&#x27;s effort on unrewarding visits. In effect, the strategy ensures that pollinators can expect a reward every time they visit an appropriately advertising flower.

Females of the aquatic plant &quot;Vallisneria americana&quot; have floating flowers attached by a long flower stalk that are fertilized if they contact one of the thousands of free-floating flowers released by a male. Sexual dimorphism is most often associated with wind-pollination in plants due to selection for efficient pollen dispersal in males vs pollen capture in females, e.g. &quot;Leucadendron rubrum&quot;.

Sexual dimorphism in plants can also be dependent on reproductive development. This can be seen in &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot;, a type of hemp, which have higher photosynthesis rates in males while growing but higher rates in females once the plants become sexually mature.

Every sexually reproducing extant species of the vascular plant has an alternation of generations; the plants we see about us generally are diploid sporophytes, but their offspring are not the seeds that people commonly recognize as the new generation. The seed actually is the offspring of the haploid generation of microgametophytes (pollen) and megagametophytes (the embryo sacs in the ovules). Each pollen grain accordingly may be seen as a male plant in its own right; it produces a sperm cell and is dramatically different from the female plant, the megagametophyte that produces the female gamete.

==Insects==

Insects display a wide variety of sexual dimorphism between taxa including size, ornamentation and coloration. The female-biased sexual size dimorphism observed in many taxa evolved despite intense male-male competition for mates. In &quot;Osmia rufa&quot;, for example, the female is larger/broader than males, with males being 8–10 mm in size and females being 10–12 mm in size. In the hackberry emperor females are similarly larger than males. The reason for the sexual dimorphism is due to provision size mass, in which females consume more pollen than males.

In some species, there is evidence of male dimorphism, but it appears to be for distinctions of roles. This is seen in the bee species &quot;Macrotera portalis&quot; in which there is a small-headed morph, capable of flight, and large-headed morph, incapable of flight, for males. &quot;Anthidium manicatum&quot; also displays male-biased sexual dimorphism. The selection for larger size in males rather than females in this species may have resulted due to their aggressive territorial behavior and subsequent differential mating success. Another example is &quot;Lasioglossum hemichalceum&quot;, which is a species of sweat bee that shows drastic physical dimorphisms between male offspring. Not all dimorphism has to have a drastic difference between the sexes. &quot;Andrena agilissima&quot; is a mining bee where the females only have a slightly larger head than the males.

Weaponry leads to increased fitness by increasing success in male–male competition in many insect species. The beetle horns in &quot;Onthophagus taurus&quot; are enlarged growths of the head or thorax expressed only in the males. &quot;Copris ochus&quot; also has distinct sexual and male dimorphism in head horns. Another beetle with a distinct horn-related sexual dimorphism is &quot;Allomyrina dichotoma,&quot; also known as the Japanese rhinoceros beetle. These structures are impressive because of the exaggerated sizes. There is a direct correlation between male horn lengths and body size and higher access to mates and fitness. In other beetle species, both males and females may have ornamentation such as horns.
Generally, insect sexual size dimorphism (SSD) within species increases with body size.

Sexual dimorphism within insects is also displayed by dichromatism. In butterfly genera &quot;Bicyclus&quot; and &quot;Junonia&quot;, dimorphic wing patterns evolved due to sex-limited expression, which mediates the intralocus sexual conflict and leads to increased fitness in males. The sexual dichromatic nature of &quot;Bicyclus anynana&quot; is reflected by female selection on the basis of dorsal UV-reflective eyespot pupils. The common brimstone also displays sexual dichromatism; males have yellow and iridescent wings, while female wings are white and non-iridescent. Naturally selected deviation in protective female coloration is displayed in mimetic butterflies.

==Spiders and sexual cannibalism==
Many arachnid groups exhibit sexual dimorphism, but it is most widely studied in the spiders. In the orb-weaving spider &quot;Zygiella x-notata&quot;, for example, adult females have a larger body size than adult males. Size dimorphism shows a correlation with sexual cannibalism, which is prominent in spiders (it is also found in insects such as praying mantises). In the size dimorphic wolf spider &quot;Tigrosa helluo&quot;, food-limited females cannibalize more frequently. Therefore, there is a high risk of low fitness for males due to pre-copulatory cannibalism, which led to male selection of larger females for two reasons: higher fecundity and lower rates of cannibalism. In addition, female fecundity is positively correlated with female body size and large female body size is selected for, which is seen in the family Araneidae. All &quot;Argiope&quot; species, including &quot;Argiope bruennichi&quot;, use this method. Some males evolved ornamentation including binding the female with silk, having proportionally longer legs, modifying the female&#x27;s web, mating while the female is feeding, or providing a nuptial gift in response to sexual cannibalism. Male body size is not under selection due to cannibalism in all spider species such as &quot;Nephila pilipes&quot;, but is more prominently selected for in less dimorphic species of spiders, which often selects for larger male size. In the species &quot;Maratus volans&quot;, the males are known for their characteristic colorful fan which attracts the females during mating.

==Fish==
Ray-finned fish are an ancient and diverse class, with the widest degree of sexual dimorphism of any animal class. Fairbairn notes that &quot;females are generally larger than males but males are often larger in species with male–male combat or male paternal care ... [sizes range] from dwarf males to males more than 12 times heavier than females.&quot;

There are cases where males are substantially larger than females. An example is &quot;Lamprologus callipterus&quot;, a type of cichlid fish. In this fish, the males are characterized as being up to 60 times larger than the females. The male&#x27;s increased size is believed to be advantageous because males collect and defend empty snail shells in each of which a female breeds. Males must be larger and more powerful in order to collect the largest shells. The female&#x27;s body size must remain small because in order for her to breed, she must lay her eggs inside the empty shells. If she grows too large, she will not fit in the shells and will be unable to breed. The female&#x27;s small body size is also likely beneficial to her chances of finding an unoccupied shell. Larger shells, although preferred by females, are often limited in availability. Hence, the female is limited to the growth of the size of the shell and may actually change her growth rate according to shell size availability. In other words, the male&#x27;s ability to collect large shells depends on his size. The larger the male, the larger the shells he is able to collect. This then allows for females to be larger in his brooding nest which makes the difference between the sizes of the sexes less substantial. Male–male competition in this fish species also selects for large size in males. There is aggressive competition by males over territory and access to larger shells. Large males win fights and steal shells from competitors. Another example is the dragonet, in which males are considerably larger than females and possess longer fins.

Sexual dimorphism also occurs in hermaphroditic fish. These species are known as sequential hermaphrodites. In fish, reproductive histories often include the sex-change from female to male where there is a strong connection between growth, the sex of an individual, and the mating system within which it operates. In protogynous mating systems where males dominate mating with many females, size plays a significant role in male reproductive success. Males have a propensity to be larger than females of a comparable age but it is unclear whether the size increase is due to a growth spurt at the time of the sexual transition or due to the history of faster growth in sex changing individuals. Larger males are able to stifle the growth of females and control environmental resources.

Social organization plays a large role in the changing of sex by the fish. It is often seen that a fish will change its sex when there is a lack of a dominant male within the social hierarchy. The females that change sex are often those who attain and preserve an initial size advantage early in life. In either case, females which change sex to males are larger and often prove to be a good example of dimorphism.

In other cases with fish, males will go through noticeable changes in body size, and females will go through morphological changes that can only be seen inside of the body. For example, in sockeye salmon, males develop larger body size at maturity, including an increase in body depth, hump height, and snout length. Females experience minor changes in snout length, but the most noticeable difference is the huge increase in gonad size, which accounts for about 25% of body mass.

Sexual selection was observed for female ornamentation in &quot;Gobiusculus flavescens&quot;, known as two-spotted gobies. Traditional hypotheses suggest that male–male competition drives selection. However, selection for ornamentation within this species suggests that showy female traits can be selected through either female–female competition or male mate choice. Since carotenoid-based ornamentation suggests mate quality, female two-spotted guppies that develop colorful orange bellies during breeding season are considered favorable to males. The males invest heavily in offspring during incubation, which leads to the sexual preference in colorful females due to higher egg quality.

==Amphibians and non-avian reptiles==

In amphibians and reptiles, the degree of sexual dimorphism varies widely among taxonomic groups. The sexual dimorphism in amphibians and reptiles may be reflected in any of the following: anatomy; relative length of tail; relative size of head; overall size as in many species of vipers and lizards; coloration as in many amphibians, snakes, and lizards, as well as in some turtles; an ornament as in many newts and lizards; the presence of specific sex-related behaviour is common to many lizards; and vocal qualities which are frequently observed in frogs.

Anole lizards show prominent size dimorphism with males typically being significantly larger than females. For instance, the average male &quot;Anolis sagrei&quot; was 53.4 mm vs. 40 mm in females. Different sizes of the heads in anoles have been explained by differences in the estrogen pathway. The sexual dimorphism in lizards is generally attributed to the effects of sexual selection, but other mechanisms including ecological divergence and fecundity selection provide alternative explanations. The development of color dimorphism in lizards is induced by hormonal changes at the onset of sexual maturity, as seen in &quot;Psamodromus algirus&quot;, &quot;Sceloporus gadoviae&quot;, and &quot;S. undulates erythrocheilus&quot;. Sexual dimorphism in size is also seen in frog species like &quot;P. bibronii&quot;. 

Male painted dragon lizards, &quot;Ctenophorus pictus&quot;. are brightly conspicuous in their breeding coloration, but male colour declines with aging. Male coloration appears to reflect innate anti-oxidation capacity that protects against oxidative DNA damage. Male breeding coloration is likely an indicator to females of the underlying level of oxidative DNA damage (a significant component of aging) in potential mates.

== Birds ==

Possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain macroevolution of sexual size dimorphism in birds. These include sexual selection, selection for fecundity in females, niche divergence between the sexes, and allometry, but their relative importance is still not fully understood . Sexual dimorphism in birds can be manifested in size or plumage differences between the sexes. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa, with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case, e.g. birds of prey, hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds. Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or coloration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly colored sex. Such differences have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes. This difference produces a stronger female choice since they have more risk in producing offspring. In some species, the male&#x27;s contribution to reproduction ends at copulation, while in other species the male becomes the main (or only) caregiver. Plumage polymorphisms have evolved to reflect these differences and other measures of reproductive fitness, such as body condition or survival. The male phenotype sends signals to females who then choose the &#x27;fittest&#x27; available male.

Sexual dimorphism is a product of both genetics and environmental factors. An example of sexual polymorphism determined by environmental conditions exists in the red-backed fairywren. Red-backed fairywren males can be classified into three categories during breeding season: black breeders, brown breeders, and brown auxiliaries. These differences arise in response to the bird&#x27;s body condition: if they are healthy they will produce more androgens thus becoming black breeders, while less healthy birds produce less androgens and become brown auxiliaries. The reproductive success of the male is thus determined by his success during each year&#x27;s non-breeding season, causing reproductive success to vary with each year&#x27;s environmental conditions.

Migratory patterns and behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms. This aspect also stems back to size dimorphism in species. It has been shown that the larger males are better at coping with the difficulties of migration and thus are more successful in reproducing when reaching the breeding destination. When viewing this from an evolutionary standpoint, many theories and explanations come into consideration. If these are the result for every migration and breeding season, the expected results should be a shift towards a larger male population through sexual selection. Sexual selection is strong when the factor of environmental selection is also introduced. Environmental selection may support a smaller chick size if those chicks were born in an area that allowed them to grow to a larger size, even though under normal conditions they would not be able to reach this optimal size for migration. When the environment gives advantages and disadvantages of this sort, the strength of selection is weakened and the environmental forces are given greater morphological weight. The sexual dimorphism could also produce a change in timing of migration leading to differences in mating success within the bird population. When the dimorphism produces that large of a variation between the sexes and between the members of the sexes, multiple evolutionary effects can take place. This timing could even lead to a speciation phenomenon if the variation becomes strongly drastic and favorable towards two different outcomes. Sexual dimorphism is maintained by the counteracting pressures of natural selection and sexual selection. For example, sexual dimorphism in coloration increases the vulnerability of bird species to predation by European sparrowhawks in Denmark. Presumably, increased sexual dimorphism means males are brighter and more conspicuous, leading to increased predation. Moreover, the production of more exaggerated ornaments in males may come at the cost of suppressed immune function. So long as the reproductive benefits of the trait due to sexual selection are greater than the costs imposed by natural selection, then the trait will propagate throughout the population. Reproductive benefits arise in the form of a larger number of offspring, while natural selection imposes costs in the form of reduced survival. This means that even if the trait causes males to die earlier, the trait is still beneficial so long as males with the trait produce more offspring than males lacking the trait. This balance keeps dimorphism alive in these species and ensures that the next generation of successful males will also display these traits that are attractive to females.

Such differences in form and reproductive roles often cause differences in behavior. As previously stated, males and females often have different roles in reproduction. The courtship and mating behavior of males and females are regulated largely by hormones throughout a bird&#x27;s lifetime. Activational hormones occur during puberty and adulthood and serve to &#x27;activate&#x27; certain behaviors when appropriate, such as territoriality during breeding season. Organizational hormones occur only during a critical period early in development, either just before or just after hatching in most birds, and determine patterns of behavior for the rest of the bird&#x27;s life. Such behavioral differences can cause disproportionate sensitivities to anthropogenic pressures. Females of the whinchat in Switzerland breed in intensely managed grasslands. Earlier harvesting of the grasses during the breeding season lead to more female deaths. Populations of many birds are often male-skewed and when sexual differences in behavior increase this ratio, populations decline at a more rapid rate. Also not all male dimorphic traits are due to hormones like testosterone, instead they are a naturally occurring part of development, for example plumage. In addition, the strong hormonal influence on phenotypic differences suggests that the genetic mechanism and genetic basis of these sexually dimorphic traits may involve transcription factors or cofactors rather than regulatory sequences.

Sexual dimorphism may also influence differences in parental investment during times of food scarcity. For example, in the blue-footed booby, the female chicks grow faster than the males, resulting in booby parents producing the smaller sex, the males, during times of food shortage. This then results in the maximization of parental lifetime reproductive success. In Black-tailed Godwits &quot;Limosa limosa limosa&quot; females are also the larger sex, and the growth rates of female chicks are more susceptible to limited environmental conditions.

Sexual dimorphism may also only appear during mating season; some species of birds only show dimorphic traits in seasonal variation. The males of these species will molt into a less bright or less exaggerated color during the off-breeding season. This occurs because the species is more focused on survival than on reproduction, causing a shift into a less ornate state. 

Consequently, sexual dimorphism has important ramifications for conservation. However, sexual dimorphism is not only found in birds and is thus important to the conservation of many animals. Such differences in form and behavior can lead to sexual segregation, defined as sex differences in space and resource use. Most sexual segregation research has been done on ungulates, but such research extends to bats, kangaroos, and birds. Sex-specific conservation plans have even been suggested for species with pronounced sexual segregation.

The term sesquimorphism (the Latin numeral prefix &quot;sesqui&quot;- means one-and-one-half, so halfway between &quot;mono&quot;- (one) and &quot;di&quot;- (two)) has been proposed for bird species in which &quot;both sexes have basically the same plumage pattern, though the female is clearly distinguishable by reason of her paler or washed-out Examples include Cape sparrow (&quot;Passer melanurus&quot;), rufous sparrow (subspecies &quot;P. motinensis motinensis&quot;), and saxaul sparrow (&quot;P. ammodendri&quot;).

== Non-avian dinosaurs ==

Examining fossils of non-avian dinosaurs in search of sexually dimorphic characteristics requires the supply of complete and articulated skeletal and tissue remains. As terrestrial organisms, dinosaur carcasses are subject to ecological and geographical influence that inevitably constitutes the degree of preservation. The availability of well-preserved remains is not a probable outcome as a consequence of decomposition and fossilization. Some paleontologists have looked for sexual dimorphism among dinosaurs using statistics and comparison to ecologically or phylogenetically related modern animals.

Apatosaurus and Diplodocus

Female &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; had interconnected caudal vertebrae that allowed them to keep their tails elevated to aid in copulation. Discovering that this fusion occurred in only 50% of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus&quot; skeletons and 25% of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skeletons indicated that this is a sexually dimorphic trait.

Theropoda

It has been hypothesized that male theropods possessed a retractable penis, a feature similar to modern day crocodilians. Crocodilian skeletons were examined to determine whether there is a skeletal component that is distinctive between both sexes, to help provide an insight on the physical disparities between male and female theropods. Findings revealed the caudal chevrons of male crocodiles, used to anchor the penis muscles, were significantly larger than those of females. There have been criticisms of these findings, but it remains a subject of debate among advocates and adversaries.

Ornithopoda

Studies of sexual dimorphism in hadrosaurs have generally centered on the distinctive cranial crests, which likely provided a function in sexual display. A biometric study of 36 skulls found sexual dimorphism was exhibited in the crest of 3 species of hadrosaurids. The crests could be categorized as full (male) or narrow (female) and may have given some advantage in intrasexual mating-competition.

Ceratopsians

According to Scott D. Sampson, if ceratopsids were to exhibit sexual dimorphism, modern ecological analogues suggest it would be found in display structures, such as horns and frills. No convincing evidence for sexual dimorphism in body size or mating signals is known in ceratopsids, although there is evidence that the more primitive ceratopsian &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot; possessed sexes that were distinguishable based on frill and nasal prominence size. This is consistent with other known tetrapod groups where midsized animals tend to exhibit markedly more sexual dimorphism than larger ones. However, it has been proposed that these differences can be better explained by intraspecific and ontogenic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. In addition, many sexually dimorphic traits that may have existed in ceratopsians include soft tissue variations such as coloration or dewlaps, which would be unlikely to have been preserved in the fossil record.

Stegosaurians

A 2015 study on specimens of &quot;Hesperosaurus&quot; &quot;mjosi&quot; found evidence of sexual dimorphism in the shape of the dermal plates. Two plate morphs were described: one was short, wide, and oval-shaped, the other taller and narrower.

==Mammals==
In 45% of mammal species, males are larger than females, in 39%, males and females are the same size and in 16% of mammals, females are larger than males. Both genes and hormones affect the formation of many animal brains before &quot;birth&quot; (or hatching), and also behaviour of adult individuals. Hormones significantly affect human brain formation, and also brain development at puberty. A 2004 review in &quot;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&quot; observed that &quot;because it is easier to manipulate hormone levels than the expression of sex chromosome genes, the effects of hormones have been studied much more extensively, and are much better understood, than the direct actions in the brain of sex chromosome genes.&quot; It concluded that while &quot;the differentiating effects of gonadal secretions seem to be dominant,&quot; the existing body of research &quot;support the idea that sex differences in neural expression of X and Y genes significantly contribute to sex differences in brain functions and disease.&quot;

===Pinnipeds===

Marine mammals show some of the greatest sexual size differences of mammals, because of sexual selection and environmental factors like breeding location. The mating system of pinnipeds varies from polygamy to serial monogamy. Pinnipeds are known for early differential growth and maternal investment since the only nutrients for newborn pups is the milk provided by the mother. For example, the males are significantly larger (about 10% heavier and 2% longer) than the females at birth in sea lion pups. The pattern of differential investment can be varied principally prenatally and post-natally. &quot;Mirounga leonina&quot;, the southern elephant seal, is one of the most dimorphic mammals.

====Humans====


According to Clark Spencer Larsen, modern day &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; show a range of sexual dimorphism, with average body mass between the sexes differing by roughly 15%. Substantial discussion in academic literature considers potential evolutionary advantages associated with sexual competition (both intrasexual and intersexual), as well as short- and long-term sexual strategies. According to Daly and Wilson, &quot;The sexes differ more in human beings than in monogamous mammals, but much less than in extremely polygamous mammals.&quot;

The average basal metabolic rate is about 6 percent higher in adolescent males than females and increases to about 10 percent higher after puberty. Females tend to convert more food into fat, while males convert more into muscle and expendable circulating energy reserves. According to Tim Hewett, director of research in the department of sports medicine at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, females have, on average, 50–60% of the upper body strength of males, and 80–90% of the lower body strength of males, relative to body size. 

The difference in strength relative to body mass is less pronounced in trained individuals. In Olympic weightlifting, male records vary from 5.5× body mass in the lowest weight category to 4.2× in the highest weight category, while female records vary from 4.4× to 3.8×, a weight-adjusted difference of only 10–20%, and an absolute difference of about 30% (i.e., 492 kg vs 348 kg for unlimited weight classes; see Olympic weightlifting records). A study, carried out by analyzing annual world rankings from 1980 to 1996, found that males&#x27; running times were, on average, 10% faster than females&#x27;, with wider hips being a disadvantage for running. However, females have higher endurance than males. 

In early adolescence, females are on average taller than males (as females tend to go through puberty earlier), but males, on average, surpass them in height in later adolescence and adulthood. In the United States, adult males are on average 9% taller and 16.5% heavier than adult females.

Males typically have larger tracheae and branching bronchi, with about 30 percent greater lung volume per body mass. On average, males have larger hearts, slower heart rates, 10 percent higher red blood cell count, higher hemoglobin, hence greater oxygen-carrying capacity. They also have higher circulating clotting factors (vitamin K, prothrombin and platelets). These differences lead to faster healing of wounds and lower sensitivity to nerve pain after injury. In males, pain-causing injury to the peripheral nerve occurs through the microglia, while in females it occurs through the T cells (except in pregnant women, who follow a male pattern).

Females typically have more white blood cells (stored and circulating), as well as more granulocytes and B and T lymphocytes. Additionally, they produce more antibodies at a faster rate than males, hence they develop fewer infectious diseases and succumb for shorter periods. Ethologists argue that females, interacting with other females and multiple offspring in social groups, have experienced such traits as a selective advantage. Females have a higher sensitivity to pain due to aforementioned nerve differences that increase the sensation, and females thus require higher levels of pain medication after injury. Hormonal changes in females affect pain sensitivity, and pregnant women have the same sensitivity as males. Acute pain tolerance is also more consistent over a lifetime in females than males, despite these hormonal changes. Despite differences in physical feeling, both sexes have similar psychological tolerance to (or ability to cope with and ignore) pain.

In the human brain, a difference between sexes was observed in the transcription of the PCDH11X/Y gene pair unique to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Sexual differentiation in the human brain from the undifferentiated state is triggered by testosterone from the fetal testis. Testosterone is converted to estrogen in the brain through the action of the enzyme aromatase. Testosterone acts on many brain areas, including the SDN-POA, to create the masculinized brain pattern. The brains of pregnant females carrying male fetuses may be shielded from the masculinizing effects of androgen through the action of sex hormone-binding globulin.

The relationship between sex differences in the brain and human behavior is a subject of controversy in psychology and society at large. Many females tend to have a higher ratio of gray matter in the left hemisphere of the brain in comparison to males. Males on average have larger brains than females; however, when adjusted for total brain volume, the gray matter differences between sexes are almost nonexistent. Thus, the percentage of gray matter appears to be more related to brain size than it is to sex. Differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect. Haier &quot;et al.&quot; found in a 2004 study that &quot;men and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance&quot;. (See the sex and intelligence article for more on this subject.) Strict graph-theoretical analysis of the human brain connections revealed that in numerous graph-theoretical parameters (e.g., minimum bipartition width, edge number, the expander graph property, minimum vertex cover), the structural connectome of women are significantly &quot;better&quot; connected than the connectome of men. It was shown that the graph-theoretical differences are due to the sex and not to the differences in the cerebral volume, by analyzing the data of 36 females and 36 males, where the brain volume of each man in the group was smaller than the brain volume of each woman in the group.

Sexual dimorphism was also described in the gene level and shown to extend from the sex chromosomes. Overall, about 6500 genes have been found to have sex-differential expression in at least one tissue. Many of these genes are not directly associated with reproduction, but rather linked to more general biological features. In addition, it has been shown that genes with sex-specific expression undergo reduced selection efficiency, which leads to higher population frequencies of deleterious mutations and contributes to the prevalence of several human diseases.

== Immune function ==
Sexual dimorphism in immune function is a common pattern in vertebrates and also in a number of invertebrates. Most often, females are more &#x27;immunocompetent&#x27; than males. This trait is not consistent among all animals, but differs depending on taxonomy, with the most female-biased immune systems being found in insects. In mammals this results in more frequent and severe infections in males and higher rates of autoimmune disorders in females. One potential cause may be differences in gene expression of immune cells between the sexes. Another explanation is that endocrinological differences between the sexes impact the immune system – for example, testosterone acts as an immunosuppressive agent.

==Cells==
Phenotypic differences between sexes are evident even in cultured cells from tissues. For example, female muscle-derived stem cells have a better muscle regeneration efficiency than male ones. There are reports of several metabolic differences between male and female cells and they also respond to stress differently. These differences align with concepts of cell autonomous sex identity, where cells maintain intrinsic sex-based traits regardless of systemic influences.

==Reproductively advantageous==
In theory, larger females are favored by competition for mates, especially in polygamous species. Larger females offer an advantage in fertility, since the physiological demands of reproduction are limiting in females. Hence there is a theoretical expectation that females tend to be larger in species that are monogamous.
Females are larger in many species of insects, many spiders, many fish, many reptiles, owls, birds of prey and certain mammals such as the spotted hyena, and baleen whales such as blue whale. As an example, in some species, females are sedentary, and so males must search for them. Fritz Vollrath and Geoff Parker argue that this difference in behaviour leads to radically different selection pressures on the two sexes, evidently favouring smaller males. Cases where the male is larger than the female have been studied as well, and require alternative explanations.

One example of this type of sexual size dimorphism is the bat &quot;Myotis nigricans&quot;, (black myotis bat) where females are substantially larger than males in terms of body weight, skull measurement, and forearm length. The interaction between the sexes and the energy needed to produce viable offspring makes it favorable for females to be larger in this species. Females bear the energetic cost of producing eggs, which is much greater than the cost of making sperm by the males. The fecundity advantage hypothesis states that a larger female is able to produce more offspring and give them more favorable conditions to ensure their survival; this is true for most ectotherms. A larger female can provide parental care for a longer time while the offspring matures. The gestation and lactation periods are fairly long in &quot;M. nigricans&quot;, the females suckling their offspring until they reach nearly adult size. They would not be able to fly and catch prey if they did not compensate for the additional mass of the offspring during this time. Smaller male size may be an adaptation to increase maneuverability and agility, allowing males to compete better with females for food and other resources.

Some species of anglerfish also display extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are more typical in appearance to other fish, whereas males are tiny rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems. A male must find a female and fuse with her: he then lives parasitically, becoming little more than a sperm-producing body in what amounts to an effectively hermaphrodite composite organism. A similar situation is found in the Zeus water bug &quot;Phoreticovelia disparata&quot; where the female has a glandular area on her back that can serve to feed a male, which clings to her (although males can survive away from females, they generally are not free-living). This is taken to the logical extreme in the Rhizocephala crustaceans, like the Sacculina, where the male injects itself into the female&#x27;s body and becomes nothing more than sperm producing cells, to the point that the superorder used to be mistaken for hermaphroditic.

Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss &quot;Dicranum&quot; and the liverwort &quot;Sphaerocarpos&quot;. There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signalling from females.

Another complicated example of sexual dimorphism is in &quot;Vespula squamosa&quot;, the southern yellowjacket. In this wasp species, the female workers are the smallest, the male workers are slightly larger, and the female queens are significantly larger than her female workers and male counterparts.

==Evolution==

In 1871, Charles Darwin advanced the theory of sexual selection, which related sexual dimorphism to sexual selection.

The first step towards sexual dimorphism is the size differentiation of sperm and eggs (anisogamy). Anisogamy and the usually large number of small male gametes relative to the larger female gametes usually lies in the development of strong sperm competition, because small sperm enable organisms to produce a large number of sperm, and make males (or male function of hermaphrodites) more redundant.

Volvocine algae have been useful in understanding the evolution of sexual dimorphism and species like the beetle &quot;C. maculatus&quot;, where the females are larger than the males, are used to study its underlying genetic mechanisms.

In many non-monogamous species, the benefit to a male&#x27;s reproductive fitness of mating with multiple females is large, whereas the benefit to a female&#x27;s reproductive fitness of mating with multiple males is small or nonexistent. In these species, there is a selection pressure for whatever traits enable a male to have more matings. The male may therefore come to have different traits from the female.
These traits could be ones that allow him to fight off other males for control of territory or a harem, such as large size or weapons; or they could be traits that females, for whatever reason, prefer in mates. Male–male competition poses no deep theoretical questions but mate choice does.

Females may choose males that appear strong and healthy, thus likely to possess &quot;good alleles&quot; and give rise to healthy offspring. In some species, however, females seem to choose males with traits that do not improve offspring survival rates, and even traits that reduce it (potentially leading to traits like the peacock&#x27;s tail). Two hypotheses for explaining this fact are the sexy son hypothesis and the handicap principle.

The sexy son hypothesis states that females may initially choose a trait because it improves the survival of their young, but once this preference has become widespread, females must continue to choose the trait, even if it becomes harmful. Those that do not will have sons that are unattractive to most females (since the preference is widespread) and so receive few matings.

The handicap principle states that a male who survives despite possessing some sort of handicap thus proves that the rest of his genes are &quot;good alleles&quot;. If males with &quot;bad alleles&quot; could not survive the handicap, females may evolve to choose males with this sort of handicap; the trait is acting as a hard-to-fake signal of fitness.

<text>Boris Valentinovich Volynov (; born 18 December 1934) is a Soviet cosmonaut who flew two space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 5, and Soyuz 21. Following the death of Alexei Leonov in October 2019, he is the last surviving member of the original group of cosmonauts. He is also considered to be the first Jew in space.

==Biography==

Volynov was born in Irkutsk in Siberia, but then his family relocated, and he finished secondary school in Prokopyevsk, Kemerovo Oblast, in 1952. The next year he completed basic pilot training in Pavlodar, Kazakhstan, and in 1955 graduated from an aviation school in Novosibirsk. From September 1961 to January 1968 he studied at the faculty of engineering of the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy and graduated with a diploma of a pilot-engineer-cosmonaut. Later in 1980 he defended a PhD at the same academy. After resigning from the space program in 1982, he spent eight years as a senior administrator at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre. After 30 years of service in Star City, in 1990, he retired in the rank of colonel due to age limit.

==Career==

===Voskhod 1===

Volynov was assigned as one of two possible commanders training for Voskhod 1 in 1964, but he and his fellow crewmembers Georgi Katys and Boris Yegorov were bumped three days before the scheduled launch date despite being the prime crew. Sergey Korolyov was reportedly furious about this decision, but was told by Nikita Khrushchev &quot;Don&#x27;t rock the boat – it&#x27;s not worth it!&quot;

===Voskhod 3===
Having lost his chance to fly on the first Voskhod mission, Volynov spent a year training for Voskhod 3. He first trained with Georgi Katys, but Katys was dropped from active status when the KGB discovered his father had been executed in one of Stalin&#x27;s purges. He was then teamed up with Viktor Gorbatko and then Georgi Shonin, but following the death of Sergey Korolyov on 14 January 1966, the Voskhod 3 flight was cancelled just 10 days before launch. Korolyov&#x27;s successor, Vasily Mishin, cancelled the mission as he was intent on concentrating on Soyuz instead. Volynov was subsequently transferred to the Soyuz group and later assigned as a backup for Soyuz 3.

===Soyuz 5===
Soyuz 5 was launched on January 15, 1969, crewed by Volynov, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Yevgeny Khrunov. On 16 January Yeliseyev and Khrunov transferred to Soyuz 4, crewed by Commander Vladimir Shatalov, following an orbital rendezvous and docking. Soyuz 4 undocked from Soyuz 5 the following day and Volynov prepared for a solo re-entry.

Soyuz 5&#x27;s equipment module failed to separate properly following retrofire due to the misfiring of explosive bolts, and consequently blocked the re-entry heat shield on the base of the descent module. As a result of the added mass of the equipment module, Volynov lost control of Soyuz 5 which began to tumble, finally stabilizing itself with the thinnest part of the spacecraft facing forward. As the assembly entered the atmosphere, the stress and heat on the supporting struts between the modules finally made them burn through and part, allowing the equipment module to fall away and burn up on re-entry. Volynov could only wait while the descent module&#x27;s automatic orientation system tried to regain control, which fortunately it managed to do with the heat shield facing forward.

Following re-entry, the module&#x27;s parachutes deployed only partially, and a failure of the soft-landing retrorockets in the base of the descent module caused a hard landing which almost wrecked the module, and broke some of Volynov&#x27;s teeth.

===Soyuz 21===
On July 6, 1976 Volynov and Flight Engineer Vitaliy Zholobov were launched on board Soyuz 21 to spend between 54 and 66 days aboard the space station Salyut 5. Following a deterioration in the health of Zholobov, who was making his first spaceflight, the decision was made to return the crew at the earliest available opportunity and they boarded their Soyuz on August 24. However, as Volynov tried to undock from Salyut, the latch failed to release properly. As he fired the jets to move the spacecraft away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved out of range of ground communications, only the first set of emergency procedures was received. Volynov tried a second time to undock but managed only to slightly loosen the latches. This situation persisted for an entire orbit (90 minutes), then the final set of emergency procedures were received and the latches finally disengaged.

Because Soyuz 21 was returning early, it was outside the normal recovery window, and encountered strong winds as it descended, which caused uneven firing of the retrorockets. It made a hard landing around midnight 200 km southwest of Kokchetav, Kazakhstan. Zholobov&#x27;s illness was apparently caused by nitric acid fumes leaking from the Salyut&#x27;s propellant tanks. However, other reports indicate that the crew failed to properly follow their physical exercise program and suffered from lack of sleep.

==Honours and awards==

*Twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1969, 1976)
*Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR
*Order For Merit to the Fatherland 4th class
*Order of Friendship
*Two Orders of Lenin (1969, 1976)
*Order of the Red Star (1961)
*Order for Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR 3rd class
*Medal &quot;For Distinction in Guarding the State Border of the USSR&quot;
*Order of the Banner of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria
*Medal &quot;Brotherhood in Arms&quot; (Polish People&#x27;s Republic)
* Honorary Citizen of Prokopyevsk

==Family==

His mother, Yevgenia Izrailevna Volynova (1910–1991) was a pediatrician, and received a title of Honored Doctor of Russia. During World War II, she worked as a surgeon. Her Jewish background hindered selection of Volynov for space missions. His wife, Tamara Fyodorovna Savinova (b. 1935) holds a PhD in metallurgy and is a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. They have two children: a son, Andrei (b. 1958) and daughter Tatyana (b. 1965).

<text>Kunming is the capital and largest city of the province of Yunnan in China. The political, economic, communications and cultural centre of the province, Kunming is also the seat of the provincial government. During World War II, Kunming was a Chinese military center and the location of the headquarters for the US Army Forces China-Burma-India. Wujiaba Airport served as the home of the First American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Republic of China Air Force, nicknamed the Flying Tigers. Kunming was also a transport terminus for the Burma Road.

Kunming is at an altitude of above sea level and a latitude just north of the Tropic of Cancer, and is situated in the middle of the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Kunming is the fourth most populous city in Western China, after Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi&#x27;an, and the third most populous city in Southwestern China after Chongqing and Chengdu. As of the 2020 census, Kunming had a total population of 8,460,088 inhabitants, of whom 5,604,310 lived in its built-up (or metro) area made of all urban districts except Jinning. It is at the northern edge of Dian Lake, surrounded by temples and lakes and karst topography.

Kunming consists of an old, previously walled city, a modern commercial district, residential zones, and university areas. The city is also one of the major centers for scientific research and education in Southwestern China. As of 2024, it was listed among the top 100 cities in the world by scientific research output. The city has an astronomical observatory, and its institutions of higher learning include Yunnan University, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming Medical University, Yunnan Normal University, Yunnan Agricultural University and Southwest Forestry University. Kunming is also home to the Golden Temple, China&#x27;s largest bronze temple dating from the Ming dynasty.

Kunming is a major economic center in Western China. The city&#x27;s economic importance derives from its geographical position, as it shares a border with various Southeast Asian countries, serving them as a transportation hub in Southwest China, linking by rail to Vietnam and Laos, and by road to Myanmar and Thailand. This positioning also makes the city an important commercial center of trade in the region. The city also acts as a gateway to Southeast Asia and South Asia, the Kunming Changshui International Airport is one of the top 40-busiest airports in the world. As of 2024, the city is also home to six consulates from ASEAN countries.

The headquarters of many of Yunnan&#x27;s biggest corporations are based in the city, such as Hongta Group, Yunnan Copper Group, Hongyun Group, Yunnan Power Grid Co, and Fudian Bank. Kunming also houses some manufacturing, chiefly the processing of copper, as well as various chemicals, machinery, textiles, paper and cement. Kunming has a nearly 2,400-year history, but its modern prosperity dates only to 1910, when the railway from Hanoi was built. The city has continued to develop rapidly under China&#x27;s modernization efforts. Kunming was designated a special tourism center and, as such, has experienced a proliferation of high-rises and luxury hotels.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Kunming&quot; evolved from the name of an ancient ethnic group called the &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; or &quot;Kunming Barbarian&quot; (). They were a branch of the Di-Qiang people. The &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; lived in the neighbouring region of Erhai Lake during the Western Han dynasty. The Han dynasty incorporated the territory of the Dian Kingdom and set up a commandery called Yizhou in 109 BC; the Han dynasty also incorporated the &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; into Yizhou Commandery soon after. Therefore, &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; expanded east to the Lake Dian area later. &quot;Kunming&quot; has acted as a place name since the Three Kingdoms period, but the reference was not clear because this ethnicity occupied a large region. In the Yuan dynasty, the central government set up &quot;Kunming County&quot; in modern Kunming; the name &quot;Kunming&quot; has continued to this day.

A 2009 research paper proposes that the name &quot;Kunming&quot; of &quot;Kunming Yi&quot; is a cognate word of &quot;Khmer&quot; and &quot;Khmu&quot; that originally meant &quot;people&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Kunming long profited from its position on the caravan route through to Southeast Asia, India and Tibet. Early townships on the southern edge of Lake Dian (outside the contemporary city perimeter) can be dated back to 279 BC, although they have been long lost to history. Early settlements in the area around Lake Dian date back to Neolithic times. The Dian Kingdom, whose original language likely belonged to the Tibeto-Burman languages, was also established near the area.

Dian was subjugated by the Chinese Han dynasty under the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in 109 BC. The Han dynasty incorporated the territory of the Dian Kingdom into their Yizhou Commandery, but left the King of Dian as the local ruler.

The Han dynasty (205 BC–AD 220), seeking control over the Southern Silk Road running to Burma and India, brought small parts of Yunnan into China&#x27;s orbit, but subsequent dynasties could do little to tame what was then a remote and wild borderland until the 13th century. During the Sui dynasty (581–618), two military expeditions were launched against the area, and it was renamed &quot;Kunzhou&quot; in Chinese sources.

=== Medieval China ===

Founded in 765, Kunming was known to the Chinese as &quot;Tuodong&quot; () city in the Kingdom of Nanzhao (737–902) during the 8th and 9th centuries. Tuodong later became part of the successor Kingdom of Dali (937–1253). The possession of Tuodong changed hands when the city came under the control of the Yuan dynasty during its invasion of the southwest in 1252–1253. During the reign of provincial governor Ajall Shams al-Din Omar, a &quot;Chinese Style&quot; city named Zhongjing was founded where modern Kunming is today. Shams al-Din ordered the construction of a Buddhist temple, a Confucian temple, and two mosques in the city. The Confucian temple, doubling as a school, was the first of its kind in Yunnan, attracting students from minority groups across the province. Coupled with his promotion of Confucian ceremonies and customs, Shams al-Din has been largely credited with the sinicization of the region. The city grew as a trading center between the southwest and the rest of China. It is considered by scholars to have been the city of &quot;Yachi Fu&quot; (鸭池府) where people had used cowries as cash and ate their meat raw, as described by the 13th-century Venetian traveler Marco Polo. The area was first dubbed Kunming during the decline of the Yuan Dynasty.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
In the 14th century, Kunming was retaken from Mongolian control when the Ming dynasty defeated the Yuan dynasty. The Ming later built a wall surrounding present-day Kunming. 300 years later, Ming General Wu Sangui defected to Manchu invaders and held the city until his death in 1678, long after the rest of China had fallen under Manchu rule. During the beginning of Qing rule, the entirety of Yunnan and Guizhou were ruled from Kunming and Wu. During the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the seat of Wu&#x27;s newly declared Zhou dynasty was moved to Hengzhou in Hunan. Later in 1678, when Wu died, his grandson Wu Shifan resisted the Qing for two more months before committing suicide, reverting control of the city back into Qing hands. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was the seat of the superior prefecture of Yunnan.

In 1832, the beginnings of a real city were acknowledged within the city walls and there were significant structures within their confines. The founding of the city can therefore be said to have been a predominantly 19th century affair. It was also in this century that the city grew to become the major market and transport centre for the region. Many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were displaced as a result of the 1833 Kunming earthquake.

The rebel leader Du Wenxiu, the Muslim Han Sultan of Dali, attacked and besieged the city several times between 1858 and 1868. A great part of the city&#x27;s wealth did not survive the 1856 Panthay Rebellion, when most of the Buddhist sites in the capital were badly damaged, converted to mosques or razed. Decades later, Kunming began to be influenced by the West, especially from the French Empire. In the late 1800s, the French started to build the Kunming-Haiphong railway between Kunming and Haiphong in what was then French Indochina. In the 1890s, an uprising against working conditions on the Kunming–Haiphong rail line saw many laborers executed after France shipped in weapons to suppress the revolt. The meter-gauge rail line, only completed by around 1911, was designed by the French so that they could tap into Yunnan&#x27;s mineral resources for their colonies in Indochina.

Kunming was a communications center during this time and a junction of two major trading routes, one westward via Dali and Tengchong County into Myanmar, the other southward through Mengzi County to the Red River in Indochina. Eastward, a difficult mountain route led to Guiyang in Guizhou province and thence to Hunan province. To the northeast was a well-established trade trail to Yibin in Sichuan province on the Yangtze River. But these trails were all extremely difficult, passable only by mule trains or pack-carrying porters. 

=== After Qing dynasty ===
Kunming reverted to county status in 1912, under the name Kunming, and became a municipality in 1935. The opening of the Kunming area began in earnest with the completion in 1906–1910 of the Kunming-Haiphong Railway to Haiphong in north Vietnam (part of French Indochina).

Kunming became a treaty port opening to foreign trade in 1908 and became a commercial center soon after. A university was set up in 1922. In the 1930s the first highways connected to Kunming were built, linking Kunming with Chongqing in Sichuan and Guiyang in Guizhou to the east.

The local warlord General Tang Jiyao established the Wujiaba Aerodrome in 1922; an additional 23 airports would be established in Yunnan from 1922 to 1929.

=== Second World War (1937–1945) ===
Kunming was transformed into a modern city as a result of fighting of the Second Sino-Japanese War/World War II in 1937 with the outbreak of the Battles of Shanghai, Nanking and Taiyuan, forcing a great movement of refugees from the north and eastern coastal regions of China, bringing much commerce and industry into the southwest of China, including Kunming. They carried dismantled industrial plants with them, which were then re-erected beyond the range of Japanese bombers. In addition, a number of universities and institutes of higher education were evacuated there. The increased trade and expertise quickly established Kunming as an industrial and manufacturing base for the wartime government in Chongqing. 

As the battles of Shanghai, Taiyuan and Nanjing were lost by the end of 1937, and with Wuhan falling into Japanese occupation by the end of 1938, many more of China&#x27;s military forces and civilians retreated to cities outside the reach of the Japanese military ground forces a year prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939, including the relocation of the Chinese Air Force Academy from Jianqiao Airbase to Kunming&#x27;s Wujiaba Airbase, where the airfield was vastly expanded, becoming the new training hub for the battered but regrouped Chinese Air Force in which Lieutenant General Claire Lee Chennault took command of cadet training duties in the summer of 1938. The Chinese Air Force command established the 41st Pursuit Squadron based in Kunming, also known as the French Volunteer Group squadron in June 1938, and with them they brought Dewoitine D.510 fighters, with the intention of securing the sale of the planes to the Chinese Air Force; the French participated in some combat engagements against Japanese raids, including dogfights against Mitsubishi A5M fighters with Chinese &quot;Hawk III&quot; fighters over Nanchang, but after several setbacks, including a fighter pilot &quot;KIA&quot;, the group was disbanded in October 1938.

Although the Empire of Japan was focusing on ending the Chinese war of resistance at the Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu, Kunming was not out of the reach of Japanese air raids, and faced attacks by IJAAF and IJNAF bombers; military assets and infrastructure were under regular attack, while the RoCAF 18th Fighter Squadron and units of the Air Force Academy at Wujiaba were tasked with aerial defense of Kunming. The city of Kunming was prepared as an alternate National Redoubt in case the temporary capital in Chongqing fell, with an elaborate system of caves to serve as offices, barracks and factories, but it was never utilised. Kunming was to have served again in this role during the ensuing Chinese Civil War, but the Nationalist garrison there switched sides and joined the Communists. Instead, Taiwan would become the last redoubt and home of the Republic of China government, a role it fulfills to this day.

When the city of Nanning fell to the Japanese during the Battle of South Guangxi, China&#x27;s sea-access was cut off. However, the Chinese victory at the Battle of Kunlun Pass kept the Burma Road open. When the Japanese began occupying French Indochina in 1940, the Burma Road that linked Kunming and the outside-world with unoccupied China grew increasingly vital as much of the essential support and materials were imported through Burma. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the start of the Pacific War in December 1941, Kunming acted as an Allied military command center, which grouped the Chinese, American, British and French forces together for operations in Southeast Asia. Kunming became the northern and easternmost terminus of the vital war-supply line into China known as &quot;&quot;The Hump&quot;&#x27;, which stretched over the Himalayas from British bases in India to port-of-entry Kunming. The Office of Strategic Services&#x27; Service Unit Detachment 101 (predecessor to the 1st Special Forces Group) was also headquartered in Kunming. Its mission was to divert and disrupt Japanese combat operations in Burma.
Kunming, the northern terminus of all three of the Burma Road, the Ledo Road, and The Hump supply-line, was increasingly targeted by the IJAAF. When the Burma Road was lost to the Japanese, the Hump became China&#x27;s primary lifeline to the outside world. The 1st American Volunteer Group, known as the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, was based in Kunming and tasked with defense of The Hump supply-line against Japanese aerial interceptions.

Industry became important in Kunming during World War II. The large state-owned Central Machine Works was transferred there from Hunan, while the manufacture of electrical products, copper, cement, steel, paper, and textiles expanded.

=== After World War II ===
Until 1952, Kunming was a walled city. The city government in 1952 ordered hundreds of young people to tear down the wall and use its bricks to make a new road running north–south. To show its appreciation for the young people that demolished the east wall, the city government named the new street, Qingnian Lu, after them. The existence of the walls still echoes today at place names like the district of Xiaoximen () and Beimen Jie (). There are also less obvious connections to the wall, such as Qingnian Lu (), in the location of Kunming&#x27;s east wall.

After 1949, Kunming developed rapidly into an industrial metropolis with the construction of large iron and steel and chemical complexes, along with Chongqing, Chengdu and Guiyang in the southwest. A Minorities&#x27; Institute was set up in the 1950s to promote mutual understanding and access to university education among Yunnan&#x27;s multiethnic population. The city consolidated its position as a supply depot during the Vietnam War and subsequent border clashes. Until Mao Zedong&#x27;s death, in much of the rest of the country Kunming was still generally thought as a remote frontier settlement.
Accordingly, the government utilized Kunming as a place where to exile people who had fallen politically out of favor, especially during the Cultural Revolution.

In 1957, Kunming&#x27;s rail link to Haiphong and Hanoi was re-opened (after being cut during World War II). It was cut again in 1979 and re-opened again in 1996.

Since the economic reforms of the mid-1980s, Kunming has enjoyed increased tourism and foreign investment. Several Thai Chinese banks have offices in Kunming, for example, Kasikorn Bank and Krung Thai Bank. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand has visited Kunming many times to study Chinese culture and promote friendly relations. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, the city center was rebuilt, with Swiss help, in its current &#x27;modern&#x27; style to impress visitors attending the 1999 World Horticultural Exposition. It was primarily during 1997 and 1998 that much of the city&#x27;s roads, bridges and high rises were built. The World Horticultural Expo was widely regarded as a public relations success for Kunming. Today the after-effects of the Expo are apparent in more than just the physical improvements to the city—it was the Expo that made the outside world take notice of Kunming, which was relatively unknown at the time.

In July 2005, the second Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Summit was held in Kunming, with government leaders from China, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam participating. There, China agreed to lend its neighbors more than $1 billion for a series of projects. China promoted GMS cooperation as a first step toward building an eventual China-ASEAN Free Trade Area.

Infrastructure improvements were underway to improve links between Kunming and Southeast Asia in time for the 2010 establishment of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. The FTA made Kunming a trade and financial center for Southeast Asia. In addition to physical improvements to enhance Kunming&#x27;s trade with Southeast Asia, the central and provincial governments have made financial preparations to assist the city&#x27;s emergence. At the end of 2004, the central government approved Kunming to be one of the 18 mainland cities in which foreign banks could conduct business in renminbi. 

In July 2006, talks at the ASEAN Regional Forum, China, Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma) agreed to construct a highway from Kunming to Chittagong through Mandalay for trade and development.

On 1 March 2014, 29 people were killed, and more than 130 were injured at Kunming Railway Station in a terrorist attack.

== Geography ==


Kunming is located in east-central Yunnan province. It is located between north latitude 24°23&#x27; and 26°22&#x27; N, and east longitude 102°10&#x27; and 103°40&#x27; E, with a total area of . Its widest stretch from the east to the west amounts to and its largest expansion from the north to the south amounts to .

Situated in a fertile lake basin on the northern shore of the Lake Dian and surrounded by mountains to the north, west, and east, Kunming has always played a pivotal role in the communications of southwestern China. Lake Dian, known as &quot;the Pearl of the Plateau&quot;, is the largest lake in Yunnan and the sixth largest fresh water lake in China. It has an area of approximately . Kunming&#x27;s highest point is Mazong Ridge of the Jiaozi Snow Mountain in Luquan with an elevation of , and its lowest point is the joint of the Xiao River and the Jinsha River in Dongchuan District, with an elevation of . Its downtown area is above sea level.

About southeast of the city centre is the Stone Forest in Shilin County, a karst formation developed as a tourist attraction consisting of rock caves, arches, and pavilions. It is part of the larger karst-based landscape of the area.

== Climate ==
Located at an elevation of on the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau with low latitude and high elevation, Kunming has one of the mildest climates in China, characterized by short, cool dry winters with mild days and crisp nights, and long, balmy and humid summers. With its perpetual spring-like weather which provides the ideal climate for plants and flowers, Kunming is known as the &quot;City of Eternal Spring&quot;. The weather has seldom reached high temperatures in summer, only exceeding on a handful of occasions. However, freak snowfalls occur in occasional winters. Controlled by a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;), the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in June, with daily high temperatures reaching their lowest point and peak in December and May, respectively. The city is covered with blossoms and lush vegetation all-year round. The period from May to October is the monsoon season and the rest of the year is dry. The city has an annual mean temperature of , rainfall of (nearly three-fifths occurring from June to August) and a frost-free period of 230 days. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in July to 69% in February and March, the city receives 2,198 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme temperatures in the city have ranged from on 29 December 1983 and 25 May 2014 respectively.

=== Natural resources ===

Mineral resources include phosphorus, salt, magnesium, titanium, coal, quartz sand, clay, silica, copper. Phosphorus and salt mines are the most plentiful. Kunyang Phosphorus Mine is one of the three major phosphorus mines in the country. Rock salt reserves are and mirabilite reserves are . Dongchuan is a major copper production base.

Proven reserves of Coal bed gas is about , equal to of standard coal. Geothermal resources are widely distributed.

=== Environment and horticulture ===

Kunming has of lawns, trees and flowers, averaging per capita and a green space rate of 21.7 percent. The city&#x27;s smoke control area is and noise control area . 

Kunming is a significant horticultural center in China, providing products such as grain, wheat, horsebeans, corn, potato and fruit such as peaches, apples, oranges, grapes and chestnuts. Kunming is world-famous for its flowers and flower-growing exports. More than 400 types of flowers are commonly grown in Kunming. The camellia, Yulan magnolia, azalea, fairy primrose, lily and orchid are known as the six famous flowers of the city.

The camellia was confirmed by the Municipality of Kunming as its city flower in 1983.

The Kunming city government plans to create an environmental trial court to deal with environment-related lawsuits. It is to be part of the city&#x27;s intermediate people&#x27;s court and will have jurisdiction over appeals by companies that have been found guilty of violating environmental laws in cities throughout Yunnan.

== Demographics ==

The population of Han is 5,542,314, accounting for 86.16%; the population of all ethnic minorities add up to 889,898, accounting for 13.84%. Some of the 26 nationalities in the province live in Kunming, and the average life expectancy of the city&#x27;s population is 76 years old.


== Cityscape ==

The city center has three major squares and six major streets: Jinma Biji Square, Nanping Square and Dongfeng Square are the main squares, while Nanping Street, Zhengyi Road, Renmin Road, Dongfeng Road, Jinbi Road, and Qingnian Road are the main streets. While Beijing Road is arguably the main street of the city as a whole, it runs to the east of the city center. Jingxing Street, Guanghua Street, Zhengyi Road, Nanping Street, Qingnian Road, and Renmin Road are the main commercial areas in Kunming; the most popular pedestrian streets are Nanping Street, Zhengyi Road, and Jingxing Street.

Kunming&#x27;s modern city center is Nanping Square on the west bank of the Panlong River, at the intersection of Nanping Street and Zhengyi Street. This area is where Kunming&#x27;s southern city wall once stood. Rapidly being modernized, this area is a crowded and dense shopping precinct packed with clothing and electronics stores. Surrounding the area are plenty of new high-rises. The area formerly considered the city center is Dongfeng Square, located on the east bank of the Panlong River outside of the old city walls at the intersection of Beijing Road and Dongfeng Road, where in the mornings there are crowds doing taijiquan and playing badminton. Weekend amateur theatre is also performed in the square. The Panlong River has had an artificial flow ever since the construction of the Songhua Dam, and the river has been developed into effectively a canal. The river receives sewage and wastewater from surrounding pipes.

The center is an area of importance to Kunming&#x27;s Hui population, with Shuncheng Street, one of the last old streets in the center of the city, previously forming a Muslim quarter. Until shortly before 2005, this street was full of wind-dried beef and mutton carcasses, pitta bread and raisin sellers, and huge woks of roasting coffee beans being stirred with shovels. Under Kunming&#x27;s rapid modernisation, however, the street has been demolished to make way for apartments and shopping centers. Rising behind a supermarket one block north off Zhengyi Road, Nancheng Qingzhen Si is the city&#x27;s new mosque, its green dome and chevron-patterned minaret visible from afar and built on the site of an earlier Qing edifice.

Running west off Zhengyi Road just past the mosque, Jingxing Street leads into one of the more bizarre corners of the city, with Kunming&#x27;s huge Bird and Flower Market convening daily in the streets connecting it with the northerly, parallel Guanghua Street. The market offers many plants such as orchids that have been collected and farmed across the province. In the small grounds of a now vanished Confucian temple off the western end of Changchun Road, there is an avenue of pines, an ancient pond and pavilion, and beds of bamboo, azaleas and potted palms.

Jinbi Road runs south of Dongfeng Road. Both of them connect to Beijing Road. Two large Chinese pagodas rise south of Jinbi Road and the city center, each a solid thirteen stories of whitewashed brick crowned with four iron cockerels. The West Pagoda was built between 824 and 859, during the Tang dynasty; its original counterpart, the East Pagoda, was built at the same time, but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1833 and rebuilt in the same Tang style in 1882. South down Dongsi Road, past another mosque, the entrance to the West Pagoda is along a narrow lane on the right. The East Pagoda is a more cosmetic, slightly tilted duplicate standing in an ornamental garden a few minutes&#x27; walk east on Shulin Jie. The temples associated with both pagodas are closed to the public.

Many streets are lined with Jacaranda trees, which can be seen blooming abundantly in mid to late April, particularly on Jiaochang Middle Road. The trees are not native to Kunming, but originate from seeds exchanged with Algeria, which were grown in the Kunming Botanical Garden. Seeds from the botanical garden were then used by the city to plant the trees along streets.
=== Parks ===

Cuihu Park (Green Lake Park) is one of Kunming&#x27;s major parks and is predominately a lake surrounded by greenery. Located in the west side of the park is a statue of Nie Er, the composer of China&#x27;s national anthem.

Daguan Park lies on Dian Chi in Kunming&#x27;s southwestern limits. Originally laid out by the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, it has been modified over the years to include a noisy funfair, food stalls and emporiums.

Kunming&#x27;s zoo, founded in 1950, is adjoined to Yuantong Park. The zoo houses 5,000 animals from 140 species and receives 3 million visitors a year.

Other parks in Kunming include Black Dragon Pool and the Kunming Botanical Gardens in the north, along with Wenmiao Tea Garden in Wuhua District.

=== Landmarks ===

The World Horti-Expo Garden is located in the northern suburbs of Kunming and was build for the 1999 World Horticulture Exposition, which ran from 1 May to 31 October 1999. It had the theme of &quot;Man and Nature—Marching Toward the 21st Century&quot;. Golden Temple Park, located on Mingfeng Hill nearby, is connected by cable car to the World Horti-Expo Garden. Constructed in 1602 (the 30th year of the Wanli reign period of the Ming dynasty), all of its beams, pillars, arches, doors, windows, tiles, Buddhist statues, and horizontal inscribed boards are made of copper, weighing more than 200 tons. It is the largest copper building in China. 

Yuantong Temple is Kunming&#x27;s major Buddhist temple. It is Kunming&#x27;s largest and most famous temple with the original structure being first constructed more than 1,200 years ago during the Tang dynasty. The temple sits in a depression on the southern side of Yuantong Park. Northwest about from the city center is the Qiongzhu Si (Bamboo Temple) built in 639 and rebuilt in 1422 to 1428. Numerous Buddhist temples line the road to the Dragon Gate () in the Western Mountains.

Notable museums in Kunming include:
* Yunnan Provincial Museum

== Administrative divisions ==

The prefecture-level city of Kunming has jurisdiction over 14 subdivisions; seven districts, one county-level city, three counties and three autonomous counties.
Kunming also borders with Panzhihua prefecture level city and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan province.

The historical city and current city center of Kunming is in southeastern Wuhua District, close to where the four main districts converge. However, after integrating it into Kunming in 2011, the Kunming city government has built a masterplanned new city center in Chenggong District and moved the city government offices there.

Kunming plans to add two new districts (Chenggong and Jinning) to its existing four urban districts (Panlong, Wuhua, Guandu, Xishan) over the next few years.

== Society and culture ==
=== Leisure and entertainment ===
Within Kunming, the entertainment district has its focus around Kundu Square, with many cinemas, bars, clubs and restaurants. Food aside, one feature of less formal Yunnanese restaurants is that they often have a communal bamboo water pipe and tobacco for their customers. There are plenty of student bars and clubs. The city has several operatic troupes and indigenous entertainments which include &quot;huadeng&quot;, a lantern dance. Although indoor performances are lacking, there are often informal shows at the weekend outside the Workers&#x27; Cultural Hall and in Cuihu Park. There are similar shows at the Yunnan Arts Theater on Dongfeng Xi Lu. Kunming&#x27;s main cinema house is on the south side of the Dongfeng Lu/Zhengyi Lu intersection. The other main multiplex, the XJS, at the junction of Wenlin Jie and Dongfeng Xi Lu.

=== Language ===

The Kunming dialect is very similar to that of Sichuan and Guizhou but uses the third tone much less than standard Chinese. Many terms are used only in Kunming dialect, such as &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;terrific&#x27;.

The pronunciations of certain Chinese characters are very different from Mandarin Chinese. For example, &quot; (fish)&quot; would be pronounced as &quot;yi&quot; in Kunming dialect instead of &quot;yu&quot; in Mandarin Chinese; &quot; (street)&quot; would be pronounced as &quot;gai&quot; instead of &quot;jie&quot;.

When someone speaks Mandarin Chinese with a strong Kunming accent, it&#x27;ll be called Mapu (), short for Majie (, a place in Kunming) Mandarin Chinese.

The Kunming Dialect is slowly dying due to it being &#x27;informal&#x27; and is being replaced by Mandarin Chinese. Nevertheless, it is still spoken by a decent number of residents today. Sometimes this is called dirt language or slum language (土话)

=== Tourism ===

Kunming attracts domestic and foreign tourists year-round. At the center of Yunnan and as its capital, Kunming is also a transport hub for tourists heading to other parts of Yunnan such as Dali, Lijiang and Shangrila.

Conference and exhibition venues in Kunming include the Kunming International Convention and Exhibition Center and the Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Hall.

Kingdom of the Little People, a theme park featuring performers with dwarfism, is also located near Kunming.

Other famous attractions include Stone Forest and Yunnan&#x27;s Ethnic Village.

== Sports ==

Every year, many Chinese and international athletes come to Kunming for high-altitude training. The city has been China&#x27;s national high-elevation training base for more than 30 years. There are two major training complexes, Hongta Sports Center and Haigeng National Training Center.

Hongta Sports Center was built in 2000 by Hongta (Red Pagoda) cigarette company, at a cost of US$58 million. Located near Haigeng Park, the complex is mostly used by professional athletes, but also acts as a sports club for the general public. Every weekend, it hosts amateur football matches. Aside from about 10 football pitches, including one surrounded by a running track, Hongta also has a swimming pool, a badminton gymnasium, tennis courts and a basketball court. It also has one of China&#x27;s few ice hockey rinks, and a workout room with treadmills and weightlifting machines. There are also game rooms for air hockey; also pool tables and a basement bowling alley. The complex comes complete with a 101-room hotel and restaurant.

Haigeng National Training Center is located ten minutes away from Hongta on Dianchi (Lake Dian) near Kunming&#x27;s award-winning Lakeview Golf Club and new condominium developments. This complex dates from the late 1970s and was built by the government specifically to specialize in high-altitude training.

=== Golf ===

Golf is a major attraction in Kunming. There are four golf courses within an hour&#x27;s drive of downtown. For the last six years , Spring City Golf and Lake Resort in nearby Yiliang County has reigned as the best golf course in China and Hong Kong according to &quot;US Golf Digest&quot;. In 2004, it was named Asia&#x27;s best golf resort by &quot;Asian Golf Monthly&quot;. It hosts the Kunming Leg of the Omega China Tour.

Kunming has attracted foreign investment in golf course development. &quot;Spring City&quot; Golf Resort is a US$600 million project that began as an investment led by Singapore&#x27;s Keppel Land Group in 1992. Jack Nicklaus and course designer Robert Trent Jones, Jr designed the two courses.

== Economy ==

Kunming has three economic advantages over other cities in southwest China: significant natural resources, a large consumer market and a mild climate. Due to its position at the center of Yunnan, one of China&#x27;s largest producers of agricultural products, minerals and hydroelectricity, Kunming is the main commercial hub for most of the province&#x27;s resources.

Kunming&#x27;s chief industries are copper, lead and zinc production. Its iron and steel industry has been expanded. Salt and phosphate mines around Kunming are some of the largest in China. Yunnan Copper Company Limited, based in Kunming, is one of Yunnan&#x27;s largest mining corporations. From the late 1970s, Kunming&#x27;s main industries also came to include food and tobacco processing and the manufacture of construction equipment and machines. 

In May 1995, the State Council approved Kunming as an Open City. By the end of 1995, the city had approved 929 overseas-funded enterprises with a total investment of $2.3 billion including $1.1 billion of foreign capital. More than 40 projects each had an investment of more than $9 million.

Kunming is a center of engineering and the manufacture of machine tools, electrical machinery, equipment and automobiles (including heavy goods vehicles). It has a chemical industry, and plastics, cement works and textile factories. Its processing plants, which include tanneries, woodworking and papermaking factories, use local agricultural products. In 1997, Yunnan Tire Co. opened a tire plant in Kunming, with a capacity to produce two million tires per year. 

=== Development zones ===

Kunming has two major development zones, Kunming High-tech Industrial Development Zone (biological medicine, new materials, electronic information, photoelectron, agriculture) and Kunming Economic and Technology Development Zone (mechanical equipment production, biological science and food industry, information industry, software).

=== Industrial parks ===

There are 30 key industrial parks promulgated and recognized by National Development and Reform Commission in Yunnan Province.

The largest include:
* Chenggong Industrial Park
* Anning Industrial Park
* Songming Yanglin Industrial Development Zone
* Dongchuan Special Industrial Park
* Xundian Special Industrial Park
* Kunming Haikou Industrial Park.

=== Companies ===

, Kunming is home to 65 of the Top 100 Enterprises in Yunnan Province. The top 100 enterprises were based on their revenues for 2007. Hongta Group, with revenues of some RMB39.88 billion for 2007 topped the list. The tobacco sector remains the largest sector in the province.

=== Flower industry ===

Yunnan has developed into the largest flower export base in Asia, with many Dutch experts having transferred technology to the area. The Dounan Flower Market, located in suburban Kunming, is the largest in China with daily sales of 2.5 million yuan (US$300,000) from the 2 million sprays of flowers (). The provincial government agency, the Yunnan Flower Association, regulates the industry.

=== Logistics ===

Kunming East Station is at present Yunnan province&#x27;s only container handling depot, with direct links to only three provinces; Guangdong, Guizhou and Sichuan. It also has direct access to the metropolitan district of Chongqing.

The Jiaying Depot is connected with the new system of highways built linking Yunnan to the increasingly important markets of Southeast Asia, facilitating cheap Chinese exports to the region and granting resource-poor China greater access to the region&#x27;s massive raw material resources. Yunnan has thereby become a progressively important area in the Southwest&#x27;s rail logistics both in terms of national and international logistics.

== Solar energy ==
In July 2008, Kunming began to implement a program to transform the city&#x27;s solar energy industry into a US$8.8 billion industrial base in China by 2013. Kunming receives an annual average sunshine of more than 2,400 hours. Each 1 kW PV system has the potential to generate 1500 kilowatt-hours of electricity a year from solar energy. 

, the Kunming Economic Committee listed about 130 solar energy enterprises in the city. Of these, 118 enterprises produce solar lamps and solar water heaters, with a combined total production value of about US$43.8 million, and 10 enterprises are engaged in solar photovoltaic cells manufacturing, with a total production value of about US$51.2 million.

Suntech Power announced in December 2008 that it was jointly constructing a solar energy project with Yunnan Provincial Power Investment and other investors. The 1MW first-phase of the Shilin 66MW on-grid solar power station began generating power on 28 December 2009. The initial phase of the 66MW project was originally scheduled to start production in first half of 2010 while the 20MW second phase and 36 MW third phase were under construction.

== Transport ==

Kunming is situated on the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Rail and air are the main two methods to travel to or from Kunming from outside Yunnan.

=== Air transport ===
Kunming has air connections with several Chinese and Southeast Asian cities. Kunming is served by Kunming Changshui International Airport (KMG), which opened in June 2012, replacing the older international airport, which was located southeast of central Kunming.

=== Highway ===


China National Highways 108, 213 and 320 intersect in Kunming. Highways link Kunming to Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, and provide Yunnan province access to seaports of Southeast Asia.

=== Rail ===

Kunming is the main rail hub of Yunnan province. The Chengdu–Kunming railway from Sichuan, Shanghai–Kunming railway from Guizhou, and Nanning–Kunming railway from Guangxi converge in Kunming from the north, northeast and east. The Yunnan–Vietnam Railway runs from Kunming southeast to Hekou and Lao Cai on the Sino-Vietnamese border and then on to Haiphong The Kunming–Yuxi railway runs south to Yuxi, where a second rail line to Vietnam is being planned and built. To the west of Kunming, the Guangtong–Dali railway extends off the Chengdu–Kunming Line to Dali (Xiaguan Town).

Kunming has three major railway stations:
*Kunming railway station is at the southern end of Beijing Xi Lu. Compared with the other railway station (North Railway Station), Kunming Railway Station services most of the &quot;conventional&quot; (not high-speed) trains to places to other provinces of China. Trains run north to Chengdu, southeast via Xingyi to Baise and Nanning in Guangxi, and east through Guizhou, via Liupanshui, Anshun, Guiyang, into the rest of the country.
*Kunming South railway station, opened at the end of 2016, is located in Chenggong District, many miles southeast from the historical city center. It is the western terminal of the Shanghai–Kunming high-speed railway and the Guangzhou–Nanning–Kunming high-speed railway, and has high-speed service to destinations along these lines and elsewhere on the nation&#x27;s high-speed network.
*Kunming North railway station (serviced by the No. 23 Bus) is on the heritage Kunming–Hai Phong Railway, which runs to Hekou and Vietnam. Most of the station has been converted into a museum. Due to the deterioration of the railway line, the long distance narrow-gauge service has been cancelled; however, , some local narrow gauge service still operates at Kunming North Railway Station, in particular two daily trains to Shizui () Station on the western outskirts of Kunming, and to Wangjiaying () east of the city.

As of 2017, railway development projects continue to proceed in the Kunming metropolitan area. In February 2017, the railway authorities announced that a connector between the new Kunming South railway station and the old Kunming railway station (also known as the Nanyao Station; ) will open by the end of 2017, making it possible for some high-speed train to serve Kunming railway station as well.

==== Urban rail plan ====
In May 2010, Kunming began construction on its first urban rail lines, line 1 and 2 of the Kunming Metro. An elevated test section had been under construction since 2009. Parts of lines 1 and 2 opened in April 2014. Construction on line 3 began in August 2010 and the Phase 1 was completed in 2018. The entire system consisting of 6 lines and covering a total of is estimated to be complete by 2018.

=== Road and transit ===

Yunnan has built a comprehensive highway system with roads reaching almost all the major cities or towns in the region. Bus travel across the region is extensive. Buses head from Kunming to destinations such as Dali and Lijiang several times a day.

There are four major long-distance bus stations in Kunming with the South Bus Station and Railway Square Bus Station being the most primary.
* South Bus Station faces the Kunming Railway Station in Beijing Xi Lu, with standard, luxury, express and sleeper buses departing for all over Yunnan and neighboring provinces.
* Railway Square Bus Station is smaller than SBS and the majority of the buses depart from the station are private-run. Usually no fixed schedules are available and buses will leave when they are full. There are standard and sleeper services to Dali, Jinghong and elsewhere in Yunnan.

Leaving China by road into Vietnam and Laos is also possible through the respective crossings at Hekou in southeastern Yunnan or Bian Mao Zhan in Xishuangbanna.

The Kunming–Bangkok Expressway is the first expressway from China to Bangkok via Laos. The long Kunming–Bangkok Expressway begins at Kunming going down to Ban Houayxay in Laos; it then crosses the Mekong River to Chiangkhong in Thailand and eventually reaches Bangkok.

At the 14th Greater Mekong Subregion Ministerial Conference in July 2007, China, Laos and Thailand signed an agreement on the construction of a new bridge over the Mekong River to connect Chiangkhong in Thailand and Ban Houayxay in Laos, to the Kunming–Bangkok Highway. The completion of the new bridge over the Mekong River will help connect China&#x27;s southeast provinces with Bangkok. With capital investments from both China and Thailand, the bridge is expected to be completed in 2011 and will be the last link in the highway system that winds through the Mekong River region.

==== Local transit ====

Public buses and taxis are the two main means of transport within the city. A metro system is currently under construction (see Kunming Metro).

Nearly two hundred public bus lines crisscross the city center, covering the whole prefecture.

Cycling is common, and many hotels around the Kunming Railway Station provide bicycle rental services.

Conscious of its growing traffic issues, the city is currently renovating a pedestrian-friendly city centre.

==== Central Kunming ====

The city hangs off two main thoroughfares: Beijing Lu forms the north–south axis, passing just east of the center as it runs for between the city&#x27;s two trains stations; while Dongfeng Lu crosses it halfway along, divided into east (Dongfeng Dong Lu), middle (Dongfeng Zhong Lu) and west (Dongfeng Xi Lu) sections as it cuts right through the business center. The far end runs out of the city as Renmin Xi Lu, the first leg of the Burma Road. Most of the city&#x27;s famous hotels and foreign consulates lies along Dongfeng Dong Lu and the southern half of Beijing Lu, while the majority of specific landmarks and shopping district are north and west of the center around Dongfeng Xi Lu and Cuihu Park (Green Lake Park). Circling most of this is the city&#x27;s first highway ring road, Huancheng Lu, though others are planned.

Kunming has a pivotal role as a major conduit point in international drug trafficking as it is the closest major Chinese city to the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia. The Kunming Municipal Public Security Bureau Narcotics Squad is the specialist counter-narcotics police service.

Police confiscated at least three tons of drugs in Yunnan in 2005. Yunnan province seized 10 tons of illegal drugs in 2006, accounting for 80 percent of the total drugs confiscated nationwide during the period, according to Sun Dahong, then deputy director of Yunnan&#x27;s provincial Public Security Bureau. The total is more than double the amount seized in the province in 2005.

Heroin and methamphetamine seem to be the main targets of the 30,000+ strong anti-drug police in Yunnan. The majority of heroin coming into China from the Golden Triangle passes through Dali from where it is then distributed to the rest of China and internationally via China&#x27;s coastal cities.

<doc id="197183" wikidata="Q654848" url="?curid=197183" title="John Henry Lewis">
<text>John Henry Lewis (May 1, 1914 – April 18, 1974) was a hall of fame American boxer who held the World Light Heavyweight Boxing Title from 1935 to 1938. &quot;The Ring&quot; boxing magazine named Lewis the 16th greatest light heavyweight of all time. His trainer was Larry Amadee, and his managers included Ernie Lira, Larry White, Frank Schuler and Gus Greenlee.

==Early life==
Lewis was born in Los Angeles on May 4, 1914, to Mattie Drake Foster and John Edward Lewis. The family settled in Phoenix, Arizona, where he grew up and was taught to box at an early age by his father, a former lightweight who ran a Phoenix gym. Lewis claimed a great-uncle was the noted bare-knuckle brawler Tom Molineaux.

Lewis battled in exhibition &quot;midget boxing&quot; matches at the age of five. Turning professional as a welterweight at 14, he gained a reputation for speed and rapidly improving scientific boxing skill.

==Early career==
Lewis began his professional career in 1928, beating Buster Grant by a four-round decision in Phoenix, where he fought his first fourteen bouts. In 1931, he traveled to Prescott, to fight Sam Terrain on March 11. This proved to be a tragic event, as Terrain later died from the blows received during Lewis&#x27; fourth round knockout win.

On July 1, 1931, he won his first title, the USA Arizona State Middleweight Championship, in an eight-round points decision against Lloyd Phillips, in Mesa, Arizona. The crowd violently resented the ruling, possibly as a result of racial basis, but the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; called the ruling &quot;eminently just&quot;.

Lewis faced future World Heavyweight champion, James J. Braddock on September 21, 1932, defeating him in a ten-round points decision at Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Though only eighteen and still in school at the time of the fight, he took nine of the ten rounds by wide margins. Braddock forced the fighting to take the seventh round.

Taking a break from his high school studies, Lewis won a ten-round decision over Lou Scozza, a veteran Light Heavyweight contender, on October 26, 1932, in San Francisco. He was awarded six of the ten rounds, despite a half-inch cut over his right eye received in the second. According to most accounts, Scozza had an edge in the fourth and tenth, while the third and ninth were even. Lewis landed cleaner punches and in three rounds sent Scozza back on his heels with strong rights to the jaw. Lewis nearly dropped Scozza in the seventh, and in the eighth scored a terrific right to the jaw that landed him on the ropes.

In 1934, Lewis had 12 bouts, going 9–1–2. On September 20 of that year, he made an unsuccessful attempt at the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight title in Portland, Oregon, but drew with Young Firpo in ten rounds. The first six rounds were extremely close, but in the seventh, eighth, and ninth, Firpo gained a moderate points margin. In the seventh, Firpo used his unorthodox punches to pull ahead, and in the eighth and ninth, he used aggressive rights and lefts to Lewis&#x27;s body and chin. In round ten, Lewis rallied with a two-fisted attack to secure the draw decision. When John Henry unexpectedly lowered his punches, a tiring Firpo succumbed to a body attack. Two lefts and a stiff right to the head gained Lewis a slight lead, but Firpo recovered, and the brisk fighting looked even at the final bell.

Light Heavyweight contender Yale Okun became Lewis&#x27;s third-round technical knockout victim in Madison Square Garden on November 23, 1934. In the first two rounds, Okun made a fair showing and prevented Lewis from gaining a points margin. Okun was first staggered by a whizzing right to the face in the third, and after another of Lewis&#x27;s rights dropped him for a nine-count, the referee called the fight. This bout, and a previous victory against Lewis, were two of Okun&#x27;s most important career matches.

Facing Frank Rowsey in San Francisco on May 10, 1935, Lewis won a decisive ten-round points decision in San Francisco. Rowsey, outweighed by eight pounds, lost all but the fourth, but nearly knocked Lewis out in the eighth with a clean right to the jaw. The blow staggered Lewis and spun him around, but he recovered and delivered more than he received by the closing bell. Lewis showed superior ring craft, and aggression in the win.

Lewis quickly knocked out Tom Patrick at Hickey Park in Millvale in the first of a ten-round bout on June 4, 1935. The Pittsburgh audience watched Lewis knock Patrick to the mat within the first minute of fighting for a count of three, and shortly after he arose, he went down for the full count from a left and right to the jaw.

==Taking the World Light Heavyweight Championship, October 1935==
Lewis took the World Light Heavyweight Title from Bob Olin on October 31, 1935, in a fifteen-round unanimous decision at the Arena in St. Louis. Due to the Depression and a lack of interest in the Light Heavyweight class, Olin&#x27;s manager had a difficult time finding a promoter or an audience for the fight, finally settling on a payment of $15,000 to fight Lewis in St. Louis. The meager audience of 9,219 that showed on fight day could not provide enough in receipts to pay Olin half of what he was promised. Olin&#x27;s trainer, Ray Arcel, later wrote that his boxer lost the nerve to fight Lewis and had to be encouraged to change his mind up to the day of the match.

The fight, however, was spectacular, with Olin showing gameness throughout the fifteen rounds, though outmatched by Lewis. Many in the crowd urged the referee to end the fight in the twelfth, but Olin gamely continued. He came out charging and won the first two rounds with a significant margin in points. In the third, finding his range, Lewis battered Olin with precision lefts to the head and straight rights to the body. Both boxers punched with precision and skill, until the thirteenth when Lewis, struggling for a knockout, inadvertently struck Olin after the bell sounded. Faced with the &quot;machine-like precision&quot; of Lewis, Olin lost twelve rounds, while managing to keep two even. Olin, with the will of a former champion, courageously remained on his feet through the entire fifteen rounds, refusing to suffer a knockdown.

In his next fight on November 29, 1935, Lewis lost to Maxie Rosenbloom in a close, dull, 10-round non-title decision at Dreamland Auditorium in San Francisco. Lewis may have taken the fifth, but for his low blow penalties. One reporter scored five for Rosenbloom, three for Lewis, and two even. Rosenbloom&#x27;s cautious strategy of striking a blow and then clinching bored many ringside, but demonstrated experience as he adjusted for the talent of his younger opponent. Lewis&#x27;s strategy centered on a body attack, which he executed most effectively in the second, eighth and ninth rounds. In the tenth round, Lewis tried for a knockout, but was rebuffed by the scientific skill of Rosenbloom, who blocked his attacks and showered him with blows. Maxie gained his winning points advantage in the final round, though the resulting decision failed to please the crowd. Lewis&#x27;s handlers may have been wise to insist both boxers enter the ring overweight to forgo the risks of a title match, though each boxer had previously split two wins and two losses in their previous meetings.

===Successful title defenses and boxing highlights, 1936–38===
In 1936, Lewis was nearly undefeated with a record of 18–1–1.

Facing &quot;Tiger&quot; Fox, leading contender for his World Light Heavyweight Title, at the Armory in Spokane, Washington on January 10, 1936, Lewis gained a third-round knockout in a non-title bout. Both boxers weighed in above the required Light Heavyweight limit. Carrying the fighting to Lewis in the first round, Fox dominated with an aggressive but unpolished style. In the second, the tide turned, and Lewis let loose with a dozen long-range rights that left Fox on his knees. In the middle of the third, Lewis uncorked three long-range rights that left Fox off balance, and then sent him to the mat with a powerful left hook to the chin that left him sprawling. His seconds had to carry him to his corner.

On March 6, 1936, Lewis defeated southpaw Eddie Simms in a thrilling ten-round points decision at Municipal Auditorium in St. Louis, Missouri. Though fifteen pounds lighter, Lewis carried five of the ten rounds in the bitter fight. Simms took four rounds, and gave Lewis one of the toughest battles of his life. As so often occurred, Lewis cut his left eye, and had a bruised nose and mouth to show for his night&#x27;s work. In the close bout, Simms appeared to be the aggressor, which caused some in the crowd of 10,840 to dispute the final ruling, but Lewis waged an exceptional defense and scored with counter punches that were clean and decisive. Lewis used stiff left jabs to throw Simms off balance, and prevented him from using his deadly right. Simms took the first two rounds, but Lewis carried four of the last six. He shone in the tenth, with a dazzling display of punching in the final minute. Though exceedingly close, both judges and the referee scored for Lewis.

He retained the title on March 13, 1936, against Jock McAvoy in Madison Square Garden in a fifteen-round unanimous decision. Though Lewis dominated in all fifteen rounds, the majority of the crowd of 15,000, cheered for McAvoy, the game Englishman with the fast punch. McAvoy had the ability to duck quickly like many English boxers, but he took a heavy beating from Lewis, and mounted an effective defense in only the first five rounds. With a two-inch height and reach advantage, Lewis landed more punches and had no trouble with the crouch position of McAvoy, looping blows to his head with frequency. Round seven through ten clearly belonged to Lewis and greatly influenced the final decision.

Bob Godwin fell to Lewis at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in a technical knockout only 1:27 into the first round, on May 29, 1936. Before a tiny crowd of 2,988, Lewis batted Godwin to the mat with a stunning right cross, and after he rose unleashed a flurry of blows that forced the referee to call the fight.

Before a sizable crowd of 10,000, Lewis won a non-title ten-round decision against George Nichols, former Light Heavyweight Champion, at Municipal Auditorium in St. Louis, Missouri on August 12, 1936. Nichols staggered Lewis in the fifth with a crushing left, but Lewis piled up points in all the other rounds, and had Nichols hanging on groggily in the eighth and ninth.

Red Burman, a future World Heavyweight contender, became Lewis&#x27;s knockout victim 2:20 in the second round, at Chicago Stadium on October 2, 1936. Shortly after the first round opening bell, Lewis dropped Burman for a nine-count with a right to the chin, and quickly scored three more knockdowns. The referee immediately attempted to call the fight, but Burman was saved by the first round closing bell. Burman was down for a two count within a minute of the second round bell. After being floored for a nine-count, Burman arose only to go down again, and the referee called the fight.

Lewis defeated British ring master, Londonite Len Harvey before an impressive audience of 11,800 in a decisive fifteen-round title decision at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, on November 9, 1936. His attack caused Harvey to cling and clutch throughout the bout. From a slow start in the first two rounds, Lewis increased the fury of his attack using both fists in the remaining rounds, and trying hard for a knockout in the last three. Harvey was able to protect himself from a knockout in the final rounds. Lewis received few injuries, but slight damage to one of his eyes, which had been partially caused during his training for the bout. The injury later proved to be serious and catastrophic to his boxing career. Harvey complained of an injured right hand after the bout.

On February 8, 1937, Lewis defeated Al Ettore at Convention Hall in Philadelphia in a savage fifteen-round split decision before a crowd of 13,000. In round three, Ettore was down twice for nine counts from hard rights by Lewis. In a remarkable show of determination, he came back to take the fourth by a wide margin, staggering Lewis at one point, and waging battle all over the ring. One judge ruled for a draw, while the other judge and the referee ruled for Lewis. The &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; scored only six rounds for Ettore. The United Press gave eight rounds to Lewis, with seven for Ettore. Ettore dominated the first two rounds, doling out considerable punishment to Lewis, effectively using his eleven-pound weight advantage. He managed to win the ninth and tenth, but still was behind on points. Lewis suffered eye injuries in the eleventh round, as did Ettore. Several reporters attributed Lewis&#x27;s dominance in rounds thirteen through fifteen, to Ettore&#x27;s growing fatigue. Previously on January 4, 1937, Lewis had officially lost to Ettore at Convention Hall in a ten-round decision that was later changed to a very controversial draw by the Pennsylvania Boxing Commission. Ettore likely lost the first five rounds. In the final six rounds, Ettore seemed to dominate Lewis until the final bell. Lewis seemed to take the ninth and the tenth in the close bout according to one reporter, and in the scoring of Judge Al Levit. Most of the fans were rooting for a draw decision, which was not the official ruling.

Lewis won over heavyweight Willie Reddish at Griffith Stadium in Washington DC in a ten-round unanimous decision on June 29, 1937. In the eighth, ninth, and tenth, Lewis&#x27;s right and left jabs to the head and a hard attack to the body wore out his opponent. After the fourth, Reddish won several rounds, when he became the aggressor, and gained the crowd&#x27;s favor by appearing to take the lead throughout the bout. The crowd of 10,000 booed the decision. Lewis received damage to his eyes in the bout.

On December 17, 1937, Lewis defeated Johnny Risko before a crowd of 5,000 in a ten-round decision in Cleveland. Risko, fighting at 35, was nearing the end of a long boxing career. Lewis built a large margin in the early rounds, but appeared to coast in the end. The Associated Press gave him nine of the ten rounds, with one even.

Lewis was undefeated in twelve bouts in 1938. He won a title bout on April 25, with a fourth-round knockout against Emilio Martinez at the Auditorium in Minneapolis. Though a title match, the fight was not recognized as a World Light Heavyweight Title bout by the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC). Lewis took the offensive throughout the bout and received few blows from his opponent. His knockout blow was a straight right to the jaw of Martinez in the fourth, a punch he used once effectively in the first.

Elmer Ray was stopped by Lewis at Ponce de Leon Ball Park in Atlanta, Georgia in the twelfth round of a scheduled fifteen on May 19, 1938. Lewis, still reigning champion, floored Ray late in the eleventh with a punch to the kidneys, and finished him early in the twelfth. Ray, fighting with a fifteen-pound weight advantage, fought in a sideways crouch that baffled Lewis for a few rounds.

==Stripped of the NYSAC Light Heavyweight Championship, July 1938==
On July 28, 1938, the New York State Athletic Commission stripped Lewis of his title for failing to accept the challenge filed by &quot;Tiger&quot; Jack Fox.

Jimmy Adamick fell to Lewis in a ten-round split decision at Convention Hall in Philadelphia on September 15, 1938. Lewis started the first eight rounds with a commanding lead in points. In the ninth and tenth, he was at risk of losing by knockout to his heavyweight challenger, but weathered the challenge. Lewis outboxed, and outpunched his rival in the first seven rounds, but appeared to tire in the eighth. In the ninth, he was stunned by a crushing right that appeared to leave him unconscious on his feet, before he recovered and clinched. Adamick could not land the final blow before the bell ended the round, silencing the crowd of 15,000 rooting for a knockout. In the tenth, Lewis was quickly stunned by a solid left hook to the body and retreated, but used his experience and well-timed clinches to hang on. Dodging several of Adamick&#x27;s best blows, Lewis gained confidence and lashed out with stiff rights to the face before the final bell ended the match. The judges gave six rounds to Lewis, and three or four to Adamick.

===Final NBA World Light Heavyweight Title defense against Al Gainer, October 1938===
On October 28, 1938, he won a fifteen-round National Boxing Association (NBA) World Light Heavyweight title decision against Al Gainer in New Haven before a crowd of only 2,486, the smallest ever assembled for a title bout in any weight class. The fight was recognized as an NBA Light Heavyweight Title and was sanctioned by the state of Connecticut. Lewis claimed his refusal to fight Tiger Fox, the reason he was stripped of the NYSAC Light Heavyweight Title, was an economic necessity, as he knew Fox would not draw a significant audience. Lewis won decisively, but Gainer made a stronger showing in the first twelve rounds, visibly shaking Lewis with a few of his blows. Lewis took the decision, with a strong finish in the last three heats. The local &quot;Courant&quot; gave Lewis six rounds, Gainer four, with five even. Gainer&#x27;s sluggishness in the last three rounds was the result of an illness he suffered the week before the fight. There were no knockdowns in the bout.

==Unsuccessful attempt at the World Heavyweight Championship, January 1939==

On January 25, 1939, Lewis attempted to become the first Light Heavyweight champion in boxing history to go up in weight and conquer the World Heavyweight championship, but lost to reigning champion Joe Louis, in a knockout 2:29 into the first round in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. John Henry was down three times in less than three minutes from the lightning-fast blows of the reigning heavyweight champion. It was the only loss by knockout in Lewis&#x27;s career, though his most memorable by many boxing fans.

==Boxing retirement==
His next fight would have been a rematch with Len Harvey in London, but it was cancelled after Lewis failed the pre-fight medical tests. The blindness in his left eye and impaired vision in his right was of primary concern and he subsequently announced his retirement aged twenty-five years old. Lewis had a record of 103 wins, 9 losses and 6 draws, with 60 wins by knockout.

==Life after boxing==
Though he had always abstained from alcohol, Lewis worked as a liquor salesman for a Baltimore company near the end of his career.

He had two brothers who boxed professionally; Christy and Paul. Christy was a club fighter, who often appeared in preliminary bouts before him. Paul was a Middleweight who fought feature bouts during the mid-1940s, primarily in Oakland. On an episode of the PBS show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, DNA analysis proved that Christy Lewis was actor and musician LL Cool J&#x27;s maternal grandfather who gave up his daughter for adoption.

Lewis died in Berkeley, California, in 1974 at the age of 59. He had suffered from emphysema and Parkinson&#x27;s.

Lewis was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1994.

His teachers regularly spoke highly of him and considered him a hard working student. In 1952 Khrunov was also drafted into the Soviet Army where he would follow his interests in becoming a pilot and apply for pilot school. Khrunov was accepted and continued school in the military at Pavlograd in Ukraine. Khrunov later transferred to the Serov Higher Air Force School in Rostov Oblast, Southwestern Russia.

<text>Aleksei Stanislavovich Yeliseyev (; born 13 July 1934) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut who flew on three missions in the Soyuz programme as a flight engineer: Soyuz 5, Soyuz 8, and Soyuz 10. He made the world&#x27;s eighth spacewalk during Soyuz 5 in 1969.

Aleksei&#x27;s father was Lithuanian with the last name Kuraitis, who died in the Soviet&#x27;s Gulag as an enemy of the people. Aleksei uses his mother&#x27;s last name &quot;Yeliseyev&quot; so some regard him as also being a Lithuanian cosmonaut. 
A graduate of the Bauman Higher Technical School (1957) and postgraduate of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (1962). Yeliseyev worked as an engineer in Sergey Korolev&#x27;s design bureau before being selected for cosmonaut training.

Following his retirement from the space programme in 1985, he took up at an administrative position at the Bauman school for several years before retiring fully.

<text>The rock dove, rock pigeon, or common pigeon ( also ; Columba livia) is a member of the bird family Columbidae (doves and pigeons). In common usage, it is often simply referred to as the &quot;pigeon&quot;, although this is the wild form of the bird; the pigeons most familiar to people are the domesticated forms of the wild rock dove.

Wild rock doves are uniformly pale grey with two black bars on each wing, with few differences being seen between males and females; i.e. they are not strongly sexually dimorphic. The domestic pigeon (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot;, which includes about 1,000 different breeds) descended from this species. Escaped domestic pigeons are the origin of feral pigeons around the world. Both forms can vary widely in the colour and pattern of their plumage unlike their wild ancestor, being red, brown, checkered, uniformly colored, or piebald.

Habitats include various open and semi-open environments where they are able to forage on the ground. Cliffs and rock ledges are used for roosting and breeding in the wild. Originating in Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, when including their domestic and feral descendants, they are an example of a least-concern species per IUCN among birds, being abundant with an estimated population of 17 to 28 million wild and feral birds in Europe alone and up to 120 million worldwide.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

The official common name is rock dove, as given by the International Ornithological Congress.

The rock dove was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; written by Carl Linnaeus. He placed it with all the other doves and pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba livia&quot;. The genus name &quot;Columba&quot; is the Latin word meaning &quot;pigeon, dove&quot;, whose older etymology comes from the Ancient Greek κόλυμβος (&quot;kólumbos&quot;), &quot;a diver&quot;, hence κολυμβάω (&quot;kolumbáō&quot;), &quot;dive, plunge headlong, swim&quot;. Aristophanes (&quot;Birds&quot; 304) and others use the word κολυμβίς (&quot;kolumbís&quot;), &quot;diver&quot;, for the name of the bird, because of its swimming motion in the air. The specific epithet &quot;livia&quot; is a Medieval Latin variant of &quot;livida&quot;, &quot;livid, bluish-grey&quot;; this was Theodorus Gaza&#x27;s translation of Greek &quot;péleia&quot;, &quot;dove&quot;, itself thought to be derived from &quot;pellós&quot;, &quot;dark-coloured&quot;. 

Its closest relative in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; is the hill pigeon, followed by the other rock pigeons: the snow, speckled, and white-collared pigeons. Pigeon chicks are called &quot;squabs&quot;. Note that members of the lesser known pigeon genus &quot;Petrophassa&quot; and the speckled pigeon (&quot;Columba guinea&quot;), also have the common name &quot;rock pigeon&quot;. 

=== Subspecies ===
Nine subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;C. l. livia&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789 – west, central Europe, north Africa to central Asia
* &quot;C. l. gymnocycla&quot; Gray, GR, 1856 – Mauritania and Senegal to south Mali and Ghana
* &quot;C. l. targia&quot; Geyr von Schweppenburg, 1916 – north Mali and south Algeria to central Sudan
* &quot;C. l. schimperi&quot; Bonaparte, 1854 – east Egypt, south Sudan and Eritrea
* &quot;C. l. dakhlae&quot; Meinertzhagen, R, 1928 – west Egypt
* &quot;C. l. palaestinae&quot; Zedlitz, 1912 – Sinai Peninsula (Egypt) to Syria, to west and south Arabian Peninsula
* &quot;C. l. gaddi&quot; Zarudny &amp; Loudon, 1906 – east Turkey to Uzbekistan, to west and north Afghanistan
* &quot;C. l. neglecta&quot; Hume, 1873 – west Pakistan and east Afghanistan to the Himalayas
* &quot;C. l. intermedia&quot; Strickland, 1844 – south India and Sri Lanka

== Description ==
Centuries of domestication have greatly altered the rock dove. Domestic and Feral pigeons, which did not originate naturally, have significant variations in plumage. When not specified, descriptions are for assumed wild type, though the wild type may be on the verge of extinction or already extinct, and most research does not distinguish wild birds and descendants of domestic populations.

The adult of the nominate subspecies of the rock dove is long with a wingspan. Weight for wild or feral rock doves ranges from , though overfed domestic and semidomestic individuals can exceed normal weights. For standard measurements, the wing chord is typically around , the tail is , the bill is around , and the tarsus is .

This species has dark bluish-grey head, neck, and chest feathers with glossy yellowish, greenish, and reddish-purple iridescence along its neck and wing feathers. The white lower back of the pure rock dove is its best identification characteristic; the two black bars on its pale grey wings are also distinctive. The tail has a black band on the end, and the outer web of the tail feathers are margined with white. It is strong and quick on the wing, dashing out from sea caves, flying low over the water, its lighter grey rump showing well from above. The iris is orange, red, or golden with a paler inner ring, but a few pigeons may have white-grey eyes. The eyelids are orange and encapsulated in a bluish-grey to grey-white eye ring. The bill is grey-black with a conspicuous off-white cere. The feet are red to pink.

The adult female is almost identical in outward appearance to the male, but the iridescence on her neck is less intense and more restricted to the rear and sides, whereas that on the breast is often very obscure. Young birds show little lustre and are duller. Eye colour of the pigeon is generally orange, but a few pigeons may have white-grey eyes. The eyelids are orange and encapsulated in a grey-white eye ring. The feet are red to pink.

When circling overhead, the white underwing of the bird becomes conspicuous. In its flight, behaviour, and voice, which is more of a dovecot &quot;coo&quot; than the phrase of the wood pigeon, it is a typical pigeon. Although it is a relatively strong flier, it also glides frequently, holding its wings in a very pronounced V shape as it does.

The various subspecies are similar to the nominate, but can be differentiated:

* The subspecies &quot;gymnocycla&quot; is smaller and very much darker than the nominate subspecies. It is almost blackish on the head, rump and underparts with a white back and the iridescence of the nape extending onto the head. 
* Subspecies &quot;targia&quot; is slightly smaller than the nominate, with similar plumage, but the back is concolorous with the mantle instead of white. 
* Subspecies &quot;schimperi&quot; closely resembles &quot;targia&quot;, but has a distinctly paler mantle. 
* Subspecies &quot;dakhlae&quot; is smaller and much paler than the nominate. 
* Subspecies &quot;palaestinae&quot; is slightly larger than &quot;schimperi&quot; and has darker plumage. 
* Subspecies &quot;gaddi&quot; is larger and paler than &quot;palaestinae,&quot; with which it intergrades in the west. 
* Subspecies &quot;neglecta&quot; it is similar to the nominate in size but darker, with a stronger and more extensive iridescent sheen on the neck. It intergrades with &quot;gaddi&quot; in the south. 
* Subspecies &quot;intermedia&quot; is similar to &quot;neglecta&quot; but darker, with a less contrasting back.
There have been numerous skeletal descriptions of the rock dove and the associated muscles including those of the eye, jaw, neck, and throat. The skull is dominated by the rostrum, eye socket, and braincase. The quadrate bone is relatively small and mobile and connects the rest of the cranium to the lower jaw. The latter has an angled shape in lateral view because the long-axis of the front half of the lower jaw is at a 30° angle to the back half. Beneath the skull, the hyoid skeleton involves three mid-line structures and a pair of elongate structures that stem from between the junction of the back two structures. The anterior structure (the paraglossum or entoglossum) is unpaired and shaped like an arrowhead. 

Pigeons feathers have two types of melanin (pigment) – eumelanin and pheomelanin. A study of melanin in the feathers of both wild rock and domestic pigeons, of different coloration types and known genetic background, measured the concentration, distribution and proportions of eumelanin and pheomelanin and found that gene mutations affecting the distribution, amounts and proportions of pigments accounted for the greater variation of coloration in domesticated birds than in their wild relations. Eumelanin generally causes grey or black coloration, while pheomelanin results in a reddish-brown colour. Other shades of brown may be produced through different combinations and concentrations of the two colours. Darker birds may be better able to store trace metals in their feathers due to their higher concentrations of melanin, which may help mitigate the negative effects of the metals, the concentrations of which are typically higher in urban areas. 

=== Vocalizations ===

The call is a soft, slightly wavering, coo. Ornithologist David Sibley describes the display call as a &quot;whoo, hoo-witoo-hoo&quot;, whereas the Cornell Lab of Ornithology describes it as a &quot;Coo, roo-c&#x27;too-coo&quot;. Variations include an alarm call, a nest call, and noises made by juveniles. Sibley describes the nest call as a repeated &quot;hu-hu-hurrr&quot;. When displaying, songs are partly sexual, partly threatening. They are accompanied by an inflated throat, tail fanning, strutting, and bowing. The alarm call, given at sight of predators, is a grunt-like &quot;oorhh&quot;.

=== Osmoregulation ===
== Distribution and habitat ==

Before the Columbian Exchange, rock doves were restricted to a natural resident range in western and southern Europe, North Africa, and extending into South Asia. They were carried into the New World aboard European ships between 1603 and 1607. The species (including ferals) has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of . It has a large global population, including an estimated 17 to 28 million individuals in Europe. Fossil evidence suggests the rock dove originated in southern Asia, and skeletal remains, unearthed in Israel, confirm its existence there for at least 300,000 years. However, this species has such a long history with humans that it is impossible to identify its original range exactly.

Wild pigeons reside in rock formations and cliff faces, settling in crevices to nest. They nest communally, often forming large colonies of many hundreds of individuals. Wild nesting sites include caves, canyons, and sea cliffs. They will even live in the Sahara so long as an area has rocks, water, and some plant matter. They prefer to avoid dense vegetation.

Feral pigeons are usually unable to find these accommodations, so they must nest on building ledges, walls or statues. They may damage these structures via their faeces; starving birds can only excrete urates, which over time corrodes masonry and metal. In contrast, a well-fed bird passes mostly solid faeces, containing only small amounts of uric acid.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Pigeons are often found in pairs in the breeding season, but are often gregarious, living in flocks of 50 to 500 birds (dependent on the food supply). As prey birds, they must keep their vigilance, and when disturbed a pigeon within a flock will take off with a noisy clapping sound that cues for other pigeons to take to flight. The noise of the take-off increases the faster a pigeon beats its wings, thus advertising the magnitude of a perceived threat to its flockmates.

Non-vocal sounds include a loud flapping noise at take-off, feet stomping, hisses, and beak snapping. Wings may also be clapped during flights, usually during display fights or after copulation. Juveniles particularly snap their bills, usually to respond to nest invasion. The foot stomping appears deliberate, though for what purpose is unclear. Foot stomping is done with a certain foot first, showing that rock doves have &quot;footedness&quot;, similar to human handedness.

Homing pigeons, including carrier breeds, are well known for their ability to find their way home from long distances. Despite these demonstrated abilities, wild rock doves are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas. It is hypothesized that in their natural, arid habitat, they rely on this sense to navigate back home after foraging as deserts rarely possess navigational landmarks that may be used.

=== Life cycle ===
The species can breed at any time of the year due to their ability to produce crop milk, but peak times are spring and summer, when the food supply is abundant enough to support embryonic egg development. Laying of eggs can take place up to six times per year.Nesting sites are along coastal cliff faces, as well as the artificial cliff faces created by apartment buildings with accessible ledges or roof spaces. 

Courtship rituals of ferals are often observed in urban parks at any time of the year, and it is presumed that the wild populations have similar displays. Alighted males inflate their crops, puffing up the feathers on his neck to appear larger and thereby impress or attract attention (as seen in the header image). He approaches the female at a rapid walking pace while emitting repetitive quiet notes, often bowing and turning as he comes closer. At first, the female invariably walks or flies a short distance away and the male follows her until she stops. At this point, he continues the bowing motion and very often makes full- or half-pirouettes in front of the female. The male then proceeds to feed the female by regurgitating food, as they do when feeding the young. The male then mounts the female, rearing backwards to be able to join their cloacae. The mating is very brief, with the male flapping his wings to maintain balance on top of the female.

The rock dove is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents care for the young for a time. Current evidence suggests that wild, domestic and feral pigeons mate for life, although their long-term bonds are not unbreakable. They are socially monogamous, but extra-pair matings do occur, often initiated by males. 

The nest is a flimsy platform of straw and sticks, laid on a ledge, under cover, often on the window ledges of buildings. Two white eggs are laid; incubation, shared by both parents, lasts 17 to 19 days. The newly hatched squab(s) (nestling) has pale yellow down and a flesh-coloured bill with a dark band. For the first few days, the babies are tended and fed (through regurgitation) exclusively on crop milk (also called &quot;pigeon milk&quot; or &quot;pigeon&#x27;s milk&quot;). The pigeon milk is produced in the crops of both parents in all species of pigeon and dove. Pigeons are altricial and their fledging period is about 30 days.

A rock dove&#x27;s lifespan ranges from 3–5 years in the wild to 15 years in captivity, though longer-lived specimens have been reported. The main causes of mortality in the wild are predators and persecution by humans. 

=== Feeding ===

Rock doves are omnivorous, but prefer plant matter: chiefly fruits and grains.

Pigeons feed on the ground in flocks or individually. Pigeon groups typically consist of &quot;producers&quot;, which scout out food sources, and &quot;scroungers&quot;, which follow the producers and feed on food located by them. Generally, groups of pigeons contain a greater proportion of scroungers than producers. Pigeons are naturally granivorous, eating seeds that fit down their gullet. They may sometimes consume small invertebrates such as worms or insect larvae as a protein supplement. As they do not possess an enlarged cecum as in European wood pigeons, they cannot digest adult plant tissue; the various seeds they eat contain the appropriate nutrients they require. While most birds take small sips and tilt their heads backwards when drinking, pigeons are able to dip their bills into the water and drink continuously, without having to tilt their heads back.

=== Preening ===
Pigeons primarily use powder down feathers for preening, which gives a soft and silky feel to their plumage. They have no preen gland or at times have very rudimentary preen glands, so oil is not used for preening. Rather, powder down feathers are spread across the body. These have a tendency to disintegrate, and the powder, akin to talcum powder, helps maintain the plumage.

=== Predators ===

With only their flying abilities protecting them from predation, rock pigeons around the world are a favourite prey item for a wide range of raptors. In fact, with feral pigeons existing in almost every city in the world, they may form the majority of prey for several raptor species that live in urban areas. Peregrine falcons and Eurasian sparrowhawks are natural predators of pigeons and quite adept at catching and feeding upon this species. Up to 80% of the diet of peregrine falcons in several cities that have breeding falcons is composed of feral pigeons. In all life stages, rock pigeons are at risk from domestic cats, including strays. Doves and pigeons in general are considered to be game birds, since many species are hunted and used for food in many of the countries in which they are native.

Their body feathers have dense, fluffy bases and are loosely attached to the skin, hence they drop out easily. When a predator catches a pigeon, large numbers of feathers are often pulled by the attacker&#x27;s mouth and the pigeon may use this temporary distraction to make an escape. Tail feathers are also dropped when preyed upon or under traumatic conditions, probably as a distraction mechanism.

== Relationship to humans ==
The rock dove was central to Charles Darwin&#x27;s discovery of evolution, and featured in four of his works from 1859 to 1872. Darwin posited that, despite wide-ranging morphological differences, the many hundreds of breeds of domestic pigeon could all be traced back to the wild rock dove; in essence human selection of pigeon breeds was analogous to natural selection.

Rock doves often have a commensal relationship with humans, gaining both ample access to food and nesting spots in civilized areas. Human structures provide an excellent imitation of cliff structures, making rock doves very common around human habitation. Skyscrapers, highway overpasses, farm buildings, abandoned buildings, and other human structures with ample crevices are conducive to rock dove nesting. Thus the modern range of the rock dove is due in large part to humans. Agricultural settlements are favoured over forested ones. Ideal human nesting attributes combine areas with tall buildings, green spaces, ample access to human food, and schools. Conversely, suburban areas which are far from city centers and have high street density are the least conducive to pigeons. Their versatility among human structures is evidenced by a population living inside a deep well in Tunisia.

=== Domestication ===

Rock doves have been domesticated for several thousand years, giving rise to the domestic pigeon (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot;). They may have been domesticated as long as 5,000 years ago. Domesticated pigeons are used as homing pigeons as well as food and pets. They were in the past also used as carrier pigeons, used to deliver messages in peacetime or during war. Numerous breeds of fancy pigeons of all sizes, forms, and colours have been bred.
Feral pigeons (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot; or &quot;Columba livia forma urbana&quot;), also called city doves, city pigeons, or street pigeons, are descendants of domestic pigeons (&quot;Columba livia domestica&quot;) living independently and often unwanted by humans. They are often described as a public nuisance, being a potential reservoir of disease and cause of property damage.

<text>Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation (OBI) is an Evangelical Christian organization headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States. Founded in 1978, OBI operates in more than 90 countries, focusing on disaster relief, medical aid, clean water, hunger relief, community development, and orphan care programs.

== History ==
Operation Blessing International was founded on November 14, 1978, by businessman and televangelist Pat Robertson. Its stated purpose is to assist people facing challenges by connecting their needs, such as clothing and appliances, with donations from viewers of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;.

OBI collaborates with local churches and organizations to provide assistance to low-income families, including food and financial aid. In 1990, the organization transitioned its focus from individual assistance to funding outreach centers throughout the United States, focusing on local ministries, food pantries, and shelters. OBI&#x27;s international activities include medical aid, hunger relief, and disaster response efforts. The organization became officially registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 1986, following a partnership with Development Corporation.

== Activities ==
=== Disaster relief ===
Operation Blessing has been involved in domestic relief work for victims of many natural disasters, such as severe flooding in Nebraska, tornadoes in Mississippi, and hurricanes Michael and Florence in Florida and North Carolina. Internationally, Operation Blessing has assisted victims of humanitarian crises in Ukraine, Poland, Turkey, and Kenya. With a focus on public health, Operation Blessing was involved in working to combat the spread of Zika fever through educational initiatives, distribution of mosquito nets, and providing insect repellent.

OBI&#x27;s involvement extends to various natural disasters, including the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake and accompanying cholera outbreak.

== Partnerships ==
Operation Blessing has partnered with several organizations and nonprofits, including the Mayo Clinic of Minnesota, International Justice Mission, Free Wheelchair Mission, and Tide Loads of Hope. OBI has also conducted annual food distributions with professional sports teams such as the Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas City Royals.

== Affiliation ==
Operation Blessing is a member of the Association of Evangelical Relief and Development Organizations (AERDO), and is registered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It is also a national member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD), Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), Christian Service Charities, Christian Service Organizations of America (CSOA), the Global Compassion Network, the Virginia Trucking Association, and the American Trucking Associations (ATA).

== Financial accountability ==
Operation Blessing is a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA), and is audited annually by KPMG, LLP.

== Controversies ==
In 1994, Pat Robertson made pleas on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; for cash donations to Operation Blessing to support airlifts of refugees from Rwanda to Zaire. &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; later discovered that Operation Blessing&#x27;s planes were transporting diamond-mining equipment for the African Development Corporation, a venture Robertson had established in cooperation with Zaire&#x27;s dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, whom Robertson had befriended earlier in 1993. According to Operation Blessing records, Robertson owned the planes used for Operation Blessing airlifts.

A 1999 report concluded that, while Robertson&#x27;s request for donations to Operation Blessing had been misleading, it was not an intentional attempt to commit fraud. 

A September 2013 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Operation Blessing&#x27;s volunteers recited Bible passages to dying refugees. Robertson was accused of taking credit for work that was done by Médecins Sans Frontières. In a December 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; issued an apology to Operation Blessing, retracting many of their accusations, acknowledging that they had not mentioned a further report that cleared Operation Blessing of any wrongdoing, and agreeing to donate to their &quot;relief efforts for victims of the typhoon in the Philippines.&quot;

<text>Bagram Airfield-BAF, also known as Bagram Air Base , is located southeast of Charikar in the Parwan Province of Afghanistan. It is under the Afghan Ministry of Defense. Sitting on the site of the ancient town of Bagram at an elevation of above sea level, the air base has two concrete runways. The main one measures , capable of handling large military aircraft, including the Lockheed Martin C-5 Galaxy. The second runway measures . The air base also has at least three large hangars, a control tower, numerous support buildings, and various housing areas. There are also more than of ramp space and five aircraft dispersal areas, with over 110 revetments.

Bagram Air Base was formerly the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan, staffed by the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing of the U.S. Air Force, along with rotating units of the U.S. and coalition forces. It was expanded and modernized by the Americans. There is also a hospital with 50 beds, three operating theatres and a modern dental clinic. Kabul International Airport is located approximately south of Bagram, connected by two separate roads.

On 15 August 2021, the entire base fell to Taliban rebel forces after the NATO-trained Afghan National Army had surrendered. All prisoners at the Parwan Detention Facility were released. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had revealed that since August 2009 it was informed about inmates of a second prison where detainees were held in isolation and without access to the ICRC that is usually guaranteed to all prisoners; the existence of a second prison was denied by U.S. authorities.

==History==
In the 1950s, Bagram airfield was originally built by the Soviet Union during the early period of the Cold War, at a time when the United States and the neighboring Soviet Union were spreading political influence in Afghanistan. While the United States was focusing on Afghanistan, the Soviets were strengthening ties with Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime in Cuba. In 1959, a year after Afghan Prime Minister Daud Khan toured the United States, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower landed at Bagram Airfield where he was greeted by King Zahir Shah and Daud Khan among other Afghan officials.

In 1976, the original runway , was built. The airport at Bagram was maintained by the Afghan Air Force (AAF) with some support from the United States. During the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War, it played a key role, serving as a hub for the Limited Contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan operations and a base for its troops and supplies. Bagram was also the initial staging point for the invading Soviet forces at the beginning of the conflict, with elements of two Soviet Airborne Troops&#x27; divisions being deployed there. Aircraft based at Bagram, including the 368th Assault Aviation Regiment flying Su-25s, provided close air support for Soviet and Afghan troops in the field. The 368th Assault Aviation Regiment was stationed at Bagram from October 1986 to November 1987.
Some of the Soviet land forces based at Bagram included the 108th Motor Rifle Division and the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment of the 105th Guards Airborne Division. Following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces and the rise of the Western-funded and Pakistani-trained mujahideen rebels, Afghanistan plunged into civil war. Many of its support buildings and base housing built by the Soviet Armed Forces during their occupation were destroyed by years of fighting between various warring Afghan factions after the Soviets left.

From 1999 onward, control of the base was contested between the Northern Alliance and Taliban, often with each controlling territory on opposite ends of the airfield. Taliban forces were consistently within artillery and mortar range of the field, denying full possession of the strategic facility to the Northern Alliance. Press reports indicated that at times a Northern Alliance general was using the bombed-out control tower as an observation post and as a location to brief journalists, with his headquarters nearby.

Reports also indicated that Northern Alliance rocket attacks on Kabul had been staged from Bagram, possibly with Russian-made FROG-7 Rockets. In 2000, the Taliban took over control and forced the Northern Alliance to retreat further to the north.

During the US-led retribution on the Taliban for harboring the terrorist organization responsible for 9/11, the base was secured by a team from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Boat Service. By early December 2001, troops from the 10th Mountain Division shared the base with Special Operations Command officers from MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, Paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, and a small communications team consisting of personnel from the 269th Signal Company, 11th Signal Brigade out of Fort Huachuca. The British force consisted of B and C Companies from 40 Commando, Royal Marines. As of mid-December 2001 more than 300 U.S. troops, mainly with the 10th Mountain Division, were providing force protection at Bagram. The troops patrolled the base perimeter, guarded the front gate, and cleared the runway of explosive ordnance. As of early January 2002, the number of 10th Mountain Division troops had grown to about 400 soldiers.

There were numerous dining facilities at Bagram Airfield. Troops and civilians had various dining options that included Pizza Hut, Subway, an Afghan restaurant, as well as Green Beans coffee shops.

In late January 2002, there were somewhere around 4,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, of which about 3,000 were at Kandahar International Airport, and about 500 were stationed at Bagram. The runway began to be repaired by US, Italian, and Polish military personnel. By mid-June 2002, Bagram Airfield was serving as home to more than 7,000 U.S. and other armed services. Numerous tent areas housed the troops based there, including one named Viper City. It was reported that &quot;Bagram came under daily rocket attack&quot; in 2002 even though most of these attacks went unreported by the press. Landmines were also a serious concern in and around Bagram Airfield.

By late 2003, B-huts, structures made of plywood designed to hold eight troops, were replacing the standard shelter option for troops. There were several hundred, with plans to build close to 800 of them. The plans were to have nearly 1,200 structures built by 2006, but completion of the project was expected much earlier; possibly by July 2004. The increased construction fell under U.S. Central Command standards of temporary housing and allowed for the building of B-huts on base, not to show permanence, but to raise the standard for troops serving here. The wooden structures had no concrete foundation and thus were not considered permanent housing, just an upgrade from the tents, the only option Bagram personnel and troops had seen previously. The small homes offered troops protection from environmental conditions including wind, snow, sand and cold. During 2005, a USO facility was built and named after former pro football player and United States Army Ranger, Pat Tillman.
A second runway, long, was built and completed by the United States in late 2006, at a cost of US$68 million. This new runway is longer than the previous one and thicker, giving it the ability to land larger aircraft, such as the C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III, Il-76, An-124, An-225 or the Boeing 747 (which is used by civilian cargo airlines).

By 2007, Bagram had become the size of a small town, with traffic jams and many commercial shops selling goods from clothes to food. The base itself is situated high up in the mountains and sees temperatures drop to . Due to the height and snowstorms commercial aircraft have difficulty landing there, and older aircraft often rely on very experienced crews in order to be able to land there. The base was able to house 10,000 troops in 2009.

The 2007 Bagram Airfield bombing was a suicide attack that killed up to 23 people and injured 20 more, at a time when Dick Cheney, then Vice-President of the United States, was visiting Afghanistan. The attack occurred inside one of the security gates surrounding the heavily guarded base. Yousef Ahmadi, one of the Taliban spokesmen, claimed responsibility for the attack and said that Cheney was the intended target. Another Taliban spokesman later confirmed that Osama bin Laden planned the attack, and reiterated that Cheney was the intended target. This claim is supported by the relatively limited number of large suicide bombings carried out in Afghanistan, combined with the intensity of this particular attack, and the fact that Cheney was at the base. Cheney was unharmed from the attack, however. Among the dead were a U.S. soldier, a U.S. contractor, a South Korean soldier, and 20 Afghan workers at the base.
In 2008, several U.S. service members were accused of accepting bribes for the award of building contracts on Bagram. Four of the Afghans have also faced charges, while three of them have been held as material witnesses. The GI&#x27;s are reported to have received over 100,000 dollars in bribes.

In March 2009, a car bomb exploded outside the gates of Bagram Airfield facilities, wounding three civilian workers. In June 2009, two U.S. soldiers were killed and at least six other personnel were wounded during an early morning rocket attack.

In October 2009, &quot;The State&quot; reported on Bagram&#x27;s expansion. It reported that Bagram was currently undergoing US$200 million expansion projects, and called the Airfield a &quot;boom town&quot;. According to the article: &quot;Official U.S. policy is not to create a permanent occupation force in Afghanistan. But it is clear from what&#x27;s happening at Bagram Airfield—the Afghan end of the Charleston-to-Afghanistan lifeline—that the U.S. military won&#x27;t be packing up soon.&quot; In November 2009, construction of the Parwan Detention Facility was completed. It housed about 3,000 inmates, mostly insurgents who were fighting against Afghanistan and NATO-led forces.

In March 2010, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) installed 150 solar powered lights to address reports of sexual assaults at the base. Eight reported sexual assaults occurred at the base in 2009 involving Airmen; the U.S. Army&#x27;s sexual assault response team reported treating 45 victims in 2009. The report revealed that most victims knew their attacker. In same month, insurgents attacked an area at the base with rockets. One of the rockets landed next to a B-Hut in a camp located on the west side of the base killing a Bosnian national, who was working at Bagram as a contract firefighter.
In May 2010, a group of &quot;nearly a dozen&quot; insurgents attacked around the north end of the base. The assault left one U.S. contractor dead while nine service members were reported wounded. A spokesman for Bagram said a building was slightly damaged during the attack. Taliban spokesman claimed 20 armed men wearing suicide vests attacked the base with four detonating explosives at the entrances, but the military spokesman said they failed &quot;to breach the perimeter&quot; and were &quot;unable to detonate their suicide vests.&quot; The attackers were dressed in U.S. Army uniforms.

Early on the morning of 30 December 2010, Taliban militants fired two rockets on Bagram though no casualties were reported. The insurgents claimed responsibility for the incident. After the 2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests the United States decided to transfer the running of the Parwan Detention Facility to Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), although the Americans continued to have access to the facility and veto power over the release of inmates.
On 18 June 2013, the base was the subject of a mortar attack by Taliban forces, which resulted in four U.S. troops being killed and several others wounded. On Thanksgiving evening in 2013, a rocket attack killed 2 civilian contractors as they slept in their B hut on the southern part of the field.
On 28 November 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Bagram Airfield for the first time to celebrate Thanksgiving with the U.S. troops there.

As part of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, after nearly 20 years of continuous U.S. presence at the site, the Bagram Air Base was secretly evacuated by the US during the night on 1 July 2021 and de facto handed back to the Afghan government on 2 July 2021. 
The last remaining U.S. troops left the base by shutting off the electricity and slipping away in the night without notifying the Afghan Armed Forces. The base was looted by local civilians soon after U.S. forces left the area. The Afghan National Army later took control of the area and arrested some looters.

On 15 August 2021, Afghan troops stationed there fell back from their positions, leaving them to the Taliban and losing control of the airfield.
On 9 March 2024, National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) fighters claimed responsibility for an attack which killed the Bagram Division&#x27;s chief of staff.

On 14 August 2024, the Taliban celebrated their 3 year anniversary of Victory against the United States and Western powers.

==Camp Vance==
Camp Vance, Afghanistan was the base, 1.4 km from the airfield, established in December 2002 by the United States Department of Defense to headquarter the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF).

The camp was named for Gene Arden Vance Jr., a member of the U.S. Special Forces and a cryptologic linguist who, despite being critically wounded, helped save the lives of two fellow Americans and 18 Afghan soldiers during the hunt for Osama bin Laden in the War in Afghanistan.

Camp Vance was headquartered by U.S. Special Forces troops whose core tasks included advising the Afghan National Army&#x27;s special operations forces and local police, training forces associated with the Village Stability Operations (VSO) and counterinsurgency (COIN). The camp also housed highly specialized battalion-level task forces built around Army Special Forces, infantry, a Marine special operations battalion, and a Navy SEAL team.

==Parwan Detention Facility==
The Parwan Detention Facility (PDF) was completed in 2009 and is located at Bagram Airfield. It was the main detention facility for persons detained by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The older detention facility, which was located at a different site, has been criticized in the past for alleged torture and prisoner abuse. In 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that two detainees had been beaten to death by guards in December 2002. Amnesty International used the word &quot;torture&quot; to describe treatment at the detention center.

Apart from military and intelligence personnel, the only people officially allowed inside the prison building were Red Cross representatives who inspected the facility once every two weeks. It was reported in February 2009 that detainees had no access to any legal process. Many of the officers and soldiers interviewed by U.S. Army investigators in the subsequent criminal investigation said the large majority of detainees were compliant and reasonably well treated. However, some interrogators routinely administered harsh treatment which included alleged beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation, shackling to ceilings, and threats with guard dogs. Amnesty International has criticized the U.S. government for using dogs in this way at the detention center.

In 2005, the number of anti-American militants held at Bagram was 450, but began increasing then. In the same year, four al-Qaeda militants escaped from Bagram detention center. To address the mounting human rights violations and the 2005 escape incident, the U.S. decided to build a more modern detention facility. more than 3,000 alleged militants and foreign terrorists were detained at PDF, roughly 18 times as many as in Guantanamo Bay. The number increased 5-fold since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009. The detainees included senior members of al-Qaeda and Taliban militant commanders. In 2012, the Afghan government requested that control of the Parwan Detention Facility be handed over to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).

Alleged prisoner abuse at Bagram by U.S. personnel was the subject of the 2007 Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;Taxi to the Dark Side&quot;. The film details the severe beatings and torture, and ultimate death, of an Afghan taxi driver being held at the Parwan Detention Facility.

==Medical care==

The Heathe N. Craig Joint Theater Hospital on the base is 50 bed military hospital named after SSG Heathe N. Craig, a United States Army medic who died while trying to save a wounded comrade.

<text>The stock dove (Columba oenas) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae, the doves and pigeons. It is widely distributed in the western Palearctic, north to central Scandinavia and south to northwest Africa. Western and southern populations are resident, while northeastern populations are migratory to avoid the colder winters there.

==Taxonomy==
The stock dove was first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba oenas&quot;. The specific name &quot;oenas&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;oinas&quot; meaning &quot;pigeon&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;C. o. oenas&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – western Europe and northwestern Africa east to northern Kazakhstan, southwestern Siberia and northern Iran.
* &quot;C. o. yarkandensis&quot; Buturlin, 1908 – southeastern Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to western China; slightly paler than &quot;C. o. oenas&quot;.

==Description==
The stock dove is long, with a wingspan of and a weight of 303–365 g in males, 286–290 g in females. The plumage is a blue-toned grey, with two short dark grey to blackish wingbars on the tertials and greater coverts, and a broad dark grey bar at the tip of the tail. The breast is lightly suffused pinkish-purple, and the sides of the neck have an iridescent patch varying between green and purple depending on the angle of incident light. The eyes are dark, and the bill pink with a yellow tip. The male and female are indistinguishable on plumage, though males are slightly larger; juveniles are also similar, but lack the iridescent neck patch. In flight, the grey wings show a dark trailing edge; the underwing is also dark grey, unlike the white underwing of the rock dove. The short, deep, &quot;grunting&quot; &quot;Ooo-uu-ooh&quot; call is quite distinct from the modulated cooing notes of the common wood pigeon.

The stock dove is in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; in the pigeon family, the members of which are typically pale grey or brown, sometimes with white head or neck markings and usually with iridescent green or purple patches on the neck and breast. The neck feathers may be stiffened and aligned to form grooves, but these are less obvious in this species. The three western European &quot;Columba&quot; pigeons have distinctive characteristics. The common wood pigeon may be readily distinguished by its large size, as well as the white on its neck (in adults) and wings. The rock dove and stock dove are more alike in size and plumage, but wild specimens of the former have a white rump and two well-marked dark bars on the wing, while the rump of the stock dove is grey and its wing bars incomplete.

The stock dove is sociable as well as gregarious, often consorting with wood pigeons and occasionally with rock doves.

==Ecology==
The stock dove is common in ideal habitat, but never as abundant as the common wood pigeon, typically forming flocks of a few to a few tens, very rarely hundreds, and not the thousands often found with wood pigeons. In part of its European and western Asiatic range it is a migrant. There has been a sharp decline in France (−57% in 1976). Although the species is not considered threatened in Europe, it is classified in Schedule 2 of the Birds Directive and Annex III the Berne Convention. Around 100,000 to 200,000 individuals winter in France. Over half of the European stock dove population is found in the UK.

The nest is usually in a hole in an old tree. Before deforestation, the stock dove was the most frequent pigeon, nesting mostly in oak or pine wood, but as it usually nests in cavities in trees it was normally only found in old forests. In plantations there are not as many holes to nest in, so it is scarcer. In addition, as the stock dove is double-brooded, requiring two holes for its broods. It has been observed nesting in rabbit burrows, ruins, old poplar hedges, cracks in crags or cliff faces, in ivy, and in the thick growth around the boles of lime trees. It will also use nest boxes. The cavity should be about 75 centimetres deep and the hole should be big enough to admit a fist. Though nesting material is seldom used, the squabs leave the hole very oily. Stock doves prefer to nest close together. Outside of the breeding season, stock doves may also roost in cavities. Like most doves and pigeons, it lays two eggs in a clutch; nests with more eggs (up to six) have been found, but are thought to be the result of dump-nesting by other females.

The habitat of the stock dove is generally open wooded country. Even though it nests in trees it does not prefer densely wooded areas. It is also common on coasts where the cliffs provide holes.

Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, a characteristic of pigeons in general. It perches well, and in nuptial display walks along a horizontal branch with swelled neck, lowered wings, and fanned tail. During the circling spring flight the wings are smartly cracked like a whip.

Most of its food is plant material; young shoots and seedlings are favoured, and it will take grain as well as insects and snails. In some areas it feeds mostly on acorns and pine seeds. Its diet can include a variety of foods: berries such as bay and hawthorn, figs, cereal grains, beans, peas, and small invertebrates that are obtained while walking on the ground. During autumn migration in October, stock doves stop over at places with an abundance of acorns, supplementing the diet with shoots and leaves.

==Etymology==
The common name stock dove, attested from 1340 as &quot;stok-dowe&quot;, has caused some confusion about the origins of this bird. The modern usage of the word &quot;stock&quot; might imply that the bird has been tamed and kept as stock for food and merchandise, leading to the belief that this bird is a hybrid breed with its origins in human aviaries; however, this is not the case. The word &quot;stock&quot; in the common name of this species refers not to the stock of trade, but comes from the Old English &quot;stocc&quot; meaning &quot;stump, post, stake, tree trunk, log,&quot;. Therefore, &quot;stock dove&quot; means roughly &quot;a dove which lives in hollow trees&quot;. Such hollow trees near human settlements would often be taken and used as wood stock for firewood, hence the name.

An exercise to give all of the world&#x27;s birds a standard, international-use English name led to a proposal in 1988 to rename the species as &quot;stock pigeon&quot; for systematic reasons (so that all &quot;Columba&quot; species were &#x27;pigeon&#x27; rather than &#x27;dove&#x27;). This was taken up in the 7th edition of the &quot;British List&quot; in 2006 alongside the traditional vernacular name stock dove. However, later in 2006 the International Ornithological Congress (now the International Ornithological Union) published the first output from their standardised English name project, in which stock pigeon was dropped in favour of stock dove, and this was adopted in the 8th edition of the &quot;British List&quot; in 2013.

The genus name &quot;Columba&quot; is the Latin word meaning &quot;pigeon, dove&quot;, whose older etymology comes from the Ancient Greek κόλυμβος (&quot;kolumbos&quot;), &quot;a diver&quot;, from &quot;κολυμβάω&quot; (kolumbao), &quot;dive, plunge headlong, swim&quot;. Aristophanes (Birds, 304) and others use the word κολυμβίς (&quot;kolumbis&quot;), &quot;diver&quot;, for the name of the bird, because of its swimming motion in the air.

<text>Valery Nikolaevich Kubasov (; 7 January 1935 – 19 February 2014) was a Soviet/Russian cosmonaut who flew on two missions in the Soyuz programme as a flight engineer: Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 19 (the Apollo–Soyuz mission), and commanded Soyuz 36 in the Intercosmos programme. On 21 July 1975, the Soyuz 7K-TM module used for ASTP landed in Kazakhstan at 5:51 p.m. and Kubasov was the first to exit the craft. Kubasov performed the first welding experiments in space, along with Georgy Shonin.

Kubasov was also involved in the development of the Mir space station. He retired from the Russian space program in November 1993 and was later deputy director of RKK Energia.

Kubasov evaded death twice during his space career. He was part of the crew that was originally intended to fly Soyuz 2, which was found to have the same faulty parachute sensor that resulted in Vladimir Komarov&#x27;s death on Soyuz 1 and was later launched without a crew. Later, he was grounded for medical reasons before the Soyuz 11 flight, which killed the crew when the capsule was accidentally depressurised by a faulty valve.

==Early life==
Kubasov was born 7 January 1935, in Vyazniki, Vladimir Oblast, Ivanovo Industrial Oblast, RSFSR, now Vladimir Oblast, Russia. After finishing secondary school in 1952, he graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute in 1958 as an aerospace engineer and reported to work at the bureau led by Sergei Korolev. Initially focusing on ballistic studies, Kubasov worked on the design of the Voskhod capsule. He authored several studies on the calculation of spaceship trajectories, and acquired a Master of Science degree in Engineering.

In May 1964, while working for Korolev, Kubasov became one of a handful of civilian candidates who passed preliminary medical screening for one of the Soviet Voskhod missions. Two years later, after some relaxation of the existing rules, Kubasov along with Georgy Grechko and Vladislav Volkov, were officially accepted into the newly established civilian cosmonaut corps.

==Cosmonaut==

Kubasov&#x27;s first space mission, the five-day Soyuz 6 flight in October 1969, was unsuccessful due to technical issues as space vehicles never met up. During Soyuz 6 mission Kubasov and Georgy Shonin performed the first welding experiment in space. The Vulcan furnace required internal hatches between the orbital and descent modules to be sealed, with the welding performed automatically, overseen by Kubasov. Samples of stainless steel and titanium were welded together, then cut, after which the hatches were opened for Kubasov to perform a hand-held welding. However, in 1990 it became known that Vulcan&#x27;s low-pressure compressed arc had inadvertently targeted a beam at the orbital module wall. Upon opening the hatch, the cosmonauts discovered the damage and, fearing a depressurization, returned to the descent module.

Following his first mission, Kubasov began training to fly aboard the world&#x27;s first space station, Salyut 1, along with Georgy Shonin and Pyotr Kolodin.

In 1971 Kubasov was almost launched aboard the ill-fated Soyuz 11 mission, he was among the prime crew alongside Alexei Leonov. Medics from the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow found a swelling on Kubasov&#x27;s right lung. Fearing the onset of tuberculosis, the entire Soyuz 11 prime crew was grounded and replaced by the backup: Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsayev. In his memoir &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot; Leonov would later write: &quot;It turned out later, that [Kubasov] was allergic to a chemical insecticide used to spray trees&quot;.

The July, 1975, Apollo–Soyuz Test Project became Kubasov&#x27;s second space mission and he was a flight engineer on it. Kubasov spent several hours in the Apollo command and docking modules. During this project Kubasov told the U.S. President Gerald Ford in a TV linkup, that they got &quot;good space food... some juice, some coffee and a lot of water&quot;.

Kubasov&#x27;s last spaceflight was aboard Soyuz 36 in 1980. During this flight, the Soyuz transported the crew that included Bertalan Farkas, the first Hungarian astronaut. Kubasov retired as a cosmonaut on 13 November 1993.

==Death==
Kubasov died in Moscow of natural causes on 19 February 2014, at the age of 79. He was survived by his wife Lyudmila Kurovskaya, daughter Ekaterina and son Dmitry.

<text>The European turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur) is a threatened or vulnerable member of the bird family Columbidae, the doves and pigeons. It breeds over a wide area of the south western Palearctic including north Africa but migrates to northern sub-Saharan Africa to winter.

==Taxonomy==
The European turtle dove was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba turtur&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;turtur&quot; is the Latin word for a turtle dove. Linnaeus gave the locality as &quot;India&quot;. This was an error and the type locality has been designated as England. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot; that was introduced in 1855 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. t. turtur&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Europe, Madeira and the Canary Islands to western Siberia
* &quot;S. t. arenicola&quot; (Hartert, 1894) – Northwest Africa to Iran and western China
* &quot;S. t. hoggara&quot; (Geyr von Schweppenburg, 1916) – Air Massif and Hoggar Mountains (southern Sahara)
* &quot;S. t. rufescens&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1845) – Egypt and northern Sudan

Despite the identical spelling, the &quot;turtle&quot; of the name, derived from Middle English (, , ), derived in turn from Old English (male turtle dove), (female turtle dove), and ultimately from Latin , has no connection with the reptile of the same name; in the present case, &quot;turtle&quot; came originally from Latin , which is onomatopoeic, imitating the bird&#x27;s song. The genus name &quot;Streptopelia&quot; is from Ancient Greek meaning &quot;collar&quot; and meaning &quot;dove&quot;.

A few other doves in the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot; and the related genus &quot;Nesoenas&quot; are also commonly called &quot;turtle doves&quot;, while the name &quot;Turtur&quot; has also been given as a generic name to a less-closely related group of tropical African doves:
*Oriental turtle dove &quot;Streptopelia orientalis&quot; in Asia.
*Dusky turtle dove &quot;Streptopelia lugens&quot; in Africa.
*Adamawa turtle dove &quot;Streptopelia hypopyrrha&quot; in Africa.
*Malagasy turtle dove &quot;Nesoenas picturatus&quot; in Madagascar.

==Description==
Smaller and slighter in build than many other doves, it measures in length, in wingspan and weighs . The European turtle dove may be recognised by its browner colour, and the black-and-white-striped patch on the side of its neck. The tail is notable as the bird flies from the observer; it is wedge shaped, with a dark centre and white borders and tips. When viewed from below, this pattern, owing to the white under-tail coverts obscuring the dark bases, is a blackish chevron on a white ground. This can be seen when the bird stoops to drink and raises its spread tail.

The mature bird has the head, neck, flanks, and rump blue grey, and the wings cinnamon, mottled with black. The breast is vinaceous, the abdomen and under tail coverts are white. The bill is black, the legs and eye rings are red. The black and white patch on the side of the neck is absent in the browner and duller juvenile bird, which also has the legs brown.

==Distribution and habitat==
The turtle dove is a migratory species with a western Palearctic range covering most of Europe and the Middle East and including Turkey and north Africa, although it is rare in northern Scandinavia and Russia. It winters south of the Sahara. It is one of the latest migrants, rarely appearing in Northern Europe before the end of April and returning south again in September.

It is a bird of open rather than dense woodlands, and frequently feeds on the ground. It will occasionally nest in large gardens, but is usually extremely timid, probably due to the heavy hunting pressure it faces during migration. The flight is often described as arrowy, but is not remarkably swift.

The nuptial flight, high and circling, is like that of the common wood pigeon, but the undulations are less decided; it is accompanied by the whip-crack of the downward flicked wings. The arrival in spring is heralded by its ing or purring song, a rather deep, vibrating &quot;&quot;.

==Status==
Populations of turtle dove are in rapid decline across Europe and this species has red list conservation status globally. In the United Kingdom its numbers have declined by 93% since 1994 and across Europe numbers fell by 78% 1980–2013.

Environmentalist groups have attributed the decline of turtle doves in Europe partly to changed farming practices which mean that the weed seeds and shoots on which it feeds, especially fumitory, are scarcer, and partly due to shooting of birds in Mediterranean countries. According to a 2001 study cited by the European Commission, between two and four million birds are shot annually in Malta, Cyprus, France, Italy, Spain and Greece. Environmentalists have described spring hunting in Malta as particularly problematic as it is the only country with an EU derogation to shoot birds during their spring migration to breeding grounds.

According to a 2007 study by the European Commission, four currently identifiable potential threats to the turtle dove are (1) habitat loss/modification (medium to low impact), (2) droughts and climate change (mostly unknown but likely low impact), (3) hunting (partly unknown but overall medium impact), and (4) competition with the collared dove (unknown impact). The British Trust for Ornithology has also highlighted Trichomonosis parasite as a threat to the turtle dove.

A hunting ban was introduced in 2021 by the European Commission in the western Mediterranean countries of France, Spain and Portugal; this has already by summer 2024 resulted in a 25% increase in the western European breeding population, showing that hunting was indeed a major contributor to the decline.

==In culture==
According to Aelian, the turtle dove was sacred to Demeter. In Roman mythology, the turtle dove was one of the emblems of Fides, the goddess of trust and good faith.

Perhaps because of Biblical references – especially verse 2: 12 from the Song of Songs &quot;the voice of the turtle [dove] is heard in our land&quot; – its mournful voice, and the fact that it forms strong pair bonds, European turtle doves have become emblems of devoted love. In the New Testament, two turtle doves are mentioned as the customary offering during the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. In Renaissance Europe, the European turtle dove was envisaged as the devoted partner of the Phoenix. Robert Chester&#x27;s poem &quot;Love&#x27;s Martyr&quot; is a sustained exploration of this symbolism. It was published along with other poems on the subject, including William Shakespeare&#x27;s poem &quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot;, where &quot;turtle&quot; refers to the turtle dove.

The turtle dove is featured in a number of folk songs about love and loss, including &quot;There Is a Tavern in the Town&quot;. One of these is a setting by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Turtle doves are also featured in the song, &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, as the gift &quot;my true love gave to me&quot; on the second and subsequent days of Christmas.

Turtle doves appear in the title and lyrics of the spiritual &quot;Turtledove Done Drooped His Wings&quot; from the Georgia Sea Islands.

In the Shaker hymn &quot;In Yonder Valley&quot;, that &quot;the turtledove is in our land&quot; is seen as a good omen and sign of growth.

Males and young birds also have red markings on the neck or head. This species is found across the Palearctic including parts of North Africa. Across most of its range it is resident, but in the north some will migrate if the conifer cone crop fails. Some individuals have a tendency to wander, leading to the recolonisation of Ireland in the first decade of the 21st century and to vagrancy to North America. Great spotted woodpeckers chisel into trees to find food or excavate nest holes, and also drum for contact and territorial advertisement; like other woodpeckers, they have anatomical adaptations to manage the physical stresses from the hammering action. This species is similar to the Syrian woodpecker.

This woodpecker occurs in all types of woodlands and eats a variety of foods, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks, and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.

The species is closely related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species. It has a huge range and large population, with no widespread threats, so it is classed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

== Taxonomy ==
Woodpeckers are an ancient bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets and the true woodpeckers, Picinae. The largest of the five tribes within the Picinae is Melanerpini, the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the great spotted woodpecker. Within the genus &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; the great spotted woodpecker&#x27;s closest relatives are the Himalayan, Sind, Syrian, white-winged woodpeckers and the Darjeeling woodpecker. The great spotted woodpecker has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian woodpecker.

The great spotted woodpecker was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Picus major&quot;. It was moved to its current genus, &quot;Dendrocopos&quot;, by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816. The genus name &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; is a combination of the Greek words &quot;dendron &quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, and &quot;kopos&quot;, &quot;striking&quot;. The specific &quot;major&quot; is from Latin &quot;maior&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;.

=== Subspecies ===
Recognised subspecies vary by author from as few as 14 to nearly 30. This is largely because changes are clinal with many intermediate forms. However, mitochondrial DNA data suggests that the Caspian Sea region&#x27;s &quot;Dendrocopos major poelzami&quot;, Japanese &quot;D. m. japonicus&quot; and Chinese &quot;D. m. cabanisi&quot; may all merit full species status. Despite its distinctive appearance, &quot;D. m. canariensis&quot; from Tenerife in the Canary Islands appears to be closely related to the nominate subspecies &quot;D. m. major&quot;.

The fossil subspecies &quot;D. m. submajor&quot; lived during the Middle Pleistocene Riss glaciation (250,000 to 300,000 years ago) when it was found in Europe south of the ice sheet. It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, but did not differ significantly from the extant great spotted woodpecker, whose European subspecies are probably its direct descendants.

== Description ==
An adult great spotted woodpecker is long, weighs and has a wingspan. The upperparts are glossy blue-black, with white on the sides of the face and neck. Black lines run from the shoulder to the nape, the base of the bill and about halfway across the breast. There is a large white shoulder patch and the flight feathers are barred with black and white, as is the tail. The underparts are white other than a scarlet lower belly and undertail. The bill is slate-black, the legs greenish-grey and the eye is deep red. Males have a crimson patch on the nape, which is absent from the otherwise similar females. Juvenile birds are less glossy than adults and have a brown tinge to their upperparts and dirty white underparts. Their markings are less well-defined than the adult&#x27;s and the lower belly is pink rather than red. The crown of the juvenile&#x27;s head is red, less extensively in young females than males.

The various subspecies differ in plumage, the general pattern being that northern forms are larger, heavier-billed and whiter beneath, as predicted by Bergmann&#x27;s rule, so north Eurasian &quot;D. m. major&quot; and &quot;D. m. kamtschaticus&quot; are large and strikingly white, whereas &quot;D. m. hispanicus&quot; in Iberia and &quot;D. m. harterti&quot; in Corsica and Sardinia are somewhat smaller and have darker underparts. &quot;D. m. canariensis&quot; and &quot;D. m. thanneri&quot; in the Canary Islands are similar to the Iberian race but have contrasting white flanks. In Morocco, &quot;D. m. mauritanus&quot; is pale below with red in the centre of its breast, and birds breeding at higher altitudes are larger and darker than those lower in the hills. &quot;D. m. numidus&quot; in Algeria and Tunisia is very distinctive, with a breast band of red-tipped black feathers. Caspian &quot;D. m. poelzami&quot; is small, relatively long-billed and has brown underparts. &quot;D. m. japonicus&quot; of Japan has less white on its shoulders but more in its wings. The two Chinese forms, &quot;D. m. cabanisi&quot; and &quot;D. m. stresemanni&quot;, have brownish heads and underparts, and often some red on the breast. Both races have increasingly dark underparts towards the south of their respective ranges.

Some other species in its genus are similar to the great spotted woodpecker. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative&#x27;s black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile great spotted woodpeckers often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker. The Sind woodpecker is very similar to the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.

=== Moult ===

Adult great spotted woodpeckers have a complete moult after the breeding season which takes about 120 days. Northern &quot;D. m. major&quot; starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like &quot;D. m. pinetorum&quot; are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern &quot;D. m. hispanicus&quot; starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the wing coverts but replacing body, tail and primary feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing varying with latitude as with the adults.

=== Voice ===
The call of the great spotted woodpecker is a sharp &quot;kik&quot;, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling &quot;krrarraarr&quot; if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, &quot;gwig&quot;, is mostly given in the display flight. Drumming on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, serves to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.

Both sexes drum, although the male does so much more often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16 strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as the early twentieth century it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species ranges across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan, and in North Africa from Morocco to Tunisia; it is absent only from those areas too cold or dry to have suitable woodland habitat. It is found in a wide variety of woodlands, broadleaf, coniferous or mixed, and in modified habitats like parks, gardens and olive groves. It occurs from sea level to the tree line, up to in Europe, in Morocco and in Central Asia.

The great spotted woodpecker is mainly resident year-round, but sizeable movements can occur when there are shortages of pine and spruce cones in the north of the range. Highland populations often descend to lower altitudes in winter. Juveniles also have a tendency to wander some distance from where they were hatched, often as far as , sometimes up to . Vagrants have reached the Faroe Islands, Hong Kong and Iceland, and there are several sightings from North America in at least the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands and Alaska.

Due to deforestation, this woodpecker was extirpated in Ireland in the seventeenth century, but the island has been naturally recolonised, with the first proven nesting in County Down in 2007. Its expansion in range is continuing, with breeding proven or suspected in at least 10 counties by 2013, with the main concentration in Down and County Wicklow. Genetic evidence shows the birds to be of British, rather than Scandinavian, ancestry, with the populations in Ireland and Northern Ireland having separate origins. The great spotted woodpecker was also found to have been nesting in the Isle of Man from 2009, and breeding from 2010.

== Behaviour ==

The great spotted woodpecker spends much of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, many of which are shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.

The hammering of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great forces which are potentially damaging to the birds. In the great spotted woodpecker and most of its relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on hard wood. The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.

As well as using holes for breeding, great spotted woodpeckers roost at night, and sometimes during the day, in old nest cavities, excavated by other woodpeckers. They will occasionally make a new roosting hole or use an artificial site such as a nest box.

=== Breeding ===
Great spotted woodpeckers are strongly territorial, typically occupying areas of about year-round, which are defended mainly by the male, a behaviour which attracts females. Pairs are monogamous during the breeding period, but often change partners before the next season.

Sexual maturity is attained at an age of one year; courtship behaviour commences in the following December. The male has a fluttering flight display with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site. The female may initiate mating and will occasionally mount the male, this reverse mounting typically preceding normal copulation.

The pair excavate a new hole at least above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or nest box. Old holes are rarely re-used, although the same tree may be used for nesting for several years. The nest cavity is deep with an entrance hole wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the chiselling. As with other woodpeckers, the hole is unlined, although wood chips from the excavation may cover the base of the cavity.

Trees chosen for nest holes have soft heartwood and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree&#x27;s core. It is not certain how suitable trees are selected, although it may be by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent&#x27;s cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.

The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs that measure and weigh about , of which 7% is shell. They are laid from mid-April to June, the later dates being for birds breeding in the north of the range or at altitude. The eggs are incubated by either adult during the day and by the male at night, for 10–12 days before hatching. Both birds brood and feed the altricial naked chicks and keep the nest clean. The young fledge in 20–23 days from hatching. Each parent then takes responsibility for feeding part of the brood for about ten days, during which time they normally remain close to the nest tree.

There is only one brood per year. The survival rates for adults and young are unknown, as is the average lifespan, but the maximum known age is just over 11 years.

=== Feeding ===
The great spotted woodpecker is omnivorous. It digs beetle larvae from trees and also takes many other invertebrates including adult beetles, ants and spiders. The bird also digs for Lepidoptera larvae like &quot;Acronicta rumicis&quot;. Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for seeds, suet and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary. House martin colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.

Fat-rich plant products such as nuts and conifer seeds are particularly important as winter food in the north of the woodpecker&#x27;s range, and can then supply more than 30% of the bird&#x27;s energy requirements. Other plant items consumed include buds, berries and tree sap, the latter obtained by drilling rings of holes around a tree trunk.

The species feeds at all levels of a tree, usually alone, but sometimes as a pair. It will use an &quot;anvil&quot; on which to hammer hard items, particularly pine, spruce, and larch cones, but also fruit, nuts, and hard-bodied insects.

Easily accessible items are picked off the tree surface or from fissures in the bark, but larvae are extracted by chiselling holes up to deep and trapping the soft insect with the tongue, which can extend to beyond the bill, and is covered with bristles and sticky saliva to trap the prey. The woodpecker is able to extend its tongue so far because the hyoid bone to which it is attached has long flexible &quot;horns&quot; that wind around the skull and can move forward when required.

=== Predators and parasites ===
Woodland birds of prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk hunt the great spotted woodpecker. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly &quot;Carnus hemapterus&quot;, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm &quot;Prosthorhynchus transversus&quot;. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm &quot;Anomotaenia brevis&quot;.

== Status ==
The total population for the great spotted woodpecker is estimated at 73.7–110.3 million individuals, with 35% of the population in Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted woodpecker is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.

Breeding densities have been recorded as between 0.1 and 6.6 pairs/10 ha (0.04–2.7 pairs/10 acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland and its ability to thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of the subspecies &quot;D. m. canariensis&quot; on Tenerife and &quot;D. m. thanneri&quot; on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from the exploitation of the local pine forests.

<text> (TU Berlin; also known as Berlin Institute of Technology and Technical University of Berlin, although officially the name should not be translated) is a public research university located in Berlin, Germany. It was the first German university to adopt the name &quot;Technische Universität&quot; (university of technology).

The university alumni and staff includes several US National Academies members, two National Medal of Science laureates, the creator of the first fully functional programmable (electromechanical) computer, Konrad Zuse, and ten Nobel Prize laureates.

TU Berlin is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology and of the Top International Managers in Engineering network, which allows for student exchanges between leading engineering schools. It belongs to the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research. The TU Berlin is home of two innovation centers designated by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. The university is labeled as &quot;The Entrepreneurial University&quot; (&quot;Die Gründerhochschule&quot;) by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.

The university is notable for having been the first to offer a degree in Industrial Engineering and Management (&quot;Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen&quot;). The university designed the degree in response to requests by industrialists for graduates with the technical and management training to run a company. First offered in winter term 1926/27, it is one of the oldest programmes of its kind.

TU Berlin has one of the highest proportions of international students in Germany, almost 27% in 2019. In addition, TU Berlin is part of the Berlin University Alliance, has been conferred the title of &quot;University of Excellence&quot; under and receiving funding from the German Universities Excellence Initiative.

==History==


On 1 April 1879, the &quot;Königlich Technische Hochschule zu Berlin&quot; (en: &quot;Royal Technical Academy of Berlin&quot;) came into being in 1879 through a merger of the &quot;Königliche Gewerbeakademie zu Berlin&quot; (en: &quot;Royal Trade Academy&quot;, founded in 1827) and &quot;Königliche Bauakademie zu Berlin&quot; (en: &quot;Royal Building Academy&quot;, founded in 1799), two predecessor institutions of the Prussian State.

In 1899, the Königlich Technische Hochschule zu Berlin was the first polytechnic in Germany to award doctorates, as a standard degree for the graduates, in addition to diplomas, thanks to professor Alois Riedler and Adolf Slaby, chairman of the Association of German Engineers (VDI) and the Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies (VDE).

In 1916 the long-standing &quot;Königliche Bergakademie zu Berlin&quot;, the Prussian mining academy created by the geologist Carl Abraham Gerhard in 1770 at the behest of King Frederick the Great, was incorporated into the Königlich Technische Hochschule as the &quot;Department of Mining&quot;. Beforehand, the mining college had been, however, for several decades under the auspices of the &quot;Frederick William University&quot; (now Humboldt University of Berlin), before it was spun out again in 1860.

After Charlottenburg&#x27;s absorption into Greater Berlin in 1920 and Germany becoming the Weimar Republic, the &quot;Königlich Technische Hochschule zu Berlin&quot; was renamed &quot;Technische Hochschule zu Berlin&quot; (&quot;TH Berlin&quot;). In 1927, the Department of Geodesy of the &quot;Agricultural College of Berlin&quot; was incorporated into the &quot;TH Berlin&quot;. During the 1930s, the redevelopment and expansion of the campus along the &quot;East-West axis&quot; were part of the Nazi plans of a &quot;Welthauptstadt Germania&quot;, including a new faculty of defense technology under General Karl Becker, built as a part of the greater academic town (&quot;Hochschulstadt&quot;) in the adjacent west-wise Grunewald forest. The shell construction remained unfinished after the outbreak of World War II and after Becker&#x27;s suicide in 1940, it is today covered by the large-scale Teufelsberg rubble hill.

The north section of the main building of the university was destroyed during a bombing raid in November 1943. Due to the street fighting at the end of the Second World War, the operations at the &quot;TH Berlin&quot; were suspended as of 20 April 1945. Planning for the re-opening of the school began on 2 June 1945, once the acting rectorship led by Gustav Ludwig Hertz and Max Volmer was appointed. As both Hertz and Volmer remained in exile in the Soviet Union for some time to come, the college was not re-inaugurated until 9 April 1946, now bearing the name &quot;Technische Universität Berlin&quot;.

Since 2009 the TU Berlin has housed two Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KIC) designated by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.

==Name==

The official policy of the university is that only the German name, Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin), should be used abroad in order to promote corporate identity and that its name is not to be translated into English.

==Campus==

The TU Berlin covers , distributed over various locations in Berlin.
The main campus is located in the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The seven schools of the university have some 33,933 students enrolled in 90 subjects (October 2015).

From 2012 to 2022, TU Berlin operated a satellite campus in Egypt, the El Gouna campus, to act as a scientific and academic field office. The nonprofit public–private partnership (PPP) aimed to offer services provided by Technische Universität Berlin at the campus in El Gouna on the Red Sea.

The university also has a franchise of its Global Production Engineering coursecalled Global Production Engineering and Management at the Vietnamese-German University in Ho Chi Minh City.

<text>The lesser spotted woodpecker (Dryobates minor) is a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. It was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; (sometimes incorrectly spelt as &quot;Dendrocopus&quot;). Some taxonomic authorities continue to list the species there.

The range of the lesser spotted woodpecker is the Palearctic region, but several subspecies are recognised.

==Taxonomy==
The lesser spotted woodpecker was listed by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Picus minor&quot;. The species was moved to the genus &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences found that the species placed in the genus &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; did not form a monophyletic group. In the revised generic classification, the lesser spotted woodpecker was placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Dryobates&quot;, that had originally been introduced by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The genus name &quot;Dryobates&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; meaning woodland and &quot;batēs&quot; meaning walker. The specific &quot;minor&quot; is Latin for &quot;smaller&quot;.

There are 13 recognised subspecies:
*&quot;D. m. comminutus&quot; (Hartert, 1907) – England and Wales 
*&quot;D. m. minor&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Scandinavia and northeast Poland to the Ural Mountains
*&quot;D. m. kamtschatkensis&quot; (Malherbe, 1860) – Ural Mountains to the Sea of Okhotsk and northern Mongolia
*&quot;D. m. immaculatus&quot; (Stejneger, 1884) – Anadyr Basin and Kamchatka Peninsula (east Siberia)
*&quot;D. m. amurensis&quot; (Buturlin, 1908) – northeast China, Siberia, Korea and Hokkaido (Japan)
*&quot;D. m. hortorum&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1831) – central Europe 
*&quot;D. m. buturlini&quot; Hartert, 1912 – southern Europe 
*&quot;D. m. danfordi&quot; (Hargitt, 1883) – Greece and Turkey 
*&quot;D. m. colchicus&quot; (Buturlin, 1908) Caucasus and Transcaucasia 
*&quot;D. m. quadrifasciatus&quot; (Radde, 1884) – southeast Azerbaijan
*&quot;D. m. hyrcanus&quot; (Zarudny &amp; Bilkevitch, 1913) – north Iran 
*&quot;D. m. morgani&quot; (Zarudny &amp; Loudon, 1904) – southwest Iran 
*&quot;D. m. ledouci&quot; (Malherbe, 1855) – northwest Africa

==Description==
This is the smallest European woodpecker, with adults being long with a wing span of and weighing . A sample of 50 lesser spotted woodpeckers in Great Britain averaged in body mass. From its small size and its habit of spending most of its time in the tops of tall trees in woods and parks, this little woodpecker is often overlooked, but if sighted on a trunk it may at once be identified by the broad barring on the wings and narrower bars across the lower back.

The male has a crimson crown, a brown forehead, a black superciliary stripe, and another from the base of the bill to the neck. The nape and upper back are black, but the lower back is barred with black and white. On the wings are broader and more conspicuous bars, and the outer tail feathers are also barred. The under parts are white with streaks on the flanks. The bill and legs are slate-grey.

In the female the crown is white, but the young birds of both sexes have more or less crimson on the head. There are no marked seasonal changes.

==Ecology==
Its habits are very similar to those of the great spotted woodpecker, and it has the same stumpy appearance, almost triangular, when bounding from tree to tree. Its note is a repeated &quot;keek&quot;, loud for so small a bird, and its vibrating rattle can with experience be distinguished from that of the larger species. This substitute for a song may be heard at all times, but most frequently when courtship begins early in the year.

Its insect food is similar to that of the great spotted woodpecker. When hunting for wood-boring larvae it chips away at the rotten wood, and the litter at the foot of a tree is often the first indication that insects are attacking upper branches. From autumn to spring it hunts mainly on wood-living insect larvae, frequently from thin dead branches in living trees. Through the breeding season, surface-living insects from the foliage and bark of trees make up an increased amount of the diet. Nestlings are mainly fed with surface-living insects, such as aphids and larval insects. At night it roosts in old holes.

A litter of chips is also a guide to a nesting hole, for the bird does not always carry these away when excavating. The hole is usually at a considerable height above the ground and may be as high as . It is a smaller burrow than that of the great spotted woodpecker, measuring from in diameter.

The shaft varies, the nesting cavity often being or more below the entrance. Five to eight highly polished white eggs are laid upon wood dust and chips in the latter half of May, and a single brood is the rule. Both birds help to incubate. Occasionally an old or natural hollow is used or enlarged.

Populations of lesser spotted woodpeckers are mostly resident, but can be nomadic to some degree. Annual fluctuations in population numbers are common. The winter temperatures may have a direct effect on winter survival of lesser spotted woodpeckers by heat loss, whereas weather conditions during spring have an indirect effect on breeding performance by affecting food sources. In 2017, the UK population of lesser spotted woodpeckers was reported to have almost halved since 2009, to around 2,000. The British Ornithology Trust blamed modern habits of removing dead trees quickly from parks and woodland, depriving the birds of the decaying wood which is their favoured nesting habitat.

<text>Georgy Stepanovich Shonin (; 3 August 1935 – 7 April 1997) was a Soviet cosmonaut, who flew on the Soyuz 6 space mission.

Shonin was born in Rovenky, Luhansk Oblast, (now Ukraine) but grew up in Balta in the Ukrainian SSR. His family hid a Jewish family from the Nazis during WWII.

In February 1957, Shonin graduated Naval Aviation School as was awarded his lieutenant&#x27;s wings. He was then posted to the 935th Fighter Regiment of the Baltic Fleet which was the naval element of the Soviet Air Force. In 1958, he was transferred to the 768th Fighter Regiment of the Northern Fleet based in the Murmansk region. During this time, he would befriend another young flying officer named Yuri Gagarin.

Shonin was part of the original group of cosmonauts selected in 1960. Shonin would fly on Soyuz 6 in October 1969. He left the space program in 1979 for medical reasons. He was then promoted to major general. Shonin later worked as the director of the 30th Central Scientific Research Institute, Ministry of Defence (Russia) where he had management responsibilities for the development of the Buran space shuttle.

He died of a heart attack in 1997.

<doc id="197209" wikidata="Q5459044" url="?curid=197209" title="Meryta sinclairii">
<text>Meryta sinclairii, commonly known as the puka or pukanui, is a large-leaved evergreen tree endemic to New Zealand that grows to about 8 m tall, with the distinctly tropical appearance typical of the genus. There are about 27 species of &quot;Meryta&quot;, all small, resinous trees of the subtropical and tropical Pacific Ocean.

Puka occurs naturally on the Three Kings Islands (c. 34°S, 172°W) and the Hen and Chickens Islands (c. 36°S, 175°W) where it occurs in greater abundance in the relatively sheltered valleys, where soils are thick and conditions are relatively moist, rather than on the exposed ridge-tops. However, puka can also grow on cliffs with shallow, stony soils which suggests some tolerance of drought.

==Description==
The elliptical, thick, leathery leaves may be up to 50 cm long and 20 cm wide with a glossy upper surface. They are the largest entire leaves in the New Zealand flora. The petioles (leaf stalks) may be up to 35 cm long. The tree produces panicles of green-white flowers followed by black berries. The leaves are densely crowded, twenty to thirty together at the tips of the branches, with a few large deciduous scales amongst the petioles of the youngest.
When young, the puka grows straight up, but once it has flowered it tends to branch, typically forming a rounded crown. Puka&#x27;s green-white flowers arise on erect terminal panicles up to 50 cm long from spring to autumn. The flowers are inconspicuous and ball-bearing sized fruit form only on the female plants (although occasionally bisexual flowers occur). The fruit is roundish-oblong, black, shining, slightly angled when young, becoming even as it approaches maturity; seeds 5, curved, much compressed, about three-eights of an inch in length, black, or dark-brown, intensely hard. Fruits take a year to mature, and as they begin to ripen to black, birds are attracted to them.

The entire plant is more or less resinous, and the dark-brown bark has numerous warty excrescences and is easily wounded, producing large callosities as it heals. The wood is white and brittle. The branches are very stout, showing the scars of fallen leaves. The trunk is stout or slender, irregularly and sparingly branched.

==Discovery==
Puka first came to European attention when William Colenso found a single tree growing at the head of Whangaruru Bay in Northland (on the New Zealand mainland). This tree was protected by a fence, and declared sacred by Māori, who told Colenso that they had brought the tree from the Poor Knights Islands. Colenso made frequent visits to Whangaruru Bay over several years in the vain hope of procuring flowers and fruit. Colenso pointed out the tree to Dr Andrew Sinclair, (1794–1861), Colonial Secretary and naturalist, for whom the tree would eventually be named. Colenso and Sinclair sent specimens of the foliage to Kew. Later William Mair found the tree, and he eventually succeeded in procuring specimens of the leaves and fruit, which were forwarded to Dr Joseph Hooker at Kew. From these specimens the original description of the tree was made under the name &quot;Botryodendrum sinclairii&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Kirk recorded in 1869 that puka was &#x27;already established under cultivation&#x27;, and today it is widely grown as a street tree and a garden specimen in northern New Zealand. The main method of propagation is from seed although cuttings may be taken with limited success. Puka grows well in full sun or light shade and is intolerant of frost, especially when young. Puka is sensitive to frost – leaves will suffer damage if the temperature drops below −2 °C, although it has been grown as far south as Dunedin in protected situations. Puka is wind tolerant, and is unaffected by salt spray and highly tolerant of coastal conditions. Puka may be trimmed to contain its size and can be grown in large containers. It also makes an ideal indoor plant when young. &quot;Meryta sinclairii&quot; var. &#x27;Moonlight&#x27; is a variegated form with very attractive cream and yellow leaves. It is not as vigorous or as easy to grow as the wild form.

<text>Lead styphnate (lead 2,4,6-trinitroresorcinate, C6HN3O8Pb ), whose name is derived from styphnic acid, is an explosive used as a component in primer and detonator mixtures for less sensitive secondary explosives. Lead styphnate is only slightly soluble in water and methanol. Samples of lead styphnate vary in color from yellow to gold, orange, reddish-brown, to brown. Lead styphnate is known in various polymorphs, hydrates, and basic salts. Normal lead styphnate monohydrate, monobasic lead styphnate, tribasic lead styphnate dihydrate, and pentabasic lead styphnate dehydrate as well as α, β polymorphs of lead styphnate exist.

Lead styphnate forms six-sided crystals of the monohydrate and small rectangular crystals. Lead styphnate is particularly sensitive to fire and the discharge of static electricity. Long thin crystals are particularly sensitive. Lead styphnate does not react with other metals and is less sensitive to shock and friction than mercury fulminate or lead azide. It is stable in storage, even at elevated temperatures. As with other lead-containing compounds, lead styphnate is toxic owing to heavy metal poisoning.

==Preparation==
Lead styphnate (or, as it was then called, trinitro-orcinate) was discovered along with many other thrinitroresorcinate salts by British chemist John Stenhouse in 1871, the synthesis route involving action of trinitroresorcinol on lead acetate.

In 1919, Austrian chemist Edmund von Herz first established a preparation of anhydrous normal lead styphnate by the reaction of magnesium styphnate with lead acetate in the presence of nitric acid.

:{C6N3O8}MgH2O + Pb(CH3CO2)2 → {C6N3O8}PbH2O + Mg(CH3CO2)2

==Structure==
Normal lead styphnate exists as α and β polymorphs, both being monoclinic crystals. The lead centres are seven-coordinate and are bridged via oxygen bridges. The water molecule is coordinated to the metal and is also hydrogen-bonded to the anion. Many of the Pb-O distances are short, indicating some degree of covalency. The styphnate ions lie in approximately parallel
planes linked by Pb atoms.

==Properties==
Lead styphnate&#x27;s heat of formation is −835 kJ mol−1. The loss of water leads to the formation of a sensitive anhydrous material with a density of 2.9 g cm−3. The variation of colors remains unexplained. Lead styphnate has a detonation velocity of 5.2 km/s and an explosion temperature of 265–280 °C after five seconds.
==Applications==
Lead styphnate is mainly used in small arms ammunition for military and commercial applications. It serves as a primary explosive used in firearms primers, which will ignite upon a simple impact. It is similarly used in blank cartridges for powder-actuated nail guns. Lead styphnate is also used as primer in microthrusters for small satellite stationkeeping.

<doc id="197215" wikidata="Q313658" url="?curid=197215" title="Disposable camera">
<text>A disposable or single-use camera is a simple box camera meant to be used once. Most use fixed-focus lenses. Some are equipped with an integrated flash unit, and there are even waterproof versions for underwater photography. Internally, the cameras use a 135 film or an APS cartridge.

While some disposables contain an actual cartridge as used for loading normal, reusable cameras, others just have the film wound internally on an open spool. The whole camera is handed in for processing. Some of the cameras are recycled, i.e. refilled with film and resold. The cameras are returned for &quot;processing&quot; in the same fashion as film cameras.

In general the one-time-use camera represents a return to the business model pioneered by Kodak for their Kodak camera, predecessor to the Brownie camera; it is particularly popular in situations where a reusable camera would be easily stolen or damaged, when one&#x27;s regular camera is forgotten, or if one cannot afford a regular camera.

==History==

A company called Photo-Pac produced a cardboard camera beginning in 1949 which shot eight exposures and was mailed-in for processing. Cameras were expensive, and would often have been left safely at home when photo opportunities presented themselves. Frustrated with missing photo opportunities, H. M. Stiles had invented a way to enclose 35mm film in an inexpensive enclosure without the expensive precision film transport mechanism. It cost . Though incredibly similar to the familiar single-use cameras today, Photo-Pac failed to make a permanent impression on the market.

In 1966, French company FEX introduced a disposable bakelite camera called &quot;Photo Pack Matic&quot;, featuring 12 photos (4×4 cm).

The currently familiar disposable camera was developed by Fujifilm in 1986. Their QuickSnap line, known as 写ルンです (&quot;Utsurun-Desu&quot;, &quot;It takes pictures&quot;) in Japan, used 35 mm film, while Eastman Kodak&#x27;s 1987 Fling was based on 110 film. Kodak released a 35 mm version in 1988, and in 1989 renamed the 35 mm version the FunSaver and discontinued the 110 Fling.

In Japan, annual sales of disposable cameras reached a maximum of more than 89 million in 1997. Annual sales declined to less than 5 million in 2012, but increased to more than 9 million in 2019. The revived popularity of disposable cameras, such as the Fujicolor Utsurundesu (1986) is an example of Showa retro.

== Common uses ==

Disposable cameras are popular with tourists and people traveling around the world to save pictures of their adventures.

Since the late 1990s, disposable cameras have become increasingly popular as wedding favors. Usually they are placed on tables at wedding receptions to be used by guests to capture their unique perspective of the event. More commonly they are available in colors to match the wedding theme such as ivory, blue, white, gold, etc.

So-called &quot;accident camera kits&quot; containing film-based disposable cameras are increasingly being carried in vehicles to take images as evidence after an accident. The absence of batteries allows instantaneous usage even after extended storage, for example in a glove compartment.

They often have cheap plastic lenses, below average film quality, and fixed focal lengths. The quick ease of the &#x27;point and shoot&#x27; method that these disposable cameras were made for make them popular with many photographers who enjoy the &#x27;less than perfect&#x27; style these cameras provide, in a move away from digital imagery, which can also be seen in the rise in popularity of &#x27;lomography&#x27;. This has also led to a number of &#x27;lost art&#x27; type projects where disposable cameras are left in public spaces with a message for anyone finding the camera to take some images and then post the camera back, or pass it on to another person. The low cost of the cameras makes them a perfect tool for these sorts of projects.

== Digital ==

Digital one-time-use cameras (and also digital one-time-use camcorders) are available in some markets; for example the US saw the introduction of one such digital camera in 2004. Digital disposables have not had the success of their film based counterparts, possibly from the expense of the process (especially compared to normal digital camera use) and the poor quality of the images compared to either a typical digital camera, or a disposable film camera. Usually, the display shows the number of shots remaining, and once this is completed, the camera is returned to the store. The digital files are then extracted from the camera, and in return for keeping the camera, they are printed out or stored to CD (or DVD in the case of the video camera ) for the customer. Almost all digital &#x27;single use&#x27; cameras have been successfully hacked to eliminate the need to return them to the store. The motivations for such hacking include saving money and, more commonly, the challenge of overcoming artificial impositions (such as a 25 shot limit on an internal memory that can store 100 images).

<doc id="197216" wikidata="Q117512" url="?curid=197216" title="Sture">
<text>Sture () was a name borne by three distinct but interrelated noble families in Sweden in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. It was originally a nickname, meaning &#x27;haughty, proud&#x27; (compare the Swedish word &quot;stursk&quot; and the Old Norse and Icelandic personal name &quot;Sturla&quot;), but later became a surname. Particularly famous are the three regents () from these families who ruled Sweden in succession during the fifty-year period between 1470 and 1520, namely:
*Sten Sture the Elder, regent 1470–1497 and 1501–1503
*Svante Nilsson, regent 1504–1512
*Sten Sture the Younger, regent 1512–1520

The Sture families are remembered in the names of Sturegatan (&#x27;Sture Street&#x27;) and Stureplan (&#x27;Sture Square&#x27;) in central Stockholm, and by the in Uppsala, as well as , which is produced by a dairy in Sävsjö, close to the main seat of the &#x27;Younger Sture&#x27; family at .

==Sture (Sjöblad) Family==
The first Sture line to emerge is known in Swedish historiography as the Sjöblad Family () to differentiate it from later kin-groups with the name Sture, as its coat of arms bore three &quot;seeblätter&quot; (stylised water lilies), known in Swedish as &quot;sjöblad&quot;.

The earliest known member of the family was , a landowner from Västergötland who is first attested in 1310. He seems at the time to have been a loyalist of King Birger, but later defected to his brother and rival Erik Magnusson. After Erik&#x27;s death, Anund served his son, King Magnus Eriksson.

Anund&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Gustaf Algotsson Sture, lived a century later. Around 1438 he married Birgitta Stensdotter, a member of the Bielke family and half-sister to the powerful Marshal of the Realm, Karl Knutsson Bonde, who ten years later declared himself King of Sweden as Karl VIII.

Gustaf and Birgitta had a single son, Sten Gustafsson Sture, known retrospectively as Sten Sture the Elder to distinguish him from a later Sten Sture (for whom see below). He was one of his uncle King Karl&#x27;s strongest supporters, and upon Karl&#x27;s death in 1470 he was named regent () and guardian to the king&#x27;s infant son Karl Karlsson. Sten&#x27;s position was initially shaky, but he quickly established his authority by defeating a Danish invasion at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471. He made no attempt to have Karl Karlsson crowned king, but nor did he seize the throne himself, and instead continued to rule the kingdom as regent for the next thirty-two years, albeit with an interruption in the period 1497-1501. He did not have any children, and so the Sjöblad line died with him when he died in 1503.

==Danish Sture Family==
The second Sture family is usually known as the Danish Sture Family (), as it originated from Halland, then part of Denmark; it is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Sture (Spets Nedifrån)&quot;, i.e. &#x27;Sture (tip up)&#x27;, as its coat of arms resembles a spearhead pointing upwards. The earliest known member of the family was the knight Nils Sture, who is first attested in 1377 and 1392.

Nils&#x27;s son, Sven Sture, was appointed by Queen Margaret to command her forces on Gotland in either 1395 or 1396. However, soon afterward he betrayed her and turned the island over to Erik Albrektsson, son of her archenemy Albert of Mecklenburg. Gotland subsequently became the principal base for the &quot;Vitalienbrüder&quot;, German privateers hired by the Mecklenburgers to harass Scandinavian shipping. In 1398 the Teutonic Order, frustrated that their ships were also being attacked by the pirates, decided to deal with the problem by invading Gotland. Sven Sture escaped with a group of &quot;Vitalienbrüder&quot; and established a new pirate base at in Hälsingland, but later that year he accepted a pardon from Queen Margaret and settled peacefully at Eksjö (present-day ) in Småland. Sven does not seem to have had any sons, and so the Danish Sture line died with him. However, he did leave a daughter, Katarina, who married Bo Stensson of the Natt och Dag family.

==Younger Sture Family (Natt och Dag)==

After Sven Sture&#x27;s death, his castle at Eksjö was inherited first by his son-in-law Bo Stensson (Natt och Dag), and then by Bo&#x27;s son Nils. Nils subsequently adopted his grandfather&#x27;s surname, calling himself Nils Bosson Sture, and thus founded a third Sture line, traditionally referred to as the &#x27;Younger Sture Family&#x27; (), though he nevertheless continued to use the same Natt och Dag arms as his father and other paternal relatives. As a result, the Younger Sture Family is usually considered an offshoot of the Natt och Dag rather than a continuation of the Danish Sture line.

To make matters even more confusing, Nils&#x27;s Natt och Dag ancestors were linked by marriage to the Sture (Sjöblad) family. Thus Nils Bosson Sture and Sten Sture the Elder were distant cousins (Sten&#x27;s great-grandmother Märta Bosdotter was also Nils&#x27;s great-aunt), but their shared surname of Sture came from &quot;unrelated&quot; ancestors. Nils was initially one of Sten&#x27;s most prominent supporters, but the two men later became estranged, and by the time of his death Nils was a leading member of the unionist opposition to Sten&#x27;s regency.
Nils&#x27;s son Svante rejected the surname Sture, instead simply styling himself &#x27;Svante Nilsson&#x27;. This may have been a gesture of opposition to Sten Sture, to whom he was initially hostile as his father had been. As such he was one of the leaders of the 1497 rebellion which deposed Sten as regent and invited in King Hans of Denmark to rule Sweden instead, thereby restoring the Kalmar Union. Hans, however, alienated Svante and other erstwhile opponents of Sten by his clumsy attempts to play the different Swedish factions off against each other in order to increase his own power, and in 1501 Svante helped Sten to foment a rebellion which led to the expulsion of Hans&#x27;s troops and Sten&#x27;s restoration as regent. After Sten died in 1503, Svante succeeded him as regent, and ruled Sweden until his own death a decade later.
Svante&#x27;s son Sten Svantesson succeeded him as regent, and revived the Sture surname in order to associate himself with the memory of Sten Sture the Elder; he is therefore known to history as Sten Sture the Younger. The younger Sten ruled Sweden for eight years before being defeated and killed by Christian II of Denmark at the Battle of Bogesund.

The regent&#x27;s sons, Nils Stensson and Svante Stensson, were both captured by the Danes and imprisoned in Copenhagen. In their absence, a nobleman called Gustav Eriksson Vasa led a successful rebellion against Christian and declared himself King of Sweden in 1523. The following year the Stenssons were released by the new Danish king, Frederick I, and returned to Sweden. It appears Nils died soon afterward, but an apparent impostor, the so-called &quot;Daljunker&quot;, led an abortive revolt against Gustav in 1527-8. Gustav died in 1560, and was succeeded by his son King Erik XIV. Erik soon became suspicious of Svante and his eldest son Nils Svantesson, whom he believed was plotting to usurp the throne, and in 1567 he had them arrested along with Nils&#x27;s brother Erik and then personally killed all three of them in a violent outburst known to history as the Sture Murders.

Svante&#x27;s youngest son, Mauritz, managed to avoid the king&#x27;s suspicions due to his youth. He later had a son called Svante, but Svante Mauritzson failed to have children of his own, and so the Younger Sture family died with him in 1616.

===Revived Sture Line===
The Younger Stures were survived by their cousins in the main Natt och Dag line, descended from Bo Stensson&#x27;s elder brother Bengt Stensson. One of Bengt&#x27;s descendants, Sten Arfvidsson (1681–1730), was an officer in the Swedish Army during the Great Northern War, rising to the rank of Major-General and marrying a daughter of the prominent statesman Carl Piper. He was ennobled in 1720 as Baron Sture, thus establishing a new Sture line. This iteration of the Sture family died out in 1875, but the principal Natt och Dag line survives to the present day, and is indeed reckoned to be the oldest surviving family within the Swedish nobility.

==Sture Party==
Sten Sture the Elder, Svante Nilsson and Sten Sture the Younger are often known collectively as &#x27;the Stures&#x27; (), even though Svante never used the surname himself and seems to have considered himself a Natt och Dag rather than a Sture. The faction within Swedish society which supported the three regents in their efforts to maintain &quot;de facto&quot; Swedish independence from the Kalmar Union are known to historians as the Sture Party () or the Sture Men (), though neither term was used at the time. 

Marxist historiography saw the conflict between the Sture Party and Swedish unionists as a class struggle between a generally unionist aristocracy and Church on the one hand, and a separatist-leaning peasantry and bourgeoisie on the other, with the latter social groups forming the backbone of the Sture Party. However, more recent historians have instead tended to stress the fact that factional allegiances were often unstable, and seem to have depended more on personal relationships and political circumstances rather than social station or a fixed ideological outlook.
