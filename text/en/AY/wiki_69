<text>USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (CV-5) was an aircraft carrier that served in the United States Navy during World War II. Named after the Battle of Yorktown in 1781, she was commissioned in 1937. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was the lead ship of the , which was designed on the basis of lessons learned from operations with the converted battlecruisers of the and the smaller purpose-built .

&quot;Yorktown&quot; was at port in Norfolk during the attack on Pearl Harbor, having just completed a patrol of the Atlantic Ocean. She then sailed to San Diego in late December 1941 and was incorporated as the flagship of Task Force 17. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March 1942. Her aircraft sank or damaged several warships supporting the invasion of Tulagi in early May. &quot;Yorktown&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Lexington&quot; in the Coral Sea and attempted to stop the invasion of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. They sank the light aircraft carrier on 7 May during the Battle of the Coral Sea, but did not encounter the main Japanese force of the carriers and until the next day. Aircraft from &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; badly damaged &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, but the Japanese aircraft critically damaged &quot;Lexington&quot;, which was later scuttled, and severely damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot;.

Despite the damage suffered, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was able to return to Hawaii. Although estimates were that the damage would take two weeks to repair, &quot;Yorktown&quot; put to sea only 72 hours after entering drydock at Pearl Harbor, which meant that she was available for the next confrontation with the Japanese. &quot;Yorktown&quot; played an important part in the Battle of Midway in early June. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft played crucial roles in crippling two Japanese fleet carriers. &quot;Yorktown&quot; also absorbed both Japanese aerial counterattacks at Midway which otherwise would have been directed at the carriers and . On 4 June, during the battle, Japanese aircraft from the aircraft carrier Hiryu crippled &quot;Yorktown&quot; after two attacks. She lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Salvage efforts on &quot;Yorktown&quot; were encouraging, and she was taken in tow by . On 6 June, the Japanese submarine &quot;I-168&quot; fired a salvo of torpedoes, two of which struck &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and a third sinking the destroyer , which had been providing auxiliary power to &quot;Yorktown&quot;. With further salvage efforts deemed hopeless, the remaining repair crews were evacuated from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which sank on 7 June. The wreck of &quot;Yorktown&quot; was located by oceanographer Robert Ballard in 1998.

==Early career==
&quot;Yorktown&quot; was laid down on 21 May 1934 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.; launched on 4 April 1936; sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt; and commissioned at the Naval Station Norfolk (NS Norfolk), Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 September 1937, Captain Ernest D. McWhorter in command.

After fitting out, the aircraft carrier trained in Hampton Roads, Virginia and in the southern drill grounds off the Virginia capes into January 1938, conducting carrier qualifications for her newly embarked air group.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed for the Caribbean on 8 January 1938 and arrived at Culebra, Puerto Rico, on 13 January. Over the ensuing month, the carrier conducted her shakedown, touching at Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; Gonaïves, Haiti; Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Cristóbal, Panama Canal Zone. Departing Colón Bay, Cristóbal, on 1 March, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed for Hampton Roads, arrived on 6 March, and put into the Norfolk Navy Yard the next day for post-shakedown availability.

After undergoing repairs through the early autumn of 1938, &quot;Yorktown&quot; moved station from the navy yard to NS Norfolk on 17 October 1938 and soon headed for the Southern Drill Grounds for training.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; operated off the eastern seaboard, ranging from Chesapeake Bay to Guantanamo Bay, into 1939. As flagship for Carrier Division 2, she participated in her first war game—Fleet Problem XX—along with her sister-ship in February 1939. The scenario for the exercise called for one fleet to control the sea lanes in the Caribbean against the incursion of a foreign European power while maintaining sufficient naval strength to protect vital American interests in the Pacific. The maneuvers were witnessed, in part, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, embarked in the heavy cruiser .

The critique of the operation revealed that carrier operations—a part of the scenarios for the annual exercises since the entry of into the war games in 1925—had achieved a new peak of efficiency. Despite the inexperience of &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;—comparative newcomers to the Fleet—both carriers made significant contributions to the success of the problem. The planners had studied the employment of carriers and their embarked air groups in connection with convoy escort, antisubmarine defense, and various attack measures against surface ships and shore installations. In short, they worked to develop the tactics that would be used when war actually came.

==Pacific Fleet==
Following Fleet Problem XX, &quot;Yorktown&quot; returned briefly to Hampton Roads before sailing for the Pacific on 20 April 1939. Transiting the Panama Canal a week later, &quot;Yorktown&quot; soon commenced a regular routine of operations with the Pacific Fleet. The Second World War started on 1 September 1939, but the USA was not yet involved. Operating out of San Diego into 1940, the carrier participated in Fleet Problem XXI that April. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940. At the same time her signal bridge atop the tripod foremast was enclosed, and several 50 caliber machine guns were fitted in galleries along the edges of the flight deck.

Fleet Problem XXI—a two-part exercise—included some of the operations that would characterize future warfare in the Pacific. The first part of the exercise was devoted to training in making plans and estimates; in screening and scouting; in coordination of combatant units; and in employing fleet and standard dispositions. The second phase included training in convoy protection, the seizure of advanced bases, and, ultimately, the decisive engagement between the opposing fleets. The last pre-war exercise of its type, Fleet Problem XXI contained two exercises (comparatively minor at the time) where air operations played a major role. Fleet Joint Air Exercise 114A prophetically pointed out the need to coordinate Army and Navy defense plans for the Hawaiian Islands, and Fleet Exercise 114 proved that aircraft could be used for high altitude tracking of surface forces—a significant role for planes that would be fully realized in the war to come.

With the retention of the Fleet in Hawaiian waters after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI, &quot;Yorktown&quot; operated in the Pacific off the west coast of the United States and in Hawaiian waters until the following spring, when the success of German U-boats preying upon British shipping in the Atlantic required a shift of American naval strength. Thus, to reinforce the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, the Navy transferred a substantial force from the Pacific including &quot;Yorktown&quot;, Battleship Division Three (the s), three light cruisers, and 12 accompanying destroyers.

==Neutrality patrol==

&quot;Yorktown&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 20 April 1941 in company with destroyers , , and ; headed southeast, transited the Panama Canal on the night of 6–7 May, and arrived at Bermuda on 12 May. From that time until the United States entered the war, &quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted four patrols in the Atlantic, ranging from Newfoundland to Bermuda and logging steamed while enforcing American neutrality.

Although Adolf Hitler had forbidden his submarines to attack American ships, the men who manned the American naval vessels were not aware of this policy and operated on a wartime footing in the Atlantic.

On 28 October, while &quot;Yorktown&quot;, the battleship , and other American warships were screening a convoy, a destroyer picked up a submarine contact and dropped depth charges while the convoy itself made an emergency starboard turn, the first of the convoy&#x27;s three emergency changes of course. Late that afternoon, engine repairs to one of the ships in the convoy, &quot;Empire Pintail&quot;, reduced the convoy&#x27;s speed to .

During the night, the American ships intercepted strong German radio signals, indicating submarines probably in the vicinity reporting the group. Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt, commanding the escort force, sent a destroyer to sweep astern of the convoy to destroy the U-boat or at least to drive him under.

The next day, while cruiser scout planes patrolled overhead, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the cruiser fueled their escorting destroyers, finishing the task as dusk fell. On 30 October, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was preparing to fuel three destroyers when other escorts made sound contacts. The convoy subsequently made 10 emergency turns while the destroyers and dropped depth charges, with assisted in developing the contact. &quot;Anderson&quot; later made two more depth charge attacks, noticing &quot;considerable oil with slick spreading but no wreckage&quot;.

The short-of-war period was becoming more like the real thing as each day went on. Elsewhere on 30 October, torpedoed the destroyer , sinking her with a heavy loss of life, the first loss of an American warship in World War II. After another Neutrality Patrol stint in November, &quot;Yorktown&quot; put into Norfolk on 2 December.

==World War II==
On the early morning of 7 December 1941, Japanese warplanes attacked the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor without warning, damaging or sinking 16 U.S. warships. With the battle line crippled, the undamaged American carriers assumed great importance. There were, on 7 December, only three in the Pacific: &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , and . &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, , and the recently commissioned were in the Atlantic. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in massive outrage across the United States and led to the country&#x27;s formal entry into World War II the next day. &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed Norfolk on 16 December for the Pacific, her secondary gun galleries studded with new Oerlikon 20 mm guns. (The ship&#x27;s Gunnery Officer retained the Browning M2 .50 caliber machine guns the Oerlikons replaced, and acquired a supply of M1919A4 .30 caliber machine guns as well. The crew discovered the pintle mounts of the .30 calibers fitted neatly into cut swab handles, and the swab handles themselves fitted neatly into the hollow pipes used for the ship&#x27;s safety lines. Dozens of sailors went into the unofficial antiaircraft gun business, and according to one report, &quot;Yorktown bristled with more guns than a Mexican revolution movie.&quot;) She reached San Diego 30 December 1941 and soon became flagship for Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher&#x27;s newly formed Task Force 17 (TF 17).

The carrier&#x27;s first mission in her new theater was to escort a convoy carrying Marine reinforcements to American Samoa. Departing San Diego on 6 January 1942, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her consorts covered the movement of Marines to Pago Pago in Tutuila to augment the garrison already there.

Having safely covered that troop movement, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, in company with sister ship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, departed Samoan waters on 25 January. Six days later, Task Force 8 (built around &quot;Enterprise&quot;), and TF 17 (around &quot;Yorktown&quot;) parted company. The former headed for the Marshall Islands, the latter for the Gilberts, each to take part in some of the first American offensives of the war, the Marshalls-Gilberts raids.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; was being screened by two cruisers, and and four destroyers. At 05:17, &quot;Yorktown&quot; launched 11 Douglas TBD-1 Devastators and 17 Douglas SBD-3 Dauntlesses, under the command of Commander Curtis W. Smiley. Those planes hit what Japanese shore installations and shipping they could find at Jaluit, but severe thunderstorms hampered the mission, and seven planes were lost. Other &quot;Yorktown&quot; planes attacked Japanese installations and ships at Makin and Mili Atolls.

The attack on the Gilberts by Task Force 17 had apparently been a surprise since the American force encountered no enemy surface ships. A single Japanese Kawanishi H6K &quot;Mavis&quot; flying boat attempted to attack American destroyers sent astern in hope of recovering the crews of planes overdue from the Jaluit mission. Antiaircraft fire from the destroyers drove off the intruder before it could cause any damage.

Later, another Mavis, or possibly the same one, came out of low clouds distant from &quot;Yorktown&quot;. The carrier withheld her antiaircraft fire in order not to interfere with the combat air patrol (CAP) fighters. Presently, the Mavis, pursued by two Grumman F4F Wildcats, disappeared behind a cloud. Within five minutes, the enemy patrol plane fell out of the clouds and crashed in the water.

Although TF 17 was slated to make a second attack on Jaluit, it was canceled because of heavy rainstorms and the approach of darkness. Therefore, the &quot;Yorktown&quot; force retired from the area.

Admiral Chester Nimitz later called the Marshalls-Gilberts raids &quot;well conceived, well planned, and brilliantly executed.&quot; The results obtained by Task Forces 8 and 17 were noteworthy, Nimitz continued in his subsequent report, because the task forces had been obliged to make their attacks somewhat blindly, due to lack of hard intelligence data on the Japanese-held islands.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; subsequently put in at Pearl Harbor for replenishment before she put to sea on 14 February, bound for the Coral Sea. On 6 March, she rendezvoused with TF 11 which had been formed around &quot;Lexington&quot; and under the command of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown. Together they headed towards Rabaul and Gasmata to attack Japanese shipping there in an effort to check the Japanese advance and to cover the landing of Allied troops at Nouméa, New Caledonia. The two carriers were screened by eight heavy cruisers (including the Australian warships and ) and 14 destroyers. As they steamed toward New Guinea, the Japanese continued their advance toward Australia with a landing on 7 March at the Huon Gulf, in the Salamaua-Lae area on the eastern end of New Guinea.

Word of the Japanese operation prompted Admiral Brown to change the objective of TF 11&#x27;s strike from Rabaul to the Salamaua-Lae sector. On the morning of 10 March 1942, American carriers launched aircraft from the Gulf of Papua. &quot;Lexington&quot; flew off her air group commencing at 07:49 and, 21 minutes later, &quot;Yorktown&quot; followed suit. The choice of the gulf as the launch point for the strike meant the planes would have to fly some across the Owen Stanley mountains, which provided security for the task force and ensured surprise, at the cost of poor flying conditions.

In the attacks that followed, &quot;Lexington&quot;″s Douglas SBD Dauntlesses from Scouting Squadron 2 (VS-2) dive-bombed Japanese ships at Lae at 09:22. The carrier&#x27;s torpedo and bomber squadrons (VT-2 and VB-2) attacked shipping at Salamaua at 09:38. Her fighters (VF-2) split up into four-plane attack groups: one strafed Lae and the other, Salamaua. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s planes followed on the heels of those from &quot;Lexington&quot;. VB-5 and VT-5 attacked Japanese ships in the Salamaua area at 09:50, while VS-5 went after auxiliaries moored close in shore at Lae. The fighters of VF-42 flew CAP over Salamaua until they determined there was no air opposition, then strafed surface objectives and small boats in the harbor.

After carrying out their missions, the American planes returned to their carriers and 103 planes of the 104 launched were back safely on board by noon. One SBD-2 Dauntless had been downed by Japanese antiaircraft fire. The raid on Salamaua and Lae was the first attack by many pilots, and, if accuracy was below that achieved in later actions, the fliers gained invaluable experience which helped in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway.

Task Force 11 retired at on a southeasterly course until dark, when the ships steered eastward at and made rendezvous with Task Group 11.7 (TG11.7), three heavy cruisers (, HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;, and HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot;) and four destroyers under the Royal Australian Navy Rear Admiral John Crace, which provided cover for the carriers on their approach to New Guinea.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; resumed her patrols in the Coral Sea area, remaining at sea into April, out of reach of Japanese land-based aircraft and ready to carry out offensive operations whenever the opportunity presented itself. After the Lae-Salamaua raid, the situation in the South Pacific seemed temporarily stabilized, and &quot;Yorktown&quot; and her consorts in TF 17 put into the undeveloped harbor at Tongatabu, in the Tonga Islands, for needed upkeep, having been at sea continuously since departing from Pearl Harbor on 14 February.

However, the enemy was soon on the move. To Admiral Nimitz, there seemed to be &quot;excellent indications that the Japanese intended to make a seaborne attack on Port Moresby the first week in May&quot;. &quot;Yorktown&quot; accordingly departed Tongatapu on 27 April, bound once more for the Coral Sea. TF 11—now commanded by Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, who had relieved Brown in &quot;Lexington&quot;—departed Pearl Harbor to join Fletcher&#x27;s TF 17 and arrived in the vicinity of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s group, southwest of the New Hebrides Islands, on 1 May.

===Battle of the Coral Sea===

At 15:17 the next afternoon, two SBD Dauntlesses from VS-5 sighted a Japanese submarine running on the surface. Three TBD Devastators from &quot;Yorktown&quot; succeeded only in driving the submarine under.

On the morning of 3 May, TF 11 and TF 17 were some apart, engaged in fueling operations. Shortly before midnight, Fletcher received word from Australian-based aircraft that Japanese transports were disembarking troops and equipment at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. Arriving soon after the Australians had evacuated the place, the Japanese landed to commence construction of a seaplane base there to support their southward thrust.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; accordingly set course northward at . By daybreak on 4 May, she was within striking distance of the newly established Japanese beachhead and launched her first strike at 07:01―18 F4F-3 Wildcats of VF-42, 12 TBD Devastators of VT-5, and 28 SBD Dauntlesses from VS and VB-5. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s air group made three consecutive attacks on enemy ships and shore installations at Tulagi and Gavutu on the south coast of Florida Island in the Solomons. Expending 22 torpedoes and 76 bombs in the three attacks, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s planes sank the destroyer , three minesweepers and four barges. In addition, Air Group 5 destroyed five enemy seaplanes but lost two F4F Wildcats (the pilots were recovered) and one TBD Devastator (whose crew was lost).

Meanwhile, that same day, TF 44, a cruiser-destroyer force under Rear Admiral Crace (RN), joined &quot;Lexington&quot;″s TF 11, thus completing the composition of the Allied force on the eve of the crucial Battle of the Coral Sea.

Elsewhere, to the northward, eleven troop-laden transports—escorted by destroyers and covered by the light carrier , four heavy cruisers, and a destroyer—steamed toward Port Moresby. In addition, another Japanese task force—formed around the two Pearl Harbor veterans, carriers and , and screened by two heavy cruisers and six destroyers—provided additional air cover.

On the morning of 6 May, Fletcher gathered all Allied forces under his tactical command as TF 17. At daybreak on 7 May, he dispatched Crace, with the cruisers and destroyers under his command, toward the Louisiade archipelago to intercept any enemy attempt to move toward Port Moresby.

While Fletcher moved north with his two flattops and their screens in search of the enemy, Japanese search planes located the oil tanker and her escorting destroyer, and misidentified the former as a carrier. Two waves of Japanese planes—first high-level bombers and then dive bombers—attacked the two ships. &quot;Sims&quot;, her antiaircraft battery crippled by gun failures, took three direct hits and sank quickly with a heavy loss of life. &quot;Neosho&quot; was more fortunate in that, even after seven direct hits and eight near-misses, she remained afloat until, on 11 May, her survivors were picked up by and her hulk sunk by the rescuing destroyer.

&quot;Neosho&quot; and &quot;Sims&quot; had performed a valuable service, drawing off the planes that might otherwise have hit Fletcher&#x27;s carriers. Meanwhile, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot;″s planes found &quot;Shōhō&quot; and sank her. One of &quot;Lexington&quot;″s pilots reported this victory with the radio message, &quot;Scratch one flattop&quot;.

That afternoon, &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, still not located by Fletcher&#x27;s forces, launched 27 bombers and torpedo planes to search for the American ships. Their flight proved uneventful until they ran into fighters from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot;, which proceeded to down nine enemy planes in the ensuing dogfight.

Near twilight, three Japanese planes incredibly mistook &quot;Yorktown&quot; for their own carrier and attempted to land. The ship&#x27;s gunfire, though, drove them off, and the enemy planes crossed &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s bow and turned away out of range. Twenty minutes later, when three more enemy pilots made the mistake of trying to get into &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s landing circle, the carrier&#x27;s gunners splashed one of the trio.

However, the battle was far from over. The next morning, 8 May, a &quot;Lexington&quot; search plane spotted Admiral Takeo Takagi&#x27;s carrier striking force—including &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. &quot;Yorktown&quot; planes scored two bomb hits on &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, damaging her flight deck and preventing her from launching aircraft. In addition, the bombs set off explosions in gasoline storage tanks and destroyed an engine repair workshop. &quot;Lexington&quot;″s Dauntlesses added another hit. Between the two American air groups, the hits killed 108 Japanese sailors and wounded 40 more.

While the American aircraft were attacking the Japanese flattops, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; had been alerted by an intercepted message that indicated that the Japanese knew of their whereabouts and prepared to fight off a retaliatory strike, which came shortly after 11:00.

American Combat Air Patrol F4F Wildcats downed 17 aircraft, although some still got through the defenses. Nakajima B5N &quot;Kates&quot; launched torpedoes from both sides of &quot;Lexington&quot;″s bow, achieving two hits on the port side while Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers managed three bomb hits. &quot;Lexington&quot; began to list from three partially flooded engineering spaces. Several fires raged below decks, and the carrier&#x27;s elevators were put out of commission.

Meanwhile, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was having problems of her own. Skillfully maneuvered by her commander, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, the carrier dodged eight torpedoes. Attacked by &quot;Val&quot; dive-bombers, the ship managed to evade all but one bomb. At 11:27, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was hit in the center of her flight deck by a single , semi-armor-piercing bomb which penetrated four decks before exploding, causing severe structural damage to an aviation storage room and killing or seriously wounding 66 men, as well as damaging the superheater boilers which rendered them inoperable. Up to 12 near misses damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s hull below the waterline.

&quot;Lexington&quot;″s damage control parties brought the fires under control, and the ship was still able to continue flight operations despite the damage. The air battle itself ended shortly before noon on the 8th; within an hour, the carrier was on an even keel, although slightly down by the bow. However, an explosion caused by the ignition of gasoline vapors later caused a fire and tore apart her interior. &quot;Lexington&quot; was abandoned at 17:07, and later sunk by the destroyer .

The Japanese had won a tactical victory, inflicting comparatively heavier losses on the Allied force, but the Allies, in stemming the tide of Japan&#x27;s conquests in the South and Southwest Pacific, had achieved a strategic victory. &quot;Yorktown&quot; had not achieved her part in the victory without cost, and had suffered enough damage to cause experts to estimate that at least three months in a yard would be required to put her back in fighting trim. However, there was little time for repairs, because U.S. naval intelligence had gained enough information from decoded Japanese naval messages to estimate that the Japanese were on the threshold of a major operation aimed at the northwestern tip of the Hawaiian chain. These were two islets in a low coral atoll known as Midway Island.

===Battle of Midway===

Armed with this intelligence, Admiral Nimitz began methodically planning Midway&#x27;s defense, rushing all possible reinforcement in the way of men, planes and guns to Midway. In addition, he began gathering his comparatively meager naval forces to meet the enemy at sea. As part of those preparations, he recalled TF 16, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; to Pearl Harbor for a quick replenishment.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;, too, received orders to return to Hawaii; she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 May, entering dry dock the following day. The damage the ship had sustained after Coral Sea was considerable, and led to the Navy Yard inspectors estimating that she would need at least two weeks of repairs. However, Admiral Nimitz ordered that she be made ready to sail alongside TF 16. Further inspections showed that &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s flight elevators had not been damaged, and the damage to her flight deck and hull could be patched easily. Yard workers at Pearl Harbor, laboring around the clock, made enough repairs to enable the ship to put to sea again in 48 hours. The repairs were made in such a short time that the Japanese Naval Air Commanders would mistake &quot;Yorktown&quot; for another carrier as they thought she had been sunk during the previous battle. However, one critical repair to her power plant was not made: her damaged superheater boilers were not touched, limiting her top speed. Her air group was augmented by planes and crews from &quot;Saratoga&quot; which was then headed for Pearl Harbor after her refit on the West Coast. &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed as the core of TF 17 on 30 May.

Northeast of Midway, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, flying Vice Admiral Fletcher&#x27;s flag, rendezvoused with TF 16 under Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance and maintained a position to the northward of him.

Patrols, both from Midway and the carriers, were flown during early June. At dawn on 4 June &quot;Yorktown&quot; launched a 10-plane group of Dauntlesses from VB-5 which searched a northern semicircle for a distance of out but found nothing.

Meanwhile, PBYs flying from Midway had sighted the approaching Japanese and broadcast the alarm for the American forces defending the key atoll. Admiral Fletcher, in tactical command, ordered Admiral Spruance&#x27;s TF 16 to locate and strike the enemy carrier force.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s search group returned at 08:30, landing soon after the last of the six-plane CAP had left the deck. When the last of the Dauntlesses were recovered, the deck was hastily respotted for the launch of the ship&#x27;s attack group: 17 Dauntlesses from VB-3, 12 Devastators from VT-3, and six Wildcats from &quot;Fighting Three&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;, meanwhile, launched their attack groups.

The torpedo planes from the three American carriers located the Japanese striking force, but met disaster. Of the 41 planes from VT-8, VT-6, and VT-3, only six returned to &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot;; none made it back to &quot;Hornet&quot;.

As a reaction to the torpedo attack the Japanese CAP had broken off their high-altitude cover for their carriers and had concentrated on the Devastators, flying &quot;on the deck&quot;, allowing Dauntlesses from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; to arrive unopposed.

Virtually unopposed, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s dive-bombers attacked , making three lethal hits with bombs and setting her on fire. &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s planes, meanwhile, hit and , effectively destroying them. The bombs from the Dauntlesses caught all of the Japanese carriers in the midst of refueling and rearming operations, causing devastating fires and explosions.

Three of the four Japanese carriers had been left burning wrecks. The fourth, , separated from her sisters, launched a striking force of 18 &quot;Vals&quot; and soon located &quot;Yorktown&quot;.

As soon as the attackers had been picked up on &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s radar at about 13:29, she discontinued fueling her CAP fighters on deck and swiftly cleared for action. Her returning dive bombers were moved from the landing circle to open the area for antiaircraft fire. The Dauntlesses were ordered aloft to form a CAP. An auxiliary gasoline tank was pushed over the carrier&#x27;s fantail, eliminating one fire hazard. The crew drained fuel lines and closed and secured all compartments.

All of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s fighters were vectored out to intercept the oncoming Japanese aircraft at a distance of out. The Wildcats attacked vigorously, breaking up what appeared to be an organized attack by some 18 &quot;Vals&quot; and 6 &quot;Zeroes&quot;. &quot;Planes were flying in every direction&quot;, wrote Captain Buckmaster after the action, &quot;and many were falling in flames.&quot; The leader of the &quot;Vals&quot;, Lieutenant Michio Kobayashi, was probably shot down by the VF-3&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander John S. Thach. Lieutenant William W. Barnes also pressed home the first attack, possibly taking out the lead bomber and damaging at least two others.

Despite an intensive barrage and evasive maneuvering, three &quot;Vals&quot; scored hits. Two of them were shot down soon after releasing their bomb loads; the third went out of control just as his bomb left the rack. It tumbled in flight and hit just abaft the number two elevator on the starboard side, exploding on contact and blasting a hole about square in the flight deck. Splinters from the exploding bomb killed most of the crews of the two gun mounts aft of the island and on the flight deck below. Fragments piercing the flight deck hit three planes on the hangar deck, starting fires. One of the aircraft, a &quot;Yorktown&quot; Dauntless, was fully fueled and carrying a bomb. Prompt action by LT A. C. Emerson, the hangar deck officer, prevented a serious fire by activating the sprinkler system and quickly extinguishing the fire.

The second bomb to hit the ship came from the port side, pierced the flight deck, and exploded in the lower part of the funnel, in effect a classic &quot;down the stack shot.&quot; It ruptured the uptakes for three boilers, disabled two boilers, and extinguished the fires in five boilers. Smoke and gases began filling the firerooms of six boilers. The men at Number One boiler remained at their post and kept it alight, maintaining enough steam pressure to allow the auxiliary steam systems to function.

A third bomb hit the carrier from the starboard side, pierced the side of number one elevator and exploded on the fourth deck, starting a persistent fire in the rag storage space, adjacent to the forward gasoline stowage and the magazines. The prior precaution of smothering the gasoline system with carbon dioxide undoubtedly prevented the gasoline from igniting.

While the ship recovered from the damage inflicted by the dive-bombing attack, her speed dropped to ; and then at 14:40, about 20 minutes after the bomb hit that had shut down most of the boilers, &quot;Yorktown&quot; slowed to a stop, dead in the water.

At about 15:40, &quot;Yorktown&quot; prepared to get underway; and, at 15:50, thanks to the black gang in No. 1 Fireroom having kept the auxiliaries operating to clear the stack gas from the other firerooms and bleeding steam from No. 1 to the other boilers to jump-start them, Chief Engineer Delaney reported to Captain Buckmaster that the ship&#x27;s engineers were ready to make or better. &quot;Yorktown&quot; yanked down her yellow breakdown flag and up went a new hoist-&quot;My speed 5.&quot; Captain Buckmaster had his signalmen hoist a huge new (10 feet wide and 15 feet long) American flag from the foremast. Sailors, including Ensign John d&#x27;Arc Lorenz called it an incalculable inspiration: &quot;For the first time I realized what the flag meant: all of us — a million faces — all our effort — a whisper of encouragement.&quot; Damage control parties were able to temporarily patch the flight deck and restore power to several boilers within an hour, giving her a speed of 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph) and enabling her to resume air operations.

Simultaneously, with the fires controlled sufficiently to warrant the resumption of fueling, &quot;Yorktown&quot; began refueling the fighters then on deck; just then the ship&#x27;s radar picked up an incoming air group at a distance of . While the ship prepared for battle, again smothering gasoline systems and stopping the fueling of the planes on her flight deck, she vectored four of the six fighters of the CAP in the air to intercept the raiders. Of the 10 fighters on board, eight had as little as of fuel in their tanks. They were launched as the remaining pair of fighters of the CAP headed out to intercept the Japanese planes.

At 16:00, maneuvering &quot;Yorktown&quot; churned forward, making 20 knots. The fighters she had launched and vectored out to intercept had meanwhile made contact with the enemy. &quot;Yorktown&quot; received reports that the planes were &quot;Kates&quot;. The Wildcats shot down at least three, but the rest began their approach while the carrier and her escorts mounted a heavy antiaircraft barrage.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; maneuvered radically, avoiding at least two torpedoes before another two struck the port side within minutes of each other, the first at 16:20. The carrier had been mortally wounded; she lost power and went dead in the water with a jammed rudder and an increasing list to port.

As the ship&#x27;s list progressed, Commander Clarence E. Aldrich, the damage control officer, reported from central station that, without power, controlling the flooding looked impossible. The Chief Engineer, Lieutenant Commander John F. Delaney, soon reported that all boiler fires were out, all power was lost, and that it was impossible to correct the list. Buckmaster ordered Aldrich, Delaney, and their men to secure the fire and engine rooms and lay up to the weather decks to put on life jackets.

The list, meanwhile, continued to increase. When it reached 26 degrees, Buckmaster and Aldrich agreed that capsizing was imminent. &quot;In order to save as many of the ship&#x27;s company as possible&quot;, the captain wrote later, he &quot;ordered the ship to be abandoned&quot;.

Over the next few minutes the crew lowered the wounded into life rafts and struck out for the nearby destroyers and cruisers to be picked up by their boats, abandoning ship in good order. After the evacuation of all wounded, the executive officer, Commander Dixie Kiefer left the ship down a line on the starboard side. Buckmaster, meanwhile, toured the ship one last time, to see if any men remained. After finding no &quot;live personnel&quot;, Buckmaster lowered himself into the water by means of a line over the stern, by which time water was lapping the port side of the hangar deck.

===Salvage and sinking===
After being picked up by the destroyer , Buckmaster transferred to the cruiser and reported to Vice Admiral Fletcher, who had shifted his flag to the heavy cruiser after the first dive-bombing attack. The two men agreed that a salvage party should attempt to save the ship since she had stubbornly remained afloat despite the heavy list and imminent danger of capsizing.

While efforts to save &quot;Yorktown&quot; had been proceeding apace, her planes were still in action, joining those from &quot;Enterprise&quot; in striking the last Japanese carrier—&quot;Hiryū&quot;—late that afternoon. Taking four direct hits, the Japanese carrier was soon helpless. She was abandoned by her crew and left to drift out of control.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;, as it turned out, floated throughout the night. Two men were still alive on board her; one attracted attention by firing a machine gun, heard by the sole attending destroyer, &quot;Hughes&quot;. The escort picked up the men, one of whom later died. Buckmaster selected Executive Officer Dixie Kiefer commander of the salvage crew which also included 29 officers and 141 men to return to the ship in an attempt to save her. Five destroyers formed an antisubmarine screen while the salvage party boarded the listing carrier on the morning of 6 June. The fleet tug , summoned from Pearl and Hermes Reef, commenced towing the ship, although progress was painfully slow.

&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s repair party went on board with a carefully predetermined plan of action to be carried out by men from each department—damage control, gunnery air engineering, navigation, communication, supply and medical. To assist in the work, Lieutenant Commander Arnold E. True brought &quot;Hammann&quot; alongside to starboard, aft, furnishing pumps and electric power.

By mid-afternoon, the process of reducing topside weight was proceeding well; one gun had been dropped over the side and a second was ready to be cast loose, planes had been pushed over the side, and a large quantity of water had been pumped out of engineering spaces. These efforts reduced the list by about two degrees.

Unknown to &quot;Yorktown&quot; and the six nearby destroyers, however, had discovered the disabled carrier and achieved a favorable firing position. The I-boat eluded detection—possibly due to the large amount of debris and wreckage in the water—until 15:36, when lookouts spotted a salvo of four torpedoes approaching the ship from the starboard beam.

&quot;Hammann&quot; went to general quarters, with a 20-millimeter gun going into action in an attempt to explode the torpedoes in the water as she tried to get underway. One torpedo hit &quot;Hammann&quot; directly amidships and broke her back. The destroyer jackknifed and went down rapidly. Two torpedoes struck &quot;Yorktown&quot; at the turn of the bilge at the after end of the island structure. The fourth torpedo passed astern of the carrier.

About a minute after &quot;Hammann&quot; sank there was an underwater explosion, possibly caused by the destroyer&#x27;s depth charges going off. The concussion killed many of &quot;Hammann&quot;″s and a few of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s men who had been thrown into the water, battered the damaged carrier&#x27;s hull, dislodged &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s auxiliary generator and numerous fixtures from the hangar deck, sheared rivets in the starboard leg of the foremast, and injured several onboard crew members. The remaining destroyers initiated a search for the enemy submarine (which escaped), and commenced rescue operations for &quot;Hammann&quot; survivors and the &quot;Yorktown&quot; salvage crew. &quot;Vireo&quot; cut the tow and doubled back to assist in rescue efforts.
Throughout the night of 6 June and into the morning of 7 June, &quot;Yorktown&quot; remained afloat; but by 05:30 on 7 June, observers noted that her list was rapidly increasing to port. Shortly afterwards, the ship turned over onto her port side, and lay afloat for several minutes, revealing the torpedo hole in her starboard bilge- the result of the submarine attack. Captain Buckmaster&#x27;s American flag was still flying. All ships half-masted their colors in salute; all hands who were topside with heads uncovered came to attention, with tears in their eyes. Two patrolling PBYs appeared overhead and dipped their wings in a final salute. At 07:01, the ship rolled upside-down, and slowly sank, stern first, in of water with her battle flags flying. To most who witnessed the sinking, the &quot;Yorktown&quot; went quietly and with enormous dignity- &quot;like the great lady she was,&quot; as one of them put it. In all, &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s sinking on 7 June 1942 claimed the lives of 141 of her officers and crewmen.

==Wreck location==
On 19 May 1998, the wreck of &quot;Yorktown&quot; was found and photographed by oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard, discoverer of the wrecks of the and the . The wreck of &quot;Yorktown&quot;, deep, was sitting upright in excellent condition. Despite spending 56 years on the deep-sea floor, much of her paint and equipment were still visible. A more extensive survey of the wreck was conducted by in September 2023.

==Honors and legacy==
&quot;Yorktown&quot; (CV-5) earned three battle stars for her World War II service, two of them for the significant part she had played in stopping Japanese expansion and turning the tide of the war at Coral Sea and at Midway. CV-10, the second vessel of the Essex-class of aircraft carriers, was renamed from USS &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; to &quot;Yorktown&quot; in honor of her loss at Midway, and was preserved after decommissioning in 1970 to become a museum ship in 1975.

<text>Deutsche Telekom AG (, ; often just Telekom, DTAG or DT; stylised as ·T·) is a partially state-owned German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn and the largest telecommunications provider in Europe by revenue. It was formed in 1995 when , a state monopoly at the time, was privatized. Since then, Deutsche Telekom has consistently featured among &quot;Fortune&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;&#x27;s top Global 500 companies by revenue, with its ranking at number 79. In 2023, the company was ranked 41st in the Forbes Global 2000. The company operates several subsidiaries worldwide, including the mobile communications brand T-Mobile. It is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest telecommunications company and biggest in Europe by revenue.

, the German government held a direct 14.5% stake in company stock and another 17.4% through the government bank KfW. On 4th June 2024, the German government reduced its total shareholding to 27.8%. The company is a component of the EURO STOXX 50 stock market index.

== History ==
The was the German federal government postal administration created in 1947 as a successor to the Reichspost. It was also the major telephone company in West Germany.

On 1 July 1989, as part of a post office reform, was split into three entities, one being Deutsche Telekom. On 1 January 1995, as part of another reform, Telekom became Deutsche Telekom AG, and was privatized in 1996. As such, it shares a common heritage with the other privatized companies, Deutsche Post (DHL) and Deutsche Postbank.

Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly Internet service provider (ISP) for Germany until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. Until the early 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany, as they were one of the first German telecom units.

On 6 December 2001, Deutsche Telekom became the first official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

On 1 January 2005, Deutsche Telekom implemented a new company structure. The two organizational business units of T-Com and T-Online were merged into the Broadband/Fixed Network (BBFN) strategic business unit (T-Online merged with parent Deutsche Telekom in 2006). It provides around 40 million narrowband lines, over 9 million broadband lines, and has 14 million registered Internet customers.

In 2008, the structure was changed again. T-Online was separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com to form the new unit T-Home. In September 2010, Orange parent France Télécom and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE.

In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH. This unit now handles all products and services aimed at private customers. In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their procurement operations and benefiting from economies of scale.

In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their operations in the United States. In February 2014, Deutsche Telekom acquired the remaining parts of its T-Mobile Czech Republic division for around €800 million. The size of the remaining stake was numbered at 40 percent.

In December 2014, it was announced that Deutsche Telekom were in talks with BT Group on the acquisition of EE, and part of the deal was to provide Deutsche Telekom a 12% stake and a seat on the board in the BT Group upon completion. BT Group announced agreement in February 2015 to acquire EE for £12.5 billion and received regulatory approval from the Competition and Markets Authority on 15 January 2016. The transaction was completed on 29 January 2016.

In September 2015, Deutsche Telekom launched the &quot;Puls tablet&quot;, a Tablet computer with Android version 5.

In February 2016, at the Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona, Deutsche Telekom jointly launched the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) with Intel, Nokia, Facebook, Equinix, SK Telecom, and others, which builds on the Open Compute Project model to accelerate innovation in the telecom industry.

Amid concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks in Europe, Deutsche Telekom temporarily put all deals to buy 5G network equipment on hold in 2019, as it awaited the resolution of a debate in Germany over whether to ban Chinese vendor Huawei on security grounds.

In February 2020, Deutsche Telekom joined a new partnership called HAPS Alliance to promote the use of high-altitude vehicles in the Earth&#x27;s stratosphere with the goal of eliminating the digital divide.

On April 1, 2020, Sprint completed the merger with T-Mobile US, making T-Mobile US the owner of Sprint and becoming its subsidiary until the Sprint brand is phased out. The merger also led SoftBank Group, the then-owner of Sprint, to hold up to 24% of New T-Mobile&#x27;s shares while Deutsche Telekom holds up to 43% of its shares. The remaining 33% is since held by public shareholders.

In September 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold T-Mobile Netherlands for €5.1 billion to the investment companies Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus.

In September 2022, Deutsche Telekom is expanding its activities in the field of blockchain technology. DT’s subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom MMS provides the Ethereum Network with infrastructure in the form of validation nodes.

In December 2023, Deutsche Telekom and Nokia with Fujitsu began deploying a multivendor Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN). The network is fully integrated into Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s existing commercial network, including 5G AirScale compatible with Open RAN.

== Finances ==

For the fiscal year 2017, Deutsche Telekom reported earnings of €3.5 billion, with an annual revenue of €74.9 billion, an increase of 2.5% over the previous fiscal cycle. Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s shares traded at over €14 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$68.4 billion in November 2018.

The key trends for Deutsche Telekom are (as at the financial year ending December 31):
== Operations ==
Deutsche Telekom also holds substantial shares in other telecom companies, including Central European subsidiaries Slovak Telekom (Slovakia), Magyar Telekom (Hungary). Furthermore, Magyar Telekom holds majority shares in Makedonski Telekom (North Macedonia), and Hrvatski Telekom (Croatia) holds majority shares in Crnogorski Telekom (Montenegro).

DT also holds shares in the Hellenic telecommunication operator OTE, which also have shares in several other companies like Telekom Romania and the IT&amp;C retailer Germanos. Deutsche Telekom also operates a wholesale division named International Carrier Sales &amp; Solutions (ICSS) that provides white label voice and data wholesale support services to large carriers. OTE also used to have shares in One Telecommunications operating in Albania. Prior to its sale it was known as Telekom Albania using DT&#x27;s logo and marketing strategies.

Operation of telephone companies involves billing-software or &quot;BSS&quot;. Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s T-Mobile billing was performed on Israeli-backend systems until 2014, when Ericsson was selected to replace the Israeli backend.

=== T-Systems ===
T-Systems sells worldwide products and services to medium to very large business customers. The focus is on the marketing of complex services and industry solutions.

=== Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier ===
Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier is formerly known as Deutsche Telekom International Sales and Solutions. It is an international wholesale arm of Deutsche Telekom.

<text>Daniel Cornelius Danielssen (4 July 1815 – 13 July 1894) was a Norwegian physician. He was most noted for his research regarding the causes and treatment of leprosy.

==Biography==
Danielssen was from Bergen, Norway. Dating from 1839, he was associated with St. Jørgens Hospital (&quot;Sankt Jørgens Hospital&quot;) in Bergen. He later worked with Gerhard Armauer Hansen, discovering the bacteria causing leprosy, and made Bergen a world centre of lepra research in the middle of the nineteenth century.

With dermatologist Carl Wilhelm Boeck, he was co-author of an acclaimed study on lepra titled &quot;Om Spedalskhed&quot; (1847). In October 1849, he was named head physician of research at Lungegaard Hospital (&quot;Lungegaardshospitalet&quot;). In 1859, German pathologist Rudolf Virchow visited Danielssen in Bergen in order to study lepra.

In 1876–78 he served as a zoologist on a Norwegian expedition to northern waters, and for several years was chairman of the Society for the Advancement of Norwegian Fisheries (&quot;Selskabet for de norske Fiskeriers Fremme&quot;). Also, for a number of years, Danielssen was a representative of Bergen to the Stortinget, 1862–64, 1871–73 and 1875–76. Danielssen was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1877.

The characteristic anesthesia of the extremity affected by untreated Leprosy is sometimes called as the &quot;Danielssen&#x27;s Sign&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="194855" wikidata="Q369987" url="?curid=194855" title="USS Enterprise (CV-6)">
<text>USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6) was a carrier built for the United States Navy during the 1930s. She was the seventh U.S. Navy vessel of that name. Colloquially called &quot;The Big E&quot;, she was the sixth aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. Launched in 1936, she was the only &quot;Yorktown&quot;-class and one of only three American fleet carriers commissioned before World War II to survive the war (the others being and ).

&quot;Enterprise&quot; participated in more major actions of the war against Japan than any other United States ship. These actions included the attack on Pearl Harbor — 18 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of her air group arrived over the harbor during the attack; seven were shot down with eight airmen killed and two wounded, making her the only American aircraft carrier with men at Pearl Harbor during the attack and the first to sustain casualties during the Pacific War — the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, various other air-sea engagements during the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Enterprise&quot; earned 20 battle stars, the most for any U.S. warship in World War II, and was the most decorated U.S. ship of World War II. She was also the first American ship to sink a full-sized enemy warship after the Pacific War had been declared when her aircraft sank the Japanese submarine &quot;I-70&quot; on 10 December 1941. On three occasions during the war, the Japanese announced that she had been sunk in battle, inspiring her nickname &quot;The Grey Ghost&quot;. By the end of the war, her planes and guns had downed 911 enemy planes, sunk 71 ships, and damaged or destroyed 192 more.

Despite efforts made by the public after the war to turn &quot;Enterprise&quot; into a museum ship, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was scrapped from 1958 to 1960.

==Construction and commissioning==
The sixth carrier built for the United States Navy and the second of the , &quot;Enterprise&quot; was launched on 3 October 1936 at Newport News Shipbuilding, sponsored by Lulie Swanson, wife of Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson, and commissioned on 12 May 1938 with Captain Newton H. White, Jr. in command. &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed south on a shakedown cruise which took her to Rio de Janeiro. Captain Charles A. Pownall relieved White on 21 December. After her return, she operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until April 1939, when she was ordered to duty in the Pacific.

==Service history==

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was one of fourteen ships to receive the early RCA CXAM-1 radar. Captain George D. Murray assumed command of the carrier on 21 March 1941. Based first at San Diego (where she was used in the filming of &quot;Dive Bomber&quot;, starring Errol Flynn and Fred MacMurray) and then at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu after President Roosevelt ordered the Fleet to be &quot;forward based,&quot; the carrier and her Air Group trained intensively and transported aircraft to American island bases in the Pacific. &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the other ships of Task Force 8 (TF 8) departed Pearl Harbor on 28 November 1941 to deliver Marine Fighter Squadron 211 (VMF-211) to Wake Island nearly due west. She was scheduled to return to Hawaii on 6 December 1941, but was delayed by the weather, and she was still at sea about west of Oahu at dawn on 7 December 1941.

===World War II===
====Pearl Harbor====
&quot;Enterprise&quot; launched eighteen of her SBDs - the CAG&#x27;s aircraft, 13 aircraft from Scouting Squadron Six (VS-6) and four aircraft from Bombing Squadron Six (VB-6) - at dawn on 7 December to scout an arc extending from the northeast to southeast of the ship, and to land at Ford Island at Pearl Harbor after completing their search routes. As these aircraft arrived in pairs over Pearl Harbor, they were caught between attacking Japanese aircraft and defensive anti-aircraft fire from the ships and shore installations below. Seven SBDs were shot down, either from enemy action or friendly fire, with the loss of eight airmen killed and two wounded.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; received radio messages from Pearl Harbor reporting that the base was under attack, and she was later directed to launch an airstrike based on an inaccurate report of a Japanese carrier southwest of her location. The strike was launched around 17:00, consisting of six Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters of Fighting Squadron Six (VF-6), 18 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of Torpedo Squadron Six (VT-6), and six SBDs of VB-6.

Unable to locate any targets, the torpedo and dive bombers returned to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but the six fighters were directed to divert to Hickam Field on Oahu. Although word of the planes&#x27; expected arrival had been broadcast to all ships and anti-aircraft units in the area, the appearance of the Wildcats in the night sky over Oahu triggered panic firing, which shot down three of them, killing their pilots, while a fourth aircraft ran out of fuel, forcing the pilot to bail out.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; pulled into Pearl Harbor for fuel and supplies on the evening of 8 December. Vice-Admiral William Halsey Jr., commander of Carrier Division 2, ordered every able-bodied man on board to help rearm and refuel &quot;Enterprise&quot;; this process normally took 24 hours to complete, but was completed this time within seven hours. She and the other ships of TF 8 sailed early the next morning to patrol against possible additional attacks on the Hawaiian Islands. Although the group encountered no Japanese surface ships, &quot;Enterprise&quot; aircraft sank at on 10 December 1941.

During the last two weeks of December 1941, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her escorts steamed west of Hawaii to cover the islands while two other carrier groups made a belated attempt to relieve Wake Island. After a brief layover at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her group sailed on 11 January 1942, protecting convoys reinforcing Samoa.

On 16 January 1942, a TBD of VT-6, piloted by Chief Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate and enlisted Naval Aviation Pilot Harold F. Dixon, got lost on patrol, ran out of fuel, and ditched. Dixon and his two crewmates, bombardier Anthony J. Pastula and gunner Gene Aldrich, survived for 34 days in a small rubber raft after their food and water were washed overboard, before drifting ashore on the atoll of Pukapuka, where the natives fed them and notified Allied authorities. The three men were then picked up by . Dixon was awarded the Navy Cross for &quot;extraordinary heroism, exceptional determination, resourcefulness, skilled seamanship, excellent judgment and highest quality of leadership.&quot;

On 1 February 1942, &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s Task Force 8 raided Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap in the Marshall Islands. In two waves, 64 airplanes attacked and for the loss of six of their number, sunk only a small gunboat and damaged the light cruiser &quot;Katori&quot;, the minelayer &quot;Tokiwa,&quot; and five other ships. Also, numerous airplanes and ground facilities were destroyed. &quot;Enterprise&quot; received only minor damage in the Japanese counterattack, as TF 8 retired to Pearl Harbor.

The next month, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, now part of Task Force 16, swept the central Pacific, attacking enemy installations on Wake and Marcus Islands.

==== Doolittle Raid, April 1942 ====

After minor alterations and repairs at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and TF 16 departed on 8 April 1942 to rendezvous with her sister ship and sailed west, escorting &quot;Hornet&quot; on the mission to launch 16 Army B-25 Mitchells in the &quot;Doolittle Raid&quot; on Tokyo. While fighters from &quot;Enterprise&quot; flew combat air patrol, the B-25s launched on 18 April, and flew undetected the remaining to the target. The task force, its presence known to the enemy after a Japanese picket boat radioed a warning, reversed course and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 April.

==== Battle of Midway, June 1942 ====

Five days later, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sortied toward the South Pacific to reinforce U.S. carriers operating in the Coral Sea. However, the Battle of the Coral Sea was over before &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrived. With &quot;Hornet&quot;, she performed a feint towards Nauru and Banaba (Ocean) islands which caused the Japanese to delay Operation RY to seize the two islands, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May 1942, and began intensive preparation to meet the expected Japanese thrust at Midway Island.

On 28 May, &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed Pearl Harbor as Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance&#x27;s flagship with orders &quot;to hold Midway and inflict maximum damage on the enemy by strong attrition tactics&quot;. With &quot;Enterprise&quot; in TF 16 were &quot;Hornet,&quot; six cruisers, ten destroyers and four oilers. On 30 May, Task Force 17 (TF 17), with Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher in , left Pearl with two cruisers and six destroyers and rendezvoused with TF 16; as senior officer present, Rear Admiral Fletcher became &quot;Officer in Tactical Command.&quot; Vice Admiral Halsey, the usual commander of TF 16 and senior to both Fletcher and Spruance, was medically ordered to remain in a naval hospital at Pearl Harbor due to stress-induced severe weight loss and severe psoriasis.

Each side launched air attacks during the day in a decisive battle. Though the forces were in contact until 7 June, by 10:45am on 4 June the outcome had been decided. Three Japanese carriers were burning and it was only a matter of time until a fourth was caught and knocked out. The Battle of Midway began on the morning of 4 June 1942, when four Japanese carriers, unaware of the presence of U.S. naval forces, launched attacks on Midway Island. Shortly after the first bomb fell on Midway, the first wave of planes (4 B-26B Marauders, 6 TBF-1 Avengers, 11 SB2U-3s, 16 SBDs and 15 B-17s) from Midway Island attacked unsuccessfully. Several more groups attacked, again failing to damage their targets. Planes from the U.S. carriers attacked next. &quot;Enterprise&quot; torpedo bombers attacked first, scoring no hits and suffering heavy losses. Soon after, &quot;Enterprise&quot; dive bombers attacked and disabled the Japanese carriers and , leaving them ablaze, while &quot;Yorktown&quot; aircraft also bombed the , leaving her burning and dead in the water.

Within an hour, the remaining Japanese carrier, , launched air strikes that crippled &quot;Yorktown&quot; with three bombs and two torpedoes striking home during two separate attacks. In late afternoon, a mixed squadron of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; bombers, flying from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, disabled &quot;Hiryu&quot;, leaving her burning. The following day &quot;Enterprise&quot; dive bombers alone sank the cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot;. While &quot;Yorktown&quot; and were the only American ships sunk, TF 16 and TF 17 lost a total of 113 planes, 61 of them in combat. Japanese losses were much higher: four carriers (all scuttled), one cruiser and 272 carrier aircraft with many of their highly experienced aircrews. Despite losses to her aircraft squadrons, &quot;Enterprise&quot; came through undamaged and returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June 1942.

====South Pacific====
Captain Arthur C. Davis relieved Murray on 30 June 1942. After a month of rest and overhaul, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed on 15 July 1942 for the South Pacific, where she joined TF 61 to support the amphibious landings in the Solomon Islands on 8 August. For the next two weeks, the carrier and her planes guarded seaborne communication lines southwest of the Solomons. On 24 August, a strong Japanese force was discovered some north of Guadalcanal, and TF 61 sent planes to the attack. In the ensuing Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the light carrier was sunk, and the Japanese troops intended for Guadalcanal were forced back. &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered the most heavily of the American ships; three direct bomb hits and four near misses killed 74, wounded 95, and inflicted serious damage on the carrier. Quick, hard work by damage control parties patched her up so that she was able to return to Hawaii under her own power.

Repaired at Pearl Harbor from 10 September–16 October 1942, &quot;Enterprise&quot; embarked Air Group 10 in early October. This was the first time that the Grim Reapers of VF-10 deployed from &quot;Enterprise&quot; under commanding officer James H. Flatley, who became known as &quot;Reaper Leader.&quot; She departed once more for the South Pacific, where with &quot;Hornet&quot; she formed TF 61, although Captain Osborne Hardison relieved Davis on 21 October. Five days later, &quot;Enterprise&quot; scout planes located a Japanese carrier force and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands was under way. &quot;Enterprise&quot; aircraft struck carriers and cruisers during the struggle, while the ship herself underwent intensive attack. Hit twice by bombs, &quot;Enterprise&quot; lost 44 men and had 75 wounded. Despite serious damage, she remained in action and took on board a large number of planes and crewmen from &quot;Hornet&quot; when that carrier was sunk. Though the American losses of a carrier and a destroyer were more severe than the Japanese loss of one light cruiser, the battle gave the Americans time to reinforce Guadalcanal against the next enemy onslaught, and nearby Henderson Field was therefore secure from the Japanese bombardment. The loss of &quot;Hornet&quot; meant &quot;Enterprise&quot; was now the only functioning (albeit damaged) U.S. carrier in the Pacific Theater. On one of the decks, the crew posted a sign: &quot;&quot;Enterprise&quot; vs Japan.&quot;

&quot;Enterprise&quot; reached Nouméa, New Caledonia on 30 October for repairs, but a new Japanese thrust at the Solomons demanded her presence and she sailed on 11 November, with repair crews from still working on board. Part of the repair crew were 75 Seabees from Company B of the 3rd Construction Battalion. This was due to a shortage of fleet repair resources. Underway with orders to engage the enemy, the Seabees focused on effecting repairs even during the forthcoming battle. The work was under the round-the-clock supervision of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s damage control officer, Lt. Cmdr. Herschel Albert Smith.

The commanding officer of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Captain Osborne Bennett &quot;Ozzie B&quot; &quot;Oby&quot; Hardison, notified the Navy Department that &quot;the emergency repairs accomplished by this skillful, well-trained, and enthusiastically energetic force have placed this vessel in condition for further action against the enemy.&quot; This remarkable job later won the praise of Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr., Commander South Pacific Area and the South Pacific Force, who sent a dispatch to the of the Seabee detachment stating, &quot;Your commander wishes to express to you and the men of the Construction Battalion serving under you his appreciation for the services rendered by you in effecting emergency repairs during action against the enemy. The repairs were completed by these men with speed and efficiency. I hereby commend them for their willingness, zeal, and capability.&quot;

On 13 November, aviators from &quot;Enterprise&quot; helped to sink the , the first Japanese battleship lost during the war. &quot;Hiei&quot; was already crippled by numerous shells from American cruisers and destroyers the previous evening. &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers first struck &quot;Hiei&quot;., and after landing and rearming at Henderson Field, the Avengers found and attacked &quot;Hiei&quot; again and claimed three more torpedo hits. The combined attacks by both &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; Avengers and American Army B-17 Flying Fortresses from Henderson Field inflicted a total of 5-8 torpedo hits and 7-8 500 lb and 1000 lb bomb hits on &quot;Hiei&quot;, in addition to the damage from the night surface battle, eventually prompting the Japanese to scuttle the stricken battleship. On 14 November, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; Avengers and Dauntlesses , joined by USMC Avengers from Henderson Field, attacked the heavy cruiser &quot;Kinugasa&quot; on her return trip from an unopposed bombardment of Henderson Field the night before. At 09:36, a 500-pound bomb hit &quot;Kinugasa&quot;″s machine gun mount in front of the bridge, starting a fire in the forward gasoline storage area. Captain Sawa and his executive officer were killed by the bomb, and &quot;Kinugasa&quot; gradually began to list to port. Near-misses caused additional fires and flooding and a second attack by 17 more Dauntlesses knocked out &quot;Kinugasa&quot;″s engines and rudder and opened more compartments to the sea. At 11:22, &quot;Kinugasa&quot; capsized and sank southwest of Rendova Island at , taking 511 crewmen with her.

When the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal ended on 15 November 1942, &quot;Enterprise&quot; had shared in sinking sixteen ships and damaging eight more. The carrier returned to Nouméa on 16 November to complete her repairs.

Sailing again on 4 December, &quot;Enterprise&quot; trained out of Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, until 28 January 1943, when she departed for the Solomons area. On 30 January, her fighters flew combat air patrol for a cruiser–destroyer group during the Battle of Rennell Island. Despite the destruction of most of the attacking Japanese bombers by &quot;Enterprise&quot; planes, the heavy cruiser was sunk by aerial torpedoes.

Detached after the battle, the carrier arrived at Espiritu Santo on 1 February, and for the next three months operated out of that base, covering U.S. surface forces up to the Solomons. Captain Samuel Ginder assumed command of the ship on 16 April. &quot;Enterprise&quot; then steamed to Pearl Harbor where, on 27 May 1943, Admiral Chester Nimitz presented the ship with the first Presidential Unit citation awarded to an aircraft carrier.

In the summer of 1943, with the new and carriers joining the American Pacific Fleet, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was temporarily relieved of duty, and on 20 July, she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a much-needed overhaul. Over the course of several months, &quot;Enterprise&quot; received an extensive refit, which included, among other upgrades, new anti-aircraft weapons and an anti-torpedo blister that significantly improved her underwater protection. This mid-war refit is where she would receive her two iconic &quot;6&quot;s on her flight decks.

===Return to duty===
Captain Matthias Gardner relieved Ginder on 7 November. Back at Pearl Harbor on 6 November, &quot;Enterprise&quot; left four days later to provide close air support to the 27th Infantry Division landing on Makin Atoll, during the Battle of Makin, from 19–21 November 1943. On the night of 26 November, &quot;Enterprise&quot; introduced carrier-based night fighters to the Pacific when a three-plane team from the ship broke up a large group of land-based bombers attacking TG 50.2. Two of the three planes returned to the ship, with LCDR Edward &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare the only casualty. After a heavy strike by aircraft of TF 50 against Kwajalein on 4 December, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor five days later.

The carrier&#x27;s next operation was with the Fast Carrier Task Force in softening up the Marshall Islands and supporting the landings on Kwajalein, from 29 January-3 February 1944. Then, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed, still with TF 58, to strike the Japanese naval base at Truk Lagoon in the Caroline Islands, on 17 February. Again &quot;Enterprise&quot; made aviation history, when she launched the first night radar bombing attack from a U.S. carrier. The twelve torpedo bombers in this strike achieved excellent results, accounting for nearly one-third of the 200,000 tons of shipping destroyed by aircraft.

Detached from TF 58 with escorts, &quot;Enterprise&quot; launched raids on Jaluit Atoll on 20 February, then steamed to Majuro and Espiritu Santo. Sailing on 15 March in TG 36.1, she provided air cover and close support for the landings on Emirau Island (19–25 March). The carrier rejoined TF 58 on 26 March, and for the next 12 days, joined in a series of strikes against the islands of Yap, Ulithi, Woleai, and Palau. After a week&#x27;s rest and replenishment at Majuro, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed on 14 April to support landings in the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area of New Guinea, and then hit Truk again from 29 to 30 April.

On 6 June 1944, she and her companions of TG 58.3 sortied from Majuro to join the rest of TF 58 in attacking the Marianas Islands. Striking Saipan, Rota, and Guam from 11 to 14 June, &quot;Enterprise&quot; pilots gave direct support to the landings on Saipan on 15 June, and covered the troops ashore for the next two days.

Aware of a major Japanese attempt to break up the invasion of Saipan, Admiral Spruance, now Commander 5th Fleet, positioned TF 58 to meet the threat.

====Battle of the Philippine Sea====
On 19 June 1944, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was one of four carriers of Task Group 58.3 under the command of Rear Admiral John W. Reeves&#x27; during the largest carrier aircraft battle in history: the Battle of the Philippine Sea. For over eight hours, airmen of the United States and Imperial Japanese navies fought in the skies over TF 58 and the Marianas. Over the course of two days, a total of six American ships were damaged, and 130 planes and a total of 76 pilots and aircrew were lost. In sharp contrast, American carrier aircraft, with a major assist from U.S. submarines, sank three Japanese carriers (, , and ), and destroyed 426 carrier aircraft, losses from which Japanese naval aviation would never recover.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; participated both in the defense of the fleet and in the subsequent early-evening strike against the Japanese task forces. During the chaotic after-dark recovery of the air strike, a fighter and a bomber came aboard simultaneously, but fortunately did not cause an accident. A planned midnight strike against the Japanese fleet by night-flying &quot;Enterprise&quot; pilots was cancelled because of the recovery and rescue operations required after the dusk attack. After the battle, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her Task Group continued to provide air support for the invasion of Saipan through 5 July. She then sailed for Pearl Harbor and a month of rest and overhaul, during which she was painted in Measure 33/4Ab Dazzle camouflage. During this time, Gardner was replaced by Commander Thomas Hamilton on 10 July before he was relieved in his turn by Captain Cato Glover on 29 July. Back in action on 24 August, the carrier sailed with TF 38 in that force&#x27;s aerial assault on the Volcano and Bonin Islands from 31 August – 2 September, and Yap, Ulithi, and the Palaus from 6–8 September.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====
After operating west of the Palau Islands, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined other units of TF 38 on 7 October and set course to the north. From 10 to 20 October, her aviators flew over Okinawa, Formosa, and the Philippines, blasting enemy airfields, shore installations, and shipping in preparation for the assault on Leyte. After supporting the Leyte landings on 20 October, &quot;Enterprise&quot; headed for Ulithi to replenish, but the approach of the Japanese fleet on 23 October called her back to action.

In the Battle of Leyte Gulf (23–26 October), &quot;Enterprise&quot; planes struck all three groups of enemy forces, battering battleships and destroyers before the action ended. Targeting Admiral Takeo Kurita &quot;Center Force in the Sibuyan Sea, nine of her Helldivers attacked the battleship &quot;Musashi&quot; with armour-piercing bombs and scored four hits; further repeated bomb and torpedo strikes eventually sunk &quot;Musashi&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; also sent 27 planes (Avengers and Helldivers escorted by Hellcats) to attack Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force. The strikes against battleship &quot;Yamashiro&quot; killed 20 sailors with strafing and rocket attacks, while a bomb&#x27;s near miss damaged the hull and flooded the starboard bilge causing the ship to list by almost 15 degrees until counter-flooding in the port bilge righted the ship. &quot;Enterprise&quot; planes also hit the battleship Fusō, as one bomb destroyed the catapult and both floatplanes, while another bomb hit the ship near Turret No. 2 and penetrated the decks, killing everyone in No. 1 secondary battery; the ship began to list 2 degrees to starboard. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; and &quot;Fusō&quot; were later sunk that evening by U.S. destroyers and battleships at Surigao Strait. 

&quot;Enterprise&quot; remained on patrol east of Samar and Leyte until the end of October, then retired to Ulithi for supplies. During November, her aircraft struck targets in the Manila area, and at the island of Yap. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1944 and Glover was replaced by Captain Grover B. H. Hall on 14 December.

====Luzon and Tokyo====
Sailing on 24 December for the Philippines, &quot;Enterprise&quot; carried an air group specially trained in night carrier operations; as the only carrier capable of night operations, it left Oahu with its hull code changed from CV to CV(N), the &quot;N&quot; representing &quot;Night&quot;. it joined TG 38.5 and swept the waters north of Luzon and of the South China Sea during January 1945, striking shore targets and shipping from Formosa to Indo-China including an attack on Macau. After a brief visit to Ulithi, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined TG 58.5 on 10 February 1945, and provided day and night combat air patrol for TF 58 as it struck Tokyo on 16–17 February.

====Iwo Jima====
She then supported the Marines in the Battle of Iwo Jima from 19 February – 9 March, when she sailed for Ulithi. During one part of that period, &quot;Enterprise&quot; kept aircraft aloft continuously over Iwo Jima for 174 hours.

====Okinawa====

Departing Ulithi on 15 March, the carrier continued her night work in raids against Kyūshū, Honshū, and shipping in the Inland Sea of Japan. Damaged lightly by an enemy bomb on 18 March, &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered Ulithi six days later for repairs. Back in action on 5 April, she supported the Okinawa operation until she was damaged on 11 April—this time by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;—and was forced back to Ulithi. Off Okinawa once more on 6 May, &quot;Enterprise&quot; flew patrols around the clock as &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks increased. On 14 May 1945, she suffered her last wound of World War II when a &quot;kamikaze&quot; Zero, piloted by Lt. J.G. Shunsuke Tomiyasu, destroyed her forward elevator, killing 14 and wounding 68.

The carrier sailed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she underwent repairs and an overhaul from 12 June-31 August 1945. The war ended with the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945.

=== Aviation complement ===
The following aviation complement was disembarked from &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 7 September 1945 at NAS Barber&#x27;s Point;

*United States Pacific Fleet - Navy Carrier Air Group 52 (CVGN-52) - NYD SEATTLE 1x Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat - ship&#x27;s flight
**VFN-52 - 22x F6F-5 + 15x F6F-5P
**VTN-52 (torpedo bomber squadron) - 16x General Motors TBM-3E Avenger

===Post war===
====Operation Magic Carpet====
Restored to peak condition, &quot;Enterprise&quot; voyaged to Pearl Harbor, returning to the States with some 1,141 servicemen due for discharge, including hospital patients and former POWs, then sailed on to New York on 25 September 1945 via the Panama Canal arriving on 17 October 1945. Two weeks later, she proceeded to Boston for installation of additional berthing facilities, then began a series of three Operation Magic Carpet voyages to Europe, bringing home more than 10,000 veterans in her final service to her country.

The first European voyage returned 4,668 servicemen from Southampton, England, in November 1945. On the second trip to Europe, she was boarded by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Albert Alexander in Southampton, who presented &quot;Enterprise&quot; with a British Admiralty pennant that was hoisted when a majority of the Admiralty Board members were present. The pennant was given to &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a token of respect from several high-ranking officers of an ally. She returned to New York on 25 December 1945 with 4,413 servicemen. On this nine-day trip, she encountered four storms, some with winds of that caused waves that swamped the forecastle deck in water up to deep. According to damage control officer John U. Monro, the storms smashed sections of walkways and railings, and swept loose objects overboard. Her last voyage was to the Azores, and returned 3,557 personnel, including 212 WACs to New York on 17 January 1946.

===The end for &quot;Enterprise&quot;===
With the commissioning of over two dozen larger and more advanced aircraft carriers by end of 1945, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was deemed surplus for the post-war needs of America&#x27;s navy. She entered the New York Naval Shipyard on 18 January 1946 for deactivation and was decommissioned on 17 February 1947. In 1946, she had been scheduled to be handed over to the state of New York as a permanent memorial, but this plan was suspended in 1949. Subsequent attempts were made at preserving the ship as a museum or memorial, but fund-raising efforts failed to raise enough money to buy the vessel from the Navy, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was sold on 1 July 1958 to the Lipsett Corporation of New York City for scrapping at Kearny, New Jersey.

A promise was made to save the distinctive tripod mast for inclusion in the Naval Academy&#x27;s new football stadium, but was never fulfilled; instead, a memorial plaque was installed at the base of what is still called &quot;&quot;Enterprise&quot; Tower.&quot; Scrapping was complete as of May 1960. In 1984, a permanent &quot;&quot;Enterprise&quot; Exhibit&quot; was dedicated at the Naval Aviation Museum, Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, to house artifacts, photos, and other items of historical interest. 

Surviving &quot;Enterprise&quot; artifacts include the ship&#x27;s bell, which resides at the U.S. Naval Academy, where it is traditionally rung only after Midshipmen victories over West Point; and the , one-ton nameplate from the ship&#x27;s stern, which sits near a Little League park in River Vale, New Jersey. Her commissioning plaque and one of her anchors are on display at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

===Successors to &quot;Enterprise&quot;===
The name was revived in February 1958 when the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was laid down as the eighth &quot;Enterprise&quot;; this ship was commissioned in November 1961. Also nicknamed the &quot;Big E&quot;, various artifacts and mementos were kept aboard from her predecessor. The port holes in the captain&#x27;s in-port cabin and conference room are only one example. She was inactivated and removed from service on 1 December 2012 after being in the fleet for 51 years. Due to considerations arising from reactor removal, she cannot be turned into a memorial. At her inactivation, it was announced that the ninth ship to bear the name &quot;Enterprise&quot; would be the planned , CVN-80. It has not been confirmed what, if any, artifacts from USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6) will be incorporated into this next generation aircraft carrier, although a time capsule containing mementos from both CV-6 and CVN-65 will be presented to the first captain of the new &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The aforementioned port holes aboard the CVN-65 will be removed and returned to the Boston Navy Yard Museum.

==Awards and commendations==


&quot;Enterprise&quot; was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for her service during World War II. The citation states:

In addition to her Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Enterprise&quot; received the Navy Unit Commendation and 20 battle stars for World War II service, making her the highest decorated U.S. ship of the war.

Finally, she was presented with a British Admiralty pennant that was hoisted when a majority of the Admiralty Board members were present. The pennant was given to &quot;Enterprise&quot; as an unofficial token of respect from an ally.

==Legacy==
* Gene Roddenberry, creator of the television show, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, named his fictional starship in honor of CV-6 early on in the development of the show, because he was &quot;particularly fascinated&quot; by her war record, and had &quot;always considered it a heroic ship&quot;. In doing so, he replaced the name &quot;S.S. Yorktown&quot; (named after &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s sister ship) he had originally envisioned for his fictional starship, when he conceived the show in early 1964. The name &quot;Enterprise&quot; has been given to multiple starships throughout the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise over the years in both television and motion picture stories. The CV-6 is acknowledged during a discussion of past vessels named Enterprise in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; while CVN-65 is featured in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.
* Jack C. Taylor, founder of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, had served on &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a fighter pilot during the war, and (re-)named his company in 1969 after the ship.

<text>USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CVN-65), formerly CVA(N)-65, is a decommissioned United States Navy aircraft carrier. In 1958, she became the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the United States Navy, and the world, as well as the eighth United States naval vessel to bear the name. Like her predecessor of World War II fame, she is nicknamed &quot;Big E&quot;. At , she is the longest naval vessel ever built and the only ship of a class that was originally planned to have five other ships. Her displacement ranks her class as the third largest carrier class, after the and the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class. &quot;Enterprise&quot; had a crew of some 4,600 service members.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was, at the time of inactivation, the third-oldest commissioned vessel in the United States Navy after the wooden-hulled and . She was inactivated on 1 December 2012, and officially decommissioned on 3 February 2017, after over 55 years of service. She was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; the same day. The name has been adopted by the future &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carrier .

==Design==

Designed under project SCB 160, USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was intended as the lead ship of a new class of six nuclear powered aircraft carriers, but massive increases in construction costs led to the remaining vessels being cancelled.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; is the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors, having an eight-reactor propulsion design, with each A2W reactor taking the place of one of the conventional boilers in earlier constructions. She is the only carrier with four rudders, two more than other classes, and features a more cruiser-like hull.

===Armament===
Because of the huge cost of her construction, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was launched and commissioned without the planned RIM-2 Terrier missile launchers. Initially, the carrier had little defensive armament. Late in 1967, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was fitted with a prototype Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS) installation, with two eight-round box launchers for Sea Sparrow missiles. A third BPDMS launcher was fitted during the ship&#x27;s refit in 1970–1971.

Later upgrades added two NATO Sea Sparrow (NSSM) and three Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS gun mounts. One CIWS mount was later removed and two 21-cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launchers were added.

===Radar===
&quot;Enterprise&quot; had a phased array radar system known as SCANFAR. SCANFAR was intended to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the US Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system. It was installed on only two vessels, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the cruiser , placing an unacceptable power drain on the electric systems of both ships.

The technology of the AN/SPS-32 was based on vacuum tubes and the system required constant repairs. The SPS-32 was a phased array radar which had a range of 400 nautical miles against large targets, and 200 nautical miles against small, fighter-size targets. These early phased arrays, replaced around 1980, were responsible for the distinctive square-looking island.

The AN/SPS-32 and AN/SPS-33 radars, while ahead of their time, suffered from issues relating to the electrical beam steering mechanism and were not pursued in further ship classes. While they are considered to be an early form of &quot;phased array&quot; radar, it would take the later technology of the Aegis phased array AN/SPY-1 with its electronically controlled beam steering to make phased array radars both reliable and practical for the USN. The dome above the SCANFAR contained the unique electronic warfare suite, the Andrew Alford AA-8200 dipole antennas (which never acquired a military designation). The system consisted of six rows of antennae encircling the dome. The antennas in the upper two rows were encased in piping radomes as they were small and fragile.

==History==

===Commissioning and trials===
The ship&#x27;s keel was laid at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Shipway 11 on 4 February 1958. On 24 September 1960, the ship was launched, sponsored by the wife of William B. Franke, then Secretary of the Navy. On 25 November 1961, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was officially commissioned, with Captain Vincent P. de Poix, formerly of Fighting Squadron 6 on her predecessor, in command. On 12 January 1962, the ship made her maiden voyage starting an extensive shakedown cruise and a lengthy series of tests and training exercises designed to determine the full capabilities of the nuclear powered super carrier. A full-speed run with her escort, , demonstrated the sheer power and speed of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s novel nuclear propulsion plant; afterwards, &quot;Laffey&quot; radioed, &quot;You win the race. Fuel gone, topside salted, crew wet, and engines tired.&quot; On 20 February 1962, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a tracking and measuring station for the flight of &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, the Project Mercury space capsule in which Lieutenant Colonel John H. Glenn Jr. made the first American orbital spaceflight. &quot;Enterprise&quot; completed shakedown activities at Naval Station Norfolk on 5 April 1962.

===1960s===
On 25 June 1962, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined the 2nd Fleet on her initial operational deployment, carrying out training off the US East Coast, and took part in Exercise &quot;LantFlex 2-62&quot;, a nuclear strike exercise, in conjunction with the carrier from 6–12 July. In August, the carrier joined the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, returning to Norfolk, Virginia on 11 October 1962.

====1962 Cuban Missile Crisis====
In October 1962, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was dispatched to her first international crisis. Following revelations that the Soviet Union was constructing nuclear missile launch sites on Cuba, President John F. Kennedy ordered the United States Department of Defense to conduct a large-scale buildup. Among the preparations, the US Atlantic Fleet readied large numbers of its ships. On 22 October, President Kennedy ordered a naval and air &quot;quarantine&quot; (blockade) on shipment of offensive military equipment to Cuba and demanded the Soviets dismantle the missile sites there. Five Second Fleet carriers participated in the blockade—&quot;Enterprise&quot; (as part of Task Force 135), , , , and , backed by shore-based aircraft. By 28 October, the crisis was both peacefully and successfully averted, after the United States secretly agreed to remove nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey.

====Second and third deployments====
On 19 December 1962, a Grumman E-2 Hawkeye was catapulted off &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the first shipboard test of a nose-wheel launch bar designed to replace the catapult bridle. Minutes later, a second launch with a launch bar was made by a Grumman A-6A Intruder, demonstrating one of the primary design goals of reducing launch intervals.

In 1963–1964, now under command of Captain Frederick H. Michaelis, &quot;Enterprise&quot; made her second and third deployments to the Mediterranean. During her third deployment, the carrier was part of Operation Sea Orbit, the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered task force with the cruisers &quot;Long Beach&quot; and , together forming a convoy to sail around the world. On 25 February 1964, a crewman of the Finnish merchant ship was injured in a fall while the ship was in the vicinity of Souda Bay, Greece. &quot;Enterprise&quot; answered her call for assistance. A surgeon was transferred to &quot;Verna Paulin&quot; by helicopter. In October 1964, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company for her first Refueling and Overhaul. During this refit, her eight nuclear reactors, which had powered &quot;Enterprise&quot; as she steamed over , were refueled, two of her propeller shafts were replaced, and the ship&#x27;s electronics were updated. &quot;Enterprise&quot; emerged from her refit on 22 June 1965 and returned to action.

====Vietnam deployments====
In November 1965, the Enterprise was transferred to the Seventh Fleet, home-ported at NAS Alameda, California. The following month, on 2 December, she became the first nuclear-powered ship to engage in combat when she launched aircraft against the Viet Cong near Biên Hòa City. The ship led Carrier Division Three, with &quot;Enterprise&quot; (redesignated CVA(N)-65), which had Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9) aboard, &quot;Bainbridge&quot;; ; and . &quot;Enterprise&quot; launched 125 sorties on the first day, unleashing of bombs and rockets on the enemy&#x27;s supply lines. On 3 December, she set a record of 165 strike sorties in a single day.

In January 1966, the aircraft carrier was continuing operations as a unit of Task Force 77 in the Gulf of Tonkin, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Henry L. Miller, Commander Carrier Division Three. Under the command of Captain James L. Holloway III, she was carrying a complement of approximately 350 officers and 4,800 men. Four West coast squadrons of CVW-9, commanded by Commander F. T. Brown, were embarked; VF-92, under Commander E. A. Rawsthorne, and VF-96, under Commander R. D. Norman, flying F-4B Phantom IIs; VA-93 under Commander A. J. Monger, and VA-94, under Commander O. E. Krueger, flying A-4C Skyhawks. With these squadrons were three others based on the East Coast; VA-36, under Commander J. E. Marshall, VA-76, under Commander J. B. Linder, flying A-4C Skyhawks; and RVAH-7, under Commander K. Enny, flying RA-5C Vigilantes. Rear Admiral Miller was relieved as Commander Carrier Division Three by Rear Admiral T. J. Walker on 16 February 1966. During the change of command ceremony on the flight deck, Rear Admiral Miller praised the ship&#x27;s performance in his farewell remarks and presented air medals to more than 100 pilots and flight officers.

The ship tied up at Leyte Pier, U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, on the evening of 8 December 1966. Loading of supplies for the first line period was started immediately. Rear Admiral Walter L Curtis Jr, Commander Carrier Division Nine, brought his flag aboard. In company with , and , &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed for Yankee Station on 15 December, and took up her position there three days later.

When &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed the Gulf of Tonkin on 20 June 1967, her pilots had flown more than 13,400 battle missions during 132 combat days of operations. (Enterprise Command History 1967, 29) As Vice Admiral Hyland stated in his congratulatory statement, &quot;the entire Air Wing Nine has earned a resounding &#x27;Well Done&#x27;.&quot; The carrier had steamed 67,630 miles in operations with the Seventh Fleet. She arrived in Subic Bay on 22 June and departed on 25 June for return to Alameda on 6 July 1967.
At Alameda, &quot;Enterprise&quot; began an overhaul. Captain Kent Lee relieved Captain James L. Holloway as commanding officer in ceremonies on 11 July 1967. Shipyard work was completed on 5 September 1967, and after completing sea trials on 7 September, &quot;Enterprise&quot; steamed south from San Francisco Bay to San Diego to reembark CVW-9 and get underway for refresher training off the California coast.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was visiting Sasebo, Japan in January 1968 when the US intelligence ship was seized by North Korea, and she served as flagship of TF 71 (Rear Admiral Epes), which had been formed in response and they operated near South Korean waters for almost a month, during Operation Formation Star. When diplomatic negotiations had defused tensions, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her escorts were released to head south to Yankee Station on 16 February 1968. &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to NAS Alameda on 18 July 1968, having completed 12,839 catapult launches, with 12,246 sorties9,182 of them combat. After a short overhaul in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from 29 July to 26 September, she returned to Alameda to prepare for another deployment to Vietnam.

===1969 fire===
During the morning of 14 January 1969, while being escorted by the destroyers and , a MK-32 Zuni rocket loaded on a parked F-4 Phantom exploded when ordnance cooked off after being overheated by an aircraft start unit. The explosion set off fires and additional explosions across the flight deck.

The fires were brought under control relatively quickly (when compared with previous carrier flight deck fires), but 27 sailors were killed, and an additional 314 sailors were injured. The fire destroyed 15 aircraft, and the resulting damage forced &quot;Enterprise&quot; to put in for repairs at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Hawaii, primarily to repair the flight deck&#x27;s armored plating. On 1 March 1969, repairs to the ship were completed and the ship proceeded on her scheduled western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment to Vietnam and the Tonkin Gulf. These destinations would be delayed by events in the eastern Sea of Japan.
===Korean operations===
On 14 April 1969, tensions with North Korea flared again as a North Korean aircraft shot down a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star that was on a reconnaissance patrol over the eastern Sea of Japan from its base at Atsugi, Japan. The entire 31-man crew was killed. The US responded by activating Task Force 71 (TF 71) to protect future such flights over those international waters. Initially, the Task Force was to comprise &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , , and with a screen of cruisers and destroyers. &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrived on station with TF 71 in late April after completion of repairs. The ships for TF 71 came mostly from Southeast Asia duty. This deployment became one of the largest shows of force in the area since the Korean War.

===1970s===
In 1969–1970, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to Newport News Shipbuilding and went through an overhaul and her second refitting. In January 1971, she completed sea trials with newly designed nuclear reactor cores that contained enough energy for 10 years. On 11 June 1971 &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with Captain Forrest S. Petersen now in command and Carrier Air Wing Fourteen (CVW-14) onboard, then departed for Vietnam again.

====South and Southeast Asia====

&quot;Enterprise&quot;, and launched a total of 2,001 strike sorties by 30 July 1971. Strike operations in July were disrupted when the carriers on station evaded three typhoons: Harriet, Kim and Jean. A slight increase in South Vietnam strike sorties occurred during the month. These were mainly visual strikes against enemy troop positions and in support of U.S. helicopter operations. From August–November 1971, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was in operations on Yankee Station.

In December 1971, Captain Ernest E. Tissot Jr. assumed command, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was deployed to the Bay of Bengal, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 as a show of strength against India&#x27;s naval blockade by INS &quot;Vikrant&quot;. Later a Soviet Navy submarine was also trailing the US task force. A confrontation was averted when &quot;Enterprise&quot; moved away from the Indian Ocean toward Southeast Asia. &quot;Enterprise&quot; completed its deployment on 12 February 1972.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to the South China Sea from 12 September 1972 with CVW-14 onboard. On 18 December 1972, the United States resumed bombing campaigns above the 20th parallel under the name Linebacker II. During Linebacker II operations, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and other carriers on station reseeded the mine fields in Haiphong harbor and conducted concentrated strikes against surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery sites, enemy army barracks, petroleum storage areas, Haiphong naval and shipyard areas, and railroad and truck stations. Navy tactical air attack sorties under Linebacker II were centered in the coastal areas around Hanoi and Haiphong. There were 705 Navy sorties in this area during Linebacker II. Between 18 and 22 December, the Navy conducted 119 Linebacker II strikes in North Vietnam, with the main limiting factor on airstrikes being bad weather. In December 1972, the North Vietnamese returned to the peace table and Linebacker II ended. In January 1973, the Vietnam cease-fire was announced, and American carriers ceased all combat sorties into North and South Vietnam. From 28 January 1973, aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Ranger&quot; flew 81 combat sorties against lines-of-communication targets in Laos. The corridor for overflights was between Huế and Da Nang in South Vietnam. These combat support sorties were flown in support of the Laotian government, which had requested this assistance. Laos had no relationship with the ceasefire in Vietnam. &quot;Enterprise&quot; completed its deployment on 12 June 1973.

====Post-Vietnam====
After the cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973, &quot;Enterprise&quot; proceeded to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, where the carrier was altered and refitted to support the Navy&#x27;s newest fighter aircraft – the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. Two of four jet blast deflectors were enlarged to accommodate the Tomcat. The No. 4 propulsion shaft was replaced; it had been bent when its screw became fouled in a discarded arresting gear cable.

On 18 March 1974, the first operational Tomcats of VF-1 Wolfpack and VF-2 Bounty Hunters made their maiden takeoffs and landings from the carrier. In September 1974, &quot;Enterprise&quot; became the first carrier to deploy with the new fighter plane when she made her seventh WESTPAC deployment.

In February 1975, Typhoon Gervaise struck the island nation of Mauritius, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was ordered to provide disaster relief. Arriving at Port Louis, carrier personnel spent more than 10,000 man-hours rendering such assistance as restoring water, power and telephone systems, clearing roads and debris, and providing helicopter, medical, food and drinkable water support to the stricken area.

====Operation Frequent Wind====

In April 1975, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Midway&quot;, , and were deployed to waters off South Vietnam for possible evacuation contingencies as North Vietnam, in violation of the Paris Peace Accords, launched a conventional invasion of South Vietnam. On 29 April, Operation Frequent Wind was carried out by U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps helicopters from the 7th Fleet. The Operation involved the evacuation of American citizens and &quot;at-risk&quot; Vietnamese from Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam under heavy attack from the invading forces of North Vietnam.

President Gerald Ford ordered helicopter evacuation when PAVN shelling forced the cessation of fixed-wing evacuation from Tan Son Nhut Airport. With fighter cover provided by carrier aircraft, the helicopters landed at the US Embassy, Saigon and the DAO Compound to pick up evacuees. The last helicopter lifted off the roof of the United States Embassy at 7:53 am, local time, on 30 April 1975 carrying the last 11 Marine Security Guards. During Operation Frequent Wind, aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; flew 95 sorties. VF-1 and VF-2, flying from &quot;Enterprise&quot; made the first combat deployment of the F-14 Tomcat.

====Eighth and ninth deployments====
In July 1976, &quot;Enterprise&quot; began her eighth Western Pacific deployment. Beginning in October she took part in the ANZUS exercise &#x27;Kangaroo II&#x27; with ships of the Australian and New Zealand Navies.

One of the ports visited was Hobart, Tasmania in November 1976. It had also been the first time an American ship anchored in the capital&#x27;s harbor, Hobart, since the early 1920s. A beer with a picture of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for its label was just one of the commemorations received by the renowned nuclear carrier.

In February 1977, Idi Amin, the President of Uganda, made derogatory remarks against the United States in public and Americans in Uganda were taken hostage. This was several months after the Israeli raid at Entebbe airport. &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her escort ships were scheduled to transit home after a seven-month deployment but having just left Mombasa after a port call, were directed to remain in the area and operated off the east African coast for about one week. The ship&#x27;s Marine detachment and air wing prepared for a possible mission to rescue and evacuate the Americans, but Amin eventually released all the hostages. The ships then steamed across the Indian Ocean at high speed to make a previously scheduled final port call at NAS Cubi Point in the Philippines before returning to NAS Alameda.

In 1978, &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent her ninth Western Pacific deployment, the last before the ship&#x27;s planned major refit. The 1978 WESTPAC cruise included port calls in Hong Kong, Perth, Australia, and Singapore, and ended at the end of the year. In January 1979, the carrier arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for the intended 36-month refurbishment. This overhaul modified the ship&#x27;s superstructure – removing the SCANFAR radars and the unique inverted cone-shaped top section, which was three stories high. During the lengthy overhaul, Navy and shipyard personnel referred to &quot;Enterprise&quot; as &quot;Building 65.&quot;

===1980s===

In 1982, the carrier made her 10th WESTPAC deployment. In April 1983, &quot;Enterprise&quot; ran aground on a sandbar in San Francisco Bay while returning from deployment and remained stuck there for several hours. Coincidentally, George Takei, who played Mr. Sulu, helmsman of the fictional starship , was aboard at the time as a guest of the Navy. Even though groundings and collisions are usually career-ending events for U.S. warship captains, the captain at the time, Robert J. Kelly, who had already been selected for promotion to commodore, eventually became a four-star admiral and Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet.

In 1985, the Enterprise began training for her 11th WESTPAC deployment. Late at night on 2 November 1985 with Captain Robert L. Leuschner Jr. on the bridge, she struck Bishop Rock on the Cortes Bank during flight exercises, damaging the outer hull with a gash more than 100 feet in length and knocking out of one screw, a chip whose size was illustrated with a photograph of a Navy diver stretched out and reclining inside the notch. The cost of repairing the damage was $17 million, and Leuschner was relieved of command on 27 January 1986 as a result of the incident, by Captain Robert J. Spane.

In 1986, the carrier made her 12th WESTPAC deployment, leaving on 15 January 1986. She led Battle Group FOXTROT, including , , , , , , and . The Battle Group sailed directly for the Indian Ocean, with stops in Hawaii, Subic Bay, and Singapore. On 28 April 1986, &quot;Enterprise&quot; became the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to transit the Suez Canal. She went from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean to relieve &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, on station with off the coast of Libya. &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered the Mediterranean to support &quot;Operation El Dorado Canyon&quot;, the US bombing of Libya. It was the ship&#x27;s first visit to the Mediterranean in more than 22 years. During the deployment, Rear Admiral J.T. Howe was relieved as Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group 3 by Rear Admiral Paul David Miller.

In February 1988, &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent her 13th deployment and was assigned to Operation Earnest Will, escorting reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. On 14 April, another Earnest Will ship, , struck an Iranian mine in international waters. In response, the US launched Operation Praying Mantis against Iranian targets, starting with two Iranian oil platforms that were being used as support bases for Iranian attacks on merchant shipping. Aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s CVW-11 bombed two Iranian frigates, helping to sink one and damaged the other, and provided other air support for the strike.

In September 1989, &quot;Enterprise&quot; left Alameda and began her 14th overseas deployment, an around-the-world cruise that would end at the ship&#x27;s new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. In early December 1989, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Midway&quot; participated in Operation Classic Resolve, President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s response to Philippine President Corazon Aquino&#x27;s request for air support during the rebel coup attempt. &quot;Enterprise&quot; remained on station conducting flight operations in the waters outside Manila Bay until the situation subsided.

===1990s===
In April 1990, &quot;Enterprise&quot; completed her around-the-world deployment, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, after having steamed more than (nautical). In October, the carrier moved to Newport News Shipbuilding for refueling and the Navy&#x27;s largest complex overhaul refit ever attempted. On 27 September 1994, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to sea for sea trials, now with Captain Richard J. Naughton in command, during which she performed an extended full power run as fast as when she was new.

On 28 June 1996, &quot;Enterprise&quot; began her 15th overseas deployment. The carrier enforced no-fly zones in Bosnia as part of Operation Joint Endeavor and over Iraq as part of Operation Southern Watch. The deployment ended in December 1996, which also marked the end of active service for the Grumman A-6 Intruder from the Navy. February 1997, &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered Newport News Shipbuilding for an extended selective restrictive availability lasting four-and-a-half months.

In November 1998, following workups, &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed on her 16th overseas deployment, with CVW-3 embarked. On the night of 8 November, shortly after the start of the deployment, a Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler crashed into a Lockheed S-3 Viking on the carrier&#x27;s flight deck. The mishap occurred as the EA-6B was landing during night carrier qualifications, striking the folded wings of the S-3, which had not yet cleared the landing area of the flight deck.

The four-man crew of the EA-6B perished when the aircraft hit the water, but the two crew members of the S-3 ejected. A fire broke out on the flight deck but was quickly extinguished by the flight deck crew. Three of the four members of the Prowler crew were lost at sea, and the remains of the fourth were recovered shortly after the crash. The crew of the Viking were rushed to the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Virginia. There were no other significant injuries. An exhaustive search for three missing EA-6B Prowler crew members was suspended after nearly 24 hours. 

On 23 November 1998, &quot;Enterprise&quot; relieved in the Persian Gulf.

During a port call in Jebel Ali, UAE, the carrier hosted former President George H. W. Bush and enjoyed a live concert by rock group Hootie &amp; the Blowfish.

In December 1998, &quot;Enterprise&quot; battlegroup spearheaded Operation Desert Fox, destroying Iraqi military targets with more than 300 Tomahawk land attack missiles and of ordnance. The 70-hour assault was carried out by &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , , and .

Shortly after the Račak massacre and failure of Yugoslavian peace talks in Rambouillet, France, &quot;Enterprise&quot; quickly left a port visit in Cannes, France, to return to the Adriatic.

In early March 1999, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf to relieve in support of Operation Southern Watch, returning to Norfolk in May 1999.

During the 1998–1999 deployment, &quot;Enterprise&quot; steamed more than and spent 151 days underway. &quot;Enterprise&quot; Battle Group was the first to deploy with IT-21, which allowed unprecedented internal and external communication capabilities, including Internet, email, and television.

===2000s===
In March 2001, &quot;Enterprise&quot; took part in the exercise &quot;JTFEX 01-2&quot; in the Caribbean Sea. &quot;U24&quot;, a Type 206 class diesel-electric submarine with the German Navy, managed to &quot;sink&quot; the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by firing flares and taking a photograph through its periscope.

On 25 April 2001, &quot;Enterprise&quot; began her 17th overseas deployment with CVW-8 embarked and Captain James A. Winnefeld Jr. in command. From 18–28 June, the carrier and four escorts participated in an exercise with the Royal Navy in a joint and combined warfare training exercise in the North Sea, near the Hebrides and in Scotland.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was beginning her voyage home from the Persian Gulf when the September 11 attacks were carried out. Without orders, the carrier returned to the waters off Southwest Asia near the Persian Gulf, outrunning her escorts. In October 2001, the United States launched air attacks against Al-Qaeda training camps and Taliban military installations in Afghanistan. The actions were designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a base for terrorist operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime.

Over three weeks, aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; flew nearly 700 missions and dropped over of ordnance over Afghanistan. On 10 November, the carrier arrived at her home port of Norfolk, Virginia, 16 days later than originally planned. During her last day at sea, the ship hosted a live two-hour broadcast of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Garth Brooks performed a concert with Jewel from &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 21 November while she was docked in Norfolk, Virginia. The concert was carried live on CBS. On Pearl Harbor Day (7 December 2001), President George W. Bush addressed the sailors of &quot;Enterprise&quot; from its flight deck.

In January 2002, &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia for a scheduled one-year Extended Dry Docking Selected Restricted Availability.

====Iraq War====

=====Operation Iraqi Freedom=====
From September 2003 to February 2004, the ship deployed to relieve the four carriers that were on station during the invasion of Iraq. Enterprise&#x27;s role was to provide continued air support for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The fully repaired was a member of her escort group at this time. A USO tour was held aboard while at sea, with wrestler Kurt Angle, NASCAR racer Mike Wallace, and comedian Robin Williams giving talks and performances. The ship made several port-calls to Jebel Ali, a stop in Bahrain (during which actor Ben Affleck visited the ship), and Naples, Italy and Cartegna, Spain on the way home. Admiral James Stavridis commanded the battle group at this time with Captain Eric Neidlinger as &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s commanding officer.

2005 saw the ship in for another routine shipyard overhaul at Newport News Shipyard in Newport News, Virginia. Departing the dock after this yard period, &quot;Enterprise&quot; ran through a sand bar, causing all eight reactors to shut down, leaving the ship adrift on emergency power for nearly three hours before she was tugged back to her pier at Norfolk Naval Base. It took about three days for the ship&#x27;s nuclear machinists to clear her condensers of river mud.

In May 2006, &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed for a six-month deployment, operating in the 6th, 5th and 7th Fleet areas in a world-tour, supporting Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, and visiting ports in Dubai, Hong Kong, and crossing the line. She returned to Norfolk on 18 November 2006.

On 19 December 2007, the carrier returned home after a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf.

In April 2008, &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered the Northrop-Grumman Newport News shipyard for a scheduled 18-month Extended Docking Selected Restricted Availability, with a projected completion date of September 2009. As maintenance was performed, costs continued to rise above projections and the completion date repeatedly slid. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the oldest active combat vessel in the Navy, was scheduled to be decommissioned as late as 2014. On 6 April 2009, Admiral Gary Roughead, Chief of Naval Operations, said that he was seeking a congressional dispensation to speed up the process to decommission &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Under this new timetable, the ship would complete one final deployment before being decommissioned in late 2012 or early 2013. This would temporarily reduce the US Navy to having only ten active aircraft carriers through the launch of the in 2015. In October 2009, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees agreed with the recommendation, approving the decommissioning of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 2013 after 51 years of service.

===2010s===

In April 2010, the Navy announced that the cost of refurbishing the carrier had risen to $655 million and was scheduled to be completed the same month. On 19 April 2010, &quot;Enterprise&quot; left the Northrop Grumman shipyard to conduct sea trials in preparation for return to the fleet. The total cost of refurbishing the carrier was $662 million, which was 46% over budget, while the programme of work took eight months longer than scheduled. The Navy said it planned to use the carrier for two six-month deployments before her scheduled 2013 decommissioning date.

On 1 January 2011, the Virginian-Pilot leaked highlights from the final video of a set entitled &quot;XO Movie Night&quot; that was filmed on &quot;Enterprise&quot; and aired via closed circuit television on select Saturday evenings. The videos, which were not meant for release outside the command, were produced by Captain Owen Honors when he was executive officer (XO) of the ship in the 2006–07 timeframe and included profanity, anti-gay slurs, and sexually suggestive scenes.

Captain Honors received public support from Navy personnel, but on 4 January 2011, Admiral John C. Harvey Jr., the commander of the United States Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk removed Honors for demonstrating poor judgment. Captain Dee Mewbourne was appointed as replacement commander. Forty officers and enlisted sailors, including six flag officers, were later disciplined to varying extents over the incident.

The carrier and her strike group deployed on 13 January 2011. Accompanying the carrier on the cruise to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean were Carrier Air Wing One, guided-missile cruiser , and guided-missile destroyers , , and . In February 2011, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was involved in an incident with Somali pirates, an event that ended in the deaths of four American citizens and two pirates. According to official reports of this incident provided by the navy, two pirates died; with another two dying at an unknown earlier time.

The carrier returned to Norfolk on 15 July 2011. During its deployment, it had participated in operations that captured 75 Somali pirates and its strike group made missile strikes against the Libyan government.
11 March 2012 began the final deployment from Norfolk homeport with Carrier Group Ships , , and and on 9 April 2012, the Navy announced that &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her group, Carrier Strike Group Twelve, would be assigned to join in the Persian Gulf. The mission was described as routine, not a response to a specific threat. Upon completion of this cruise in fall 2012, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was officially taken out of service, and was ordered to report back immediately to Norfolk for immediate deactivation, and eventual decommissioning.

In October 2012, &quot;Enterprise&quot; transited the Suez Canal for the final time. She paid her last foreign port call when she visited Naples, Italy, between 16–21 October, which had been the Big E&#x27;s first foreign port-of-call fifty years earlier.

On 4 November 2012, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to her homeport at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, for the last time. While on the journey, the carrier cruised nearly 81,000 miles in a 238-day deployment to the Persian Gulf and her aircraft flew more than 2,000 sorties in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

====Decommissioning====
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was deactivated on 1 December 2012 at Norfolk Naval Station, Virginia. The deactivation of &quot;Enterprise&quot; resulted in a one-time increase of approximately $857.3 million in depot maintenance costs for the US Navy&#x27;s operation and maintenance budget for Fiscal Year 2013.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to be decommissioned. Naval enthusiasts requested that &quot;Enterprise&quot; be converted into a museum. By 2012, this was deemed too expensive to make such an effort practical, in addition to the fact that the ship would need to be partially dismantled anyway to remove the eight reactors safely. A petition was also set up for the next carrier to be named as the ninth USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
At the inactivation ceremony, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that the next &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class carrier, , would be named &quot;Enterprise&quot;. VIPs present for the ceremony included several former commanding officers, a granddaughter of the ship&#x27;s sponsor, and a former A-6 pilot, Eugene McDaniel, who had been shot down and captured in North Vietnam and was returning to the ship for the first time since the day he was shot down.
On 8 February 2013, the United States Department of Defense announced that a number of nuclear projects would have to be postponed until the upcoming budget sequestration issue was resolved. These include the planned de-fueling of &quot;Enterprise&quot; as well as mid-life overhauls (including nuclear refueling) for two ships. The contract for de-fueling &quot;Enterprise&quot; was eventually awarded to Huntington Ingalls Industries in June 2013.

In October 2014, Newport News Shipbuilding announced that one of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s anchors, removed from the ship during deactivation, had been transferred to the during her RCOH. In early 2017, it was announced that steel from CVN-65 will be recycled and used to construct CVN-80. Over 35,000 pounds of steel has been removed from CVN-65 and repurposed into CVN-80. The crew of the ship&#x27;s final deployment built a time capsule constructed from her steel and wood to preserve the carrier&#x27;s history for CVN-80.
The final reactor was de-fueled in December 2016, with Enterprise officially decommissioned on 3 February 2017. The same day, the ship was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Registry&quot; (NVR). According to Navy Sea Systems Command, the recycling of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was delayed by the Navy until further information on &quot;more technically executable, environmentally responsible&quot; approaches to disposing of the aircraft carrier are available. On 10 April 2018, Newport News Shipbuilding announced that &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s inactivation process had been completed. &quot;Ex-Enterprise&quot; was stored at Hampton Roads while disposal plans were determined by the Navy.

The final disposal plan for &quot;Enterprise&quot; will be a long and complicated process. The carrier had eight reactors and numerous compartments contaminated by radiation and therefore could not be used as a target ship in a &quot;SINKEX&quot; or live-fire training sinking exercise. The Navy set up a new office to organize the disposal of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the coming retirement of the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers. Ultimately, it was decided to use a commercial facility to break the ship up, with scrapping to begin in 2025. The process is anticipated to take five years, with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to be gone completely by 2030. 

The total costs of scrapping the &quot;Enterprise&quot; have been estimated at over $1 billion; however, as of 17 January 2025, scrapping remained delayed by local disputes over plans to scrap the carrier in Mobile, AL.

==In popular culture==

In the 1986 science-fiction film &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, Pavel Chekov and Uhura infiltrate the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Scenes set on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; were actually filmed aboard the since the actual &quot;Enterprise&quot; was at sea during filming.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is a setting in the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, also released in 1986. Shots of the main characters&#x27; F-14s on the flight deck and general flight-ops scenes were filmed on both the actual &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the , with the latter being used after the &quot;Enterprise&quot; ran aground at Cortes Bank. The USS &quot;Ranger&quot; again substituted for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for interior shots.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is at the center of The Raft, a refugee flotilla, in the 1992 novel &quot;Snow Crash.&quot;

<text>A mute is a device attached to a musical instrument which changes the instrument&#x27;s tone quality (timbre) or lowers its volume. Mutes are commonly used on string and brass instruments, especially the trumpet and trombone, and are occasionally used on woodwinds. Their effect is mostly intended for artistic use, but they can also allow players to practice discreetly. Muting can also be done by hand, as in the case of palm muting a guitar or grasping a triangle to dampen its sound.

Mutes on brass instruments are typically inserted into the flared end of the instrument (bell). They can also be held in front of or clipped onto the bell. Of brass mutes, the &quot;straight mute&quot; is the most common and is frequently used in classical and jazz music, but a wide variety are available. On string instruments of the violin family, mutes are usually attached to the bridge, the piece of wood that supports the strings. Palm muting a guitar involves placing the side of the hand across the strings, and some of them have physical mutes which produce a similar effect. Pianos have a soft pedal and occasionally a practice pedal, which both decrease the instrument&#x27;s volume.

== Overview ==
According to &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, a mute is a &quot;device used on a musical instrument to modify its timbre by reducing the intensity of certain partials and amplifying others&quot;. More generally, it refers to &quot;any of various devices used to muffle or soften the tone of an instrument&quot;. The act of using a mute is called &quot;muting&quot;. Brass mutes are occasionally referred to as &quot;dampers&quot;, but &quot;damping&quot; usually means reducing or deadening the sound after it has been played.

Mutes can be used artistically and for practical purposes. They are used in several genres of music: violin mutes have been used in classical music since at least the seventeenth century, and many types of brass mutes are used in jazz. A common misconception is that muting has the sole purpose of decreasing volume, but this is only true of practice mutes; string instruments in particular can easily play softly without additional equipment.

=== Notation ===
Musical notation directing players to mute and unmute their instruments varies. The type of mute and when to add and remove is specified in text above the music; &quot;open&quot; is often used in music for brass to indicate the subsequent passage should be played without a mute. In classical music, the phrase &quot;con sordino&quot; or &quot;con sordini&quot; (, abbreviated &quot;con sord.&quot;), directs players to use a straight mute on brass instruments, and mount the mute on string instruments. The corresponding &quot;senza sordino&quot; indicates removing the mute. Synonyms include &quot;avec sourdine&quot; and &quot;sans sourdine&quot; (French); &quot;mit Dämpfer&quot; and &quot;ohne Dämpfer&quot; (German). Ample time must be given to allow players to add and remove the mute, though some mutes can be engaged and disengaged quickly.

For hand muting that changes over time, &quot;o&quot; is used above the music for open (unmuted) and &quot;+&quot; for closed (muted). For dampening on percussion or harp, the étouffé symbol (resembling a coda symbol) or a diamond-shaped notehead is used.

== Brass ==

Mutes are widely used on brass instruments to alter their timbre. They are often directly inserted into the instrument&#x27;s bell, but can also be clipped or held onto the end of the bell. Mutes of various types are available in many sizes for all brass instruments, including the tuba; trumpet and trombone players have the widest selection of mutes. They are made of a variety of materials, including fiber, plastic, cardboard, and metal (usually aluminum, brass, or copper). In general, mutes soften the lower frequencies of the sound because they nearly close the bell, but accentuate higher ones due to resonances within the mute.

Stoppers for natural trumpets (the predecessor of the modern valved trumpet) were found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun dating to around 1300 BC, but they were most likely for protecting the instrument from moisture or damage during transport. The earliest known mention of trumpet mutes dates to a 1511 account of a carnival in Florence. Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s 1607 opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; opens with a muted trumpet ensemble, which musicologist Wolfgang Osthoff suggests is because the piece was first performed in a small, intimate chamber. These early mutes, known as Baroque mutes, were fashioned from wood and had a hole in the center to permit airflow. They raised the pitch by a semitone or more when inserted, which could be corrected by adding a piece of tubing of appropriate length, known as a crook. Besides musical use, Baroque mutes were used for secret military retreat, funerals, and practice.

The modern straight mute was in widespread use by 1897, being used on tubas in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Until the 20th century it was the only mute commonly used in orchestras, but new mutes were eventually invented to create novel, unique timbres, largely for the works of jazz composers. Jazz big band composer Sammy Nestico wrote that mutes can &quot;inject a much needed color change into an arrangement&quot;. A well-known example of brass mute usage is the &quot;voice&quot; of adults in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, which is actually the sound of a muted trombone.

=== Straight ===
The straight mute is roughly a truncated cone closed at the end facing outwards from the instrument, with three cork pads at the neck to allow sound to escape through the space between the bell and the mute. The mute acts as a high-pass filter. In trumpets, it lets through frequencies above about 1800 Hz, producing a shrill, piercing sound that can be penetrating at high volumes. Straight mutes made of materials like plastic or fiberglass are generally darker and less forceful in sound than their metal (usually aluminum) counterparts. The straight mute is among the few that can be played at a true &quot;forte&quot; dynamic.

The most commonly used brass mute in classical music, straight mutes for trumpet (and sometimes trombone) are also used in jazz. It is the only type of tuba mute regularly used and is available for all brass instruments. In classical music, when the mute type is not specified, it is assumed that the player should use a straight mute. Sammy Nestico wrote that straight mutes can &quot;shade and soften vocal backgrounds&quot;, but opined that they were &quot;a bit harsh&quot;.

The pixie mute is a thinner straight mute inserted further into the bell, and is most commonly used along with a plunger for special effects. The name is trademarked by the Humes &amp; Berg Company, but is widely used to refer to similar mutes from other makers.

=== Cup ===

The cup mute is similar to a straight mute, but includes an extra inverted cone on the end opening towards the bell of the instrument. Mostly used in jazz and on trumpet or trombone, it has a more subdued and darker tone than the straight mute. The cup mute in trumpets acts as a band-pass filter, permitting frequencies between 800 and 1200 Hz. The distance between the cup and the end of the bell is adjustable in some cup mutes: a &quot;half-closed&quot; mute permits more air to escape and thus more volume, while a &quot;fully-closed&quot; mute produces a quiet tone and is therefore mostly used soloistically.

Variants of the cup mute include the mic-a-mute and the buzz-wow mute. The mic-a-mute, so named because it is usually played close to a microphone, has a rubber rim on the cup and felt lining on the inside, creating a richer sound. The buzz-wow mute has resonators on the end which produce a buzzing effect, similar to a kazoo.

=== Harmon ===

The harmon mute, also known as the wa-wa, wow-wow, or wah-wah mute, is available for trumpet and trombone and is mainly used in jazz. Unlike the cup and straight mutes, it has a cork that completely blocks airflow around the mute. Instead, air must go into the harmon mute&#x27;s chamber and escape out a hole, which protrudes into the mute. A &quot;stem&quot; (a tube with a small cup) may be inserted into the mute, which changes the instrument&#x27;s sound and path of airflow. The mute is made of metal (usually aluminum or copper) and has a cylindrical or bulbous shape; mutes of the latter type are sometimes called &quot;bubble mutes&quot;.

Depending on the stem&#x27;s presence and position, the mute has a variety of sounds. In trumpets, the mute without a stem (&quot;stem out&quot;) acts as a band-pass filter permitting frequencies between 1500 and 2000 Hz, making a subdued, distant sound. Playing with the stem fully inserted (&quot;stem in&quot;) produces a unique, penetrating sound, while playing with the stem halfway out (&quot;half-stem&quot;) has characteristics of both &quot;stem in&quot; and &quot;stem out&quot; playing. Players can also move their hand in front of the mute to produce a &quot;wa-wa&quot; effect by alternately closing and opening the bell.

An early version of the harmon mute was patented by John F. Stratton in 1865, and the mute in its modern form was patented in 1925 by George Schluesselburg. The name derives from Patrick T. &quot;Paddy&quot; Harmon, who financed Schluesselburg and was assigned half of the interest of Schluesselburg&#x27;s patent. Harmon&#x27;s interest in the mute came from his hiring black jazz bands—whose trumpeters sometimes used a predecessor of the mute—to play at his Arcadia and Dreamland ballrooms in Chicago. The harmon mute was originally always played with stem inserted. In 1946, jazz trumpeter Miles Davis pioneered the usage of the mute with stem removed, which became part of his trademark sound. Some trumpeters believe that dents on the mute&#x27;s chamber improve sound and intonation. An acoustical study at the University of Puget Sound found that large dents led to a &quot;weaker&quot; tone and a degradation in tone quality, while small dents could improve tone and amplify the sound.

=== Stopping ===

French horn players can use standard mutes, but often use their hand to mute the sound, a technique known as &quot;stopping&quot;. By inserting their hand fully into the instrument, airflow is limited, producing a quiet and nasal sound. The shortening of the air column raises the pitch by approximately one semitone, so the player must adjust by playing a semitone lower. The technique was developed and popularized by Anton Joseph Hampel in the mid-18th century. He also invented physical stop mutes for the French horn, which now come in both transposing and non-transposing variants; the latter does not require the player to change their fingerings as they would when hand-stopping.

=== Other ===
==== Solotone ====
The solotone mute consists of two telescoping cones and a small tube in the center, all made of cardboard. It is structurally similar to a harmon mute, but has a cardboard tube in the middle. It has a more intense sound than the harmon mute and has a characteristic &quot;megaphone-like&quot; quality. Other names for the mute include the Cleartone mute, &quot;doppio sordino&quot;, double mute, and Mega mute. An example of the mute&#x27;s use in classical music is in Béla Bartók&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2, composed in 1937–1938.

==== Bucket ====

The bucket mute, also known as the velvetone or velvet-tone, resembles a bucket attached to the outside of the bell. The mute is filled with absorbent material which dampens the sound, resulting in a &quot;covered&quot; sound similar to that of a French horn. The mute can be clipped to the rim of the bell, but a model manufactured by Jo-Ral Mutes is instead inserted into the bell. Originating with early jazz trumpeters who held empty lard cans in front of their instruments, the first bucket mute was made by William McArthur in 1922.

==== Plunger ====

The plunger is held in front of the bell. It can be held stationary, which produces a dull tone, but can also be moved, producing various sound effects. Skillful usage can produce speech-like sounds, and short, loud notes while holding the plunger close to the bell produce &quot;exploding&quot; tones. The plunger is often used in conjunction with growling or with a straight mute (or both). Trumpeters and trombonists typically use the head of a sink plunger and toilet plunger respectively, but metal plunger mutes are also produced commercially. If a household plunger is used, some players recommend drilling a hole in the middle of it to adjust the sound, though this practice is controversial.

==== Derby (hat) ====
The derby or hat is a bowler hat or similarly shaped object held in front of the bell, like the plunger. Alternatively, it can be attached to a player&#x27;s music stand and the trumpet pointed into it. Its larger depth means that it does not distort the trumpet&#x27;s sound, but does reduce its volume. A similar effect can also be achieved with a piece of felt or thick cloth that covers the bell.

==== Whispa and practice mutes ====
The softest mute intended for musical use, the whispa or whisper mute traps sound in a chamber filled with absorbent material, and only a small amount is allowed to escape through small holes on the chamber. The mute is difficult to play, especially in the upper register. Practice mutes, available for most brass instruments, can be used during practice to prevent bothering others; whispa mutes can also be used as practice mutes. Electronic systems also exist that allow players to hear themselves through earphones.

== Woodwinds ==

Mutes are not very effective on woodwind instruments because the proportion of sound emitted from the bell varies, meaning the degree of muting changes with the fingering. Furthermore, blocking the open end of a woodwind prevents the lowest note from being played. Mutes have very occasionally been used, however, for the oboe, saxophone, bassoon, and clarinet.

Early oboe mutes were inserted into the bell and made of cotton wool, paper, sponge or hardwood. They softened and gave a veiled quality to the lower notes of the instrument. Muting the oboe and bassoon is now done by stuffing a cloth, handkerchief or disk of sound-absorbing material into the bell. In saxophones, muting can be done with a cloth or handkerchief, or a velvet-covered ring inserted into the bell; the ringed mute causes the lower notes of the instruments to play flat.

== Strings ==
=== Violin family ===

Mutes for string instruments of the violin family work by adding mass to the bridge, or occasionally by dampening the strings behind the bridge. Made of wood, metal, rubber, plastic, or leather, they result in a darker, less brilliant sound because they dampen high-frequency vibrations in the bridge and shift its resonances to lower frequencies. This type of mute was introduced in the 17th century. They are used in performance, to change the tone of the instrument, or during practice, to minimize disturbing others by reducing volume considerably. Practice mutes are generally heavier than performance mutes.

These devices vary widely in their construction, use, and effects on tone. The Heifetz mute, invented by Henryk Kaston and violinist Jascha Heifetz and patented in 1949, allows for adjusting the degree of muting. Placed onto the top of the bridge, it stays on by friction, and may be slid up and down to vary the dampening effect. Some mutes attached to the bridge can be engaged or removed quickly, which is called for in certain modern orchestral works. For example, the popular Tourte and Finissima mutes can be slid along the strings on and off the bridge. The Bech magnetic mute system, with a magnet to secure the mute to the tailpiece when not in use to prevent rattling, is another such mute. There are also wire mutes that can press the strings on the tailpiece side of the bridge, leading to a lessened muting effect.

Practice mutes can be used to heavily dampen stringed instruments to make practicing them in hotels or apartments less intrusive. Metal practice mutes, which are often coated in rubber, have a larger effect than rubber mutes. A practice mute limits the player&#x27;s ability to hear the effect of the techniques they are working on, so players are advised to spend some practice time without the mute.

==== Wolf eliminator ====
The wolf tone is an undesirable resonance that occurs in string instruments, particularly the cello. A specialized cylindrical metal piece, known as a wolf tone eliminator, can be attached between the bridge and tailpiece of the instrument to adjust the strength and pitch of the problem resonance. Placing a rubber mute similarly can also suppress the wolf tone.

=== Fretted ===

A common technique in rock, metal, funk, and disco music, palm muting a guitar or bass guitar involves placing the side of the hand on the strings. In classical music, this technique is sometimes known as &quot;pizzicato effleuré&quot;. It reduces the strings&#x27; resonance and makes a &quot;dry, chunky sound&quot;. Guitars and bass guitars can also have built-in or makeshift dampening devices to simulate the effect of palm muting. The Fender Jaguar guitar, for example, has a spring-loaded strip of foam that presses against the strings when enabled. Some guitars have an individual piece of foam for each string.

== Percussion ==
Snare drums can be muted with a piece of cloth laid on top, or placed between the snares and the lower membrane. Undesirable ringing overtones can be suppressed by placing a variety of objects on the drumhead, including wallets, self-adhesive pieces of gel, and a circular piece of plastic with the same size as the head. Struck idiophones (e.g. xylophones) can be muted with the hand or a device, which results in short tones lacking resonance; cowbells can be muted by placing a cloth inside them. Maracas and similar shaken idiophones can be muted by holding their chamber instead of their handle.

Some percussion instruments, such as the triangle, timpani, and suspended cymbal, are intended to be muted or dampened by hand. A triangle can also be dampened by placing it inside a sack and striking it from outside. Muting a timpani can be done with a handkerchief, cloth, or piece of felt; the muting device can also be struck directly.

=== Piano ===

The soft pedal, or una corda pedal, decreases the volume of a piano. In grand pianos, this is done by shifting the hammers so that each hammer misses one of the multiple strings used for each note; in uprights, the soft pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings, making a softer impact.

The middle pedal on most pianos is a sostenuto pedal, which does not perform a muting function. On some pianos, however, the middle pedal is a &quot;practice pedal&quot;, which lowers a piece of felt between the hammers and strings, muffling the sound. The main pedal still has an effect, as the felt is not pressed against the strings except when the hammer strikes. Even quieter than the soft pedal, the practice pedal is intended to be used to prevent bothering others during practice.

<text>Uri Geller ( ; ; born 20 December 1946) is an Israeli-British illusionist, magician, television personality, and self-proclaimed psychic. He is known for his trademark television performances of spoon bending and other illusions. Geller uses conjuring tricks to simulate the effects of psychokinesis and telepathy. Geller&#x27;s career as an entertainer has spanned more than four decades, with television shows and appearances in many countries. Magicians have called Geller a fraud because of his claims of possessing psychic powers.

==Early life==
Geller was born on 20 December 1946 in Tel Aviv, which was then part of the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel). His mother and father were of Austrian-Jewish and Hungarian-Jewish background respectively. Geller is the son of Itzhaak Geller (Gellér Izsák), a retired army sergeant major, and Margaret &quot;Manzy&quot; Freud (Freud Manci). Geller claims that he is a distant relative of Sigmund Freud on his mother&#x27;s side.

At the age of 11 Geller moved with his family to Nicosia in what was then British-ruled Cyprus, where he attended high school, the Terra Santa College, and learned English. At the age of 18 he joined the Israeli Army&#x27;s Paratroopers Brigade, with which he served in the 1967 Six-Day War, and was wounded in action. He worked as a photographic model in 1968 and 1969, during which time he began to perform for small audiences as a nightclub entertainer, becoming well known in Israel.

Geller first started to perform in theatres, public halls, auditoriums, military bases and universities in Israel. The parapsychologist Andrija Puharich met Geller in 1971 and assisted him in travelling to the United States.

==Television and film career==
Geller became famous demonstrating on television what he claimed to be psychokinesis, dowsing and telepathy. His performance included spoon bending, describing hidden drawings and making watches stop or run faster. Geller said he performed those feats through willpower and the strength of his mind. His apparent ability to bend metal objects during his television appearances came to be known as the &quot;Geller effect&quot; and made him a celebrity. The work of magician and investigator James Randi was the main factor in revealing that Geller&#x27;s actual methods were stage magic tricks.

In 1973, Geller appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, an appearance recounted in both Randi&#x27;s book &quot;The Truth About Uri Geller&quot; and in the &quot;Nova&quot; documentary episode &quot;Secrets of the Psychics&quot; hosted by Randi on PBS.
In the documentary, Randi says that &quot;Johnny had been a magician himself and was skeptical&quot; of Geller&#x27;s claimed paranormal powers, so prior to the date of taping, Randi was asked &quot;to help prevent any trickery&quot;; accordingly, the show&#x27;s staff prepared its own props without informing Geller and did not let Geller or his staff &quot;anywhere near them&quot;. When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said, &quot;This scares me&quot;, and, &quot;As you know, I told your people what to bring&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me&quot;. Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel strong&quot;, and expressed his displeasure at feeling he was being &quot;pressed&quot; to perform by Carson. According to Adam Higginbotham:

This appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller&#x27;s claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham,

By the mid-1980s, Geller was described as &quot;a millionaire several times over&quot; and claimed to be performing mineral-dowsing services for mining groups at a standard fee of £1 million. In June 1986, the &quot;Australian Skeptic&quot; reported that Geller had been paid $250,000 and granted an option of 1,250,000 Zanex shares at $0.20 each until 5 June 1987. However &quot;no diamonds had come from the site identified by Geller.&quot;

British television presenter Noel Edmonds often used hidden cameras to record celebrities in &quot;Candid Camera&quot;–like situations for his television programme, &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;. In 1996 Edmonds planned a stunt in which shelves would fall from the walls of a room while Geller was in it. The cameras recorded footage of Geller from angles he was not expecting and they showed Geller grasping a spoon firmly with both hands as he stood up to display a bend in it.

Geller starred in the horror film &quot;Sanitarium&quot; (2001), directed by Johannes Roberts and James Eaves. In May 2002 he appeared as a contestant on the first series of the reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, where he was the first to be eliminated and finished in last place. In 2005, Geller starred in &quot;Uri&#x27;s Haunted Cities: Venice&quot;, a XI Pictures/Lion TV production for Sky One, which led to a behind-the-scenes release in early 2008 called &quot;Cursed&quot;; both productions were directed by Jason Figgis. In early 2007, Geller hosted a reality show in Israel called &quot;The Successor&quot; (), where the contestants supposedly displayed supernatural powers; Israeli magicians criticised the program, saying that it was all magic tricks. Geller said he welcomed the &quot;mystical aura&quot; that the publicity gave him. In July 2007, NBC signed Geller and Criss Angel for &quot;Phenomenon&quot;, to search for the next great mentalist; contestant Mike Super won the position. In January 2008, Geller began hosting the TV show &quot;The Next Uri Geller&quot;, broadcast by Pro7 in Germany.

In February 2008, Geller stated in the TV show &quot;The Next Uri Geller&quot; (a German version of &quot;The Successor&quot;) that he did not have any supernatural powers, before winking to the camera.
He also appeared on the Dutch television program &quot;De Nieuwe Uri Geller&quot;, which shares a similar TV format to its German counterpart. The goal of the programme was to find the best mentalist in the Netherlands. In March 2008, he started the same show in Hungary (&quot;A kiválasztott&quot; in Hungarian). During the show, Geller speaks in both Hungarian and English. Geller also performs his standard routines of making stopped watches start, spoons jump from televisions, and tables move. Geller co-produced the TV show &quot;Book of Knowledge&quot;, released in April 2008. In October 2009, a similar show, called &quot;The Successor of Uri Geller&quot;, aired on Greek television.

In 2013, a BBC documentary, &quot;The Secret Life of Uri Geller – Psychic Spy?&quot;, featured Uri Geller, Benjamin Netanyahu, Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Green, Paul H. Smith, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ. The documentary claimed Geller became a &quot;psychic spy&quot; for the CIA, was recruited by Mossad, and worked as an &quot;official secret agent&quot; in Mexico, being a frequent guest of President José López Portillo. In the film, Geller claims to have erased floppy discs carried by KGB agents by repeatedly chanting the word &quot;erase&quot;.

==Paranormal claims==
Geller has claimed his feats are the result of paranormal powers given to him by extraterrestrials. The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) was a prominent early critic of Geller. Skeptics such as James Randi have shown that Geller&#x27;s tricks can be replicated with stage magic techniques.

Andrija Puharich met Geller in 1971 and endorsed him as a genuine psychic. Under hypnosis, Geller claimed he was sent to Earth by extraterrestrials from a spaceship 53,000 light years away. Geller later denied the space fantasy claims, but affirmed there &quot;is a slight possibility that some of my energies do have extraterrestrial connection.&quot; Puharich also stated that Geller teleported a dog through the walls of his house. Science writer Martin Gardner wrote that since &quot;no expert on fraud was there as an observer” nobody should take the claim seriously.

In his biography of Geller, &quot;Uri: A Journal of the Mystery of Uri Geller&quot; (1974), Puharich claimed that with Geller he had communicated with super-intelligent computers from outer space. According to Puharich the computers sent messages to warn humanity that a disaster was likely to occur if humans did not change their ways. The psychologist Christopher Evans, who reviewed the book in &quot;New Scientist&quot;, wrote that although Puharich believed every word he had written the book was credulous and &quot;those fans of Geller&#x27;s who might have hoped to have used the book as ammunition to impress the sceptics [...] will be the most disappointed of all.&quot; James Randi has written that the biography contained &quot;silly theories,&quot; but was &quot;both a boost and a millstone to Geller.&quot;

In 1992, Geller was asked to investigate the kidnapping of Hungarian model Helga Farkas. He predicted she would be found in good health but she was never found and is widely believed to have been murdered. Geller was a friend of Bruce Bursford and helped him &quot;train his mind&quot; during some cycling speed-record-breaking bids in the 1990s.

In 1997, Geller was involved with Second Division football club Exeter City by placing ‘energy-infused’ crystals behind the goals at Exeter&#x27;s ground to help the club win a crucial end-of-season game. (Exeter lost the game 5–1.) He was appointed co-chairman of the club in 2002. The club was relegated to the Football Conference in May 2003, where it remained for five years. He has since severed ties with the club. He had also been involved with Reading F.C. and claimed in 2002 that he had helped them to avoid relegation by getting the club&#x27;s supporters to look into his eyes and say &quot;win, Reading, win&quot;. Reading manager, Alan Pardew, dismissed Geller&#x27;s role in the club&#x27;s survival – which was achieved thanks to a draw in the critical match – stating &quot;as soon as we get a bit of joy, thanks to all the hard work and efforts of my staff and players, he suddenly comes out of the blue and tries to claim the limelight.&quot;

In a 2008 interview, Geller told &quot;Telepolis&quot;, &quot;I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, to the best of my recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t have powers. It means that I don&#x27;t say ‘it&#x27;s supernatural’, I say &#x27;I&#x27;m a mystifier!&#x27; That&#x27;s what I said. And the sceptics turned it around and said, ‘Uri Geller said he&#x27;s a magician!&#x27; I never said that.&quot; In that interview Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts he tells children to &quot;forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!&quot;

In March 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Geller wrote an open letter to the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, stating that he would telepathically prevent her from leading Britain out of the European Union. In Geller&#x27;s words, &quot;As much as I admire you, I will stop you telepathically from doing this – and believe me I am capable of executing it.&quot; The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31st January 2020 under the leadership of May&#x27;s successor, Boris Johnson.

===Stage magic parallels===
Many scientists, magicians, and skeptics have suggested possible ways in which Geller could have tricked his audience by using misdirection while bending objects such as keys and spoons manually.
There are many ways in which a bent spoon can be presented to an audience so as to give the appearance it was manipulated using supernatural powers. One way is through brief moments of distraction in which a magician can physically bend a spoon or other object unseen by the audience, before gradually revealing the bend to create the illusion that the spoon is bending before the viewers&#x27; eyes. Another way is to pre-bend the spoon, reducing the amount of force that needs to be applied to bend it again.
Critics have accused Geller of using his demonstrations fraudulently outside the entertainment business. James Randi, one of Geller&#x27;s most prominent critics, wrote &quot;The Truth About Uri Geller&quot; explaining how Geller&#x27;s various alleged supernatural abilities, such as spoon bending and telekinesis, can be easily reproduced by any magician using sleight of hand.

In the early 1970s, an article in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that a court had ordered Geller to refund a customer&#x27;s ticket price and pay court costs after finding that he had committed fraud by claiming that his feats were telepathic.
A 1974 article in &quot;Haolam Hazeh&quot; alleged that Geller&#x27;s manager Shipi Shtrang and Shipi&#x27;s sister Hannah Shtrang secretly helped in Geller&#x27;s performances.
In Geller&#x27;s first autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, he acknowledged that, in his early career, his manager talked him into adding a magic trick to make his performances last longer. This trick involved Geller appearing to guess audience members&#x27; car registration numbers, when his manager had given them to him ahead of time.
Yasha Katz, who had been Geller&#x27;s manager in Britain, said in 1978 that all performances by Geller were simply stage tricks and he explained how they were really done.

Geller&#x27;s spoon-bending feats are discussed in &quot;The Geller Papers&quot; (1976), edited by Charles Panati. There was controversy when it was published. Several prominent magicians came forward to demonstrate that Geller&#x27;s psychic feats could be duplicated by stage magic. Martin Gardner wrote that Panati had been fooled by Geller&#x27;s trickery and &quot;The Geller Papers&quot; were an &quot;embarrassing anthology&quot;.

During telepathic drawing demonstrations, Geller claimed the ability to read the minds of subjects as they drew a picture. Although in these demonstrations he cannot see the picture being drawn, he is sometimes present in the room, and on these occasions can see the subjects as they draw. Critics argue this may allow Geller to infer common shapes from pencil movement and sound, with the power of suggestion doing the rest.

Geller admits, &quot;Sure, there are magicians who can duplicate [my performances] through trickery.&quot; He has claimed that even though his spoon bending can be repeated using trickery, he uses psychic powers to achieve his results.
Physicist Richard Feynman, who was an amateur magician, wrote in &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; (1985) that Geller was unable to bend a key for him and his son. Randi has stated that if Geller is truly using his mind to perform these feats, &quot;He is doing it the hard way.&quot;

In November 2008, Geller accepted an award during a convention of magicians, the &quot;Services to Promotion of Magic Award&quot; from the Berglas Foundation. In his acceptance speech, Geller said that if he had not had psychic powers then he &quot;must be the greatest&quot; to have been able to fool journalists, scientists, and Berglas himself. In October 2012, Geller gave a lecture for magicians in the United States at the Genii Magazine 75th Birthday Bash.

===Scientific testing===

Geller&#x27;s performances of drawing duplication and cutlery bending usually take place under informal conditions such as television interviews. During his early career, he allowed some scientists to investigate his claims.
When Geller&#x27;s supposed abilities were tested by the US Central Intelligence Agency in 1973, the experimenters concluded that Geller had &quot;demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner&quot;.

A study was commissioned by the United States Defense Intelligence Agency as part of the Stargate Project and conducted during August 1973 at Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International) by parapsychologists Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ. Geller was isolated and asked to reproduce simple drawings prepared in another room. Writing about the same study in a 1974 article published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, they concluded that he had performed successfully enough to warrant further serious study.

In &quot;An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural&quot;, Randi wrote, &quot;Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ, who studied Mr. Geller at the Stanford Research Institute, were aware, in one instance at least, that they were being shown a magician&#x27;s trick by Geller [...] Their protocols for this &#x27;serious&#x27; investigation of the powers claimed by Geller were described by Ray Hyman, who investigated the project on behalf of the Department of Defense&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency, as &#x27;sloppy and inadequate. Critics have pointed out that both Puthoff and Targ were already believers in paranormal powers and Geller was not adequately searched before the experiments. The psychologist C. E. M. Hansel and skeptic Paul Kurtz have noted that the experiments were poorly designed and open to trickery.

Critics of the experiments include psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann, who published a description of how Geller could have cheated in an informal test of his so-called psychic powers in 1977. Their 1978 article in &quot;Nature&quot; and 1980 book &quot;The Psychology of the Psychic&quot; (2nd ed. 2000) described how a normal explanation was possible for Geller&#x27;s alleged psychic powers. Marks and Kammann found evidence that while at SRI, Geller was allowed to peek through a hole in the laboratory wall separating him from the drawings he was being invited to reproduce. These drawings were placed on a wall opposite the peephole which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom, enabling him to listen to the investigators&#x27; conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings. These basic errors indicate the great importance of ensuring that psychologists, magicians, or other people with an in-depth knowledge of perception, who are trained in methods for blocking sensory cues, be present during the testing of psychics. Marks, after evaluating the experiments, wrote that none of Geller&#x27;s paranormal claims had been demonstrated in scientifically controlled conditions, concluding that &quot;Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever. However, I believe him to be a very clever, well-practiced magician.&quot;
Marks and Kammann tested Geller&#x27;s ability to mentally repair watches and found that &quot;many supposedly broken watches had merely been stopped by gummy oil and simply holding them in the hand would warm the oil enough to soften it and allow watches to resume ticking.&quot;

==Litigation==
Geller has litigated or threatened legal action against some of his critics with mixed results. These included libel allegations against James Randi and illusionist Gérard Majax.

In 1971, mechanical engineering student Uri Goldstein attended one of Geller&#x27;s shows, and subsequently sued the show&#x27;s promoters for breach of contract. He complained that Geller had promised a demonstration of several psychic powers but had delivered only sleight-of-hand and stage tricks. The case came before the civil court in Beersheba. Geller was not present as the summons had been sent to the office of the promoter Miki Peled, who had ignored it as being trivial. Goldstein was awarded IL27.5 (around $5) for breach of contract. Later, Goldstein admitted that he went to the show specifically with the intention of suing to get his money back, and he had already found a lawyer to represent him prior to attending the performance.

In a 1989 interview with a Japanese newspaper, James Randi was quoted as saying that Geller had driven a scientist to &quot;shoot himself in the head&quot; after finding out that Geller had fooled him. Randi afterwards claimed it was a metaphor lost in translation. The story was also repeated in a Canadian newspaper, which quoted Randi as saying essentially the same thing: &quot;One scientist, a metallurgist, wrote a paper backing Geller&#x27;s claims that he could bend metal. The scientist shot himself after I showed him how the key bending trick was done.&quot; In 1990, Geller sued Randi in a Japanese court over the statements published in the Japanese newspaper. Randi claims that he could not afford to defend himself; therefore, he lost the case by default. The court declared Randi&#x27;s statement an &quot;insult&quot; as opposed to libel, and awarded a token judgement against him, paying Geller only &quot;one-third of one-percent of what he&#x27;d demanded&quot;. Since the charge of &quot;insult&quot; is only recognized in Chinese and Japanese law, Randi was not required to pay. Later in 1995, Geller agreed not to pursue payment of the Japanese fine. Randi maintained that he had never paid anything to Geller.
In 1992, Geller filed a $15 million suit against Randi and CSICOP for statements made in an &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; interview on 9 April 1991, but he was unsuccessful because the statute of limitations had expired. In 1994, Geller asked to dismiss without prejudice, and he was ordered to pay $50,000 for the publisher&#x27;s attorney fees. After not paying in time, Geller was sanctioned with an additional $20,000. Due to the sanction, the suit was dismissed with prejudice, which, according to Randi&#x27;s attorneys, means that Geller cannot pursue the same suit in any other jurisdiction. In 1995, Geller and Randi announced that this settled &quot;the last remaining suits&quot; between him and the CSICOP. As part of the settlement, Geller agreed not to pursue the payment of the 1990 Japanese ruling, in exchange for Prometheus Books inserting an errata on all future editions of &quot;Physics and Psychics&quot;, correcting erroneous statements made about him.

In 1991, Geller sued Timex Corporation and the advertising firm Fallon McElligott for millions in &quot;Geller v. Fallon McElligott&quot; over an ad showing a person bending forks and other items, but failing to stop a Timex watch. Geller was sanctioned $149,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit.

In 1998, the Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC) in the United Kingdom rejected a complaint made by Geller, (the BSC) saying that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t unfair to have magicians showing how they duplicate those &#x27;psychic feats&#x27;&quot; on the UK &quot;Equinox&quot; episode &quot;Secrets of the Super Psychics&quot;.

In 1999, Geller considered a suit against IKEA over a furniture line featuring bent legs that was called the &quot;Uri&quot; line.

===Copyright claims===
In November 2000, Geller sued video game company Nintendo for £60 million over the Pokémon species &quot;&quot;, localized in English as &quot;Kadabra&quot;, which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity. The Pokémon in question has psychic abilities and carries a spoon. Geller also claimed that the star on Kadabra&#x27;s forehead and the lightning patterns on its abdomen are symbolisms popular with the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany. The katakana for the character&#x27;s name, ユンゲラー, is visually similar to the transliteration of Geller&#x27;s own name into Japanese (ユリゲラー). He is quoted as saying: &quot;Nintendo turned me into an evil, occult Pokémon character. Nintendo stole my identity by using my name and my signature image.&quot; Pokémon anime director and storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka confirmed in an interview that Kadabra would not be used on a Pokémon Trading Card until an agreement was reached on the case. In November 2020, Geller issued an apology and agreed to allow cards depicting Kadabra to be printed.
In 2007, Geller issued a DMCA notice to YouTube to remove a video uploaded by Brian Sapient of the &quot;Rational Response Squad&quot; which was excerpted from an episode of the &quot;Nova&quot; television series titled &quot;Secrets of the Psychics&quot;. The video included footage of Geller failing to perform. In response, Sapient contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation, issued a DMCA counter-notice, and sued Geller for misuse of the DMCA. Geller&#x27;s company, Explorologist, filed a counter-suit. Both cases were settled out of court; a monetary settlement was paid (but it is not clear whether Sapient paid Geller or vice versa) and the eight seconds of footage owned by Explorologist were licensed under a noncommercial Creative Commons license.

==Personal life==
Geller married wife Hanna Geller in 1979.
Michael Jackson was best man when Geller renewed his wedding vows in 2001. Geller also negotiated the TV interview between Jackson with the journalist Martin Bashir, &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot;. Later, however, Jackson reportedly kept an &quot;enemy list&quot; on which Geller appeared, along with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, attorney Gloria Allred, music executive Tommy Mottola, DA Tom Sneddon, and Janet Arvizo, mother of a Jackson accuser.
Following Jackson&#x27;s death, ITV broadcast an interview with Geller about his association with Jackson, titled &quot;My Friend Michael Jackson: Uri&#x27;s Story&quot;, in July 2009.

On 11 February 2009, Geller purchased the uninhabited 100-metre-by-50-metre Lamb Island off the eastern coast of Scotland, previously known for its witch trials, and beaches that Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have described in his novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Geller claims that buried on the island is Egyptian treasure, brought there by Scota, the mythological half-sister of Tutankhamen in Irish mythology, 3,500 years ago. He claimed that he will find the treasure through dowsing. Geller also claimed to have strengthened the mystical powers of the island by burying there a crystal orb once belonging to Albert Einstein. In 2022, Geller sought to declare Lamb as Republic of Lamb, a micronation.

In 2014, a 12-foot-tall statue of a gorilla made from approximately 40,000 metal spoons was unveiled in Geller&#x27;s Berkshire garden by the Duke of Kent, with the intention of possibly relocating it to Great Ormond Street Hospital. The statue was welded by sculptor Alfie Bradley, and funded by the British Ironworks Centre of Oswestry. According to Bradley, many of the spoons were donated by schoolchildren from around the world. Speaking at the unveiling, Geller said &quot;This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children.&quot;

Geller has lived in Tel Aviv in Israel since 2015. He previously lived in the village of Sonning-on-Thames, Berkshire, in England. He is trilingual, speaking fluent Hebrew, Hungarian and English. In an appearance on Esther Rantzen&#x27;s 1996 television talk show &quot;Esther&quot;, Geller declared that he had suffered from anorexia nervosa and bulimia for several years. He has written 16 fiction and non-fiction books.

Geller is president of International Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that lobbied the International Committee of the Red Cross to recognise Magen David Adom (&quot;Red Star of David&quot;) as a humanitarian relief organisation.

In 2021 Geller opened the Uri Geller Museum located at 7 Mazal Arieh Street in Old Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The museum exhibits the personal collection of art and objects that Geller has collected throughout his career. It also features an archaeological display of the ancient soap factory that was discovered during the museum&#x27;s renovation.

<text>The Foundling Hospital (formally the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children) was a children&#x27;s home in London, England, founded in 1739 by the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram. It was established for the &quot;education and maintenance of exposed and deserted young children.&quot; The word &quot;hospital&quot; was used in a more general sense than it is in the 21st century, simply indicating the institution&#x27;s &quot;hospitality&quot; to those less fortunate. Nevertheless, one of the top priorities of the committee at the Foundling Hospital was children&#x27;s health, as they combated smallpox, fevers, consumption, dysentery and even infections from everyday activities like teething that drove up mortality rates and risked epidemics. With their energies focused on maintaining a disinfected environment, providing simple clothing and fare, the committee paid less attention to and spent less on developing children&#x27;s education. As a result, financial problems would hound the institution for years to come, despite the growing &quot;fashionableness&quot; of charities like the hospital.

==Early history==
===Foundation===

Thomas Coram presented his first petition for the establishment of a Foundling Hospital to King George II in 1735. The petition was signed by 21 prominent women from aristocratic families, whose names not only lent respectability to his project, but made Coram&#x27;s cause &quot;one of the most fashionable charities of the day&quot;. Two further petitions, with male signatories from the nobility, professional classes, gentry, and judiciary, were presented in 1737. The founding royal charter, signed by King George II, was presented by Coram at a distinguished gathering at &#x27;Old&#x27; Somerset House to the Duke of Bedford in 1739. It contains the aims and rules of the hospital and the long list of founding governors and guardians: this includes 17 dukes, 29 earls, 6 viscounts, 20 barons, 20 baronets, 7 privy counsellors, the lord mayor and 8 aldermen of the City of London; and many more besides. The building was constructed between 1742 and 1752 by John Deval, the King&#x27;s Master Mason.

The first children were admitted to the Foundling Hospital on 25 March 1741, into a temporary house located in Hatton Garden. At first, no questions were asked about child or parent, but a note was made of any &#x27;particular writing, or other distinguishing mark or token&#x27; which might later be used to identify a child if reclaimed. These were often marked coins, trinkets, pieces of fabric or ribbon, playing cards, as well as verses and notes written on scraps of paper. On 16 December 1758, the hospital governors decided to provide receipts to anyone leaving a child making the identifying tokens unnecessary. Despite this, the admission records show that tokens continued to be left. Clothes were carefully recorded as another means to identify a claimed child. One entry in the record reads, &quot;Paper on the breast, clout on the head.&quot; The applications became too numerous, and a system of balloting with red, white and black balls was adopted. Records show that between 1 January 1750 and December 1755, 2523 children were brought for admission, but only 783 taken in. Private funding was insufficient to meet public demand. Between 1 June 1756 and 25 March 1760, and with financial support from Parliament, the hospital adopted a period of unrestricted entry. Admission rates soared to highs of 4,000 per year. By 1763 admission was by petition, requiring applicants to provide their name and circumstances. Children were seldom taken after they were 12 months old, except for war orphans.

On reception, children were sent to wet nurses in the countryside, where they stayed until they were about four or five years old. Due to the fact that many of these nurses lived outside of London it was necessary to involve a network of voluntary inspectors, who were the hospital&#x27;s representatives. Although the hospital governors had no specific plan for who these inspectors were, in practice it was often local clergy or gentry who performed this role.

At the age of 16, girls were generally apprenticed as servants for four years; at 14, boys were apprenticed into a variety of occupations, typically for seven years. There was a small benevolent fund for adults.

The London hospital was preceded by the Foundling Hospital, Dublin, founded 1704, and the Foundling Hospital, Cork, founded 1737, both funded by government.

===The new hospital ===
In September 1742, the stone of the new hospital was laid on land acquired from the Earl of Salisbury on Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Field in Bloomsbury, an undeveloped area lying north of Great Ormond Street and west of Gray&#x27;s Inn Lane. The hospital was designed by Theodore Jacobsen as a plain brick building with two wings and a chapel, built around an open courtyard. The western wing was finished in October 1745. An eastern wing was added in 1752 &quot;in order that the girls might be kept separate from the boys&quot;. The new Hospital was described as &quot;the most imposing single monument erected by eighteenth century benevolence&quot;.

In 1756, the House of Commons resolved that all children offered should be received, that local receiving places should be appointed all over the country, and that the funds should be publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two months to 12, and a flood of children poured in from country workhouses. In less than four years 14,934 children were presented, and a vile trade grew up among vagrants, who sometimes became known as &quot;Coram Men&quot;, of promising to carry children from the country to the hospital, an undertaking which they often did not perform or performed with great cruelty. Of these 15,000, only 4,400 survived to be apprenticed out. The total expense was about £500,000, which alarmed the House of Commons. After throwing out a bill which proposed to raise the necessary funds by fees from a general system of parochial registration, they came to the conclusion that the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued. The hospital, being thus thrown on its own resources, adopted a system of receiving children only with considerable sums (e.g., £100), which sometimes led to the children being reclaimed by the parent. This practice was finally stopped in 1801; and it henceforth became a fundamental rule that no money was to be received. The committee of inquiry had to be satisfied of the previous good character and present necessity of the mother, and that the father of the child had deserted both mother and child, and that the reception of the child would probably replace the mother in the course of virtue and in the way of an honest livelihood. At that time, illegitimacy carried deep stigma, especially for the mother but also for the child. All the children at the Foundling Hospital were those of unmarried women, and they were all first children of their mothers. The principle was in fact that laid down by Henry Fielding in &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot;: &quot;Too true I am afraid it is that many women have become abandoned and have sunk to the last degree of vice [i.e. prostitution] by being unable to retrieve the first slip.&quot;

There were some unfortunate incidents, such as the case of Elizabeth Brownrigg (1720–1767), a severely abusive Fetter Lane midwife who mercilessly whipped and otherwise maltreated her adolescent female apprentice domestic servants, leading to the death of one, Mary Clifford, from her injuries, neglect and infected wounds. After the Foundling Hospital authorities investigated, Brownrigg was convicted of murder and sentenced to hang at Tyburn. Thereafter, the Foundling Hospital instituted more thorough investigation of its prospective apprentice masters and mistresses.

==Music and art==

The Foundling Hospital grew to become a very fashionable charity, and it was supported by many noted figures of the day in high society and the arts. Its benefactors included a number of renowned artists, thanks to one of its most influential governors, the portrait painter and cartoonist William Hogarth.

===Art===
Hogarth, who was childless, had a long association with the hospital and was a founding governor. He designed the children&#x27;s uniforms and the coat of arms, and he and his wife Jane fostered foundling children. Hogarth also decided to set up a permanent art exhibition in the new buildings, encouraging other artists to produce work for the hospital. By creating a public attraction, Hogarth turned the Hospital into one of London&#x27;s most fashionable charities as visitors flocked to view works of art and make donations. At this time, art galleries were unknown in Britain, and Hogarth&#x27;s fundraising initiative is considered to have established Britain&#x27;s first ever public art gallery.

Several contemporary English artists adorned the walls of the hospital with their works, including Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, Richard Wilson and Francis Hayman. Hogarth himself painted a portrait of Thomas Coram for the hospital, and he also donated his &quot;Moses Brought Before Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. His painting &quot;March of the Guards to Finchley&quot; was also obtained by the hospital after Hogarth donated lottery tickets for a sale of his works, and the hospital won it. Another noteworthy piece is Roubiliac&#x27;s bust of Handel. The hospital also owned several paintings illustrating life in the institution by Emma Brownlow, daughter of the hospital&#x27;s administrator. In the chapel, the altarpiece was originally &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; by Casali, but this was deemed to look too Catholic by the hospital&#x27;s Anglican governors, and it was replaced by Benjamin West&#x27;s picture of Christ presenting a little child. William Hallett, cabinet maker to nobility, produced all the wood panelling with ornate carving, for the court room.

Exhibitions of pictures at the Foundling Hospital, which were organised by the Dilettante Society, led to the formation of the Royal Academy in 1768. The Foundling Hospital art collection can today be seen at the Foundling Museum.

===Music===

In May 1749, the composer George Frederic Handel held a benefit concert in the Hospital chapel to raise funds for the charity, performing his specially composed choral piece, the &quot;Foundling Hospital Anthem&quot;. The work included the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus from recently composed oratorio, &quot;Messiah&quot;, which had premiered in Dublin in 1742. On 1 May 1750 Handel directed a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; to mark the presentation of the organ to the chapel. That first performance was a great success and Handel was elected a Governor of the hospital on the following day. Handel subsequently put on an annual performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; there, which helped to popularise the piece among British audiences. He bequeathed to the hospital a fair copy (full score) of the work.

The musical service, which was originally sung by the blind children only, was made fashionable by the generosity of Handel. In 1774, Dr Charles Burney and a Signor Giardini made an unsuccessful attempt to form in connection with the hospital a public music school, in imitation of the Pio Ospedale della Pietà in Venice, Italy. In 1847, however, a successful juvenile band was started. The educational effects of music were found excellent, and the hospital supplied many musicians to the best army and navy bands.

==Relocation==
In the 1920s, the Hospital decided to move to a healthier location in the countryside. A proposal to turn the buildings over for university use fell through, and they were eventually sold to a property developer called James White in 1926. He hoped to transfer Covent Garden Market to the site, but the local residents successfully opposed that plan. In the end, the original Hospital building was demolished. The children were moved to Redhill, Surrey, where an old convent was used to lodge them, and then in 1935 to the new purpose-built Foundling Hospital in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. When, in the 1950s, British law moved away from institutionalisation of children toward more family-orientated solutions, such as adoption and foster care, the Foundling Hospital ceased most of its operations. The Berkhamsted buildings were sold to Hertfordshire County Council for use as a school (Ashlyns School) and the Foundling Hospital changed its name to the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children and currently uses the working name Coram.

==Today==

The Foundling Hospital still has a legacy on the original site. Seven acres (28,000 m2) of it were purchased for use as a playground for children with financial support from the newspaper proprietor Lord Rothermere. This area is now called Coram&#x27;s Fields and owned by an independent charity, Coram&#x27;s Fields and the Harmsworth Memorial Playground. The Foundling Hospital itself bought back 2.5 acres (10,000 m2) of land in 1937 and built a new headquarters and a children&#x27;s centre on the site. Although smaller, the building is in a similar style to the original Foundling Hospital and important aspects of the interior architecture were recreated there. It now houses the Foundling Museum, an independent charity, where the art collection can be seen. The original charity still exists as Coram, registered under the name Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. The surviving Foundling Hospital&#x27;s Archive covers the years 1739 to 1954. 23% of those records, covering the period of 1739 to 1899 have been digitised, transcribed and made available online (as of October 2024).

==In fiction==

In the 1840s Charles Dickens lived in Doughty Street, near the Foundling Hospital, and rented a pew in the chapel. The foundlings inspired characters in his novels including the apprentice Tattycoram in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, and Walter Wilding the foundling in &quot;No Thoroughfare&quot;. In &quot;Received a Blank Child&quot;, published in &quot;Household Words&quot; in March 1853, Dickens writes about two foundlings, numbers 20,563 and 20,564, the title referring to the words &quot;received a [blank] child&quot; on the form filled out when a foundling was accepted at the hospital.

The Foundling Hospital is the setting for Jamila Gavin&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;Coram Boy&quot;. The story recounts elements of the problems mentioned above, when &quot;Coram Men&quot; were preying on people desperate for their children.

It appears in three books by Jacqueline Wilson: &quot;Hetty Feather&quot;, &quot;Sapphire Battersea&quot; and &quot;Emerald Star&quot;. In the first story, &quot;Hetty Feather&quot;, Hetty has just arrived in the hospital, after her time with her foster family. This book tells us about her new life in the Foundling Hospital. In &quot;Sapphire Battersea&quot;, Hetty has just left the hospital and speaks ill of it. The Foundling Hospital is mentioned in &quot;Emerald Star&quot;, although it is mainly about Hetty growing up.

Published in 2020, Stacey Halls&#x27; &quot;The Foundling&quot; (or &quot;The Lost Orphan&quot; in the U.S.) sees the main character, Bess Bright, leave her illegitimate daughter Clara at London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital. The book was a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Best Seller.

<doc id="194865" wikidata="Q459118" url="?curid=194865" title="Marcos Pérez Jiménez">
<text>Marcos Evangelista Pérez Jiménez (25 April 1914 – 20 September 2001) was a Venezuelan military officer and the dictator of Venezuela from 1950 to 1958, ruling as member of the military junta from 1950 to 1952 and as president from 1952 to 1958. He took part in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état, becoming part of the ruling junta. He ran in the 1952 election. However, the junta cancelled the election when early results indicated that the opposition was ahead and declared Jiménez provisional president. He became president in 1953 and instituted a constitution that granted him dictatorial powers.

Under Pérez&#x27;s rule, the rise of oil prices facilitated many public works projects, including roads, bridges, government buildings and public housing, as well as the rapid development of industries such as hydroelectricity, mining and steel. The economy of Venezuela developed rapidly while Pérez was in power. On the other hand, Pérez presided over one of the most repressive governments in Venezuela. His government&#x27;s secret police, the &quot;Dirección de Seguridad Nacional&quot; (&quot;National Security Service&quot;), suppressed criticism and imprisoned those who opposed his rule.

Following massive public demonstrations in support of democratic reforms, Pérez was deposed in a coup perpetrated by disgruntled sectors within the Armed Forces of Venezuela on 23 January 1958. Pérez was then exiled to the Dominican Republic, later Miami, United States and afterwards went on to settle in Spain under the Franco regime&#x27;s protection.

==Early life, education and early career==
Marcos Evangelista Pérez Jiménez was born in Michelena, Táchira State. His father, Juan Pérez Bustamante, was a farmer; his mother, Adela Jiménez, a schoolteacher from Cucuta, Colombia. Pérez Jiménez attended school in his home town and in Colombia, and in 1934, he graduated from the Military academy of Venezuela, at the top of his class. He subsequently studied at Chorrillos Military School in Peru.

In 1945, Pérez Jiménez participated in a coup that helped install the founder of the Democratic Action, Rómulo Betancourt, as President of the Revolutionary Government Junta. The government would later become known as El Trienio Adeco. After a constitutional change providing universal suffrage, elections were held in 1947 that resulted in the election of a party member, Rómulo Gallegos.

==1948 coup d&#x27;état==

Fears of cuts in pay for soldiers and a lack of modernized army equipment led Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Delgado Chalbaud to stage another coup in 1948. Betancourt and Gallegos were exiled, political parties were suppressed and the Communist Party was once again banished by the military junta headed by Delgado Chalbaud, Luis Felipe Llovera Páez and Pérez Jiménez.

After a clumsily arranged kidnapping that ended in the murder of Delgado Chalbaud, the Military Junta changed its name to a Government Junta and reorganized itself with Pérez Jiménez pulling the strings of puppet president, Germán Suárez Flamerich.

==Presidency==
The junta called an election for 1952 in order to elect a Constituent Assembly that would elect a president and draft a new constitution. When early results showed that the opposition was well on its way to victory, the junta halted the count. On 2 December 1952, it released &quot;final&quot; results that showed the pro-junta &quot;Independent Electoral Front&quot; (FEI) winning a majority of assembly seats. On the same day, the junta dissolved itself and turned over power to the military, who then made Pérez provisional president. The Constitutional Assembly, comprising only FEI delegates after an opposition boycott, formally elected him president on 19 April 1953. Soon afterward, it enacted a constitution that gave the president virtually unlimited powers to take measures he deemed necessary to protect national security, peace and order. For all intents and purposes, it transformed Pérez Jiménez&#x27; presidency into a legal dictatorship.

Pérez Jiménez (widely known as &quot;P.J.&quot;) changed the name of the country, which had been &quot;United States of Venezuela&quot; since 1864, to the &quot;Republic of Venezuela&quot;. This name remained until 1999, when it was changed to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by a constitutional referendum. ()

During his government, Pérez Jiménez undertook many infrastructure projects, including construction of roads, bridges, government buildings, large public housing complexes and the symbolic Humboldt Hotel &amp; Tramway overlooking Caracas. The economy of Venezuela developed rapidly during his term.

The price for this development was high, however. Pérez was not tolerant of criticism, and his government ruthlessly pursued and suppressed the opposition. Opponents of his regime were painted as communists and often treated brutally and tortured.

Pérez Jiménez&#x27;s government pursued a policy of forced assimilation of Indigenous peoples in Venezuela and the elimination of indigenous culture, with the help of Catholic missionaries. The government adopted the Pátzcuaro Convention, which established the pro-forced assimilationist Inter-American Indian Institute, for the purpose of collaborating with Latin American governments to help force the assimilation of indigenous peoples in the nations of the region.

On 12 November 1954, Pérez was awarded the Legion of Merit by the government of the United States. Foreign capital and immigration were also highly promoted during his presidency, especially from European communities such as those of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese origin. Perez also pushed for vast and ambitious infrastructure programs, based on the policy of reinforced concrete, with construction of buildings, large and modern highways, which linked and renewed ties between states and other major works which greatly modernized the country.

Pérez Jiménez was up for reelection in 1957. By this time, the opposition had been so cowed that Pérez Jiménez could not possibly have been defeated. However, he dispensed with even those formalities. Instead, he held a plebiscite in which voters could only choose between voting &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to another term for the president. Predictably, Pérez Jiménez won by a large margin, though by all accounts the count was blatantly rigged.

==Cabinet (1952–1958)==
==Removal from power==

One of the first public demonstrations against the Pérez Jiménez regime occurred on 1952, after the assassination of opposition leader Leonardo Ruiz Pineda. During a commemorative ceremony in Nuevo Circo, Caracas, hundreds of people waved handkerchiefs during a minute of silence asked in his honor.

On 27 March 1957, Aaron Copland had come to Caracas to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of his &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer said it had a &quot;magical effect&quot; on the audience. As Copland recalled, &quot;To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment.&quot; On that evening actress Juana Sujo performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, &quot;...that government of the people, by the people, for the people (&quot;del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo&quot;) shall not perish from the earth&quot;, the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music.&quot;
In January 1958 there was a general uprising, leading to the 1958 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état that deposed Pérez; with rioting in the streets, he left the country, paving the way for the establishment of democracy in Venezuela.

==Post-presidency==
Pèrez fled to the United States, where he lived until 1963, when he was extradited to Venezuela on charges of embezzling $200 million during his presidential tenure. The 1959–63 extradition of Pérez, related to Financiadora Administradora Inmobiliaria, S.A., one of the largest development companies in South America, and other business connections, is considered by scholars to be a classic study in the precedent for enforcement of administrative honesty in Latin American countries.

Upon arrival in Venezuela he was imprisoned until his trial, which did not take place for another five years. Convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to four years in prison, he was released as he had already spent more time in jail while he awaited trial. He was then exiled to Spain. In 1968, he was elected to the Senate of Venezuela for the Nationalist Civic Crusade, but his election was contested, and he was kept from taking office. A quick law was passed whereby former prisoners were excluded from participating in the governmental process.

He died in Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain, at the age of 87 on 20 September 2001.

==Legacy==
The period of Pérez Jiménez in power is remembered historically as a government of nationalist roots. His government was based on an ideological pragmatism characterized by the Doctrine of National Wellbeing, that the regime expressed in the New National Ideal would be the philosophical beacon to guide the actions of the government.

His political legacy known &quot;perezjimenismo&quot; was upheld by the &quot;Cruzada Cívica Nacionalista&quot; (CCN; Nationalist Civic Crusade) party, which held seats in Congress from 1968 to 1978. In recent years there has been a revival of &quot;perezjimenismo&quot; and the New National Ideal, with numerous groups revising and upholding the legacy of Marcos Pérez Jiménez. In Venezuelan politics, he symbolizes forms a right-wing caudillo mentality together with Juan Vicente Gómez.

== In popular culture ==
The documentary film &quot;Tiempos de dictadura&quot; (&quot;&quot;), directed by , focuses on his dictatorship, from the 1948 coup d&#x27;état against President Rómulo Gallegos and the human rights violations committed by the Seguridad Nacional (including censorship, arrests, torture and extrajudicial killings) to the public works and lavish carnivals promoted by the oil boom.

==Personal life==
On 4 February 1945, Pérez married Flor María Chalbaud, daughter of Antonio Chalbaud Cardona and Angelina Castro Tejera. The couple had four daughters together.

<doc id="194869" wikidata="Q44701" url="?curid=194869" title="The Tenant of Wildfell Hall">
<text>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the second and final novel written by English author Anne Brontë. It was first published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell. Probably the most shocking of the Brontës&#x27; novels, it had an instant and phenomenal success, but after Anne&#x27;s death her sister Charlotte prevented its re-publication in England until 1854.

The novel is framed as a series of letters from Gilbert Markham to a friend about the events connected with his meeting a mysterious young widow, calling herself Helen Graham, who arrives with her young son and a servant to Wildfell Hall, an Elizabethan mansion which has been empty for many years. Contrary to the early 19th-century norms, she pursues an artist&#x27;s career and makes an income by selling her pictures. Her strict seclusion soon gives rise to gossip in the neighbouring village and she becomes a social outcast. Gilbert comes to understand that she has fled with her son, whom she desperately wishes to save from his father&#x27;s influence. The depiction of marital strife and women&#x27;s professional work is mitigated by the strong moral message of Anne Brontë&#x27;s belief in universal salvation.

Most critics now consider &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; to be one of the first feminist novels. Writer and suffragist May Sinclair, in 1913, said that &quot;the slamming of [Helen&#x27;s] bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England&quot;. In leaving her husband and taking away their child, Helen violates not only social conventions but also early 19th-century English law.

==Background==
Some aspects of the life and character of the author&#x27;s brother Branwell Brontë correspond to those of Helen&#x27;s husband Arthur Huntingdon in &quot;The Tenant&quot;. He resembles Branwell Brontë in three ways: physical good-looks; sexual adventures (before his affair with his employer&#x27;s wife, Mrs Robinson, Branwell is thought to have fathered an illegitimate child who died at birth); and especially in his alcoholism. Another character in the novel, Lord Lowborough, has an association with opium that may also reflect Branwell&#x27;s behaviour.

Another possible source for &quot;The Tenant&quot; is the story of Mrs Collins, the wife of a local curate, who in November 1840 came to Anne&#x27;s father Patrick Brontë seeking advice regarding her alcoholic husband&#x27;s abusive conduct. Mr Brontë&#x27;s counsel was that she should leave her husband. Mrs Collins returned to Haworth in the spring of 1847, while Anne was writing &quot;The Tenant&quot;, and told how she had managed to build a new life for herself and her two children.

== Locations ==

The Brontë biographer Winifred Gérin believed that the original of Wildfell Hall was Ponden Hall, a farmhouse near Stanbury in West Yorkshire. Ponden shares certain architectural details with Wildfell, including latticed windows and a central portico with a date plaque above.

Blake Hall at Mirfield, where Anne had been employed as a governess, was suggested as the model for Grassdale Manor, Arthur Huntingdon&#x27;s country seat, by Ellen Nussey, a friend of Charlotte Brontë, to Edward Morison Wimperis, an artist commissioned to illustrate the Brontë sisters&#x27; novels in 1872. However, neither Blake Hall nor Thorpe Green, another house where Anne was employed as a governess, corresponds exactly with Grassdale.

Linden-Car, the village that Wildfell Hall stands close to, is in Yorkshire. &quot;&quot; in northern dialect means pool, pond or low-lying and boggy ground. Also mentioned is Lindenhope, where &quot;&quot; in Northeastern English means a small enclosed valley.
==Plot summary==
The novel is divided into three volumes.

Part One (Chapters 1 to 15) is narrated by farmer Gilbert Markham as a letter to his friend Jack Halford, beginning with an account of how a mysterious widow, Mrs Helen Graham, arrives at Wildfell Hall, a nearby mansion. A source of curiosity for the small community, the reticent Mrs Graham and her young son, Arthur, are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village. Initially, Gilbert casually courts vicar&#x27;s daughter Eliza Millward, despite his mother&#x27;s belief that he can do better. His interest in Eliza wanes as he comes to know Mrs Graham. In retribution, Eliza spreads (and perhaps creates) scandalous rumours about Mrs Graham. With gossip flying, Gilbert is led to believe that his friend Frederick Lawrence is courting Mrs Graham. At a chance meeting on a road, Gilbert strikes the mounted Mr Lawrence with a whip handle, causing him to fall from his horse. Though she is unaware of this confrontation, Mrs Graham still refuses to marry Gilbert, but when he accuses her of loving Mr Lawrence, she gives him her diaries.

Part two (Chapters 16 to 44) is taken from Helen&#x27;s diaries, in which she describes her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon. The handsome, witty Huntingdon is also spoilt, selfish and self-indulgent. Before marrying Helen, he flirts with Annabella Wilmot, and uses this to manipulate Helen and convince her to marry him. Helen, blinded by love, marries him, and resolves to reform him with gentle persuasion and good example. After the birth of their only child, also called Arthur, Huntingdon becomes increasingly jealous of their son and his claims on Helen&#x27;s attentions and affections.

Huntingdon&#x27;s pack of dissolute friends frequently engage in drunken revels at the family&#x27;s home, Grassdale, oppressing those of finer character. Both men and women are portrayed as degraded. In particular, Annabella, now Lady Lowborough, is shown to be unfaithful to her melancholic but devoted husband.

Walter Hargrave, the brother of Helen&#x27;s friend Milicent Hargrave, vies for Helen&#x27;s affections. While he is not as wild as his peers, he is an unwelcome admirer and Helen senses his predatory nature. Mr Hargrave informs Helen of Huntingdon&#x27;s affair with Lady Lowborough. When his friends depart, Huntingdon pines openly for his paramour and derides his wife, but he will not grant her a divorce.

Huntingdon&#x27;s corruption of their son – encouraging him to drink and swear at his tender age – is the last straw for Helen. She plans to flee to save her son, but her husband learns of her plans from her diary and burns the artist&#x27;s tools with which she had hoped to support herself. Eventually, with help from her brother, Mr Lawrence, and her servant, Rachel, Helen escapes and finds a secret refuge at Wildfell Hall.

Part Three (Chapters 45 to 53) continues Gilbert&#x27;s letter to Mr Halford after reading of the diaries. Helen bids Gilbert to leave her because she is not free to marry. He complies and soon learns that she has returned to Grassdale because her husband is gravely ill. Helen&#x27;s ministrations are in vain, and Huntingdon&#x27;s death is painful since he is fraught with terror at what awaits him. Helen cannot comfort him, for he rejects responsibility for his actions and wishes instead for her to come with him to plead for his salvation.

A year passes. Gilbert pursues a rumour of Helen&#x27;s impending wedding, only to find that Mr Lawrence, with whom he has reconciled, is marrying Helen&#x27;s friend Esther Hargrave. Gilbert goes to Grassdale, and discovers that Helen is now wealthy and lives at her estate in Staningley. He travels there, but is plagued by anxiety that she is now far above his station. By chance he encounters Helen, her aunt and young Arthur. The two lovers reconcile and marry.

==Characters==

===Helen and her family===

* Helen &quot;Nell&quot; Huntingdon (née Lawrence), known also under her alias Helen Graham (Graham is her mother&#x27;s maiden name), the protagonist of the novel and the tenant of the title. Wildfell Hall is the place where she and her brother were born. After their mother&#x27;s death she goes to live with their aunt and uncle at Staningley Manor, while her brother, Frederick, remains with their father. In spite of their separation, Helen has maintained an affectionate relationship with her brother and later he helps her to escape from her abusive and dissolute husband. The character of Helen Graham was probably inspired by Anna Isabella Milbanke, the wife of Lord Byron. Like Anna, Helen firstly believed that reforming her husband&#x27;s behaviour was her religious obligation. Despite disillusionment, both women retained their Universalist faith.
* Master Arthur Huntingdon, five years old at the beginning of the book, the son of Arthur and Helen Huntingdon. He has a resemblance to his uncle, Frederick, which gives rise to gossip. He is grown up by the time of Gilbert&#x27;s letter to Jack Halford, and is residing at Grassdale Manor with his wife, Helen Hattersley (the daughter of Milicent Hargrave and Ralph Hattersley).
* Mr Maxwell, Helen&#x27;s wealthy uncle, dies near the end of the novel and leaves Staningley to Helen.
* Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Maxwell, Helen&#x27;s aunt, tries to warn her against marrying Huntingdon. She dies several years after Helen&#x27;s and Gilbert&#x27;s marriage.
* Frederick Lawrence, Helen&#x27;s brother, helps her to escape from Huntingdon and lends her money. As he and Helen grew up apart and only met in Staningley or Grassdale, no one in Linden-Car village guessed that the secretive Mrs Graham is actually Frederick&#x27;s sister. Eventually he marries Esther Hargrave. Being in mourning for her husband, Helen is forced to miss her brother&#x27;s wedding.

===Huntingdon and his circle===
* Arthur Huntingdon, Helen&#x27;s abusive and alcoholic husband, is a Byronic figure of great fascination but also of barely concealed moral failings. His abusive behaviour impels Helen to run away from him, but nevertheless when he becomes ill (after the injury from falling from a horse when drunk), Helen returns to Grassdale to take care of him. Unwilling to stop drinking alcohol, Huntingdon deteriorates in health and eventually dies. He is widely thought to be loosely based on the author&#x27;s brother, Branwell, but some critics have argued that they have very little in common. Along with Lord Lowborough, Huntingdon bears far stronger resemblance to two types of drunkards outlined in Robert Macnish&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Drunkenness&quot;.
* Annabella Wilmot, later Lady Lowborough, Arthur Huntingdon&#x27;s paramour, is flirtatious, bold and exquisitely beautiful. She has an affair with Huntingdon for several years. Helen is forced to put up with the affair, but when Annabella&#x27;s husband discovers it, he obtains a divorce. Gilbert says he hears that after Annabella moves to the continent, she falls into poverty and dies destitute and alone, but stresses he cannot be sure if this is true or merely a rumour.
* Lord Lowborough, a friend of Huntingdon&#x27;s and Annabella&#x27;s husband, is apathetic but devoted. Melancholic, dour and gloomy, he is in complete contrast to Huntingdon. He used to gamble and drink too much alcohol and developed an addiction to opium, but, after his financial ruin, gradually reforms himself. Lowborough truly loves Annabella, and her infidelity brings him such suffering that only his Christian faith and strong will keep him from suicide. Later he divorces her and after some time marries a plain middle-aged woman, who makes a good wife to him and a stepmother to his children with Annabella – a son and a daughter (who, it is implied, is Huntingdon&#x27;s). Lord Lowborough also has some resemblances to Branwell, such as a life of debauchery, periods of remorse/religious torments, and opium, as well as moral weakness.
* Ralph Hattersley, a friend of Huntingdon&#x27;s, marries Milicent Hargrave because he wants a quiet wife who will let him do what he likes with no word of reproach or complaint. He mistreats his wife. &quot;I sometimes think she has no feeling at all; and then I go on until she cries – and that satisfies me,&quot; he tells Helen. But after he reforms himself he becomes a loving husband and father.
* Mr Grimsby, another of Arthur&#x27;s friends, is a misogynist. He helps Arthur to conceal his affair with Annabella.

===Inhabitants of Linden-Car Farm===
* Gilbert Markham, a twenty-four-year-old farmer, is the principal narrator in the novel. He exhibits jealousy, moodiness and anger, but during the course of the novel he grows morally and proves to be worthy of Helen.
* Fergus Markham, Gilbert&#x27;s seventeen-year-old brother, is high-spirited and idle, and often tries but fails to be witty.
* Rose Markham, a clever and pretty girl of 19, is Gilbert&#x27;s younger sister and a friend of the Millward sisters. She becomes the wife of Jack Halford, to whom Gilbert is recounting in letters what happened 20 years prior in his youth.
* Mrs Markham, Gilbert&#x27;s mother, is a great admirer of the Reverend Millward and his ideas.

===Inhabitants of Ryecote Farm===
* Jane Wilson, a friend of Eliza Millward and a scandalmonger, tries to ensnare Frederick Lawrence, but when Gilbert reveals to him her hatred of Frederick&#x27;s sister Helen, Frederick breaks off their relationship. As no man she meets fits her high standards, she moves to a nearby country town, constantly name dropping, but friendless and, according to Helen, becomes a bitter spinster.
* Richard Wilson, Jane&#x27;s brother, succeeds the Reverend Millward in the vicarage of Lindenhope and eventually marries his daughter, the plain Mary.
* Robert Wilson, brother to Jane and Richard, is a rough farmer whom Jane is ashamed of. However, everyone else approves of him as being pleasant and kind. He eventually marries, and Jane leaves the family home as she cannot stand him and his ordinary wife.
* Mrs Wilson, the mother of Jane, Richard and Robert, is a gossip like her daughter.

===Inhabitants of the Vicarage===
* Eliza Millward, daughter of the vicar and friend of Jane Wilson, is a scandalmonger. Gilbert carries on a half-serious flirtation with her before he first meets Helen.
* Mary Millward, Eliza&#x27;s elder sister, is a plain, quiet, sensible girl, housekeeper and family drudge. She is trusted and valued by her father, loved and courted by children and poor people, dogs and cats, and slighted and neglected by everybody else.
* The Reverend Michael Millward, Eliza&#x27;s and Mary&#x27;s father, is a man of fixed principles, strong prejudices and regular habits. He considers anyone who disagrees with his views deplorably ignorant.

===Inhabitants of The Grove===
* Walter Hargrave, a friend of Arthur Huntingdon&#x27;s, is a predatory admirer of Helen while she is still living with her husband. He is a cousin of Annabella Wilmot.
* Milicent Hargrave, a meek woman, married to Ralph Hattersley against her will, is Walter&#x27;s sister and Helen&#x27;s close friend. Milicent can be seen as a foil to her. While Helen is spirited and forthright, unafraid to speak to the men in her life with frankness, Milicent, in contrast, is trampled and ignored by her husband. Helen eventually leaves Huntingdon with her beloved son in tow, while Milicent says that she is &quot;really contented&quot; with her husband and &quot;would not exchange [him] for any man on earth&quot;. At length, Ralph finally reforms himself and Milicent finds happiness in marriage.
* Esther Hargrave, the younger sister of Milicent and Walter, and Helen&#x27;s friend, is bold, high-spirited and independent. She resists an arranged marriage her family tries to force her into and eventually marries Helen&#x27;s brother, Frederick Lawrence.
* Mrs Hargrave, mother of the three Hargrave children, is a hard and stingy woman. She adores her only son and tries to marry off her daughters as soon as possible.

===Other characters===
* Mr Boarham, one of Helen&#x27;s suitors before her marriage, is rejected because Helen is repelled by his dull conversation and age. Helen prefers to spell his name &quot;Bore&#x27;em&quot;.
* Mr Wilmot, the uncle of Annabella Wilmot, is another of Helen&#x27;s early suitors. She considers him a scoundrel.
* Rachel, a servant and friend of Helen and her son, has taken care of Helen since her birth.
* Alice Myers, another paramour of the elder Huntingdon, is hired ostensibly as a governess for little Arthur. Helen is suspicious of her from the start (all the families she has previously worked for have conveniently gone abroad), and when Rachel gives her certain proof that Alice is having an affair with her husband, she decides to flee.
* Benson, the butler at Grassdale Manor, has compassion for Helen in her misfortune and helps her escape.
* Jack Halford, a squire, is the husband of Rose Markham and the addressee of Gilbert&#x27;s letters. He is an unseen character.

==Literary analysis==

===Themes===

====Alcoholism====

Arthur Huntingdon and most of his male friends are heavy drinkers. Lord Lowborough is &quot;the drunkard by necessity&quot; – he tries to use alcohol as a way to cope with his personal problems. Arthur, like his friend Ralph Hattersley, is the &quot;drunkard from an excess of indulgence in youth&quot;. Ultimately, only Ralph Hattersley and Lord Lowborough manage to reform their lives.
Arthur and Lord Lowborough particularly seem affected by the traditional signs of alcoholism. They frequently drink themselves into incoherence and on awakening, they drink again to feel better. Lord Lowborough understands that he has a problem and, with willpower and strenuous effort, overcomes his addiction. Arthur continues drinking even after he injures himself falling from a horse, which eventually leads to his death. Ralph, although he drinks heavily with his friends, does not seem to be as much afflicted by alcoholism as by his way of life. Mr Grimsby continues his degradation, going from bad to worse and eventually dying in a brawl. Huntingdon&#x27;s son Arthur becomes fond of alcohol through his father&#x27;s efforts, but Helen begins to add to his wine a small quantity of tartar emetic, &quot;just enough to produce inevitable nausea and depression without positive sickness&quot;. Very soon the boy begins to be made to feel ill by the very smell of alcohol.

====Domestic violence====
Marianne Thormählen calls Milicent&#x27;s remark to her drunk and abusive husband Ralph, reminding him that they are not at home, &quot;one of the most harrowing sentences in the entire novel&quot;. Thormählen argues that in &quot;The Tenant&quot; the traditional submissive behaviour of wives is shown as a factor that encourages male oppression. Later, when Ralph decides to reform his life, he blames his wife&#x27;s meekness and says that resistance from her would have prevented his violence and debauchery.

====Gender relations====
In discussing Brontë&#x27;s narrative strategy, Carol N. Senf compares &quot;The Tenant&quot; with Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;: in both novels female narrative is retold by a man. Brontë, like Atwood, &quot;makes the reader wonder whether any two individuals could achieve the kind of equal relationship Gilbert seems to desire in a society that encourages inequality. Certainly, Helen&#x27;s silence is in some ways as troubling to twentieth-century readers as Offred&#x27;s, though Gilbert is much kinder and more thoughtful about his superior position than [Professor] Pieixoto.&quot;

According to Priti Joshi, in &quot;The Tenant&quot; Anne challenges the central tenet of 19th-century domestic ideology – women&#x27;s influence on men – famously postulated by Hannah More. This doctrine found its way into even &quot;protofeminist&quot; novels such as &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, where the main heroine fulfills (or reduces) her ambitions for a wider life by taming and managing her husband. In &quot;The Tenant&quot;, however, masculinity is impervious to the softening or &quot;superior&quot; influence of women. Marrying Arthur, Helen is convinced that she can reform him, but six years later she escapes from him to protect herself and her young son. Helen&#x27;s second husband, Gilbert Markham, who despite many faults is &quot;more pliable&quot;, never shows any noticeable reform throughout the novel. Joshi concludes that Gilbert is &quot;tottering toward a new form of masculinity&quot; together with Jack Halford, his close friend, by exchanging confidences and, by learning to communicate and reveal emotions, doing what is considered to be feminine, he can redeem himself, become a new man and a worthy husband of Helen.

Of all Arthur&#x27;s friends, only Walter Hargrave has never been a heavy drinker. He uses this as manipulation in an attempt to win Helen&#x27;s favour. When it doesn&#x27;t work, he starts speculating that she cannot manage her life after leaving Arthur without a man&#x27;s protection and supervision.

Gilbert&#x27;s mother, Mrs Markham, holds the doctrine prevailing at the time that it is &quot;the husband&#x27;s business to please himself, and hers [i.e. the wife&#x27;s] to please him&quot;. The portrayal of Helen, courageous and independent, emphasizes her capacity for seeking autonomy rather than submitting to male authority, and the corrective role of women in relation to men. &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; is thus considered a feminist novel by many critics.

====Displacement====
Josephine McDonagh believes that the theme of displacement is underlined by the title of the novel: Helen is the tenant, not an owner-occupier, of Wildfell Hall, the place of her birth, which was bequeathed to a male descendant, her brother. &quot;The Tenant&quot; features numerous allusions to a wide range of other texts, from the Bible to contemporary novels. Apart from being used as a quotation, allusions are often applied by peculiar characters to reflect their personalities. Sometimes the individual voices of characters are shown as a patchwork of quotations. Such &quot;borrowed voices&quot; may denote the displacement of the main heroes – Gilbert, being a well-educated man with high ambitions for some &quot;great achievements&quot;, is forced to take over his father&#x27;s farm, and Helen, being a runaway wife, can call neither her home nor her name her own. The emphasis on allusions in the novel, on using the &quot;language of others&quot;, according to McDonagh, may be a reflection on the position of being a tenant, which in its subjugation is similar to that of being a wife.

====Marriage====
Until the passing of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act in 1870 a wife had no independent existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. As expressed in Hugo Black&#x27;s dissent in &quot;United States v. Yazell&quot;, &quot;This rule [coverture] has worked out in reality to mean that though the husband and wife are one, the one is the husband.&quot;

Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband&#x27;s conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, but the truth is that he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother&#x27;s pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.

====Motherhood====
Helen escapes from her husband, in violation of English law as it then was, not for her own sake but for young Arthur&#x27;s. She wants to &quot;obviate his becoming such a gentleman as his father&quot;.

====Woman artist====

According to Stevie Davies, Anne&#x27;s depiction of the woman as fee-earning artist &quot;trebly trespasses on the domain of the masculine: female artists dabbed in water-colours or sketched decoratively in pen and ink; ladies did not engage in trade; and, besides, tools of her trade [legally belonging to her husband] in this case count as stolen.&quot; Melinda Maunsell believes that Helen is &quot;both revealed and concealed by her artistic hand; providing her with an acceptable means of expression within her social construction, the artists hand also offers a form of independence, a possibility of earning a living, in a period when a woman had virtually no independent power base in any sphere.&quot;
Nicole A. Diederich has argued that in &quot;The Tenant&quot; Anne Brontë constructs marriage and remarriage as a comparative and competitive practice that restricts Helen&#x27;s rights and talents. Helen&#x27;s artistic ability plays a central role in her relationships with both Gilbert and Arthur. Her alternating freedom to paint and inability to do so on her own terms not only complicate Helen&#x27;s definition as wife, widow, and artist, but also enable Anne Brontë to criticize the domestic sphere as established by marriage and re-established with remarriage.

At the beginning of her diary, the young and unmarried Helen already defines herself as an artist. Her early drawings reveal her private and true feelings for Arthur Huntingdon, feelings that lead her to overlook his true character and lose herself to marriage. Nevertheless, in addition to revealing Helen&#x27;s true desires, the self-expression of her artwork also defines her as an artist. That she puts so much of herself into her paintings and drawings attests to this self-definition. After her marriage to Arthur, Helen, accepting the roles of wife and housekeeper, rarely refers to herself as an artist. The marital laws of the day made Helen&#x27;s artworks legally belong to her husband and allowed Arthur to destroy them when he discovered her plans to earn money by selling paintings. Diederich calls it &quot;an ironic echo&quot; of Helen&#x27;s destruction of Arthur&#x27;s portrait just before their engagement when he tried to take it from her. Diederich also points that in attempt to become a fee-earning artist &quot;Helen reclaims her artistic talent as her own, distinct from her husband&#x27;s possession of her art, and of her.&quot;

Posing as a widow, Helen makes her role as an artist who sells her works, especially to support a child, more socially acceptable. Resembling the time of Arthur&#x27;s courtship, when Helen&#x27;s portraits of him betrayed her affection, artwork once again serves the autobiographical role during her meetings with Gilbert – the painting of Wildfell Hall deceptively labelled &quot;Fernley Manor&quot; discloses her precarious position as a runaway wife. Showing Gilbert handling Helen&#x27;s paintings without her permission, Brontë, according to Diederich, &quot;hints that remarriage to Gilbert may not hold any greater promise to Helen&#x27;s self-definition and freedom as an artist than did her first marriage&quot;. However, unlike Arthur, Gilbert shows much more esteem for Helen&#x27;s artwork. Diederich concludes that &quot;the domestic realm, whether established with marriage or re-established in remarriage, doesn&#x27;t support women&#x27;s self-definition as artists, nor does it provide a structured setting for the unfettered expression of their talents&quot; and that &quot;The Tenant&quot; calls for &quot;more support for married and remarried women&#x27;s legal rights and artistic opportunities in nineteenth-century Britain&quot;.

====Universal salvation====

Seemingly pious Universalist ideas in &quot;The Tenant&quot; contradicted prevailing Protestant doctrine in England and thus advocated a socially unacceptable view. Helen expresses several times in the story her belief in eventual universal salvation for all souls. She does not reassure the elder Arthur about this on his deathbed because she wants him to repent of his wrongdoing on his own accord. Despite his inability to do so, Helen still believes in his redemption.

=== Style and narrative ===

==== Realism ====

Unlike her elder sisters, Anne Brontë did not follow the Romantic style in her two novels, opting instead for Realism. Many critics, including Anne&#x27;s sister Charlotte, considered her depiction of alcoholism and adultery overly graphic and disturbing. In defence, Anne openly stated her writer&#x27;s intentions in the preface to the second edition of the novel.

Often, when depicting the same subject as her sisters, Anne presents it in a completely different light: Wildfell Hall, an old superannuated mansion, she pictures not as a &#x27;haunted&#x27; house like Thornfield Hall or Wuthering Heights in her sisters&#x27; works, but as a decayed relic of an outworn patrician class, whose pretensions are mocked by the recrudescence of building into moor. Stevie Davies has argued that Anne&#x27;s ancient hall demystifies Gothic. Wildfell Hall is not haunted, it is simply dilapidated, damp and un-welcoming.

Anne&#x27;s portrayal of Arthur Huntingdon deflates the Byronic cult – while witty, adventurous and handsome, he is not endowed with intellectual gifts, nor even vitality, famously exhibited by Heathcliff, and has nothing of the fundamental goodness that finally redeemed Rochester. All Huntingdon&#x27;s vices come from his being spoilt as a child. Analyzing the lack of sense and reason amongst males as the consequence of value-system based on the worship of machismo, Anne depicts the pathetic end of her main hero, brought on by his drinking habits. Totally dependent on his estranged wife in his final illness, Arthur Huntingdon ultimately loses all his personality.

According to Caroline Franklin, Anne Brontë uses the Byronic paradigm &quot;not to titillate, but to shock&quot; – her protest against spousal abuse needs no scandal-mongering allusions to be sensational. The character of Helen Graham may have been inspired by Anna Isabella Milbanke, the wife of Lord Byron, who also thought at first that her religious obligation was to improve her husband&#x27;s behavior, but very soon she was disillusioned, separated from him and raised their child alone. Despite this, she – like Helen – believed in the ultimate salvation of her husband&#x27;s soul.

In &quot;The Tenant&quot; vice is not unique to the men. Lady Lowborough&#x27;s adultery has a particularly devastating effect on her husband, and the malice of Eliza Millward is poisonous to the entire community. The eternal struggle between good and evil is emphasised by heavy use of biblical references: sinners who repent and listen to reason are brought within the fold, while those who remain stubborn tend to meet violent or miserable ends.

====Sisters&#x27; connection====

Stevie Davies believes that the settings and characters in &quot;The Tenant&quot; are influenced by Anne&#x27;s juvenile fiction. In their childhood Emily and Anne Brontë created the imaginary kingdom of Gondal, about which they composed prose and poems. Thomas Moore&#x27;s biography of Byron, with its description of womanizing, gaming and carousing, directly influenced the Gondal mythos and was echoed in Brontë&#x27;s adult works. The characteristics of Arthur Huntington and Annabella Wilmot, both self-indulgent sexual transgressors, may be the relics of Gondal, where most of the main heroes were extravagant and led adventurous lives.

Four houses in the younger Brontës&#x27; novels have &quot;W. H.&quot; initials: Wellwood House in &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, the eponymous mansion in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and Wildfell Hall and Woodford Hall in &quot;The Tenant&quot;. The original &quot;Ur-hall&quot; in Gondal may be the source of inspiration for at least two of them—Wuthering Heights and Wildfell Hall. Citing all this, Davies concludes that Charlotte&#x27;s statement that Anne &quot;hated her work [on &quot;The Tenant&quot;]&quot; is not credible.

====Framed narration====

Notwithstanding Anne&#x27;s repudiation of the Gothic atmosphere, &quot;The Tenant&quot;″s narrative structure is common to Gothic fiction with the usage of framing narrator, letters and diary as clues to a whole truth. However, the narrator, Gilbert Markham, differs from his gothic predecessors in that he and the official standards he represents are shown to be in part the cause of the shocking reality he encounters. 
Chapters formed from Helen&#x27;s diary strictly follow its style and differ from Gilbert&#x27;s narrative. His story is also taken from his own diary. Such adherence to the diaries may be considered as a &#x27;testimony of experience&#x27;. Since the Renaissance writing a diary had been a popular form of documenting and expressing personal opinions.

Naomi Jacobs argues that &quot;the displacement [of framing narration by the inner] is exactly the point of the novel, which subjects its readers to a shouldering-aside of familiar notions and comfortable perceptions of the world&quot;, and both narrations and jarring discrepancies of tone and perspective between them are essential to the purpose. In &quot;The Tenant&quot;, like in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, a horrific reality of private life is obtained after passing through the voice of a framing narrator. According to Jacobs, the male narrator represents the public world, and the framed structure serves several functions that are strongly gender-related: it illustrates the process of going behind the official version of reality in order to approach the truth that the culture prefers to deny; it exemplifies the ways in which domestic reality is obscured by layers of conventional ideology; and it replicates the cultural split between male and female spheres that is shown to be one of the sources of the tragedy in the novel. Jacobs concludes that both Emily and Anne seemed to find it necessary, in approaching subjects that were considered to be controversial, to use the voice of a male narrator, appropriating, delegitimizing and even ridiculing his power, before telling anti-patriarchal truth.

Carol A. Senf believes that the &quot;unique narrative structure, the wife&#x27;s story framed by that of her husband... encourages the reader to focus on questions of gender&quot;. According to Tess O&#x27;Toole, the architecture of Brontë&#x27;s narrative stresses and calls attention to the disjunction of two different forms of domestic containment, one deriving from marriage, the other from the natal family. Priti Joshi, noting Helen and Gilbert&#x27;s suspicion of spoken words and reliance on the visual, and their faith in the written word, concludes that a diary is a fitting narrative device because the characters require it, and that the epistolary narrative form reflects this faith.

====Direct speech====

Josephine McDonagh believes that some of the stylistic features of &quot;The Tenant&quot; may be influenced by the print culture of the Brontës&#x27; time. For example, Anne&#x27;s concern to preserve the integrity of each of her narrators&#x27; voices is similar to magazine structure that maintains the voice of individual contributors. The novel&#x27;s labyrinthine structure is established by the application of direct speech. Gilbert&#x27;s letter incorporates Helen&#x27;s diary; and in turn, Helen&#x27;s diary includes Arthur&#x27;s autobiographical reminiscences.

===Genre===

====From social comedy to social drama====

Anne Brontë starts her novel in a social comedy manner, reminiscent of Jane Austen. Like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; starts with the arrival of a new person in a neighbourhood—a source of curiosity for a small rural community. Unlike Austen, Brontë makes a woman the centre of interest. Reticent Mrs Graham with her views on alcohol consumption and girls&#x27; education, controversial for the 19th century, soon becomes an outcast.

====Domestic drama====

Tess O&#x27;Toole calls &quot;The Tenant&quot; &quot;the most unusual example of 19th century domestic fiction&quot;, and attributes to that the relative marginalization of the novel in the Brontë sisters&#x27; oeuvre. According to O&#x27;Toole, Anne, unlike her elder sisters, seems to juxtapose rather than to collapse kinship and sexual relations. The relationship between Frederick and Helen is insular and cannot solve all the problems or contradictions that cluster around the concept of the domestic.

Helen&#x27;s retreat from her husband is followed by a return to her natal family origins, symbolized by her return to the home in which she was born, and adoption of her mother&#x27;s maiden name as her alias. The relationship between Helen and Frederick, sister and brother, who spent all their childhood apart and reunited only as adults, is foregrounded to domestic reform – Frederick&#x27;s virtue compensates for their father&#x27;s neglect of Helen, and their comfortable relationship, defined by mutual respect and understanding, contrasts with Helen&#x27;s problematic relationship with her husband and her suitor.

====Novel of ideas====

In the third chapter &quot;The Tenant&quot; changes tone to the novel of ideas. In a powerfully argued Miltonic debate about virtue, experience, choice and temptation, Helen challenges the segregated education of the two sexes, with its over-exposure for boys and over-protection for girls.

The novel&#x27;s critique of libertine men may be influenced by the works of Mary Wollstonecraft. Priti Joshi, believing that Anne had read her works, argues that she not only refuses the Wollstonecraftian indictment of the feminine, but also rejects its elevation, articulated by Hannah More. Anne Brontë&#x27;s feminism, in Joshi&#x27;s words, &quot;forges a path between the extremes of Wollstonecraft-More spectrum&quot;. In &quot;The Tenant&quot;, a reformed masculinity emerges not, as More would have it, under the tutelage of a woman, but by emulating feminine ways. Anne presents the &quot;idle talk&quot; of Linden-Car villagers primary as a way of creating fellowship and community, not only as vicious gossip. According to Joshi, the gossip of middle-class Linden-Car functions not as a critique of the behavior, but rather to heighten its contrast with the chilling atmosphere of the upper-class estate.

While refusing to believe whispered insinuations, the main heroes are led astray by precisely the evidence of their eyes: Gilbert, spying Helen walking with Frederick, mistakenly takes them to be lovers, and Helen&#x27;s naïve empiricism leads her to disastrous marriage. Helen&#x27;s faith in the written word and the class reserve that lead her to confide her troubles to diary, &quot;the best friend I could have for the purpose [of a confidential talk]&quot;, is also shown as folly when her husband confiscates the diary and reads its contents.

== Criticism ==

=== Contemporary reviews ===

&quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; challenged the prevailing morals of the Victorian era. Especially shocking was Helen&#x27;s slamming of her bedroom door in the face of her husband after continuing abuse. Charles Kingsley, in his review for &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;A people&#x27;s novel of a very different school is &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. It is, taken altogether, a powerful and an interesting book. Not that it is a pleasant book to read, nor, as we fancy, has it been a pleasant book to write; still less has it been a pleasant training which could teach an author such awful facts, or give courage to write them. The fault of the book is coarseness—not merely that coarseness of subject which will be the stumbling-block of most readers, and which makes it utterly unfit to be put into the hands of girls...&quot; Despite this, he believed that: &quot;[English] society owes thanks, not sneers, to those who dare to shew her the image of her own ugly, hypocritical visage&quot;.

&quot;The Spectator&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, like its predecessor [&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;], suggests the idea of considerable abilities ill applied. There is power, effect, and even nature, though of an extreme kind, in its pages; but there seems in the writer a morbid love for the coarse, not to say the brutal; so that his level subjects are not very attractive, and the more forcible are displeasing or repulsive, from their gross, physical, or profligate substratum. He might reply, that such things are in life... Mere existence, however, as we have often had occasion to remark, is not a sufficient reason for a choice of subject: its general or typical character is a point to consider, and its power of pleasing must be regarded, as well as its mere capabilities of force or effect. It is not only the subject of this novel, however, that is objectionable, but the manner of treating it. There is a coarseness of tone throughout the writing of all these Bells [Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë], that puts an offensive subject in its worst point of view, and which generally contrives to dash indifferent things&quot;.

A critic in &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, probably H. F. Chorley, cited &quot;The Tenant&quot; as &quot;the most entertaining novel we have read in a month past&quot;. However, he warned the authors, having in mind all the novels from Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell published by 1848, &quot;against their fancy for dwelling upon what is disagreeable&quot;.

&quot;The Examiner&quot;, while praising all Brontës as &quot;a hardy race&quot;, who &quot;do not lounge in drawing-rooms or boudoirs&quot;, and &quot;not common-place writers&quot;, considered &quot;The Tenant&quot;″s frame structure &quot;a fatal error: for, after so long and minute a history [of Helen&#x27;s marriage to Arthur], we cannot go back and recover the enthusiasm which we have been obliged to dismiss a volume and half before&quot;. The gossiping of the inhabitants of Linden-Car village reminded it of Jane Austen&#x27;s style, but &quot;with less of that particular quality which her dialogues invariably possessed&quot;. Considering the novel&#x27;s structure as &quot;faulty&quot;, &quot;Examiner&quot; concludes that &quot;it is scarcely possible to analyze [the novel]&quot;.

An American magazine &quot;Literature World&quot;, believing all the novels by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell were produced by the same person, praised their author as a genius, who can make &quot;his incongruities appear natural&quot;. Noting, that &quot;all that is good or attractive about [the male characters in &quot;The Tenant&quot;] is or might be womanish&quot; it supposes that the author may be &quot;some gifted and retired woman&quot;. Despite considering &quot;The Tenant&quot; &quot;infinitely inferior&quot; to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Literature World&quot; admits that the two novels share &quot;the same mysterious word-painting&quot; with which the author &quot;conveys the scene he (or she) describes to the mind&#x27;s eye, so as not only to impress it with the mere view, but to speak, as it were, to the imagination, to the inner sense, as is ever the case with the Poetry as the Painting of real genius&quot;. Again having in mind both &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;The Tenant&quot;, it concludes: &quot;However objectionable these works may be to crude minds which cannot winnow the chaff vulgarity from the rich grain of genius which burdens them, very many, while enjoying the freshness and vigour, will gladly hail their appearance, as boldly and eloquently developing blind places of wayward passion in the human heart, which is far more interesting to trace than all bustling traces and murky alleys, through which the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp genius of Dickens has so long led the public mind&quot;.

Edwin Percy Whipple from &quot;North American Review&quot; considered &quot;The Tenant&quot; &quot;less unpleasant&quot; than &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. However, both novels, in his opinion, were constructed with an &quot;excessive clumsiness&quot; and &quot;the brutal element of human nature&quot; was equally &quot;given prominence&quot; in them. He continues: &quot;[&quot;The Tenant&quot;] seems a convincing proof, that there is nothing kindly in [this]author&#x27;s powerful mind, and that, if he continues to write novels, he will introduce into the land of romance a larger number of hateful men and women than any other author of the day&quot;. In Gilbert he sees &quot;nothing good, except rude honesty&quot;, and while acknowledging Helen&#x27;s &quot;strong-mindedness&quot;, he finds no &quot;lovable or feminine virtues&quot;. Despite this, Whipple praised novels characterization: &quot;All the characters are drawn with great power and precision of outline, and the scenes are vivid as the life itself.&quot; Helen&#x27;s marriage to Arthur he sees as &quot;a reversal of the process carried on in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;&quot;, but Arthur Huntingdon, in his opinion, is &quot;no Rochester&quot;. &quot;He is never virtuously inclined, except in those periods of illness and feebleness which his debaucheries have occasioned&quot;. Whipple concludes: &quot;The reader of Acton Bell gains no enlarged view of mankind, giving a healthy action to his sympathies, but is confined to a narrow space of life, and held down, as it were, by main force, to witness the wolfish side of his nature literally and logically set forth. But the criminal courts are not the places in which to take a comprehensive view of humanity and the novelist who confines his observation to them is not likely to produce any lasting impression except of horror and disgust&quot;.

&quot;Sharpe&#x27;s London Magazine&quot;, believing &quot;despite reports to the contrary&quot; that &quot;[no] woman could have written such a work&quot;, warned its readers, especially ladies, against reading &quot;The Tenant&quot;. While acknowledging &quot;the powerful interest of the story&quot;, &quot;the talent with which it is written&quot; and an &quot;excellent moral&quot;, it argued that &quot;like the fatal melody of the Syren&#x27;s song, its very perfections render it more dangerous, and therefore more carefully to be avoided&quot;. In &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s&quot; opinion, the novel&#x27;s &quot;evils which render the work unfit for perusal&quot; arose from &quot;a perverted taste and an absence of mental refinement in the writer, together with a total ignorance of the usages of good society&quot;. It argues that the scenes of debauchery &quot;are described with a disgustingly truthful minuteness, which shows the writer to be only too well acquainted with the revolting details of such evil revelry&quot; and considers it a final &quot;proof of the unreadableness of these volumes&quot;. Helen&#x27;s belief in Universal salvation was also castigated: &quot;The dangerous tendency of such a belief must be apparent to any one who gives the subject a moment&#x27;s consideration; and it becomes scarcely necessary, in order to convince our readers of the madness of trusting to such a forced distortion of the Divine attribute of mercy, to add that this doctrine is alike repugnant to Scripture, and in direct opposition to the teaching of the Anglican Church&quot;.

&quot;The Rambler&quot;, arguing that &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;The Tenant&quot; were written by the same person, stated that the latter is &quot;not so bad a book as &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;&quot;, which it believed to be &quot;one of the coarsest of the books we ever perused&quot;. The Reverend Michael Millward was considered by &quot;Rambler&quot; as &quot;one of the least disagreeable individuals&quot; in the novel, while Helen&#x27;s Universalist views were criticised as either &quot;false and bad&quot; or &quot;vague and unmeaning&quot;. It concludes: &quot;Unless our authoress can contrive to refine and elevate her general notions of all human and divine things, we shall be glad to learn that she is not intending to add another work to those which have already been produced by her pen&quot;.

G. H. Lewes, in &quot;Leader Magazine&quot;, shortly after Anne&#x27;s death, wrote: &quot;Curious enough is to read &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, and remember that the writers were two retiring, solitary, consumptive girls! Books, coarse even for men, coarse in language and coarse in conception, the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated men – turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone, filling their loneliness with quiet studies, and writing their books from a sense of duty, hating the pictures they drew, yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness! There is matter here for the moralist or critic to speculate on&quot;.

=== Suppression and subsequent criticism ===
A great success on initial publication, &quot;The Tenant&quot; was almost forgotten in subsequent years. When it became due for a reprint, just over a year after Anne&#x27;s death, Charlotte prevented its re-publication. (The novel was out of print in England until 1854, but not in America, which had no copyright restriction.) Some critics believe that Charlotte&#x27;s suppression of the book was to protect her younger sister&#x27;s memory from further onslaughts. Others believe Charlotte was jealous of her younger sister. Even before Anne&#x27;s death Charlotte had criticized the novel, stating in a letter to W.S. Williams: &quot;That it had faults of execution, faults of art, was obvious, but faults of intention of feeling could be suspected by none who knew the writer. For my part, I consider the subject unfortunately chosen – it was one the author was not qualified to handle at once vigorously and truthfully. The simple and natural – quiet description and simple pathos – are, I think Acton Bell&#x27;s forte. I liked &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; better than the present work.&quot; Juliet Barker, in her biography of the Brontës, concluded that &quot;Charlotte, it appears, was prepared to consign her sister&#x27;s novel to oblivion because she considered its subject at odds with her own perception of what Anne&#x27;s character was and ought to have been.&quot;

Elizabeth Gaskell repeated Charlotte&#x27;s words about Anne in &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot;, claiming that the subject of &quot;The Tenant&quot; &quot;was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas&quot;. In his essay on Emily Brontë, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned &quot;The Tenant&quot; in the context of Branwell&#x27;s decline as a novel &quot;which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition than it has ever received&quot; and added that &quot;as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life than anything in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; or &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;&quot;. Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne &quot;would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [her sisters&#x27;] imperative spirits&quot;. Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of &quot;The Tenant&quot;, accused Anne of &quot;the narrowness of view&quot; and absence of &quot;some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [which] was present in Emily and Charlotte&quot;. She concluded that &quot;it is not as the writer of &quot;Wildfell Hall&quot;, but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Brontë, that Anne Brontë escapes oblivion.&quot; May Sinclair, while famously saying that &quot;when [Anne] slammed the door of Mrs Huntingdon&#x27;s bedroom she slammed it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions&quot;, considered that she &quot;had no genius&quot;. Despite that, her opinion about &quot;The Tenant&quot; was unexpectedly high: &quot;There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne&#x27;s amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Brontës.&quot; In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel — while acclaiming it as &quot;the first presentment of that Feminist novel&quot;, she stated that &quot;it bores to tears&quot;. Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: &quot;If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Brontë&#x27;s idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines.&quot; The only thing Sinclair wholly approved of was the author&#x27;s treatment of marital laws of the time: &quot;Anne Brontë attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters&#x27; boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained... Her behaviour is the least unusual, not to say revolutionary.&quot;
Despite the general dismissiveness of the late 19th–early 20th century critics, Anne still had supporters in literary circles. Esther Alice Chadwick, while believing that Anne lacked &quot;the fire and passion of her sisters&quot; and was &quot;inferior&quot; to them, claimed that she is still &quot;a character well worth studying&quot;. Chadwick also considered &quot;The Tenant&quot; to be &quot;probably the first temperance novel&quot;. George Moore, an Anglo-Irish writer, was an admirer of Anne Brontë&#x27;s novels; he believed that Anne &quot;had all the qualities of Jane Austen and other qualities&quot;, that &quot;she could write with heat&quot;, and if &quot;she had lived ten years longer she would have taken a place beside Jane Austen, perhaps even a higher place&quot;. He declared that &quot;The Tenant&quot; had &quot;the rarest literary quality of heat&quot;, and blamed Charlotte Brontë for her youngest sister&#x27;s loss of reputation.

Only in 1929 the first dedicated biography of Anne came out – it was a short monograph by W. T. Hale, where he stated that in the &quot;ideas and situations&quot;, presented in &quot;The Tenant&quot;, Anne &quot;was way ahead of her times&quot; and that &quot;she rushed in where Thackeray dared not tread.&quot; However, Hale believed that Anne &quot;will never be known to fame either as novelist or poet, but only as the sister of Charlotte and Emily.&quot;

In 1959, two biographies were published: &quot;Anne Brontë, her life and work&quot; by Ada Harrison and Derek Stanford and &quot;Anne Brontë&quot; by Winifred Gérin. Noting that &quot;The Tenant&quot; was published some ten years before George Eliot&#x27;s novels, Harrison and Stanford named Anne the &quot;first realist woman writer&quot; in Great Britain. Unlike some early critics, who considered the scenes of debauchery improbable, Harrison and Stanford believed them to be &quot;described in a fashion which Zola might have admired&quot;. Winifred Gérin believed Helen Graham to be &quot;one of the first married women in fiction who is both competent and resolved to keep herself not by any of the accepted means as housekeeper, companion or governess, but as a painter, selling her canvasses to dealers.&quot; Despite this, in her later work on the Brontës, Gérin dismissed &quot;The Tenant&quot; as being &quot;written too obviously as a work of propaganda, a treatise against drunkenness, to be considered a work of art&quot;. Several years later, however, Gérin wrote an introduction to &quot;The Tenant&quot;, where, while considering the framed structure in both &quot;The Tenant&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; a &quot;clumsy devise&quot;, acknowledged Anne&#x27;s &quot;pre-eminent gift of story-teller&quot; and &quot;eloquence in proclaiming the equality of men and women&quot;. She believed that &quot;The Tenant&quot; &quot;might be said to be the first manifesto for &#x27;Women&#x27;s Lib&#x27;&quot;. Inga-Stina Ewbank considered Anne the least talented of the sisters and claimed that the framing structure – where &quot;Helen can reveal her innermost being to the diary&quot; while Gilbert is &quot;bound to be as objective as possible&quot; – &quot;throws the novel out of balance&quot;. However, she believed that &quot;through the very nature of its central concern, &quot;The Tenant&quot; is feminist in the deepest sense of the word.&quot;
Daphne du Maurier discussed &quot;The Tenant&quot; in the context of the biography of Anne&#x27;s brother, Branwell Brontë. Du Maurier praised the narrative structure, &quot;two separate stories most cleverly combined in one&quot;, and believed Gilbert Markham &quot;with his utter confidence in his powers of attracting the opposite sex&quot; to be modelled on Branwell. Presuming that he was familiar with his sisters&#x27; novels, du Maurier believed that the story of Helen&#x27;s marital life with Arthur Huntingdon may have been &quot;a warning to Branwell&quot; and the relationship between &quot;erring, neglectful husband&quot; and &quot;the pious, praying wife&quot; resembles Branwell&#x27;s views on the marriage of Lydia Robinson, the woman at whose house he was employed as a tutor to her son, while Anne was governess to her daughters. Du Maurier concluded that in childhood years Branwell &quot;shared in his sister&#x27;s writings; somehow he must continue to live out their characters in the world of his imagination&quot;.

In her early essays on Anne Brontë&#x27;s novels and poetry Muriel Spark praised her proficiency. She believed that Charlotte was a &quot;harsh sister to Anne&quot; and &quot;had she taken an impartial view of &quot;Wildfell Hall&quot;, she must have discovered its merits.&quot; Despite notion that Charlotte and Emily were &quot;more gifted&quot;, Spark stated that &quot;[Anne&#x27;s] writings none the less take no mean place in nineteenth-century literature.&quot; However, some forty years later, in the introduction to &quot;The Essence of the Brontës&quot;, Spark radically changed her views on Anne: &quot;I do not now agree with my former opinion on Anne Brontë&#x27;s value as a writer. I think her works are not good enough to be considered in any serious context of the nineteenth century novel or that there exists any literary basis for comparison with the brilliant creative works of Charlotte and Emily... She was a writer who could &#x27;pen&#x27; a story well enough; she was a literary equivalent of a decent water-colourist.&quot;

Only in the last decades of the 20th century &quot;The Tenant&quot; began to get critical acclaim. Elizabeth Langland in her 1989 monograph &quot;Anne Brontë: The Other One&quot; said: &quot;It is worth pausing briefly to reflect on what might have been Anne&#x27;s fate had &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; been re-published with &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; so that critics could re-acquaint themselves with Anne&#x27;s greater novel and so that critics could take that opportunity to measure the substantial artistic growth between the two novels.&quot; Langland argued that the heroines in Anne&#x27;s novels influenced those of Charlotte, and named Anne among the first women writers to adopt a woman as narrator. Langland concluded that &quot;if Charlotte Brontë was radical in claiming sexual identity for women, then Anne Brontë was radical in claiming professional identity for women.&quot; Robert Liddell, noting Anne&#x27;s apparent distaste for Romantic tradition, claimed that &quot;The Tenant&quot; criticized both Branwell&#x27;s life and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Edward Chitham in &quot;A Life of Anne Brontë&quot; (1991) also juxtaposed the novels of Anne and her sisters&#x27;. He stated that in Anne&#x27;s view &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; exhibited elements which she called in the preface to the second edition of &quot;The Tenant&quot; a &quot;soft nonsense&quot;, thus making &quot;almost an accusation against Emily&quot;. Unlike Chitham and Liddell, Maria H. Frawley identified the central element in &quot;The Tenant&quot; as the criticism of 19th century domestic ideology that encouraged women to &quot;construct themselves as ethereal angels of morality and virtue&quot;. Betty Jay, analyzing Helen&#x27;s marital experience, concluded that &quot;The Tenant&quot; &quot;not only demonstrates that the individual is subject to powerful ideological forces which delineate his or her place within culture and society, but that there are ways in which these forces can be subverted and resisted by those who suffer as a result. In a narrative which dramatizes the complex interplay between subject and society by focusing on the marital experience of a woman, Brontë highlights the extent to which the internal and supposedly private realms of desire and domesticity are also intensely political.&quot;

&quot;The Tenant&quot; has established its reputation as a landmark feminist text. In her 1996 introduction to the novel, Stevie Davies called it &quot;a feminist manifesto of revolutionary power and intelligence&quot;. The novel&#x27;s framing structure, long dismissed as faulty, started to get acclaim as a fitting narrative device, essential to Anne&#x27;s critical and artistic purposes.

On 5 November 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Mutilated text==
Although the publishers respected Charlotte&#x27;s wishes, shortly before her death in 1854 the London firm of Thomas Hodgson issued a one-volume edition of &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. Hodgson performed extensive editing of the novel, removing many sections, including the chapter headings and the opening letter, that starts with: &quot;To J. Halford, Esq. Dear Halford, When we were together last...&quot; Other omissions ranged from single words to almost complete chapters (such as the 28th); some sections were completely rearranged in an attempt to compensate for the omissions.
Most subsequent English editions, including those eventually produced by Charlotte&#x27;s publisher, Smith, Elder &amp; Co., followed this mutilated text. These copies are still prevalent today, despite notes on their covers claiming them to be complete and unabridged. In 1992, Oxford University Press published the Clarendon Edition of the novel, which is based on the first edition, but incorporating the preface and the corrections presented in the second edition.

==Adaptations==

;Radio show version
Ten episodes aired from 28 November to 9 December 2011 on &quot;BBC Radio 4&quot;, with Hattie Morahan as Helen, Robert Lonsdale as Gilbert and Leo Bill as Arthur.

;Television versions
The novel has twice been adapted for television by the BBC. The first version, made in 1968, starred Janet Munro, Corin Redgrave and Bryan Marshall. Tara Fitzgerald, Toby Stephens, Rupert Graves and James Purefoy starred in the second version, made in 1996.

;Theatre and musical versions
The novel was adapted as a three-act opera at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with music composed by Garrett Hope and libretto by Steven Soebbing.

The University of British Columbia adaptation of &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; premiered in October 2015, adapted by Jacqueline Firkins and directed by Sarah Rogers.

In 2017 the novel was adapted by Deborah McAndrew and directed by Elizabeth Newman. The production opened in the Octagon Theatre, Bolton and then moved into York Theatre Royal.

The 2022 adaptation by Emme Hoy premiered at Roslyn Packer Theatre in Sydney, Australia on June 21. The production was directed by Jessica Arthur.

Literary adaptations

&quot;The Woman Who Ran&quot; (2016) by Sam Baker is a modernized retelling.

==References in culture==
In the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; Christmas special (2011), &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; is the book title acted out by Lady Mary Crawley in the Christmas charade.

The story of Helen Graham is mentioned in Elizabeth George&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;A Great Deliverance&quot;. Her name is also used as a secret code.

Tina Connolly&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Copperhead&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. The name of the heroine is Helen Huntingdon and she also has a disastrous marriage.

Sam Baker&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;The Woman Who Ran&quot; takes inspiration from radical themes of Anne&#x27;s novel. The heroine is a woman also called Helen, who she hides from her past (in an abusive marriage) in a present-day Yorkshire village.

In the 2018 &quot;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&quot; film adaptation, Juliet Ashton (Lily James), argues about the cultural significance of &quot;The Tenant&quot;: &quot;In &quot;Wildfell Hall&quot;, Anne Brontë laid bare the essential imbalance of power between men and women in the suffocating hierarchical structure of Victorian marriage.&quot;

The phrase &quot;tied to the apron strings&quot; was coined in the novel: &quot;Even at his age, he ought not to be always tied to his mother&#x27;s apron string.&quot;

<doc id="194871" wikidata="Q7875716" url="?curid=194871" title="USS Yorktown (1839)">
<text>The first USS Yorktown was a 16-gun sloop-of-war of the United States Navy. Used mostly for patrolling in the Pacific and anti-slave trade duties in African waters, the vessel was wrecked off Maio, Cape Verde in 1850.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Yorktown&quot; was one of six war ships authorized to be constructed by The Congressional Act of 3 April 1837. The first of this group was &quot;Princeton&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s first screw steamer. The other five became the third-class sloops &quot;Yorktown&quot;, , , &quot;Marion&quot;, and and were built to the design of John Lenthall. She was laid down in 1838 by the Norfolk Navy Yard, launched on 17 June 1839, and commissioned on 15 November 1840, Commander John H. Aulick in command.

==Pacific sailing==
&quot;Yorktown&quot; departed Hampton Roads on 13 December 1840, bound for the Pacific. After calling at Rio de Janeiro from 23 January to 5 February 1841, the sloop rounded Cape Horn and arrived at Valparaíso, Chile, on 20 March 1841.

The ship operated along the Pacific coast of South America until 26 May, when she sailed from Callao, Peru, bound for the Pacific isles. Looking after the interests of the American whaling industry and of the nation&#x27;s ocean commerce, she called at the Marquesas, the Society Islands, New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands. After completing her mission in the South and Central Pacific, she departed Honolulu on 6 November and headed for the coast of Mexico. &quot;Yorktown&quot; called at Mazatlán before heading south to resume operations along the coast of South America. She continued her cruising – primarily out of Callao and Valparaíso – through the early fall of 1842, when she departed Callao on 23 September, bound for San Francisco, where she arrived on 27 October.

Shifting to Monterey on 11 November, the sloop called again at Mazatlán on the 22nd before she proceeded to Valparaiso. &quot;Yorktown&quot; remained at that port until she got underway on 2 May 1843 for the east coast of the United States. After rounding Cape Horn and calling at Rio de Janeiro, she arrived at New York on 5 August. Six days later, the sloop was decommissioned.

==African slave duty==
Placed in active service once more, on 7 August 1844, with Cdr. Charles H. Bell in command, &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed New York on 11 October, bound for Funchal, Madeira. After proceeding thence to Porto Praya, the sloop joined the Africa Squadron on 27 November.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; ranged up and down the west coast of Africa, going as far south as Cape Town, Cape Colony, as she labored to curtail the slave trade. In the course of her patrols, the vigilant sloop captured slave-ships &quot;Pons&quot;, &quot;Panther&quot;, and &quot;Patuxent&quot;. On 2 May 1846, Yorktown departed Porto Praya and returned to the east coast of the United States, reaching Boston on the 29th. There, on 9 June, the sloop was once again decommissioned.

Subsequently recommissioned at Boston, she sailed on 22 November 1848 for her second deployment with the African Squadron. On board at this time as acting Master was future Confederate Navy commander William Harwar Parker. Still engaged in hunting down slave ships, &quot;Yorktown&quot; cruised along the African coast, carefully observing each ship she encountered for any sign of the illicit traffic in human flesh.

==Sinking==
On 30 August 1850 &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed from Cape Palmas, Liberia for the Cape Verde Islands where she was to be relieved by her sister ship the &quot;Dale&quot;. On 6 September 1850, she struck an uncharted reef about a mile off the northern coast of Maio Island in the Cape Verde Islands. Although the ship broke up in a very short time, not a life was lost in the wreck.

The crew of &quot;Yorktown&quot; lived on Maio Island for over a month which, according to Parker, relaxation was the norm and the crew did little more than &quot;relax and play in donkey races.&quot; On 8 October, the arrived to pick up the crew and they were transferred to the which sailed for Norfolk, arriving in December 1850.

==Discovery==
In 1999, the Portuguese company &quot;Arqueonautas Worldwide S.A.&quot; recovered various articles from the wreck of the &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which were subsequently auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in London. In early 2001, the U.S. Department of Justice informed Sotheby&#x27;s that under United States law (principally the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and subsequently the 2005 Sunken Military Craft Act) all wrecks of ships and aircraft remain the property of the U.S. Government. Sotheby&#x27;s returned the objects; which included cutlery, coins, sword hilts and scabbards, a powder flask, and various ship fittings.

<text>SAS Institute (or SAS, pronounced &quot;sass&quot;) is an American multinational developer of analytics and artificial intelligence software based in Cary, North Carolina. SAS develops and markets a suite of analytics software (also called SAS), which helps access, manage, analyze and report on data to aid in decision-making. The company&#x27;s software is used by most of the Fortune 500.

SAS Institute started as a project at North Carolina State University to create a statistical analysis system, in fact SAS originally stood for &quot;Statistical Analysis System&quot;, though it is no longer considered an acronym. It was originally used primarily by agricultural departments at universities in the late 1960s. It became an independent, private business led by current CEO James Goodnight and three other project leaders from the university in 1976.

SAS is one of the largest privately held software providers in the world, and the company&#x27;s software is used by most of the Fortune 500. The company&#x27;s revenue grew from $10 million in 1980 to $3.2 billion in 2022. Historically, it has spent a notably higher proportion of its annual revenue on research and development than most other software companies.

==History==

=== 1966–1979: Founding and early history ===
The Statistical Analysis System (SAS) began as a project at North Carolina State University&#x27;s agricultural department. It was originally led by Anthony James Barr in 1966, then joined by NCSU graduate student James Goodnight in 1967 and John Sall in 1973. In the early 1970s, the software was primarily leased to other agricultural departments in order to analyze the effect soil, weather and seed varieties had on crop yields. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health and later by a coalition of university statistics programs called the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations.

By 1976, the software had 100 customers and that year, 300 people attended the first SAS user conference in Kissimmee, Florida. Goodnight, Barr, Sall and another early participant, Jane Helwig, founded SAS Institute Inc. as a private company on July 1, 1976, in offices across the street from the university. Barr and Helwig later sold their interest in the company.

During its first year of operation, SAS adopted a tradition of polling users for suggestions to improve the software through the SASware Ballot. Many of the company&#x27;s employee perks, such as fresh fruit, reasonable work hours and free M&amp;M&#x27;s every Wednesday became part of its practices that first year. In the late 1970s, the company established its first marketing department.

=== 1980–2018 ===
SAS started building its current headquarters in a forested area of Cary, North Carolina in 1980. Later that year, it began providing on-site daycare in order to keep an employee who had planned to leave her job to care for her child at home. By 1984, SAS had expanded the benefits programs it offered to employees and their families, and begun building a fitness center, medical center, on-site cafe and other facilities. SAS became known as a good place to work and was frequently recognized by national magazines like &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, &quot;Working Mother&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot; for its work environment.

The company began its relationship with Microsoft and development for Windows operating systems in 1989. Shortly afterwards it established partnerships with database companies like Oracle, Sybase and Informix.

During the 1980s, SAS was one of Inc. Magazine&#x27;s fastest growing companies in America from 1979 and 1985. It grew more than ten percent per year from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. In 2007, SAS revenue was $2.15 billion, and in 2013 its revenue was $3.02 billion. By the late 1990s, SAS was the largest privately held software company. The Associated Press reported that analysts attributed the growth to aggressive research and development (R&amp;D) spending. It had the highest ratio of its revenues spent on R&amp;D in the industry for eight years, setting a record of 34 percent of its revenues in 1993, as it was working on a new menu-based interface. In 1998, a larger proportion of its revenue was spent on R&amp;D than at most other software companies; in 1997, this figure was more than double the industry average.

SAS created an education division in 1997 to create software for schools, including the newly formed Cary Academy. In 2003 the Bank of America Foundation purchased and donated licenses for the software to 400 schools in North Carolina. SAS funded its first advertising program in 2000 with a $30 million television and radio campaign.

The company considered making 25 percent of its ownership stake available on the stock market and providing employees with stock-options during the dot-com bubble before the following downturn, but ultimately chose not to. SAS was one of the few technology companies that did well during the downturn and hired aggressively to take advantage of available staff.

In 2009, SAS filed a lawsuit against World Programming Ltd., alleging World Programming System—a software product designed to use the features of the SAS language—violated their copyright as it was reverse engineered from the functionality of SAS Learning Edition. The European Court of Justice ruled that functionality and language elements were not protected and the case was discussed in Oracle v. Google

SAS introduced its first reseller program intended to grow sales with small to medium-sized businesses in 2006. Leading up to 2007, SAS provided funding and curriculum assistance to help start the Master of Science in Analytics program at nearby North Carolina State University. The company&#x27;s cloud-based products grew in revenues by 35 percent in 2014 and the construction of Building Q was completed late that year to house its corresponding operations.

In March 2014, SAS launched its SAS Analytics U initiative to provide free foundational technologies and support to teachers and students.

=== 2019–present ===
In 2019, SAS announced that it was investing $1 billion into further artificial intelligence R&amp;D, as part of a broader push to develop software in the fields of machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing. The investment will also fund related initiatives such as acquisitions and the creation of education programs to teach the public about the applications of AI. That year, SAS partnered with Nvidia to produce offerings related to AI and deep learning. Under that partnership, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries will support SAS&#x27; AI applications and models.

SAS partnered with Microsoft in 2020 to allow users to run their SAS workloads in the cloud with Microsoft Azure. This partnership has also facilitated co-engineering between the companies in the areas of generative AI and data management, such as integration between OpenAI and SAS&#x27; analytical systems.

SAS also partnered with TMA Solutions in 2020, with the latter consulting on AI adoption. That year, SAS launched the SAS Software Certified Young Professionals in collaboration with Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation with the goal of training 500 students in programming, machine learning and analytics through online courses.

In July 2021, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the semiconductor giant Broadcom was in talks to acquire SAS. In a July 13, 2021 email, SAS CEO Jim Goodnight stated that the company was not for sale.

In July 2021, SAS announced that it was preparing for an initial public offering (IPO). As of September 2023, the company had invested between $50 million and $60 million into internal preparations for its IPO, which was estimated to take place in 2025.

In May 2023, SAS announced its intentions to invest an additional $1 billion into AI applications for the banking, healthcare, and insurance industries over the next three years. The company&#x27;s chief technology officer Bryan Harris stated that &quot;[we] think this is where the second leg of growth of SAS over the next 50 years is going to be.&quot;

==Operations==
SAS Institute has grown in revenue each year since it was incorporated in 1976. It had a revenue of $3.2 billion in 2022. About 20-30% of the company&#x27;s revenues are spent on research and development, which is the highest ratio among software companies of its size. In 1994, &quot;Computerworld&quot; found that out of the world&#x27;s 50 largest software companies, SAS spent 2.5 times the industry average on R&amp;D. It had customers in 145 countries as of 2019. As of 2010 revenues come relatively evenly from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. According to the company&#x27;s 2014 financial reporting, its revenues are currently 46.7 percent from the Americas, 41.4 from Europe, Middle East and Africa, and 11.9 percent from Asia-Pacific. SAS has about 5,200 employees at its headquarters in Cary, North Carolina, 1,600 employees elsewhere in the US and 6,900 in Europe, Asia, Canada or Latin America. CEO James Goodnight owns about two-thirds of the company and co-founder John Sall owns the other one-third. In 2022, the company was included on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; list of the largest private companies in the United States, ranked by revenue. It was one of the largest privately held software providers in the world in 2023.

==Workplace==
SAS is well known for its workplace culture. The company was used as a model for workplace perks at Google and is taught as a case study in management seminars at Stanford. SAS was identified as a &quot;Best Company to Work For&quot; in Fortune&#x27;s annual rankings from the list&#x27;s inception in 1997 until 2021, but after slipping in rank has failed to make more recent lists. In 2014, SAS ranked No. 2 on the elite Top 25 World&#x27;s Best Multinational Workplaces list from Great Place to Work as well as No. 2 among Fortune&#x27;s 2014 Best Companies to Work For in the US. The company was No. 1 on Fortune&#x27;s US list in 2010 and 2011. In 2015, Fortune ranked SAS No. 4 on its annual list of best companies to work for in the US; in 2016, SAS was No. 8 on the same list. It is also regularly in &quot;Working Mother Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Best Companies for Working Mothers&quot; list.

===Benefits===
The SAS headquarters in Cary is situated on a 900-acre campus with various on-site services and amenities for employees. Buildings comprise about a third of the campus, while the remaining acreage is mostly green spaces and bodies of water which are accessible by trails. SAS offers on-site day care services to its employees for 850 children for about a third of the normal cost. Medical services are provided to employees and their families for free and 80% of the cost is covered for specialists. Employees are encouraged to work 35-hour weeks and have free access to a recreation and fitness center as well as life counseling services. It also hosts a summer camp for children and operates on-site cafeterias and cafes. 22.5 tons of M&amp;Ms are provided each year, in jars that are re-filled every Wednesday. Similar amenities are provided at its other offices besides its headquarters.

SAS spokespeople say its employee benefits are provided for business, not altruistic, reasons. The company evaluates new benefits using three criteria: whether it would benefit the company culture, whether it would serve a significant number of employees and whether it would save more money than is spent on it. According to academics, the company&#x27;s practices improve the loyalty, focus and creativity of its staff. Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from the Stanford Graduate School of Business estimated that the company saves $60–$80 million annually in expenses related to employee turnover. SAS has an annual employee turnover of three to five percent, while the software industry&#x27;s average is 20 to 25 percent. According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, the workplace culture has created &quot;intensely loyal&quot; staff who care about the company&#x27;s well-being. Even though there are unlimited sick days, the average employee takes only two. The 40,000 free medical visits provided to employees annually are estimated to cost the company US$4.5 million, but save it US$5 million due to the employee productivity lost when staff spend their work-hours in waiting rooms at other hospitals.

===Structure and culture===
SAS has a limited corporate hierarchy and an egalitarian culture. As the company grew it created new divisions, instead of layers of management, creating a flat, simple organizational structure. According to professor Jeffrey Pfeffer from Stanford, there are only three levels in the organization and CEO James Goodnight has 27 people who directly report to him. The organizational structure is fluid and employees can change roles rapidly.

Managers are involved in the day-to-day work with their employees. Employees are given a large extent of autonomy and developers are encouraged to pursue experimental product ideas. Input from customers guides the company&#x27;s marketing and software development. According to SAS, 80 percent of suggestions for product improvements are incorporated into the software. The dress code is informal. According to &quot;Fast Company&quot;, employees describe the environment as &quot;relaxed.&quot;

Employees are encouraged to do volunteer work and the company makes donation to non-profits where employees are involved. The company primarily focuses its philanthropic efforts on improving education. It funds pilot programs for new education models, donates laptops and provides free online software for classrooms called Curriculum Pathways. The company is a founding partner of the Watt Family Innovation Center at Clemson University, providing funding, access to software, and research.

== Acquisitions ==
==Software==

It develops, supports and markets a suite of analytics software also called SAS (statistical analysis system), which captures, stores, modifies, analyzes and presents data.

<doc id="194873" wikidata="Q1963621" url="?curid=194873" title="Allspice">
<text>Allspice, also known as Jamaica pepper, myrtle pepper, pimenta, or pimento, is the dried unripe berry of Pimenta dioica, a midcanopy tree native to the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, and Central America, now cultivated in many warm parts of the world. The name &quot;allspice&quot; was coined as early as 1621 by the English, who valued it as a spice that combined the flavours of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Contrary to common misconception, it is not a mixture of spices.

Several unrelated fragrant shrubs are called &quot;Carolina allspice&quot; (&quot;Calycanthus floridus&quot;), &quot;Japanese allspice&quot; (&quot;Chimonanthus praecox&quot;), or &quot;wild allspice&quot; (&quot;Lindera benzoin&quot;).

==Production==

Allspice is the dried fruit of the &quot;Pimenta dioica&quot; plant. The fruits are picked when green and unripe, and are traditionally dried in the sun. When dry, they are brown and resemble large, smooth peppercorns. Fresh leaves are similar in texture to bay leaves and similarly used in cooking. Leaves and wood are often used for smoking meats where allspice is a local crop.

Care must be taken during drying to ensure that the volatile oils in the fruit, such as eugenol, remain in the end products rather than being driven out by the drying process.

==Uses==

Allspice is one of the most important ingredients of Jamaican cuisine. Under the name &quot;pimento&quot;, it is used in Jamaican jerk seasoning, and traditionally its wood was used to smoke jerk in Jamaica. In the West Indies, an allspice liqueur is produced under the name &quot;pimento dram&quot;. In Mexican cuisine, it is used in many dishes, where it is known as pimienta gorda.

Allspice is also indispensable in Middle Eastern cuisine, particularly in the Levant, where it is used to flavour a variety of stews and meat dishes, as well as tomato sauce. In Arab cuisine, for example, many main dishes use allspice as the only spice.

In Northern European and North American cooking, it is an ingredient in commercial sausage preparations and curry powders, and in pickling.

In the United States, it is used mostly in desserts, but it is also responsible for giving Cincinnati-style chili its distinctive aroma and flavor. Allspice is commonly used in Great Britain, and appears in many dishes. In Portugal, whole allspice is used heavily in traditional stews cooked in large terracotta pots in the Azores islands.

In the United Kingdom it is a dominant flavour in the condiment Brown sauce.

Allspice is also one of the most used spices in Polish cuisine (used in most dishes, soups and stews) and is commonly known under the name English herb () since Britain was its major exporter.

Allspice is an important part of Swedish and Finnish cuisine. Whole allspice is used to flavour soups as well as stews such as Karelian hot pot. Ground allspice is also used in various dishes, such as minced meat sauces, Swedish meatballs, lutefisk and different cakes.

==Cultivation, trade and origin==
The allspice tree, classified as an evergreen shrub, can reach in height. Allspice can be a small, scrubby tree, quite similar to the bay laurel in size and form. It can also be a tall canopy tree, sometimes grown to provide shade for coffee trees planted underneath it. It can be grown outdoors in the tropics and subtropics with normal garden soil and watering. Smaller plants can be killed by frost; larger plants are more tolerant. It adapts well to container culture and can be kept as a houseplant or in a greenhouse.

Christopher Columbus became aware of allspice on his second New World voyage, and the plant soon became part of European diets. At the time, it was found only on the island of Jamaica, where birds readily spread the seeds. To protect the pimenta trade, Jamaican growers guarded against export of the plant. Many attempts at growing the pimenta from seeds were reported, but all failed. Eventually, passage through the avian digestive tract, whether due to the acidity or the elevated temperature, was found to be essential for germinating the seeds, and successful germination elsewhere was enabled. Today, pimenta grows in Tonga and in Hawaii, where it has become naturalized on Kauai and Maui. Jamaica remains the leading source of the plant, although some is grown by other countries in the same region. In modern times, Central American countries like Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Belize also play a large role in world exports of Allspice.

<doc id="194874" wikidata="Q14624" url="?curid=194874" title="Garam masala">
<text>Garam masala (Hindustani:- &quot;garam masālā&quot;, ) is a blend of ground spices originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in Indian, Pakistani, Nepalese, Bangladeshi, and Caribbean cuisines. It is used alone or with other seasonings. The specific combination differs by district, but it regularly incorporates a blend of flavours like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, cloves, bay leaves, star anise, and peppercorns. Garam masala can be found in a wide range of dishes, including marinades, pickles, stews, and curries.

==Ingredients==
The composition of garam masala differs regionally, with many recipes across the Indian subcontinent according to regional and personal taste, and none is considered more authentic than another. The components of the mix are roasted, then ground together or added to the dish for flavour just before finishing cooking.

A typical Indian version of garam masala contains (with Hindustani names in parentheses):
* Fennel (&quot;sauṅf&quot;)
* Indian bay leaves or malabathrum (&quot;tej pattā&quot;)
* Black and white peppercorns (&quot;kāli/safed mirch&quot;)
* Cloves (&quot;lauṅg&quot;)
* Cinnamon or cassia bark (&quot;dālacīnī&quot;)
* Mace (outer covering of nutmeg) (&quot;javitri)&quot;
* Black and green cardamom pods (&quot;ilāīcī&quot;)
* Cumin (&quot;jīra&quot;)
* Coriander seeds (&quot;dhaniā&quot;)
* Red chili powder (&quot;lāl mirch&quot;)

Some recipes call for the spices to be blended with herbs, while others call for the spices to be ground with water, vinegar, or other liquids to make a paste. Some recipes include nuts, onions or garlic, or small quantities of star anise, asafoetida, chili, stone flower (known as &quot;dagadphool, lichen&quot;), and &quot;kababchini&quot; (&quot;cubeb&quot;). The flavours may be blended to achieve a balanced effect, or a single flavour may be emphasised. A masala may be toasted before use to release its flavours and aromas. In the east of the Indian subcontinent, in West Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Bangladesh only cardamom, cinnamon and clove may be substituted for the assortment.

The Burmese &quot;masala&quot; () spice blend used in Burmese curries typically consists of ground cinnamon or cassia, cardamon, cloves, and black pepper.

<text>Captain Thomas Coram ( – 29 March 1751) was an English sea captain and philanthropist who created the London Foundling Hospital in Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Fields, Bloomsbury, to look after abandoned children on the streets of London. It is said to be the world&#x27;s first incorporated charity.

==Early life==
Thomas Coram was born in Lyme Regis, Dorset, England. His father is believed to have been a master mariner. He was sent to sea at age 11. As such, he never received a proper education. In 1694, he was settled in what is now Dighton, Massachusetts, then part of Taunton. Coram lived in Dighton for ten years, founding a shipyard there.

By a deed dated 8 December 1703, he gave of land at Taunton to be used for a schoolhouse, whenever the people should desire the establishment of the Church of England. In the deed, he is described as &quot;of Boston, sometimes residing in Taunton&quot;, and he seems to have been a shipwright. He gave some books to form a library at St. Thomas&#x27; Church, Taunton, one of which, a Book of Common Prayer given to him by Speaker Onslow, is preserved in the church.

In 1704, at the age of 36, he returned to London and helped to obtain an act of Parliament giving a bounty on the importation of tar from the colonies. He carried on business for some time. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), he commanded a merchant ship and acquired the epithet of captain. In 1712, he obtained a role in Trinity House, Deptford, a private corporation that combined public responsibilities with charitable purposes. In 1717, he unsuccessfully promoted the idea of founding a colony to be called &#x27;Georgia&#x27; in what is today Maine as a philanthropic venture. In 1719, he was stranded off Cuxhaven, when sailing for Hamburg in the &quot;Sea Flower&quot;, and the ship was plundered by the neighbouring inhabitants.

He became known for his public spirit. Old Horace Walpole (afterwards Lord Walpole) called him (18 April 1735) &quot;the honestest, most disinterested, most knowing person about the plantations he had ever talked with&quot;. He obtained an act of parliament taking off the prohibition upon deal from Germany and the Netherlands. In 1732, he was appointed one of the trustees for Georgia Colony, then founded through James Oglethorpe&#x27;s exertions.

In 1735, he brought forward a scheme for settling unemployed English artisans in Nova Scotia. The plan was approved by the board of trade and, after being dropped for a time, was carried out before Coram&#x27;s death. Brocklesby also states that on some occasion, he obtained a change in the colonial regulations in the interest of English hatters, and refused to take any reward from his clients except a hat.

==Foundling Hospital==

While living in Rotherhithe and regularly travelling into London to engage in his business interests (a journey of about ), Coram was frequently shocked by the sight of infants exposed in the streets, often in a dying state. He began to agitate for the foundation of a foundling hospital. This institution was to be a children&#x27;s home for children and orphans who could not be properly cared for. He laboured for seventeen years, and he induced many ladies of rank to sign a memorial. A charter, signed by King George II, was at last obtained for the Foundling Hospital in 1739 and considerable sums were subscribed. The first meeting of the guardians was held at Somerset House on 20 November 1739.
At a later court, a vote of thanks was presented to Coram, who requested that thanks should also be given to the ladies interested. Some houses were first taken in Hatton Garden, where children were first admitted in 1741. A piece of land was bought for £7,000 in Bloomsbury. Lord Salisbury, the owner, insisted that the whole of his ground &quot;as far as Gray&#x27;s Inn Lane&quot; should be taken; but he subscribed £500 himself.

The foundation stone of the hospital was laid on 16 September 1742. In October 1745, the west wing was finished and the children removed from Hatton Garden. Great interest was excited in the undertaking, especially by William Hogarth, who in May 1740 presented his fine portrait of Coram to the hospital. Hogarth also presented a picture of Moses with Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, and gave 157 tickets in the lottery for the &quot;March to Finchley&quot;, one of which won the prize. In addition, he introduced a portrait of Coram into an engraved power of attorney for receiving subscriptions to the hospital. Handel gave performances at the hospital in 1749 and 1750.

==Later life==
Coram continued to be invested in the hospital. Up until 1742, he continued to be elected to the General Committee. But at the May Day meeting in 1742 he received too few votes to qualify, and as a result no longer had any say in the management of the hospital. The reason why he was pushed out is not entirely clear. He was said to have spread defamatory rumours about two of the governors. Another possible reason is that he expressed criticism toward the way the hospital was run. 

In his later years, he advocated a scheme for the education of Native American girls in America. During his time in America, he lived and worked with Native Americans leading to an interest in promoting and supporting their education: specifically the girls. Despite the general view at the time that education was not as important for girls, he was of the opinion that it was just as important for them to receive an education, if not more:

This theme was also prevalent in his plans for the Foundling Hospital in that girls should also receive an education.

After the loss of his wife, he neglected his private affairs, and fell into difficulties. A subscription was raised for him. He told Brocklesby that as he had never wasted his money in self-indulgence, he was not ashamed to confess that he was poor. On 20 March 1749, an annuity of £161 was assigned to him, the Prince of Wales subscribing £21 annually. The pension was transferred on Coram&#x27;s death to Richard Leveridge, a retired admired singer.

==Family==
In his own words, Coram said he &quot;descended from virtuous good parentage on both sides.&quot; His mother died when he was very young in 1671. There is not much information on his father but he is believed to have been a master mariner. While in Massachusetts, he met and married his wife Eunice Waite. They were married in 1700 and had a happy marriage lasting until her death 40 years later. Despite Coram&#x27;s dedication to the children of the Foundling Hospital, they did not have any children of their own.

==Death and burial==
Coram died on 29 March 1751, aged 83, and was buried on 3 April in the chapel of the Foundling Hospital. An inscription was placed there, and a statue of him by William Calder Marshall was erected in front of the building a hundred years afterwards. Richard Brocklesby describes him as a rather hot-tempered, downright sailorlike man, of unmistakable honesty and sterling goodness of heart.

In 1935, the Foundling Hospital moved from Bloomsbury to new premises in Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, and the old Hospital building was demolished. A chapel was erected at the Berkhamsted Hospital with a crypt specially designed to hold Coram&#x27;s remains. In 1955, the building was sold and Coram&#x27;s remains were exhumed and moved to the Church of St Andrew, Holborn in London. The chapel still stands today, now part of Ashlyns School.

==Legacy==
Hogarth, a personal friend of Coram&#x27;s, was among the first governors of the Foundling Hospital. He painted a famous portrait of Coram (1740; reproduced in stipple by William Nutter [1754-1802] for R. Cribb in 1796) which can now be viewed at the Foundling Museum in London.

Together with some of his fellow artists, Hogarth decorated the Governors&#x27; Court Room, which contains paintings by Francis Hayman, Thomas Gainsborough and Richard Wilson. He contributed paintings for the benefit of the Foundation, and the Foundling Hospital became the first art gallery in London open to the public.

Handel allowed a concert performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; to benefit the foundation, and donated the manuscript of the Hallelujah Chorus to the hospital. He also composed an anthem specially for a performance at the Hospital, now called the &quot;Foundling Hospital Anthem&quot;.

The Foundling Hospital charity continues today and is known as Coram. The original site is also home to a seven-acre children&#x27;s park and play area, Coram&#x27;s Fields, which refuses entry to adults unaccompanied by children. Coram&#x27;s Fields is a registered charity and also provides children&#x27;s and youth services for the local community, including a Youth Centre and free Sports Programme.

In 2000, Jamila Gavin published a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Coram Boy&quot; about the Foundling Hospital. The book was adapted into a play by Helen Edmundson, which had its world premiere at the Royal National Theatre in London in November 2005 and subsequently had a brief run on Broadway.

<doc id="194882" wikidata="Q1412533" url="?curid=194882" title="Fines herbes">
<text>Fines herbes () designates an important combination of herbs that forms a mainstay of French cuisine. The canonical &quot;fines herbes&quot; of French &quot;haute cuisine&quot; comprise finely chopped parsley, chives, tarragon and chervil. These are employed in seasoning delicate dishes, such as chicken, fish, and eggs, that need a relatively short cooking period; they may also be used in a &quot;beurre blanc&quot; sauce for seasoning such dishes. &quot;Fines herbes&quot; are also eaten raw in salads.

==The classic mixture==

In 1903, the renowned chef Auguste Escoffier noted that dishes labeled &quot;aux fines herbes&quot; were sometimes being made with parsley alone. In his &quot;Culinary Guide&quot;, Escoffier insisted that:It is a mistake to serve, under the name &quot;Omelette aux fines herbes&quot;, an omelet in which chopped parsley furnishes the only aromatic note. This error is too widespread for us to hope to overturn it. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that an &quot;omelette aux fines herbes&quot; must contain: parsley, chives, and a little chervil and tarragon. Thirty-five years later, under the entry &quot;Fines Herbes&quot;, the authoritative &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; of 1938 conceded that, generally speaking, an &quot;Omelette aux fines herbes&quot; was still most frequently being seasoned only with chopped parsley, but repeated Escoffier&#x27;s admonition that it ought to contain a combination of fragrant herbs, &quot;such as, parsley, chervil, tarragon, and also chives&quot;. For in former times this was the traditional practice (&quot;la pratique ancienne&quot;), when &quot;to the aforementioned herbs, chopped mushrooms, and even truffles, would be added.&quot; 

Julia Child also echoes Escoffier: &quot;A mixture of fresh parsley, chives, tarragon, and chervil is called &quot;fines herbes&quot;&quot;, while Alan Davidson, author of &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, identifies chopped fresh parsley as the minimum basis of the &quot;fines herbes&quot; mix, with the addition of &quot;any (or all) of: chervil, tarragon, chives&quot;, noting that the number of different herbs to be used is not fixed. Food scientist Harold McGee&#x27;s definition limits the number to tarragon, chervil, chive, and omits parsley. McGee also recommends that the herbs be finely chopped using a sharp knife rather than a food processor, &quot;since food processors slice into herbs and introduce a lot of air and therefore aroma-altering oxygen.&quot;

==Substitutions==
A living tradition, such as cooking, is always subject to variation and re-creation. For example, in his memoirs, the late Pierre Franey, former chef at Le Pavillon and long-time &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist, vividly recalled his trepidation when as a teenaged apprentice chef, he was ordered to prepare a simple &quot;&quot;omelette aux fines herbes&quot;—three eggs, chervil, parsley, tarragon, chives—the first omelette I was assigned to prepare for paying guests, after a considerable amount of practicing on others.&quot; In his anxiety he almost spoiled the dish. Yet, in his accompanying recipe for Americans printed in the same book, Franey substitutes basil for the chervil, doubtless because especially in the United States, chervil, unless home-grown, can be very hard to obtain when fresh and is nearly useless when dried.

==As &quot;noble herbs&quot;==
In general, definitions of the &quot;fines herbes&quot; group in American cook books have tended to be somewhat elastic. James Beard&#x27;s &quot;Fireside Cookbook&quot; (1949), for example, contains a recipe for what he calls a &quot;Fines Herbes Bowl&quot;, a dip featuring chopped parsley, chives, dill, chopped green pepper and salt, mixed into a pint of sour cream. In his subsequent discussion of &quot;Salad Herbs&quot;, Beard lists: 1) Tarragon: &quot;The most pleasant salad herb ... Use the fresh if you can&quot;; 2) Chervil, which he calls &quot;delicate and subtle&quot;; 3) Fresh Dill, which Beard recommends especially for salads containing cucumber or cabbage; and 4) Sweet Basil: a &quot;a natural complement to tomatoes&quot;. Beard identifies these four herbs—tarragon, chervil, dill, and basil—as, &quot;the noblest of the salad herbs&quot;, noting parenthetically, however, that &quot;some people like to use a little thyme or rosemary.&quot; Finally, the basis of the French &quot;fines herbes&quot; lineup: parsley, although not one of Beard&#x27;s aforementioned &quot;noble&quot; salad herbs, yet &quot;adds much to many salad mixtures, although in a green salad it has perhaps less place.&quot;

==Versus robust herbs==

The &quot;fines herbes&quot; are sometimes contrasted with the more pungent or resinous &quot;robust herbs&quot; that appear in a &quot;bouquet garni&quot; and which, unlike &quot;fines herbes&quot;, release their flavor in long cooking. However, there is some inconsistency and overlap in terminology.

<doc id="194883" wikidata="Q5727732" url="?curid=194883" title="Cymbopogon">
<text>Cymbopogon, also known as lemongrass, barbed wire grass, silky heads, oily heads, Cochin grass, Malabar grass, citronella grass or fever grass, is a genus of Asian, African, Australian, and tropical island plants in the grass family.
Some species (particularly &quot;Cymbopogon citratus&quot;) are commonly cultivated as culinary and medicinal herbs because of their scent, resembling that of lemons (&quot;Citrus limon&quot;).
The name &quot;Cymbopogon&quot; derives from the Greek words (, &#x27;boat&#x27;) and (, &#x27;beard&#x27;) &quot;which mean [that] in most species, the hairy spikelets project from boat-shaped spathes.&quot; Lemongrass and its oil are believed to possess therapeutic properties.

== Uses ==
Citronella grass (&quot;Cymbopogon nardus&quot; and &quot;Cymbopogon winterianus&quot;) grow to about and have magenta-colored base stems. These species are used for the production of citronella oil, which is used in soaps, as an insect repellent (especially mosquitoes and houseflies) in insect sprays and candles, and aromatherapy. The principal chemical constituents of citronella, geraniol and citronellol, are antiseptics, hence their use in household disinfectants and soaps. Besides oil production, citronella grass is also used for culinary purposes as a flavoring.

=== Culinary ===

East Indian lemongrass (&quot;Cymbopogon flexuosus&quot;), also called Cochin grass or Malabar grass, is native to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand, while West Indian lemongrass (&quot;Cymbopogon citratus&quot;) is native to maritime Southeast Asia. While both can be used interchangeably, &quot;C. citratus&quot; is more suitable for cooking.

=== Folk medicine ===
In India, &quot;C. citratus&quot; is used as a medical herb and in perfumes. &quot;C. citratus&quot; is consumed as a tea for anxiety in Brazilian folk medicine, but a study in humans found no effect. The tea caused a recurrence of contact dermatitis in one case. Samoans and Tongans use mashed &quot;C. citratus&quot; (called &quot;moegalo&quot; and &quot;moengālō&quot; respectively) leaves as a traditional remedy for oral infections.

=== FDA classification ===

Lemongrass essential oil has been declared generally recognized as safe in food by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

<text>Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup (, ) is an international airport serving Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, as well as Zealand, the Øresund Region, and southern Sweden including Scania. In 2023 it is the largest airport in the Nordic countries.

As the Nordic countries&#x27; largest airport, it served close to 30 million passengers in 2024. It is one of the oldest international airports in Europe, the fourth-busiest in Northern Europe, and the busiest for international travel in Scandinavia.

The airport is on the island of Amager, south of Copenhagen city centre, and west of Malmö city centre, to which it is connected by the Øresund Bridge. The airport covers an area of . Most of the airport is in the municipality of Tårnby, with a small part in the city of Dragør.

The airport is the main hub out of three used by Scandinavian Airlines and is also an operating base for Sunclass Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Copenhagen Airport handles around 60 scheduled airlines, and has a maximum operation capability of 83 operations/hour, and a total of 108 jet bridges and remote parking stands. Unlike other Scandinavian airports, most of the airport&#x27;s passengers are international. In 2015, 6.1% of passengers travelled to and from other Danish airports, 83.5% to/from other European airports, and 10.4% were intercontinental passengers. The airport is owned by Københavns Lufthavne, which also operates Roskilde Airport. It holds 17,000 employees.

Copenhagen Airport was originally called Kastrup Airport, after the small town of Kastrup, now part of the Tårnby municipality. The formal name is still Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, to distinguish it from Roskilde Airport.

==History==


The airport was inaugurated on 20 April 1925 and was one of the first civil airports in the world. It consisted of a large, impressive terminal built of wood, a couple of hangars, a balloon mast, a hydroplane landing stage and a few grassy meadows that could be used as runways. The grass on the runways was kept short by sheep, which were shepherded away before take-offs and landings. From 1932 to 1939, takeoffs and landings increased from 6,000 to 50,000 and passenger number increased to 72,000. Between 1936 and 1939, a new terminal was built, considered one of the finest examples of Nordic functionalism. The terminal was designed by Vilhelm Lauritzen, who was considered a pioneer among architects, in terms not only of architecture and construction, but also of service and passenger comfort.

In the years of World War II, the Copenhagen airport was closed for civil operations except for periodic flights to destinations in Sweden, Germany, and Austria. In the summer of 1941 the first hard-surface runway opened. It was long and wide. When World War II ended in May 1945, Copenhagen had the most modern international airport in Europe, because the airport remained untouched by actual acts of war.

On 1 August 1947, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) was founded, an important event for the Copenhagen Airport, as Copenhagen was to be the main hub for the airline. Traffic increased rapidly in the first years SAS operated. On 26 January 1947, a KLM Douglas DC-3 &quot;Dakota&quot; crashed at the airport after stopping en route to Stockholm. 22 people on board died, including the Swedish prince Gustav Adolf and the American opera singer Grace Moore. In 1948, Copenhagen airport was third largest airport in Europe with 150 daily takeoffs and almost 300,000 passengers for the year. The airport continued its rapid growth. The terminal was expanded several times and new hangars were erected.

In 1954, Scandinavian Airlines began the world&#x27;s first trans-polar route, flying initially to Los Angeles. The route proved to be a publicity coup, and for some years Copenhagen became a popular transit point for Hollywood stars and producers flying to Europe – also the airport handled 11,000 tonnes of freight per year. In 1956, the airport handled 1 million passengers per year and won the award for the world&#x27;s best airport. The runways were lengthened and fitted with technically advanced equipment.

By 10 May 1960, when the new airport terminal (now Terminal 2) was inaugurated, the daily number of jet operations had increased to 28, and still traffic kept on growing. The large new airport terminal soon became too small, and in 1969 yet another huge expansion programme was launched. Domestic traffic was relocated to a new domestic terminal (the eastern part of Terminal 1). The (current) international terminal was supplemented with a new pier (C) and a separate arrivals hall (the building between Terminals 2 and 3). A new control tower and of additional runways allowed take-offs and landings to take place at the same time. When the comprehensive expansion was completed in 1972, the number of take-offs and landings exceeded 180,000 and there were more than eight million passengers.

Throughout the 1970s, airport traffic continued to grow, but the airport was not expanded further. A new large airport located at the island of Saltholm (with a connecting bridge to Denmark and Sweden) was on the drawing board. It would be a huge investment, and the proposal was evaluated thoroughly by many experts. In 1980, however, the Danish parliament instead decided to expand the capacity of Copenhagen airport to 20–22 million passengers by the year 2000. This solution was far cheaper than building a new airport and, because the new types of aircraft were less noisy, an airport on Saltholm did not offer a decisive environmental gain. In 1973, the airport handled 8 million passengers per year. The third (long) runway opened and the dual runway system (04L/22R-04R/22L) opened, strongly expanding the starts and landings capacity.

The expansion of the airport began in 1982, after the necessary period of planning. The intention was not to build Europe&#x27;s largest airport, but to build transit passengers&#x27; favourite airport. A stay at the airport was supposed to be an integral part of the travel experience. Efficiency and precision were obvious demands, but focus was also on generating an oasis where international travellers could relax: beautiful architecture, Scandinavian design, and pleasant, light, and comfortable surroundings with plenty of shops, restaurants, and other facilities providing enjoyment and pleasure. The new cargo terminal was built in the eastern area of the airport.

From 1984, SAS operated a marine link from the airport to Malmö, across the Øresund to a dedicated terminal in Malmö where luggage could be checked in. From 1984 to 1994, the service was operated by hovercraft, whereas from 1994 to 2000 catamarans were used. The marine link closed in 2000 due to the opening of the Øresund Bridge.

A number of important construction projects were completed in 1998: a pier connecting the domestic and international terminals; a new arrivals hall; new modern baggage handling facilities; an underground railway station with two large underground parking facilities with 2400 spaces opens; and above it all the spacious and impressive delta-shaped terminal (Terminal 3) with 17 million passengers capacity. The first stage of the new Pier D was completed in the spring of 1999.

On 1 July 2000 the Øresund Bridge opened which connects Denmark and Sweden by motorway and train. In 2001 the five-star Hilton hotel opened with 382 rooms. In 2006 for the first time in its history Copenhagen airport exceeded 20 million passengers and reached 20,900,000 passengers. In October 2007 the metro station opened, connecting the airport to the Copenhagen Metro. A new control tower opened in 2008 by Naviair as part of a major renovation of the ATC system. Airport officials announced plans to build a new low-cost terminal at the facility. On 31 October 2010 the new low cost terminal CPH Go opened by easyJet. In 2013 the airport handled a new record of 24,067,030 passengers. In 2014 CPH announced plans to increase capacity to 40 million passengers per year. It reached 30 million in 2018.

From late 2015, the airport became the first in Scandinavia to have a regularly scheduled A380 service after Emirates started operating the plane for its Copenhagen route.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the number of passengers fell dramatically during 2020. There were 7.525 million passengers this year, a majority of these in January and February when restrictions were yet not issued. The Group Annual Report 2020 showed 600 million DKK in deficit.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
Copenhagen Airport has two terminals for check-in, Terminals 2 and 3, which handle all flights and share a common airside passenger concourse as well as the arrivals section which houses customs and baggage claim and is physically located in Terminal 3. The airside is reached through a common security check located between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3.

The common airside passenger concourse is divided into piers, called A, B, C, D, E and F. Pier A and B are for flights inside Schengen only. Pier C is mostly for flights outside Schengen. Pier D is mostly for flights inside Schengen. The newest section, CPH Go, now called Pier F, dedicated to low-cost carriers opened in October 2010. So far, EasyJet, Transavia and Ryanair are the only airlines operating from this facility. An all new Terminal 4 has been discussed, but replaced by plans to expand the current facilities in appropriate increments. Copenhagen Airport says passengers have easy transfer possibilities.

Previously all domestic flights departed from Terminal 1, but from 29 March 2015 all departures have been collected in Terminals 2 and 3, and Pier C was expanded with another jetbridge at DKK 10M to facilitate the Emirates Airbus A380 to Dubai from December 2015, which was the first 2-class A380 carrying 615 passengers.

Pier E began construction in 2016 and was finished in May 2019 and opened on June 4, 2019.
SAS have moved most of its long-haul flight from pier C to E.

===Runways===
Despite the short distance to the city centre, approaches to, and departures from, the airport are above water due to the heading of the dual parallel runway system (04R/22L &amp; 04L/22R). Those runways point to the Øresund strait, close in both directions. The supplementary runway (30/12) oriented perpendicular to the main runways also has its approach or departure over Øresund in one direction. In the opposite direction, the 30/12 runway has noise restrictions as flight happens close over residential areas. Other advantages are the low altitude of the airport and absence of hills and high buildings below the approach directions. In case of fog, the runway 22L is equipped with an ILS category III C system, which allows modern aircraft to land in zero sight. Runway 04R/22L was widened by 4 meters in each side at DKK 30M to accommodate the Airbus A380, as part of a general concrete renewal program of DKK 300M.

==Other facilities==
The SAS traffic office resides at Copenhagen Airport South and in Dragør, together with a VIP terminal. The VIP terminal is actually the first terminal building, from the 1920s. It was moved about 2 km during the 1990s.

In 2015, Boeing opened a maintenance, repair, and operations facility at CPH, as proximity to daily operations is more important than high wages when checks have to be made every 1,000 flight hours.

==Ground transport==

Within the airport area, special airport buses depart every 15 minutes. The bus line connects all terminals and parking lot areas and uses in all 11 bus stops. The transport is free of charge for all. During a few night hours, the buses depart every 20 minutes instead.

===Train===
The airport&#x27;s railway station is located underneath Terminal 3 on the Øresund Railway Line.

* The station is served by trains operated by Skånetrafiken as part of the Øresundståg service between Copenhagen and different destinations across southern Sweden. Øresundståg operates regional and intercity trains to: Malmö, Gothenburg, Helsingborg, Kalmar, Karlskrona, and Kristianstad.
*DSB, the Danish national rail operator, have InterCity and InterCityExpress trains calling at this station. Domestic destinations include Esbjerg, Aarhus, Aalborg and Sønderborg.
* Swedish SJ runs several high-speed trains with daily departures between Copenhagen central station (København H) and Stockholm central station (Stockholm C) and Gothenburg (Göteborg). These trains all call at the Copenhagen Airport station (København Lufthavn/Kastrup).

===Metro===
Line M2 of the Copenhagen Metro links the airport with the city centre in around 15 minutes. The Metro station is two floors above the underground rail station and continues on elevated tracks until it goes underground after five stations. The metro trains run very frequently, in rush hours every four minutes, outside rush hours and on weekends every six minutes, and every 15/20 minutes at night. The metro runs to Kongens Nytorv station amongst other stations, where connections can be made to the City Circle that runs through the Østerbro, Nørrebro, Frederiksberg districts amongst other places in Copenhagen.

===Road===
* Movia buses 5C, 35, 36 and Gråhundbus line 999 all stop at the airport; bus 888, express-bus to Jutland, also stops at the airport. Movia bus 2A stops near the airport. There are long-distance buses to Sweden and Norway operated by Swebus: 820 to Oslo via Gothenburg and 832 to Uppsala via Stockholm. GoByBus and Bus4You also operate the same routes.
* The E20 motorway runs right by the airport. The E20 uses the toll road Øresund Bridge to Sweden. The airport has 8,600 parking spaces.

==Incidents and accidents==
*
*
* On 6 July 2022, a British Airways Airbus A320 caught fire as it was landing. Airport firefighters put out the fire with firefighting foam. People in the terminal buildings were able to record the footage.

<text>Wokingham ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Berkshire, England. It is the main administrative centre of the wider Borough of Wokingham. At the 2021 census the parish had a population of 38,284 and the wider built-up area had a population of 50,325.

== History ==


Wokingham means &#x27;Wocca&#x27;s people&#x27;s home&#x27;. Wocca was apparently a Saxon chieftain who may also have owned lands at Wokefield in Berkshire and Woking in Surrey. In Victorian times, the name became corrupted to &quot;Oakingham&quot;, and consequently the acorn with oak leaves is the town&#x27;s heraldic charge, granted in the 19th century. Geologically, Wokingham sits at the northern end of the Bagshot Formation, overlying London clay, suggesting a prehistorical origin as a marine estuary. The courts of Windsor Forest were held at Wokingham and the town had the right to hold a market from 1219. The Bishop of Salisbury was largely responsible for the growth of the town during this period. He set out roads and plots making them available for rent. There are records showing that in 1258 he bought the rights to hold three town fairs every year.

From the 14th to the 16th centuries, Wokingham was well known for its bell foundry which supplied many churches across the South of England. During the Tudor period, Wokingham was well known as a producer of silk. Some of the houses involved in these cottage industries are still to be seen in Rose Street. In the years 1643–44 Wokingham was regularly raided by both sides in the Civil War. These raids would involve the looting of livestock and trading goods, and over thirty buildings were burnt down, accounting for nearly 20% of buildings in the town at that time. It was not until the early 18th century that Wokingham had fully recovered.

Wokingham was once famous for its bull-baiting. In 1661 George Staverton left a bequest in his will giving two bulls to be tethered in the Market Place and baited by dogs on St. Thomas&#x27; Day (21 December) each year. The bulls were paraded around the town a day or two before the event and then locked in the yard of the original Rose Inn which was situated on the site of the present-day Superdrug store. People travelled from miles around to see the dangerous spectacle. A number of dogs would be maimed or killed during the event and the bulls were eventually destroyed. The meat and leather were distributed amongst the poor people of the town. Some of the spectators also sustained fatal injuries. In 1794 on the morning after the bull-baiting Elizabeth North was found dead and covered with bruises. In 1808, 55-year-old Martha May died after being hurt by fighters in the crowd. The cruel &#x27;sport&#x27; was prohibited by the Corporation in 1821 but bulls were still provided at Christmas and the meat distributed to the poor. Bull-baiting was banned by Act of Parliament in 1833.

In 1723, the &#x27;Black Act&#x27; was passed in Parliament to make it an offence to black one&#x27;s face to commit criminal acts. It was named after an infamous band of ruffians, known as the &#x27;Wokingham Blacks&#x27;, who terrorised the local area until 29 of them were arrested after fighting a pitched battle with Grenadier Guards in Bracknell. The formerly important industry of brick-making has given way to software development, light engineering and service industries, and the population has greatly increased.

== Governance ==
There are two tiers of local government covering Wokingham, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Wokingham Town Council and Wokingham Borough Council. The town council is based at Wokingham Town Hall in the Market Place, which was built in 1860 on the site of an earlier guildhall. The borough council is also based in the town, having its headquarters at Shute End.

Wokingham forms part of the wider Wokingham constituency. Its MP is Clive Jones, a Liberal Democrat, who won the seat at the 2024 general election.

===Administrative history===
Wokingham was historically part of the ancient parish of Sonning. Wokingham became a chapelry in the Middle Ages; its church of All Saints was built in the 14th century, probably on the site of a 12th-century chapel. The chapelry of Wokingham was a separate civil parish from an early date, but remained part the ecclesiastical parish of Sonning until 1812.

The town was also an ancient borough. Its date of becoming a borough is unknown, but it may have followed the grant of rights to hold a market at Wokingham to the Bishop of Salisbury (as lord of the manor of Sonning) in 1219. The town&#x27;s first known charter was issued by Elizabeth I in 1583. The civil parish of Wokingham was subdivided into three townships, being Wokingham North, Wokingham South, and a Wokingham township covering the central part of the town, the latter township being presumed to correspond to the original borough. The Wokingham North township covered the area north-east of the town centre, including All Saints&#x27; Church and the Ashridge and Dowlesgreen areas; that township was a detached part of Wiltshire until it was transferred to Berkshire under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

By the 1830s, the borough extended beyond the Wokingham township to cover most of the parish. The borough was left unreformed when most ancient boroughs were converted into municipal boroughs in 1836. The borough corporation continued to exist, but as Wokingham was not a municipal borough, local government functions were gradually given instead to the board of guardians of the Wokingham poor law union. The Municipal Corporations Act 1883 directed that unreformed boroughs such as Wokingham were either to be converted into municipal boroughs under a new charter by 1886, or would be abolished. Wokingham then secured a new charter converting it into a municipal borough in 1885. A new borough boundary was drawn, covering the built up area as it then was and some immediately adjoining areas.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries. The parish of Wokingham was therefore split into a &#x27;Wokingham Within&#x27; parish covering the same area as the borough, and a Wokingham Without parish covering the parts of the old parish outside the borough boundary.

The municipal borough of Wokingham was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area merging with the surrounding Wokingham Rural District to become a new non-metropolitan district called Wokingham. District-level functions formerly performed by the borough council passed to the new Wokingham District Council. A successor parish called Wokingham covering the area of the former borough was created in 1974, with its council taking the name Wokingham Town Council. Wokingham District Council became a unitary authority in 1998 when it took over county-level functions from the abolished Berkshire County Council.

== Geography ==

Wokingham is on the Emm Brook in the Loddon Valley in central Berkshire situated west of central London. It sits between the larger towns of Reading and Bracknell and was originally in a band of agricultural land on the western edge of Windsor Forest. The soil is a rich loam with a subsoil of sand and gravel. Wokingham has a town centre, with main residential areas radiating in all directions. These include Woosehill to the west, Emmbrook to the northwest, Dowlesgreen, Norreys, Keephatch and Bean Oak to the east, and to the south Wescott and Eastheath. Older names include Woodcray and Luckley Green.

Wokingham has grown extensively since the mid-20th century. Woosehill and Dowlesgreen were built on farmland in the late 1960s and early 1970s, along with Bean Oak. Keephatch was built in the early 1990s. The Norreys Estate was built in the 1960s; however, Norreys Avenue is the oldest residential road in that area, having been built in the late 1940s as emergency housing following the Second World War. Norreys Avenue has a horseshoe shape and occupies the site of the demolished Norreys Manor. Much of the road contains 1940s-style prefabricated houses, although there are some brick houses along with three blocks of 1950s police houses.

In 2010, the council set up WEL (Wokingham Enterprise Limited) to manage a £100m regeneration project to redevelop the town centre with new retail, leisure and residential facilities, parking, roads and open spaces. Several major expansion projects around the town are planned over the next decade, including a major redevelopment of the town centre, new north and south relief roads and at the former military base at nearby Arborfield Garrison. As of 2015, the redevelopment of the railway station and surrounding area is complete, and large scale housing construction is underway to the north-east and south-east of the town.

The Wokingham built up area now extends beyond the parish boundary. Following the 2021 census, the Office for National Statistics has defined a Wokingham built up area which covers most of the parish of Wokingham and parts of neighbouring parishes, notably Finchampstead to the south and Barkham to the south-west.

== Transport ==
The A329(M) motorway, accessible from the east of town, connects Wokingham to Reading and the rest of the motorway network at junction 10 of the M4. The Wokingham junction is where the A329(M) ends and becomes the A322, for Bracknell and the M3.

Wokingham railway station is at the junction of the Waterloo to Reading line with the North Downs Line. South Western Railway manages the station and provides services, along with Great Western Railway.

Most local bus services are provided by Thames Valley Buses, but the services from Wokingham to Reading and Bracknell are operated by Reading Buses, after First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley closed their Bracknell depot in the summer of 2015. There is also a football bus run on Reading FC match days by Stagecoach South to the Madejski Stadium.

==Media==

== Literature ==

In the 18th century, the Ballad of Molly Mogg was written in Wokingham. Molly was the barmaid daughter of the publican of the old Rose Inn (not on the site of the present one). She was well known to local Binfield man, Alexander Pope, who, during a storm, found himself stranded at the inn with his friends, Gay, Swift and Arbuthnot. They wrote the ballad extolling her virtues to pass the time. Wokingham is the setting of Lars Iyer&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Nietzsche and the Burbs&quot;. The character of Tom the chimney sweep in Charles Kingsley&#x27;s classic childhood story &quot;The Water Babies&quot; was based on the life and times of a Wokingham boy called James Seaward, who was a boy sweep in Victorian times. In his later years, Seaward swept the chimneys at Charles Kingsley&#x27;s home at the Rectory in Eversley, Hampshire. Seaward was elected Alderman of Wokingham from 1909 until his death in 1921. He had 12 children. The Water Babies are the subject of Wokingham&#x27;s first public sculpture, installed in 1999, which graces the upper-level entrance to Wokingham Library.

== Film ==
The 1971 film &quot;See No Evil&quot;, also released under the title &quot;Blind Terror&quot;, was filmed in and around Wokingham, with scenes shot at the since-redeveloped Wokingham railway station. Scenes for ITV series &quot;Primeval&quot; were filmed at Wokingham&#x27;s Red Lion pub.

<doc id="194887" wikidata="Q957105" url="?curid=194887" title="Sandefjord Airport, Torp">
<text>Sandefjord Airport, Torp (; ) is a minor international airport located northeast of Sandefjord and south of Oslo in Norway. The airport features a runway aligned 18/36. Torp partially serves as a regional airport for Vestfold and in part as a low-cost airport for Eastern Norway and the capital, Oslo. Widerøe have a base at Torp, serving both domestic and shorter International flights. It also sees scheduled flights by airBaltic, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Scandinavian Airlines, and Norwegian Air Shuttle. As of 2021, it was the second-largest airport in eastern Norway in terms of flights after Rygge shut down in 2016.

The airport was built largely with NATO funding as one of several bases to be used by the United States Air Force in case of war. Construction started in 1953 and the airport was opened on 2 July 1956. By then, the military interest in the airport had dwindled. Civilian flights commenced in 1958, and in 1960, a municipal airport company was established to run a civilian sector. Vestfoldfly started operations the following year, and through a series of name changes and acquisitions has become the basis for Widerøe&#x27;s operations at Torp. International services commenced in 1985 and Mediterranean charter services in 1992. The airport expanded in the 1960s and in 1997 became a Ryanair destination, which marketed it as an airport serving Oslo as Oslo Torp and Oslo South. The airport markets itself as TORP Sandefjord Airport ().

The main entry road from European route E18 traverses the birch tree forests of Fokserød Nature Preserve.

==History==

===Establishment===
Following the end of the Second World War and Norway&#x27;s subsequent membership in NATO, it became strategically important to build several new air stations in the country. This was based on a United States analysis from 1951, carried out by General Robert K. Taylor, which intended to station three wings, each of 75 aircraft, in Denmark and Norway. Each wing would have about 3,000 permanently stationed American personnel. Norwegian policy prohibited permanent stationing of foreign military personnel on Norwegian soil, but allowed the United States to build air stations that would be suitable for refueling before attacking targets within Eastern Europe. There were two main strategies that NATO intended to use that would require a new military air station in Southern Norway. The first was the &quot;polar strategy&quot;, which involved NATO aircraft flying nuclear weapons into the Soviet Union. This would require refueling stations in Norway, but only about twenty permanently stationed personnel. The second was to station aircraft to allow a flanking maneuver if Soviet troops were to attack Central Europe.

Negotiations between NATO, the United States and Norway were initiated on 27 March 1951. The United States wanted to own and operate the air stations itself, and use the stations for preemptive strikes towards the Soviet Union. At the time, air stations were available for use at Sola, Gardermoen, Lista and Ørland, but more capacity would be needed. On 24 November, the United States proposed converting Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg into an air force station. NATO dedicated NOK 48 million to rebuild the airport. The issue was discussed by Parliament on 4 March 1952 along with several other proposals to build air stations or expand airports to meet NATO&#x27;s needs, namely Gardermoen, Jarlsberg, Lista, Ørland, Bardufoss and Rygge. The legislature approved funding the program with NOK 92 million of the total NOK 277.6 million budget. In May 1952, Prime Minister Oscar Torp informed United States General Dwight D. Eisenhower that he intended to try to convince Parliament to change the Norwegian base policies to allow permanent stationing of foreign troops. This was not successful, and Parliament would not change the policy. Instead, the politicians hoped the American fighters based in Denmark would defend Norway.

Closer investigations of Jarlsberg showed that the airport was not suitable for expansion. The airport had been expanded in 1950, receiving a runway. An air station for Republic F-84 Thunderjet fighter jets would require a runway, and due to surrounding hills this was not possible at Jarlsberg. Instead, the military looked at Langåker and Torp as possible locations. However, the military did note that Jarlsberg would be easier to defend, but that the defensibility was correlated to the rugged terrain that made expansion difficult. Torp was also preferred due to its close proximity to the European Route E18, and the Vestfold Line and Råstad Station. The choice of location was approved by NATO on 6 September 1952, and by the Cabinet of Norway on 12 September. It was unanimously passed by Parliament on 18 October, with only Torgeir Andreas Berge speaking up against the location. Berge, who lived within the approach area of the airport, was concerned about noise pollution affecting the local population.
The government expropriated the necessary land in February 1953. This covered , of which was forest, was fields and was pasture. About half the area was in the municipality of Stokke, the rest in the former municipality of Sandar. Thirty-seven land-owners were affected, receiving a combined compensation NOK 3.75 million. The builder was the Norwegian Defence Estates Agency and the main contractor was Astrup &amp; Aubert. Other major contractors were Lo-Wi-Co, who did most of the explosives, and Byggmester Thor Kandal jr., who built the buildings. A pumping station for fuel was built at the shore at Bogen, and a pipeline built to the air station. The fuel was transported to Bogen with small tank ships from Vølle and later Slagentangen. This system was built by the United States, and was in use until 1993. The runway and taxiway were built in concrete. Up to twenty people worked on the construction at any time. The official opening occurred on 2 July 1956, when two F-84s landed at 11:00.

===First civilian operation===

The interest to use Torp as an air station dwindled during the 1950s. Norway did not need the station for regular stationing of aircraft, and the United States did not need it as long as Norway did not allow permanent stationing of foreign troops. In October 1956, the military stated that they did not mind if Torp also inaugurated a civilian sector. The municipalities established committee, and on 2 October 1957 the Ministry of Transport and Communications granted permission to establish a municipal civilian sector at Torp. At the time, Jarlsberg was still being used for scheduled services to Vestfold, and the plans to open Torp as a civilian airport met political resistance from Tønsberg. The civilian sector would cost NOK 900,000, including a terminal building, a control tower, small maintenance facilities and a tarmac. A limited company, Andelslaget Torp flyplass, was established on 24 October 1958. In addition to the municipalities of Stokke and Sandar, several local companies and private individuals bought shares. The company changed its name to AS Torp Flyplass in 1959.

The first civilian aircraft to land was a Douglas DC-3 from Fred. Olsen Airtransport in 1958. The first scheduled flight was a Braathens SAFE Fokker F27 on 13 October, a route that flew daily from Oslo along the South Coast to Stavanger. The construction was completed on 15 September 1959 and the airport was officially opened on 5 October. On 16 October, both Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen were closed due to fog, and eight scheduled aircraft were rerouted to Sandefjord. The name of the company was changed to AS Sandefjord Lufthavn in 1960, and the airport named Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Local patriots had expected Braathens SAFE to relocate their route from Jarlsberg to Torp after the opening of the airport, but this was not carried out. Braathens SAFE received concession in 1960 to fly from Oslo via Sandefjord and Kristiansand to Aalborg in Denmark twice a week. The service was terminated after a single season due to Scandinavian Airlines taking over the route, and removing Sandefjord from the schedule.

===Military activity===
NATO decided in 1957 to build arsenals for nuclear weapons in all member countries, including Norway. Because the weapons were to be operated only by American personnel, this was in violation with Norwegian base policy. However, foreign personnel was allowed to be based in Norway during war, and therefore infrastructure would be allowed to be built in Norway to allow nuclear weapons to operate from Norway in such a scenario. Norway approved that seven air stations, including Torp, would have conventional ammunition storages that could be converted to nuclear weapons storage facilities in war, and allow the weapons to be transported into Norway following the declaration of war. The arsenals were built underground in bedrock with reinforced concrete.

The arsenal caused massive local protests, and the municipal council made a declaration where it supported the concerns raised about the danger of an explosion. The protests were not taken consideration to, following a report from another division of the military that stated that the risk of an explosion was close to zero. Construction started in May 1961. The hangar that was built at Torp was used by Horten Flyfabrikk from 1956 to 1965. It had up to 270 employees and had previously been based at Jarlsberg. Marinens Hovedverft performed maintenance of a single aircraft in 1967, but terminated operations at Torp afterwards.

===Slow growth===
Vestfoldfly was established at Torp in 1961. It operated various charter services, including flights of newspapers.
During the 1960s, Vestfoldfly never received a concession for a regular, scheduled flight from Sandefjord to Oslo. The reason was that the Skien-based Fjellfly held the concession for the routes from Oslo to Sandefjord, Tønsberg and Skien. Fjellfly never used its landing rights at Sandefjord, but nevertheless still hindered Vestfoldfly from starting a competing route. The municipalities of Sandefjord and Sandar merged in 1968, giving the Sandefjord a 93.11 percent ownership in the airport. During the entire 1960s, the airport company lost money.

Vestfoldfly split in two in the late 1960s, creating an aviation school which remained in operation until 1999. The other activity was renamed Norsk Flytjeneste. In 1969, Norsk Flytjeneste and Jotun, a large Sandefjord-based industrial company, established Penguin Air Service, where Norsk Flytjeneste owned 25 percent of the shares. Penguin Air Service company bought a six-seat Piper PA-31 Navajo and started charter services for Jotun. In 1975, Bugge Supplyship also joined the joint venture and a second aircraft was bought. Most of the traffic was for the oil industry to Stavanger.

Nordic Air was established in 1970 and commenced cargo charter services out of Torp. They remained in service until 1973. Nor-Fly started operating from Sandefjord in 1974. The airline at first had a Douglas DC-3, and later four Convair 440. The company had been established in 1952, and started flights from Sandefjord to serve commuters and business travelers to Western Norway and the oil industry. The airline applied concessions for scheduled services, but these were rejected by the government. The airline was sold to Partnair in 1985. By the 1970s, the airport company was still losing money, and in 1978 the airport had 3,000 passengers. The following year, the airport had 7,800 passengers, but this fell to 5,400 in 1982.

By the 1980s, Norsk Air had up to four daily round to Stavanger. From 12 January 1984 the airline was permitted to fly these as scheduled flights. Services to Bergen Airport, Flesland started on 10 July. Soon there were four daily round trips to both cities, supplemented by charter trips operated by Penguin. Busy Bee started flights from Torp on 26 March 1984. It operated a single daily round trip from Sandefjord via Stavanger and Haugesund to Bergen. The company never made a profit on the service, and terminated it in 1991. This followed an agreement that one Fokker 50 aircraft was to be sold to Widerøe Norsk Air. Sandefjordbanken established a branch at the airport in 1985.

Norsk Flytjeneste opened their first international route, to Copenhagen Airport on 30 July 1985. It soon changed its name to Norsk Air. With the introduction of Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, Norsk Air established a route to Göteborg Landvetter Airport and to London Stansted Airport. Neither were profitable, and were quickly terminated. When the airline&#x27;s owners fell into financial distress and was bought by Widerøe in 1989. They renamed the company Widerøe Norsk Air. On 1 May 1996, Widerøe Norsk Air was merged with Widerøe and ceased to exist. After the merger, Widerøe phased out the Brasilias and replaced them with de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft.

===Expansion===
The airport company made a NOK 2.1 million profit in 1985. During the mid-1980s, local commercial interests stated that they wished for more activity at Torp. This led to a public debate about the structure and need for investments in the airport. Three main strategies were proposed: the municipality would sell the airport to private investors; the municipality, Vestfold County Municipality and private investors would take over operation of the airport; or the airport would be taken over—fully or in part—by the state-owned Civil Aviation Administration. In February 1986, Vestfold Industrial Association established the company I/S Vestfold Næringsliv for Torp (VNFT, renamed Vestfold Flyplassinvest in 1997). This company, along with the county municipality and Stokke Municipality, bought part of AS Sandefjord Lufthavn on 28 April 1987 through a private placement of NOK 18 million. This gave Sandefjord an ownership of 42.0 percent, Vestold 35.5 percent, VNFT 13.5 percent and Stokke 9.0 percent.

The new owners concluded that the airport needed a new control tower and a new terminal building. Construction was issued as a public tender in 1987, but the military decided to stop the plans. At this time, a debate about a new location for Oslo Airport had started. One of the proposals was to use Gardermoen, one of the two permanently used air stations in Eastern Norway. The air force was worried that they would have to abandon Gardermoen and relocate to Torp. It would be likely that this would give twenty or forty fighter jets stationed at Torp. The military expansion plans were not in line with the civilian ones. At the same time, the military felt that the existing terminal building was located too close to the arsenal, and that a new terminal had to relocate further away. The airport operators needed additional space. The old terminal had a capacity of 10,000 passengers; in 1984, it served 42,486, and in 1987, 100,907 passengers. By 1990, the issues related to Gardermoen had been resolved, and the military no longer had objections to expanding Torp.

The private placement in 1987 allowed sufficient financing of a new terminal building. It was a pointed building that was planned to have the largest possible surface facing the tarmac—to allow the highest possible number of aircraft to park. It was constructed in such a way that it could be easily expanded in both directions. The new terminal was completed in 1991 and cost NOK 47 million. This also included a tarmac, and expansion of the taxiway and parking for 300 cars. There was also a need to upgrade the runway, which had had no major maintenance since construction. The end of the Cold War had reduced the threat level and the military no longer saw a need to keep Torp at as high a level. However, the civilian airport operator needed the upgrades. They proposed that the airport operator advance the money, but this was rejected by the Defence Estates Agency. NATO decided that they had too many air stations, and was not willing to pay either. The airport operator still took the chance that the military would repay the advance, since it had done so in similar situation earlier. The runway was upgraded for NOK 10 million in 1989, but only NOK 1 million was refunded in 1993. The first charter flights from Torp were conducted in 1989. Saga started flights to Mallorca in 1992, as did Vingreiser. These are today part of MyTravel. Torp Café and Catering Service Partner in 1998.

Following the Oslo Airport localization controversy in the 1980s and early 1990s, Parliament decided to locate the new main airport for Eastern Norway at Gardermoen, north of Oslo. This caused Buskerud, Vestfold and Telemark to grow further from the main airport, strengthening the regional position of Torp. By 1990, the airport was again losing money, with a loss of NOK 2.1 million, but the passenger numbers were up to 137,279. The debate about ownership woke again in 1992, this time with the Civil Aviation Administration considering if it should purchase part of or all of the airport. In 1992 the airport had 142,983 passengers, and the Civil Aviation Administration estimated that the airport would have 280,000 passengers following the closing of Fornebu in 1998. Local politicians did not want to sell the whole airport to the state, and the Civil Aviation Administration was not interested in purchasing part of the airport, so a sale did not go through.

The air traffic employees in the control tower worked for the Civil Aviation Administration. In October 1991, they went on strike demanding that they receive better working conditions. However, the airport owner and the Civil Aviation Administration could not agree on who had the responsibility to build a new tower. Since 1987, the airport operator kept all landing fees, while the Civil Aviation Administration collected the navigation fees. The air force stated that it had no need for an upgrade to the airport, and was not willing to pay for further investments. The Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the Civil Aviation Administration had previously decided that the state would not give subsidies to Sandefjord Airport, and that such investments must be carried by the operating company. Plans were made, but construction was stopped by the military in 1991.

The next plan was launched in 1996, and parliament decided that the state would finance the new tower. However, when construction was to commence in 1998, the ministry decided that the tower instead should be financed by the airport operator. The ministry stated that this was because they did not want to use the limited state funds, that were entirely generated from user fees, to invest in airports that the state had chosen to not operate. It also stated that investments should be concentrated on security rather than increased capacity, and that the airport operating company had sufficient capital to finance the investments. Construction started in 1999 and was finished in 2001. The tower is identical to the one at Tromsø Airport and cost NOK 40 million.

===Low-cost airport===
The European aviation market was fully deregulated on 1 April 1997, and concession was no longer needed to fly internationally between countries within the European Economic Area. The Irish airline Ryanair wanted to use this to establish several routes from London Stansted Airport, including Oslo. They intended to market Sandefjord Airport as Oslo South (later Oslo Torp). Ryanair and Torp had meetings to discuss the matter, but the airport instead wanted SAS and Braathens SAFE to establish routes. However, neither of these were interested. To create pressure against Ryanair in the negotiations, the airport operator contacted EasyJet, who also considered flying from London to Torp. In the end, Ryanair was the only airline that established itself following the deregulation. The first Ryanair flight, with a Boeing 737-200, departed on 3 November 1997. The branding of Torp as Oslo caused a heated discussion between the Civil Aviation Administration, after the International Air Transport Association in 1998 placed Sandefjord Airport under the area code for Oslo.

Torp had 158,972 passengers in 1996 and the company lost NOK 1.3 million. In addition, a new private placement was made for NOK 3.5 million by the existing owners. The airport had 410,944 passengers in 1998 and made a profit of NOK 349,000. Sandefjord became the country&#x27;s tenth-largest airport. The airport grew to 684,431 passengers in 1999 and produced a profit of NOK 23.4 started a restaurant in the terminal building in 1991, which allowed them to provide catering to the airlines. The catering was taken over by Select Service Partner AS. The terminal was expanded to fit 1 million passengers annually, and a new parking house was built. From 1998, Sandefjord Airport strengthened itself in two directions. The commercial interests of Telemark declared that they would focus on using the larger Sandefjord Airport instead of Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. At the same time, the moving of Oslo Airport from Fornebu to Gardermoen made Torp a more viable regional airport. By 2000 the airport had 758,951 passengers. The duty-free store was operated by Norsk Air, later by Widerøe, until 1998, when it was taken over by SAS Catering. It was taken over by Jotunfjell Partners in 2006. The sheriff&#x27;s office in Sandefjord was responsible for border control at Torp until 1999. From then the airport has been a separate border control office, and by 2004 it had 23 employees. Since 2003 the custom&#x27;s office for Vestfold is located at Torp, and the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities has about fifty employees stationed.

Norwegian leisure airline &quot;ConTigo&quot; started charter flights using Boeing 727 on 3 November 1996, but terminated services after 22 December. Coast Air started flights from Sandefjord to Haugesund Airport, Karmøy twice daily from 26 October 1998. SAS started two daily flights to Copenhagen from 29 March 1999; these were taken over by Widerøe from 1 January 2002. Braathens, along with its partner KLM, started operating from Sandefjord. KLM offered Fokker 70 services to its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol three times daily from 1 May 1999 through their subsidiary KLM Cityhopper. Braathens started operating services with Boeing 737s to Stavanger and Bergen on 9 May, but terminated the services from 1 November due to low yield. Sun Air of Scandinavia, a franchise of British Airways, started flights from Torp to Billund Airport on 1 November 1999, but this was terminated in March 2000. GuardAir started flights from Torp to Ålesund Airport, Vigra, Kristiansand and Gothenburg in 1998, as well as moving the company&#x27;s head offices to Torp, but the airline went bankrupt in 2001.

===Development since the 2000s===
Swedish low-cost airline &quot;Goodjet&quot; started flights from Torp to Beauvais–Tillé Airport near Paris on 15 July 2002 using Airbus A320-200 aircraft. The airline terminated all services on 6 December of the same year.

Ryanair commenced flights to Glasgow Prestwick Airport on 4 April 2002. The same year, the airport expanded the international arrival section, and the airport passed one million annual passengers, and the airport is the seventh largest in the country. The profit had sunk to NOK 9.3 million. A new international terminal was opened in 2003. On 4 April, Ryanair started a service to Stockholm Skavsta Airport. The airport had 1,084,244 passengers in 2004, and a revenue of NOK 163.2 million. A survey conducted in 2004 showed that 64 percent of the passengers at Torp were tourist rather than business travelers, about twice the level of other airports. The same year, both Widerøe and Ryanair had 450,000 passengers, while KLM had 80,000. The largest destination was London with 250,000 passengers, followed by Copenhagen and Frankfurt with 120,000.

During the planning of high-speed upgrade of the line, plans called to move the line to create a station integrated in the airport terminal, as had been done with Oslo Airport Station and Trondheim Airport Station. However, as the construction of a new Vestfold Line was put on hold, an intermediate solution was found to reopen Råstad Station, and offer a shuttle bus to the airport. On 16 May 2007, Vestfold County Municipality announced that they would forward the investment costs of NOK 7 million for the new station, with a payback from the National Rail Administration by 2012. The latter would build, own and operate the station. The station opened on 21 January 2008, and the new platform is located on the east side of the tracks. The old station building, location in the west side, has been converted into a museum. During the first year, 80,000 passengers used the station, sufficient to make the NOK 4.5 million used by NSB on the shuttle bus profitable.

As a decision was made to close Moss Airport, Rygge by 30 October 2016, Ryanair announced in July 2016 it would relocate several routes from Moss to Sandefjord by then.

On 10 January 2024, after almost 25 years of operations at the airport, the leadership of KLM announced that they would terminate the airlines&#x27; route to Amsterdam, effective from 31 March 2024. According to KLM, the decision was made due to the coming slot restrictions at Schiphol, as well as that the ticket sales hadn&#x27;t reached a satisfactory level as it had before the COVID-19 pandemic. As the route was quite popular among the local population for its offering of connecting flights through KLM&#x27;s wide network of destinations, the decision was met with severe criticism by civilians, businesses, as well as local and regional politicians.

<text>Lyme Regis ( ) is a town in west Dorset, England, west of Dorchester and east of Exeter. Sometimes dubbed the &quot;Pearl of Dorset&quot;, it lies by the English Channel at the Dorset–Devon border. It has noted fossils in cliffs and beaches on the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site and heritage coast. The harbour wall, known as The Cobb, appears in Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Persuasion&quot;, the John Fowles novel &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; and the 1981 film of that name, partly shot in the town.

A former mayor and MP was Admiral Sir George Somers, who founded the English colonial settlement of Somers Isles, now Bermuda, where Lyme Regis is twinned with St George&#x27;s. In July 2015, Lyme Regis joined Jamestown, Virginia in a Historic Atlantic Triangle with St George&#x27;s. The 2011 census gave the urban area a population of 4,712, estimated at 4,805 in 2019.

==History==
In Saxon times, the abbots of Sherborne Abbey had salt-boiling rights on land adjacent to the River Lym, and the abbey once owned part of the town. Lyme is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the 13th century, it developed as one of the major British ports. A royal charter was granted by King Edward I in 1284 when &quot;Regis&quot; was added to the town&#x27;s name. The charter was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth I in 1591.

John Leland visited in the 16th century and described Lyme as &quot;a praty market town set in the rootes of an high rokky hille down to the hard shore. There cummith a shalow broke from the hilles about a three miles by north, and cummith fleting on great stones through a stone bridge in the bottom.&quot;

In 1644, during the English Civil War, Parliamentarians withstood an eight-week siege of the town by Royalist forces under Prince Maurice. The Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis at the start of the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685.

Lyme grew in size as a result of seaside tourism in the 18th century bought about by new purported health benefits of the sea air/taking the waters, and the establishment of the turnpike road system. The town then benefited at the expense of continental destinations during the Napoleonic wars when wealthy tourists were unable to travel abroad. This led notable people including Jane Austen to visit, who set part of her final novel &quot;Persuasion&quot; in the town.

Between 1811 and her death in 1847 Mary Anning, a geological pioneer, found and identified Jurassic marine reptile fossils in cliffs to the east of Lyme Regis.

On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1915, was torpedoed, the first major U-boat kill of World War I. A local lifeboat delivered bodies to the &quot;Pilot Boat Inn&quot; in Bridge Street. Lassie, the owner&#x27;s dog, licked the face of Seaman Cowan, who was believed dead, and seemingly brought him back to life. The namesake of this cross-breed became a legend of books, radio, film and television.

In 1965, the town&#x27;s railway station was closed under the Beeching Axe. The station was dismantled and rebuilt at Alresford, on the Mid Hants Watercress Railway in Hampshire. The route to Lyme Regis was notable for being operated by aged Victorian locomotives. One of these Adams Radial Tank engines is now preserved on the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. A West Country Class steam locomotive No. 34009 was named &quot;Lyme Regis&quot; after the town.

In 2005, one event to mark the bicentenary of Admiral Nelson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar was a re-enactment of the arrival of the news aboard the Bermuda sloop . The actor playing the part of Lieutenant John Richards Lapenotière, the Trafalgar messenger, was welcomed at Lyme Regis.

==Geography==

Lyme Regis is a coastal town in West Dorset, west of Dorchester and east of Exeter. It lies in Lyme Bay, on the English Channel coast at the Dorset–Devon border. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 3,671. The town has grown around the mouth of the River Lim (or Lym) which drops from a plateau at an altitude of about before flowing around south and south-east to the sea. Its name is of British origin and probably cognate with the Welsh &quot;llif&quot; meaning flood or stream. Historically there were mills along its length. Its lower reaches coincide with sections of three recreational footpaths: the Wessex Ridgeway, Liberty Trail and East Devon Trail.

The town&#x27;s beaches and cliffs are noted for fossils. They form part of the local Heritage Coast and the more extensive coastal World Heritage Site, commonly referred to as the Jurassic Coast – stretching for from Orcombe Point near Exmouth in the west to Old Harry Rocks in the east. The coastal exposures provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning some 185 million years of the Earth&#x27;s history. Localities along the Jurassic Coast include a range of important fossil zones.

The Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone geological formations host a multitude of remains from the Early Jurassic, from which epoch good fossil records are rare. Many remains are well preserved, including complete specimens of important species. Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area around Lyme Regis, notably those discovered by Mary Anning (1799–1847). Significant finds include &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot;, &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dimorphodon&quot;, &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot; (one of the first armoured dinosaurs) and &quot;Dapedium&quot;. The town holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival. A fossil of the world&#x27;s largest moth was discovered there in 1966.

To the south-west are Poker&#x27;s Pool, Seven Rock Point and Pinhay Bay and to the north-east is Charmouth. The coast is subject to landslips that expose the Jurassic-age fossils to be found on the beaches. &quot;The Dowlands Landslip&quot; occurred on 24 December 1839, west along the coast in Devon, in an area belonging to Bindon Manor. About of wheat and turnip fields were dislodged when a great chasm more than across, deep and long was formed. The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as &quot;Goat Island&quot; among the newly formed gullies. On 3 February 1840 a smaller landslip occurred nearby. The phenomenon attracted many visitors, and farmers charged sixpence to view it. The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of interest for its diverse natural history.

Landslides continued to cause problems in the area into the 21st century. In 2005, work began on a £16 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion. The town&#x27;s main beach was relaid and reopened on 1 July 2006. On the evening of 6 May 2008, a section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Police described the landslip as the &quot;worst in 100 years&quot;. It called for diverting the South West Coast Path inland between Lyme Regis and Charmouth via the Lyme Regis Golf Course.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census the town&#x27;s parish had 2,431 dwellings, 1,770 households and a population of 3,671.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2011 is shown in the table below.

The 2012 mid-year estimate for the population of the parish is 3,637.

==Religion==

The parish church of St Michael the Archangel, above Church Cliff, dominates the old town. Dating from the 12th century, it was originally a tripartite structure with an axial tower. Transepts were added in about 1200 and two aisles in the 13th century. A new church was built east of the tower and transepts early in the 16th century and the old chancel and aisles removed. The old nave was shortened in the 19th century.

Mary Anning is buried there and commemorated in a stained-glass window provided by members of the Geological Society of London, an organisation that did not admit women until 1904.

The Baptist church was founded in 1653 and has been on the same site since 1699. Bethany Chapel, an independent Evangelical (Christian Brethren) church, celebrated its centenary in 2014.

==Education==
The Boat Building Academy, a registered charity runs courses in traditional boatbuilding and furniture making from its site at Monmouth Beach.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Lyme Regis, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Lyme Regis Town Council and Dorset Council. The town council meets at the Guildhall on Bridge Street, which was completed in 1889. The town council&#x27;s offices are at the nearby Guildhall Cottage on Church Street.

Lyme Regis was an ancient borough, with the earliest known charter dating from 1284. Until 1604 the borough only covered a small part of the parish; in that year the borough was extended to match the parish. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The municipal borough was abolished in 1974 to become part of the new district of West Dorset. The modern town council was created as a successor parish council for the old borough at the same time.

West Dorset was abolished in 2019 under the 2019 structural changes to local government in England, when Dorset Council was established as a unitary authority. Since then, Lyme Regis has been part of the Lyme and Charmouth ward which elects one member to Dorset Council.

Lyme Regis is part of the West Dorset constituency for elections to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. From 1295 to 1868 it was covered by the Lyme Regis constituency

==Landmarks==
===The Cobb===
The first record of the Cobb, the town&#x27;s harbour wall, is in a 1328 document describing it as having been damaged by storms. It was made of oak piles driven into the seabed, with boulders stacked between. The boulders had been floated into place, tied between empty barrels. A 1685 account describes it as, &quot;an immense mass of stone, of a shape of a demi-lune, with a bar in the middle of the concave: no one stone that lies there was ever touched with a tool or bedded in any sort of cement, but all the pebbles of the see are piled up, and held by their bearings only, and the surge plays in and out through the interstices of the stone in a wonderful manner.&quot; The Cobb wall provides a breakwater to shield the town from storms and separate Monmouth and Cobb Gate beaches.

The Cobb had economic importance in and around the town, creating an artificial harbour that enabled the town to develop as a port and shipbuilding centre from the 13th century onwards. Shipbuilding was significant between 1780 and 1850; nearly 100 ships were launched, including the 12-gun Royal Navy brig HMS &quot;Snap.&quot; Well-sited for trade with France, the port&#x27;s most prosperous period was from the 16th century until the end of the 18th. In 1780, the port was larger than the Port of Liverpool but its importance declined in the 19th century, as it could not handle ships of increasing size.

The Cobb has been destroyed or damaged by storms several times; it was swept away in 1377, along with 50 boats and 80 houses. The southern arm was added in the 1690s and rebuilt in 1793 after it was destroyed in a storm the previous year. It is thought that mortar was used in the Cobb&#x27;s construction for the first time in this rebuilding. It was reconstructed in 1820 using Portland Admiralty Roach, a type of Portland stone. After the Great Storm of 1824, Captain Sir Richard Spencer RN carried out pioneering lifeboat design work in Cobb harbour. The current Lyme Regis Lifeboat Station was opened in 1997.

===Lyme Regis Marine Aquarium===
Open since the late 1950s, Lyme Regis Marine Aquarium occupies an early 18th-century stone building on the Cobb harbour wall. The aquarium showcases some of the abundant local sea life and offers insight into Lyme&#x27;s rich maritime history.

Visitors have opportunities to hand-feed a shoal of tame Thicklip grey mullet, stroke a lobster, and hold a starfish. Other exhibits include weaver fish, wrasse, blenny, sea mice and crustaceans, including hermit crab.

===Other landmarks===

Town Mill, a watermill dating from 1340, has been restored to working order and produces flour. It is powered by water from the River Lym via a leat running along a lynch. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records a mill at Lyme in 1086, so the site could be much older. Town Mill Brewery opened in part of the mill in March 2010.

Near the Town Mill, on the site of an old chapel dedicated to St Mary and the Holy Spirits, is the &quot;Lepers&#x27; Well&quot;. In medieval times &quot;leper&quot; was used as a general description of skin diseases, not necessarily leprosy. A hospital that stood on the site 700 years ago is commemorated by a plaque on the wall of the well. The well water still runs, but probably at a reduced rate. The land was left untouched for many years before it was landscaped as a visitors&#x27; garden in the 1970s.

The frontage of the Three Cups Hotel in Broad Street dates from 1807. It is believed that Jane Austen stayed in Hiscott&#x27;s Boarding House on the same site in 1804. Since then the hotel has accommodated Alfred Lord Tennyson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and J. R. R. Tolkien, who spent several holidays there. In 1944 General Eisenhower delivered an important briefing before D-Day to senior Allied officers in its first-floor lounge. It was used as a setting in the film &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; in 1981. The owners, Palmers Brewery of Bridport, closed the hotel in May 1990 and put forward plans to demolish the significantly historic rear of the building and replace it with retail units, a restaurant, and visitor and private accommodation.

The Royal Lion Hotel is a former coaching inn dating from the first decade of the 17th century. It is reputedly haunted; many alleged ectoplasms have been sighted in the corridors and cold spots.
On 22 May 2022 a new Statue of Mary Anning was unveiled by Alice Roberts at the junction of Long Entry and Gun Cliff Walk. The statue was the result of a crowdfunded campaign (&quot;Mary Anning Rocks&quot;) to commission and display a statue to the paleontologist Mary Anning in Lyme Regis.

==Culture and media==
The museum stands on the site of Mary Anning&#x27;s birthplace and family shop off Bridge Street, holding a collection of local memorabilia, historical items and exhibits to explain the local geological and palaeontological treasures. It was formerly known as the Philpot Museum. Set into the pavement outside the museum is an example of Coade stone work, in the form of ammonites, reflecting the palaeontology for which the town is famous. It commemorates Eleanor Coade, who had an 18th-century artificial stone factory in London and a seaside home, Belmont House, in the town.

The Dinosaurland Fossil Museum is in the former church where Mary Anning was baptised.

Thanksgiving Day has been held since Parliament decreed, at the end of the English Civil War, as a day of celebration and prayer in Lyme to mark its victory over the long siege of the town by Royalist forces. The celebration includes residents dressed in period costume to parade through the streets.
Annual events include the Lyme Regis Carnival and Regatta, the Lyme Regis Fossil Festival (in conjunction with the London Natural History Museum), and Mary Anning Day. The traditional conger cuddling event takes place during Lifeboat Week. The carnival and regatta, organised by volunteers, take place over a week in August, as does the Lyme Regis Gig Club regatta.

Bonfire night celebrations include a torchlight procession, a bonfire on the beach and a firework display. A Christmas Tree Festival has more than 30 trees decorated and displayed in Lyme Regis Baptist Church. An Easter bonnet parade takes place in the town on Easter Sunday. A May Day fête features stalls and entertainment from various groups in Lyme.

Lyme Regis is the home of B Sharp, a music charity for young people. It runs music workshops, performances and training, and signposts progression routes beyond B Sharp. It also runs an annual Busking Festival open to all performing artists, now in May, and an open air &quot;Big Mix&quot; festival in July to present music-making by young people.

The Marine Theatre, operated by the charity Lymearts Community Trust, stages a variety of live events.
In 2012 graffiti artist Banksy stenciled an origami crane on a wall adjacent to the River Lym at the intersection of Mill and Coombe Streets.

Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Stockland Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Charmouth.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent, Heart West, Wessex FM, and Lyme Bay Radio, a community based station.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Bridport &amp; Lyme Regis News&quot;.

===Literature and films===
The Cobb featured in Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Persuasion&quot; (1818), and in the 1960 television miniseries, 1971 TV series, 1995 film, 2007 film and 2022 film based on the novel. The poet Tennyson is said to have gone straight to the Cobb on arrival, saying, &quot;Show me the exact spot where Louisa Musgrove fell!&quot;. The Cobb also featured in the 1981 film &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;, based on the 1969 novel of the same name by John Fowles. The town was used in filming &quot;All Over the Town&quot; (1949), under the name &quot;Tormouth&quot;.

The town community is portrayed in disguise in &quot;The Earl&#x27;s Granddaughter&quot; (1895) by Georgina Castle Smith, writing as Emma. It also features in A. S. Byatt&#x27;s Booker Prize-winning 1990 novel &quot;Possession&quot; and the 2002 film adapted from it. Lyme Regis is the setting for much of the historical novel &quot;Remarkable Creatures&quot; by Tracy Chevalier, of which fossil hunter Mary Anning is a protagonist.

Lyme Regis is the setting and filming location of a 2020 film &quot;Ammonite&quot;, starring Kate Winslet as Mary Anning alongside Saoirse Ronan and Fiona Shaw. The 2023 film Wonka, starring Timothée Chalamet, was filmed in Lyme Regis.

== Sport ==
Lyme Regis Football Club, known as the Seasiders, was formed in 1885. Its three senior and five junior teams play at the Davey Fort Ground in Charmouth Road. The seniors play in the Devon and Exeter Football League and Perry Street and District League. In its 125th anniversary year, 2010, Tony Cottee (a former West Ham, Everton and England striker) was made club patron.

<doc id="194896" wikidata="Q176284" url="?curid=194896" title="Ramones (album)">
<text>Ramones is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, released on April 23, 1976, by Sire Records. After &quot;Hit Parader&quot; editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote several articles about the group and asked Danny Fields to be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce &quot;Ramones&quot;, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 ($35,505.27 in 2024) to record the album.

The album cover, photographed by &quot;Punk&quot; magazine&#x27;s Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 ($693.46 in 2024) for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album&#x27;s liner notes. After its release, &quot;Ramones&quot; was promoted with two singles, which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, although two were booked in Britain.

Violence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and Nazism were prominent in the album&#x27;s lyrics. The album opens with &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;, which is among the band&#x27;s most recognized songs. Most of the album&#x27;s tracks are uptempo, with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Down to the Basement&quot; is the album&#x27;s longest track. &quot;Ramones&quot; contains a cover of the Chris Montez song &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

&quot;Ramones&quot; was unsuccessful commercially, peaking at number 111 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. Despite its poor chart performance, it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Most Essential Punk Records&quot;. &quot;Ramones&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential punk albums of all time, and it had a significant impact on other genres of rock music, such as grunge and heavy metal. The album was ranked at number 33 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the ranking in a 2012 revision and dropping to number 47 in the 2020 reboot of the list. It was placed first in the same publication&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Best Debut Albums of All Time&quot; in 2022. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2014 for 500,000 copies sold in the US.

==Background==
Ramones began playing gigs in mid-1974, with their first show at Performance Studios in New York City. The band, performing in a style similar to the one used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in downtown Manhattan, specifically CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City. In early 1975, Lisa Robinson, an editor of &quot;Hit Parader&quot; and &quot;Rock Scene&quot;, saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group&#x27;s vocalist Joey Ramone related that &quot;Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life; she started writing about us in &quot;Rock Scene&quot;, and then Lenny Kaye would write about us and we started getting more press like &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down.&quot; Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted Danny Fields, former manager of the Stooges, and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band &quot;had everything I ever liked&quot; and became the manager in November 1975.

On September 19, 1975, Ramones recorded a demo at 914 Sound Studios, which was produced by Marty Thau. Featuring the songs &quot;Judy Is a Punk&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,&quot; the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels. Producer Craig Leon, who had seen the Ramones perform in the summer of 1975, brought the demo to the attention of Sire Records&#x27; president Seymour Stein. After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife Linda Stein, Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European progressive rock bands. Drummer Tommy Ramone recalled: &quot;Craig Leon is the one who got us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president and all these people—he&#x27;s the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label.&quot; The label offered to release &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Kill That Girl&quot; as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album. Sire accepted their request and agreed to release a studio album instead.

==Recording and production==

In January 1976 the band took a break from their live performances to prepare for recording at Plaza Sound studio. Sessions began later that month and were completed within a week for $6,400; the instruments took three days and the vocal parts were recorded in four days. In 2004, Leon admitted that they recorded &quot;Ramones&quot; quickly due to budget restrictions, but also that it was all the time they needed.

The band applied microphone placement techniques similar to those which many orchestras used. The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by the Beatles in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of the devices. The guitars can be heard separately on the stereo channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed in the middle of the stereo mix. The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as overdubbing, a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as doubling, where the vocal line used is sung twice.

Recording for the album was expanded by Mickey Leigh (Joey&#x27;s brother) and Leon with percussion effects, which went unmentioned in the liner notes to the album&#x27;s release. Author Nicholas Rombes said that the production&#x27;s quality sounded like &quot;the ultimate do-it-yourself, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk,&quot; but concluded that they approached the recording process with a &quot;high degree of preparedness and professionalism.&quot;

==Lyrics and composition==
The songs on &quot;Ramones&quot; addressed several lyrical themes including violence, male prostitution, drug use, and Nazism. While the moods displayed in the album were often dark, Johnny said that when writing the lyrics they were not &quot;trying to be offensive.&quot; Many songs from the album have backing vocals from different guests. Leigh sang backing vocals on &quot;Judy Is a Punk,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,&quot; and in the bridge of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop.&quot; Tommy sang backing vocals on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Walk Around with You,&quot; &quot;Judy Is a Punk,&quot; and during the bridge of &quot;Chain Saw.&quot; The album&#x27;s engineer, Rob Freeman, sang backing vocals for the final refrain of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.&quot; Leon wrote in the booklet for the album&#x27;s 2016 reissue that when layered background vocals appear on the album, they are primarily Freeman&#x27;s contributions combined with some of Leon and Dee Dee&#x27;s, and a great deal by Leigh, &quot;all compiled and compressed to create an effective cyborg backing vocal creature.&quot; The album&#x27;s length is 29 minutes and four seconds and it contains 14 tracks. On the original issue of the album, all the original songs were credited to &quot;the Ramones&quot; collectively.

The opening &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; was written by Tommy, and originally named &quot;Animal Hop.&quot; Once Dee Dee reviewed the lyrics, the band changed the wording, the name, and partially the theme. According to Tommy, the song&#x27;s original concept was about &quot;kids going to a show and having a good time,&quot; but the theme became more Nazi-related after its revision. The piece begins with an instrumental interval which lasts about 20 seconds. At the 20th second, the guitar and bass cease, marking Joey&#x27;s first line, &quot;Hey ho, let&#x27;s go!&quot; The bass and guitar gradually rebuild and become &quot;full–force&quot; once all the instruments play together in ensemble. The piece resolves by repeating what is played from 0:22–0:33. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; as a &quot;three-chord assault.&quot;

&quot;Beat on the Brat&quot; was said by Joey to have origins relating to the upper class of New York City. Dee Dee, however, explained that the song was about how Joey saw a mother &quot;going after a kid with a bat in his [apartment building&#x27;s] lobby and wrote a song about it.&quot;

&quot;Judy Is a Punk&quot; – written around the same time as &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot; — was written by Joey after he walked by Thorny Croft, an apartment building &quot;where all the kids in the neighborhood hung out on the rooftop and drank.&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics are fictional and refer to two juvenile offenders in Berlin and San Francisco and their possible deaths at the conclusion of the song. &quot;Judy Is a Punk&quot; is the original album&#x27;s shortest track at 1:32; it is partially derived from the Burl Ives 1953 folk song, “There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly.&quot;

&quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; – the album&#x27;s slowest song – was solely written by Tommy and pays homage to love songs by pop music acts of the 1960s, particularly the John Lennon-penned Beatles song, I Should Have Known Better. The song used a 12-string guitar, glockenspiel, and tubular bells in its composition, and was said by author Scott Schinder to be an &quot;unexpected romantic streak.&quot;

&quot;Chain Saw&quot; opens with the sound of a running circular saw and was influenced by the 1974 horror film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. At nearly 180 beats per minute, &quot;Chain Saw&quot; had the fastest tempo of the album&#x27;s songs and, according to Rombes, is the most &quot;home-made&quot; sounding.

&quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; contains four lines of minimalist lyrics that depict youthful boredom and inhaling solvent vapors found in glue. &quot;I hope no one thinks we really sniff glue,&quot; said Dee Dee. &quot;I stopped when I was eight [years old].&quot; Dee Dee also explained that its concept came from adolescent trauma. After several songs by the Ramones whose titles began with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to ...&quot;, Tommy said that &quot;Now I Want to Sniff Some Glue&quot; is the first positive piece on the album. The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk fanzines, Mark Perry&#x27;s &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot;.

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Down to the Basement&quot; is also minimalist, and inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three major chords. With a playing time of 2:40, it is the longest piece on the album. (Asked about the bathroom at CBGB, Debbie Harry remarked: &quot;I think that song from the Ramones is partially about that: &#x27;I don&#x27;t wanna go down to the basement ... &#x27; As kids, we never wanted to go down to the basement cos it was so dark and scary. And that toilet was certainly very scary.&quot;)

&quot;Loudmouth&quot; has six major chords and is harmonically complex. The song&#x27;s lyrics are — depending on the reading and punctuation — a single row or four very brief lines.

&quot;Havana Affair&quot; has a lyrical concept incorporating the comic strip &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; by Cuban-born illustrator Antonio Prohias. At roughly 170 beats per minute, &quot;Loudmouth&quot; and &quot;Havana Affair&quot; proceed at about the same tempo.

&quot;Havana Affair&quot; segues into &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot; – the first of many Ramones songs to voice an ironic and pessimistic perspective on a failing or failed relationship.

Written solely by Dee Dee, the lyrics of &quot;53rd &amp; 3rd&quot; concern a male prostitute (&quot;rent boy&quot;), waiting at the corner of 53rd Street and Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. When the prostitute gets a customer, he kills the customer with a razor to prove he is not a homosexual. In interviews, Dee Dee described the piece as autobiographical. &quot;The song speaks for itself,&quot; Dee Dee commented in an interview. &quot;Everything I write is autobiographical and written in a very real way, I can&#x27;t even write.&quot; According to Danny Fields, &quot;Johnny would never admit to knowing that &#x27;53rd and 3rd&#x27; was about Dee Dee turning tricks!&quot; The half-sung and half-shouted bridge in &quot;53rd and 3rd&quot; are performed by Dee Dee, whose voice is described by author Cyrus Patell as what &quot;breaks the deliberate aural monotony of the song and emphasizes the violence of the lyric.&quot;

&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; is a cover version of the hit song by Chris Montez, featuring Leon playing Radio City&#x27;s large Wurlitzer pipe organ.

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Walk Around with You&quot; consists of two lyric lines and three major chords. One of the group&#x27;s earliest compositions, written at the beginning of 1974, it was the opener on their first demo.

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Walk Around with You&quot; segues into the closing track &quot;Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World,&quot; which refers to a Hitler Youth member. Seymour Stein complained about its original lyrics — &quot;I&#x27;m a Nazi, baby, I&#x27;m a Nazi, yes I am. I&#x27;m a Nazi Schatze, y&#x27;know I fight for the Fatherland&quot; — insisting the track was offensive. When he threatened to remove the track from the album, the band put together alternate lyrics: &quot;I&#x27;m a shock trooper in a stupor, yes I am. I&#x27;m a Nazi Schatze, y&#x27;know I fight for the Fatherland.&quot; Stein accepted the revision and it was duly released.

==Artwork and packaging==

Initially, the Ramones wanted an album cover similar to &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; (1964) and subsequently had pictures taken in that style by Danny Fields but Sire was dissatisfied with the results. The art direction was by Toni Wadler and, according to cartoonist John Holmstrom, the &quot;Meet The Beatles&quot; cover idea came out &quot;horribly&quot;. Wadler later chose a photo by Roberta Bayley, a photographer for &quot;Punk&quot; magazine for the cover. The black and white photograph on the front of the album was originally in an issue of &quot;Punk&quot;.

The cover photo features (from left to right) Johnny, Tommy, Joey and Dee Dee Ramone, staring at the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped and faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert&#x27;s Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between the Bowery and Second Street. The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, with the majority of their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover. Music historian Legs McNeil states that &quot;Tommy [is] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [is] hunched over a bit.&quot; The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band&#x27;s logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. Liner notes on the back cover fail to acknowledge backing vocalists and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record&#x27;s credits. Johnny replied: &quot;We didn&#x27;t want people to get confused with who&#x27;s in the band or who&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s our first album, you know, and we didn&#x27;t want people to get confused.&quot;

The artwork became one of the most imitated album covers in music. The image of a band in front of a brick wall dressed in ripped jeans and leather jackets was copied by Alvin and the Chipmunks in &quot;Chipmunk Punk&quot;. &quot;Ramones&quot;″s artwork was ranked number 58 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 1991 list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.

The album sleeve and a poster of the same design are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

==Promotion==

===Singles===
There were two singles released from the album: &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.&quot; The first was released in February 1976, originally as a 7&quot; split single with &quot;Havana Affair&quot; as its B-side. The release, along with the &quot;Ramones&quot; 2001 Expanded Edition, featured &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; remixed as a single version, although it maintains a time of two minutes and twelve seconds. On January 6, 2004, Rhino Entertainment re-released &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; as a CD single, using &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; as its B-side. &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; was released in September 1976 as a 7&quot; single. It included live versions of &quot;California Sun&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Walk Around with You&quot; as B-sides, recorded at the Roxy Theater in West Hollywood in August 1976. &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot; was also released in the UK, giving the band a presence in the European marketplace. Even though the song saw some success in the UK and Europe, it failed to chart in the top 50.

===Touring===

In 1974 the band played 30 performances, nearly all at the New York-based club CBGB. All but one of the band&#x27;s 1975 gigs were booked for New York City, with Waterbury, Connecticut as the exception. After the album&#x27;s recording, the Ramones headlined for very few shows, usually opening for an identified cover band which played Aerosmith and Boston. When they opened at Brockton, Massachusetts, the audience appeared extremely uninterested in the Ramones so Johnny swore off playing as an introduction for other bands. Following this, Fields booked several headlining shows around the Tri-state area, and they began playing frequently at gigs like CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City. After performing with Blondie in New Jersey, they continued their tour to Boston, Massachusetts for three shows. Leigh later said of the tour:

At the time, Leigh was road manager, stage manager, chauffeur, and head of security. Vega, who contributed to the album&#x27;s packaging, helped out with the road crew as much as possible. Tommy&#x27;s friend Monte Melnick occasionally helped with the audio output, but this was typically done by Leigh.

Following their debut album&#x27;s release, the band performed at over 60 concerts for its promotion. While most of the gigs were booked in North America, two dates—July 4 and 5—were in London&#x27;s Roundhouse venue and Dingwalls, respectively. Linda Stein pushed to make these events happen, setting up the band performances in the UK during the United States Bicentennial. Fields relates: &quot;On the two-hundredth anniversary of our freedom, we were bringing Great Britain a gift that was forever going to disrupt their sensibilities.&quot; The band sold out for their first London performance, with an audience of roughly 3,000. Leigh described the Dingwalls gig as very similar to performances at CBGB. Likewise, these venues in future were headlined by other punk bands like the Clash and Sex Pistols. The band performed over 100 concerts the following year.

==Reception==

&quot;Ramones&quot; was released on April 23, 1976, by Sire Records and received glowing reviews. In May, John Rockwell of the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a rave review, saying: &quot;What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. ... conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself.&quot; Rockwell noted: &quot;the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock so pure that other associations get left behind.&quot; Nick Kent favourably commented in the &quot;NME&quot;: &quot;This record poses a direct threat to any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi ...&quot;. Reviewing that same month in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said that, while the power of the band&#x27;s music draws from &quot;fairly ominous sources&quot; like Nazi imagery and brutality, he cannot deny the &quot;sheer pleasure&quot; of the music: &quot;For me, it blows everything else off the radio: it&#x27;s clean the way the Dolls never were, sprightly the way the Velvets never were, and just plain listenable the way Black Sabbath never was.&quot; In July, Paul Nelson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album was similar to early rock and roll, and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity. In August, &quot;Creem&quot; dubbed &quot;The Ramones&quot; as &quot;The most radical album of the past six years&quot;, saying: &quot;[it] is so strikingly different, so brazenly out of touch with prevailing modes as to constitute a bold swipe at the status quo.&quot; Reviewer Gene Sculatti saw it as &quot;a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll reactionary&#x27;s manifesto&quot; ... &quot;a sharp wedge between the stale ends of a contemporary music scene bloated with graying superstars and overripe for takeover.&quot; Critic Joe S. Harrington declared that the album was a huge landmark for music history, proclaiming that &quot;[it] split the history of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in half.&quot; Theunis Bates, a writer for &quot;Time&quot;, summed the album up with: &quot;&quot;Ramones&quot; stripped rock back to its basic elements ... lyrics are very simple, boiled-down declarations of teen lust and need.&quot; Bates also said that it &quot;is the ultimate punk statement.&quot; Kris Needs of &quot;ZigZag&quot; declared that the album&#x27;s &quot;mutant vocals and ultra-simplicity of the music and lyrics do take some getting used to, but once you get past the curiosity stage, the effect can be shattering, especially at high volume&quot; and that it was &quot;impossible to mention highlights, &#x27;cos the whole album&#x27;s a highlight, geared and stripped down for maximum energy and effect.&quot; In 1977 Charles M. Young of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; regarded &quot;Ramones&quot; as &quot;one of the funniest rock records ever made and, if punk continues to gain momentum, a historic turning point.&quot;

Later reviews of &quot;Ramones&quot; tended to praise the album&#x27;s influence on rock music. In 1995, Jeff Tamarkin of &quot;The AllMusic Guide to Rock&quot; said that the album ignited the punk rock era, writing: &quot;rock&#x27;s mainstream didn&#x27;t know what hit it.&quot; In 2001, April Long of &quot;NME&quot; rewarded the album with a perfect score, remarking that the Ramones were &quot;arguably the most influential band ever,&quot; despite their lack of mainstream acceptance. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot; also deemed the album influential, saying &quot;In comparison to some of the music the album inspired, The Ramones sounds a little tame—it&#x27;s a little too clean, and compared to their insanely fast live albums, it even sounds a little slow.&quot; The album&#x27;s sound was considered by Erlewine to be &quot;all about speed, hooks, stupidity, and simplicity.&quot;

Regardless of this critical acclaim, &quot;Ramones&quot; was not successful commercially. It only reached No. 111 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and sold 6,000 units in its first year. Outside the US, the album peaked at No. 48 on the Swedish Sverigetopplistan chart.

The album was included in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s List of Top Ten College Cult Classics (1995), where it was noted that &quot;everything good that&#x27;s happened to music in the last fourteen years can be directly traced to the Ramones.&quot; Also in 1995, the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; named it the No. 1 alternative rock album. In 2001, the magazine also included the album in its special issue &quot;25 Years of Punk with a list of The 50 Most Essential Punk Records&quot;, where it resided at the top spot. That same year, it was named the fourth best punk album by &quot;Mojo&quot;, who called it the &quot;coolest, dumbest, simplest, greatest rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record ever to be cut by four sweet, dysfunctional screw-ups.&quot;

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the 2002 induction ceremony, with the website stating that their first album changed the rock genre from &quot;bloated and narcissistic&quot;, to &quot;basic&quot; rock and roll. In 2003, &quot;Ramones&quot; was considered by &quot;Spin&quot;″s Chuck Klosterman, Greg Milner, and Alex Pappademas to be the sixth most influential album of all time. They noted that the album &quot;saved rock from itself and punk rock from art-gallery pretension.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; Magazine included the album in their &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot; (2003) list, where it was listed at No. 74. In 2006, it was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 greatest albums ever. &quot;Ramones&quot; was included in Chris Smith&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot;, who said the album &quot;opened a whole new world of garage rock for those fed up with the excesses of existing rock gods.&quot; It was also included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2010, it was ranked as the greatest debut album of the year in 1976. It was placed first in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time list in 2022. The album went gold in the US just after its 38th anniversary, certified by the RIAA on April 30, 2014.

In 2016, Rhino Records announced the July 29 release of a 40th-anniversary deluxe edition comprising three CDs and one LP, including stereo and mono mixes of the original album; single mixes, outtakes and demos; and a live 1976 performance.

==Legacy and influence==
&quot;Ramones&quot; is considered to have established the musical genre of punk rock, as well as popularizing it years afterward. Rombes wrote that it offered &quot;alienated future rock&quot;, and that it &quot;disconnected from tradition.&quot; The album was the start of the Ramones&#x27; influence on popular music, with examples being genres such as heavy metal, thrash metal, indie pop, grunge, post-punk, and most notably, punk rock. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said of their influence on rock in general:

Despite the lack of popularity in its era, the importance of the album for the development of punk rock music was incredible, influencing many of the most well-known names in punk rock, including the Damned, the Clash, Black Flag, Misfits, and Green Day. Billie Joe Armstrong, singer for Green Day, explained his reasoning for listening to the band: &quot;they had songs that just stuck in your head, just like a hammer they banged right into your brain.&quot; The album also had a great impact on the English punk scene as well, with the bassist for Generation X, Tony James, saying that the album caused English bands to change their style. &quot;When their album came out,&quot; commented James, &quot;all the English groups tripled speed overnight. Two-minute-long songs, very fast.&quot; In another interview, James stated that &quot;Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Classic Albums&quot; by Collins GEM recognized &quot;Ramones&quot; as the start of English punk rock and called it the fastest and hardest music that could possibly be concocted, stating: &quot;The songs within were a short, sharp exercise in vicious speed-thrash, driven by ferocious guitars and yet halting in an instant. It was the simple pop dream taken to its minimalist extreme.&quot; In 2012 the album was preserved by the National Recording Registry, deeming it &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.&quot;

===Cover versions and tributes===
Each song on &quot;Ramones&quot; has been covered by various bands. Sonic Youth covered &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot; on their 1987 EP &quot;Master=Dik&quot;, as did Weird Al Yankovic on the &quot;Dr. Demento Covered in Punk&quot; LP (2018). In 1991, German punk band Die Toten Hosen played &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; on their cover album &quot;Learning English, Lesson One&quot;. A tribute album titled &quot;Gabba Gabba Hey: A Tribute to the Ramones&quot; was released on August 30, 1991. It contained the songs &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot;, &quot;53rd &amp; 3rd&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Down to the Basement&quot;, &quot;Loudmouth&quot;, and &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot;. Screeching Weasel released &quot;Ramones&quot; (1992), which consisted of the band performing the entire album track list. 1998&#x27;s &quot;Blitzkrieg Over You!: A Tribute to the Ramones&quot; featured a cover &quot;Judy Is a Punk&quot; in German, and in 2000, both &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; and &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot; appeared on Dee Dee Ramone&#x27;s solo release &quot;Greatest &amp; Latest&quot;. The compilation album &quot;Ramones Maniacs&quot; included Youth Gone Mad&#x27;s version of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; (featuring a guest appearance by Dee Dee Ramone) and Yogurt&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot;. &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;, &quot;Havana Affair&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot;, and &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; were all covered on &quot;The Song Ramones the Same&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family: A Tribute to Ramones&quot; (2003) featured several of the album&#x27;s songs covered by bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers (&quot;Havana Affair&quot;), Rob Zombie (&quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;), Metallica (&quot;53rd &amp; 3rd&quot;), U2 (&quot;Beat on the Brat&quot;), Pete Yorn (&quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot;), and John Frusciante (&quot;Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World&quot;). In 2006, &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; was reworked into a children&#x27;s song on the album &quot;Brats on the Beat: Ramones for Kids&quot;.

<doc id="194903" wikidata="Q2503633" url="?curid=194903" title="Emma Albani">
<text>Dame Emma Albani, DBE (born Marie-Louise-Emma-Cécile Lajeunesse; 1 November 18473 April 1930) was a Canadian-British operatic coloratura soprano, later spinto soprano and dramatic soprano of the 19th and early 20th century, the first Canadian singer to become an international star. Her repertoire focused on the operas of Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and Wagner. She performed across Europe and North America.

==Early life==

Albani was born Marie-Louise-Emma-Cécile Lajeunesse in Chambly, Quebec, to the professional musician Joseph Lajeunesse and his wife, Mélina Mignault. Her parents were French-Canadians. Her date of birth is usually given as 1 November 1847, but other authors have placed her birth in 1848 or 1850, &quot;The Biographical Dictionary of America&quot; puts her birth on 18 September 1851, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot; says 1 November 1851, and Albani&#x27;s memoir says 1852. She began her musical studies with her mother, and at age five her father took over her musical lessons. Her father was a proficient musician who was skilled with the violin, harp, piano and organ. He kept her on a strong practice regimen, with as much as four hours a day of lessons on the harp and piano.

==Emigration and tuition==
The family moved to Plattsburgh, New York, in 1852. In 1856 after the death of her mother, she continued her education in a Montreal convent-school, run by the Dames du Sacré-Coeur where her father had obtained the position of Music Master. This afforded her a better education than she might otherwise receive, and additional musical instruction. On 24 August 1860 she and Adelina Patti were soloists in the world premiere of Charles Wugk Sabatier&#x27;s &quot;Cantata&quot; in Montreal which was performed in honour of the visit of the Prince of Wales. She was also awarded a gold medal for musical composition from that convent. However, she was ultimately unable to finance a musical education in Quebec, where singing and acting were considered unsavoury careers for a woman, and her family moved to Albany, New York in 1865. Her father was unable to give her the training which her very fine voice deserved, but she obtained a place in the cathedral choir, where her singing attracted much attention, as it did in concerts, in which she not only sang but played on both the piano and harp. There she became a popular singer, an organist and teacher of singing and saved enough money to continue her studies.

In 1868, she travelled to Paris, where she studied with Gilbert Duprez at the Conservatoire de Paris. She spent six months in Paris, training with Duprez. She then travelled to Italy, where she studied Italian opera singing with Francesco Lamperti. Under the guidance of her elocution instructor, Signor Delorenzi, she changed her name to the simpler Emma Albani, which sounded more European. She made her debut at Messina using the surname Albani.

==Operatic career==
===Development in Italy===
Her funds began to run low, and although her training was not yet complete, she began to look for work to help support her schooling. She found a position in Messina, and her operatic debut was on 30 March 1870, in Messina, playing Amina in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;. Her debut performance was very well received. She later recalled:

She returned to Milan after her contract in Messina had expired, to resume her instruction by Lamperti. Additional work offers began to pour in. She soon accepted the role of Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, performing it in Cento. Further roles followed in Florence and Malta, with parts in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;. After spending the winter of 1870–1871 performing in Malta, she auditioned for Frederick Gye, the manager of Covent Garden in London. He was impressed by her talent and signed her to a five-year contract. She was scheduled to make her London debut in the spring of 1872. Before her London contract began, she returned to Italy to study with Lamperti at Lake Como, and then appeared at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, giving one last series of nine performances in ten days in the title role of Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Mignon&quot;, a part she studied with the composer in Paris prior to her making her debut in the role.

===Move to London&#x27;s Covent Garden===
Albani arrived in London in the spring, and made her professional debut on 2 April 1872 as Amina in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;. Critics and audience members alike were impressed with her strong performance in the role, and her admirers presented her with flowers and jewellery. At Covent Garden, she developed an interest in oratorio after being introduced to it by Sir Julius Benedict and Josiah Pittman, who encouraged her to explore it. Her first opportunity to present a piece came in October 1872, when she performed &quot;Angels, ever bright and fair&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Theodora&quot; at the Norwich Festival.

For the 1872–1873 winter season she performed with the Italian Opera at the Salle Ventadour in Paris, where she made her debut as Amina with Victor Capoul as Elvino.

Her second season in London included performances in the roles of Ophelia in Ambroise Thomas&#x27; &quot;Hamlet&quot; and the Countess in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. During the off time after the second season she travelled to Moscow to perform in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. She then went to St. Petersburg, where the Tsar Alexander II viewed her performances.
In her third season in London, she performed in mostly the same roles she had in her first two seasons: &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; and &quot;Martha&quot;. The competition in the opera world of London was very stiff, and it was common for performers to be possessive of their roles. After her third season, Queen Victoria requested a private performance from Albani, who travelled to Windsor Castle in July 1874 to perform the aria &quot;Caro nome&quot; from &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, the folk ballad &quot;Robin Adair&quot;, the Bach/Gounod &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, and the popular song &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;. The Queen was suitably impressed by her performance and would call Albani back to perform other pieces, by composers such as Brahms, Grieg, Handel and Mendelssohn, as well as traditional French and Scottish tunes.

In the fall of 1874, she undertook a tour of the United States, visiting New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Albany. The tour was under the management of Maurice Strakosch. She was accompanied by Frederick Gye&#x27;s son, Ernest Gye, who was acting on his father&#x27;s behalf. She learned the role of Elsa in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in two weeks, performing it at the Academy of Music in New York. The opera was performed in Italian, which was also the custom at Covent Garden.

She returned to London for her fourth season at Covent Garden in 1875. After the season, she performed at the Norwich Festival, where she sang in Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Hymn of Praise&quot; Symphony-Cantata and Julius Benedict&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Legend of St. Cecilia&quot;. In her fifth season in London (1876) she performed the role of Elisabeth in the London premiere of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

Afterward she went to Paris and sang at the Théâtre des Italiens, where she was well received, and gave a special performance at the Élysée Palace for Maréchal MacMahon.

Albani married Ernest Gye on 6 August 1878. She became pregnant, but continued to tour and perform until shortly before the birth of her son, Frederick Ernest Gye on 4 June 1879. He was to be the couple&#x27;s only child. In the fall of 1879, after singing at the Hereford and Bristol Festivals, she returned to Florence. In January 1880, she sang in Nice, and from there she went to the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels. On 26 June 1880 she performed Isabella in Ferdinand Hérold&#x27;s &quot;Le pré aux clercs&quot; at Covent Garden, a production that was mounted especially for her.

Throughout the 1880s, Albani toured Europe and North America, garnering praise wherever she travelled. In 1881, she was invited to perform in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, which was being given at the Berlin Royal Opera. She agreed to appear in the role of Elsa, which she had previously sung in Italian, and relearned the part in German. The performance was attended by the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm I. The reception was very positive, earning three curtain calls. In 1882, the Kaiser awarded her the title of &quot;Hofkammersängerin&quot;.

In 1883, she gave three recitals in Montreal. More than ten thousand people showed up to greet her upon her arrival, and at a reception the poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette read a poem that he had written in her honour. Her first operatic performance in Canada came on 13 February 1883 in Toronto, at the Grand Opera House where she performed in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. On 15 July 1884 in London she sang the role of Brunehild in Ernest Reyer&#x27;s opera &quot;Sigurd&quot; and the role of Juliette in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; in the same season.

===Performances with New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera===
Albani made her debut with New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera on 20 November 1891 as Valentine in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, a performance which took place while the company was on tour in Chicago. Her second appearance in Chicago on 23 November was as Desdemona in the company&#x27;s first ever performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, and she also sang the role there at a gala performance of Act 4 on 9 December. Other appearances with the Met in Chicago included another as Valentine, Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Violetta in Act 1 of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; (on a double bill with Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, in which Emma Eames&#x27;s sang Santuzza) and Elsa in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. Her first appearance with the company in New York was as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; on 23 December.

Further performances in New York included four appearances as Valentine (a role she also performed on tour in Louisville, Albany, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and Boston), three as Donna Elvira in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, three as Eva in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, one more as Gilda, one as Desdemona, one as Elsa, as well as a single appearance as Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. She also sang Donna Elvira and Eva on tour in Boston. Her final appearance with the Met was in New York on 31 March 1892, as Senta in &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;. All the operas in which she appeared were sung in Italian. In total she had performed 29 times with the company. As the season progressed, some critics remarked on the wear and tear that was becoming evident in her voice, but praised her artistry and experience. Of her last performance at the Met, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The Senta of Mlle. Albani was not vocally perfect, yet it had so many excellences that her hearers must have been inclined to forgive the departures from the pitch which seem to have become an inseparable accompaniment of her singing of late. She did much to atone for them by the intelligence of her work and by the dramatic earnestness with which she imbued all her singing. She earned a fair share of the honors of the evening.&quot;
===Final season at Covent Garden===
Even in Albani&#x27;s final season at Covent Garden in 1896, she continued to receive strongly positive reviews. The greatest triumph of her career came on 26 June 1896, when she sang Isolde in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, with Jean de Reszke in his first London Tristan, Louise Meisslinger as Brangäne, David Bispham as Kurwenal, Édouard de Reszke as King Marke, and Luigi Mancinelli conducting. There were a total of four performances, all of which sold out despite the higher than normal ticket prices and the oddity that the opera was sung in German. On 24 July she sang Valentine in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. There had been no announcement, and few people would have realized it was the last time they were to hear her in opera. Her career at Covent Garden had lasted for twenty-four years.

===Post Covent Garden===

After retiring from Covent Garden in 1896, Albani departed for a tour of Canada, performing in venues across the country. In 1898, she toured Australia. .She also was active in oratorio in Britain. 

&quot;Madam Albani gave her farewell concert&quot; at the Albert Hall in London, in 1900. (The London Encyclopedia, First published 1983 by Macmillan London).

 In 1907, Albani toured Australia and New Zealand . In spring 1908, the veteran Albani toured the English provinces as part of a company containing two budding talents: pianist Marie Novello, who two years later would become one of Theodor Leschetizky&#x27;s last students, and John McCormack, who only months before had made his own Covent Garden debut. Albani gave her last public performance on 14 October 1911. That same year she released a book, &quot;Forty Years of Song&quot;. The book was effectively a memoir, recounting stories of her youth, travels and career, and impressions of fellow performers and the royalty she met over her life, as well as providing some useful advice on singing.

She and her husband retired to Kensington. Poor investments resulted in the loss of much of their wealth, and Albani was forced to give musical lessons to earn income. Her husband died in 1925, compounding the situation, but benefit concerts arranged by friends provided sufficient income for Albani. She died on 3 April 1930, aged 82, at her home on Tregunter Road, Kensington and was buried with her husband at Brompton Cemetery.

==Honours and legacy==
Albani received the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1897, often known as the &quot;Beethoven Medal&quot;. Madame Selitsky, the prima donna who performs in Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1908) was inspired by Albani. Montgomery later wrote a profile of the singer for &quot;Courageous Women&quot; (1934), a non-fiction work. In 1925, Albani was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada mounted a plaque at her birthplace in 1939. It was replaced with a stele in 1977.

Several streets and places have been named after her in Quebec. Two streets in Montreal have been named in her honour. The first, &quot;rue Albani&quot;, was dedicated in 1912. It disappeared when road construction merged it with another street. The second, &quot;avenue Albani&quot;, was named 19 March 1969 by the city&#x27;s council. In 1980 Canada Post commissioned a postage stamp honoring her on the 50th anniversary of her death. The stamp was designed by artist Huntley Brown, portraying her in costume as Violetta from the opera &quot;La Traviata&quot;. It is a colourised version of the adjacent image.

In the 1990s, the former mayor of Chambly, Robert Lebel donated the Emma Albani fund for musical arts to the town.

Albani is depicted in a stained-glass mural by Frédéric Back in the Place-des-Arts metro station in Montreal.

<text>Track and field is a sport that includes athletic contests based on running, jumping, and throwing skills. The name used in North America is derived from where the sport takes place, a running track and a grass field for the throwing and some of the jumping events. Track and field is categorized under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running and racewalking. Though the sense of &quot;athletics&quot; as a broader sport is not used in American English, outside of the United States the term &quot;athletics&quot; can either be used to mean just its track and field component or the entirety of the sport (adding road racing and cross country) based on context.

The foot racing events, which include sprints, middle- and long-distance events, racewalking, and hurdling, are won by the athlete who completes it in the least time. The jumping and throwing events are won by those who achieve the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus, and hammer. There are also &quot;combined events&quot; or &quot;multi events&quot;, such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events. In these, athletes participate in a combination of track and field events. Most track and field events are individual sports with a single victor; the most prominent team events are relay races, which typically feature teams of four. Events are almost exclusively divided by gender, although both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions are usually held at the same venue. One exception are mixed relays, in which two men and two women make up the four-person team. If a race has too many people to run all at once, preliminary heats will be run to narrow down the field of participants.

Track and field is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic Games in Greece. In modern times, the two most prestigious international track and field competitions are the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the World Athletics Championships. World Athletics, formerly known as the &quot;International Association of Athletics Federations&quot; (&quot;IAAF&quot;), is the international governing body for the sport of athletics.

Records are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world, continental, and national levels. However, if athletes are deemed to have violated the event&#x27;s rules or regulations, they are disqualified from the competition and their marks are erased.

==History==


The sport of track and field has prehistoric roots, being among the oldest of sporting competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal human physical expressions. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events are the Ancient Olympic include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.

Track and field events were also present at the Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 201 BC. In the Middle Ages, new track and field events began developing in parts of Northern Europe. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as fierljeppen in North European Lowlands in the 18th century.

Discrete track and field competitions, separate from general sporting festivals, were first recorded in the 19th century. These were typically organised among rival educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubs. Influenced by a Classics-rich curriculum, competitions in the English public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing, fox hunting and hare coursing. The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest running club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819. The school organised Paper Chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two &quot;foxes&quot;; even today RSSH runners are called &quot;hounds&quot; and a race victory is a &quot;kill&quot;. The first definite record of Shrewsbury&#x27;s cross-country Annual Steeplechase is in 1834, making it the oldest running race of the modern era. The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still extant, the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840. This featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the Derby Stakes, the Hurdle Race and the Trial Stakes. Runners were entered by &quot;owners&quot; and named as though they were horses. away and a decade later, the first Wenlock Olympian Games were held at Much Wenlock racecourse in 1851. It included a &quot;half-mile foot race&quot; (805 m) and a &quot;leaping in distance&quot; competition.

In 1865, Dr William Penny Brookes of Wenlock helped set up the National Olympian Association, which held their first Olympian Games in 1866 at the Crystal Palace in London. This national event was a great success, attracting a crowd of over ten thousand people. In response, the Amateur Athletic Club was formed that same year and held a championship for &quot;gentlemen amateurs&quot; in an attempt to reclaim the sport for the educated elite. Ultimately the &quot;allcomers&quot; ethos of the NOA won through and in 1880 the AAC was reconstituted as the Amateur Athletic Association, the first national body for the sport of athletics. The AAA Championships, the &quot;de facto&quot; British national championships despite being for England only, have been held annually since July 1880 with breaks only during two world wars and 2006–2008. The AAA was effectively a global governing body in the early years of the sport, helping to codify its rules.

Meanwhile, the New York Athletic Club in 1876 began holding an annual national competition, the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing and made international competitions possible.

The revival of the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century marked a new high for track and field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track and field events plus a marathon, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track and field remained among its most prominent contests. The Olympics was the elite competition for track and field, only open to amateur sportsmen. Track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had taken expense money for playing baseball, violating Olympic amateurism rules. His medals were reinstated 29 years after his death.

That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established as the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism as a founding principle for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, making it one of the most prestigious competitions for students. In 1923 track and field featured at the inaugural World Student Games. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.

Until the early 1920s, track and field was almost an exclusively male pursuit. Many colleges required women to participate in walking events. Walking was considered to be a primarily female sport. In the late 1800s it was still incredibly rare to find women in the gym, as this was considered a masculine activity. On 9 November 1895, the first women&#x27;s track meet in the United States was held and it was called &quot;a field day&quot;. Alice Milliat argued for the inclusion of women at the Olympics, but the International Olympic Committee refused. She founded the International Women&#x27;s Sports Federation in 1921 and, alongside a growing women&#x27;s sports movement in Europe and North America, the group initiated of the Women&#x27;s Olympiad, held annually from 1921 to 1923. In cooperation with the English Women&#x27;s Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA), the Women&#x27;s World Games was held four times between 1922 and 1934, as well as a Women&#x27;s International and British Games in London in 1924. These efforts ultimately led to the introduction of five track and field events for women in the athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics. National women&#x27;s events were established in this period, with 1923 seeing the First British Track &amp; Field championships for women and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) sponsoring the first American Track &amp; Field championships for women. In China, women&#x27;s track and field events were being held in the 1920s, but were subject to criticism and disrespect from audiences. Physical education advocate Zhang Ruizhen called for greater equality and participation of women in Chinese track and field. The rise of Kinue Hitomi and her 1928 Olympic medal for Japan signified the growth of women&#x27;s track and field in East Asia. More women&#x27;s events were gradually introduced, though it was only towards the end of the century that the athletics programmes approached gender parity. Marking an increasingly inclusive approach to the sport, major track and field competitions for disabled athletes were first introduced at the 1960 Summer Paralympics.

With the rise of numerous regional championships, and the growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onward, the sport gained exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over half a century of amateurism, in the late 1970s the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by professionalism. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the US and replaced with a non-amateur body focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field). The IAAF abandoned amateurism in 1982 and later rebranded itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. While Western countries were limited to amateurs until the 1980s, the Soviet Bloc always fielded state-funded athletes who trained full-time, putting American and Western European athletes at a significant disadvantage. 1983 saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics, becoming, with the Olympics, one of track and field&#x27;s most prestigious competitions.

The profile of the sport reached an apogee in the 1980s, with a number of athletes becoming household names, like Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith Joyner. Many world records were broken then, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport&#x27;s popularity. The rising commerciality of track and field was also met with developments in sports science, and there were transformations in coaching methods, athlete&#x27;s diets, training facilities, and sports equipment. The use of performance-enhancing drugs also increased. State-sponsored doping in 1970s and 1980s East Germany, China, the Soviet Union, and early 21st century Russia, as well as prominent individual cases such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and marketability of the sport.

From the 1990s onward, track and field became increasingly more professional and international, as the IAAF gained over 200 member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition with the introduction of prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major track and field meetings in Europe—raised the economic incentive through its US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East—the first-ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.

==Events==

Track and field events are divided into three categories: track events, field events and combined events. The majority of athletes tend to specialize in one event type with the aim of perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over specified distances, and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—surmounting obstacles. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team members at the end of a certain distance.

There are two types of field events: jumps and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of the jumps. The performances of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and overstepping this mark is judged as a foul. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.

The throwing events involve hurling an implement (such as a heavyweight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on the distance that the object is thrown. Combined events involve the same group of athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete or team with the highest score at the end of all events is the winner.

==Track==

===Sprints===
Races over short distances, or sprints, are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event, the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other. Sprinting events are focused on athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100, 200, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric: the 100 metres evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440 yard dash or quarter-mile race.

At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the indoor 400 m. Races up to 100 m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete&#x27;s maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner&#x27;s near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation. Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20 metres.

Japanese man Hidekichi Miyazaki was the world&#x27;s oldest competitive sprinter, sprinting the 100m race at 105 years old before his death in 2019.

The 60 metres is a common indoor event and indoor world championship event. Less-common events include the 50, 55, 300, and 500 metres, which are run in some high school and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, though rarely competed, has a star-studded history: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea&#x27;s record in 2009.

===Middle distance===
The most common middle-distance track events are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear of the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.

Middle distance events can begin in one of two ways: a staggered start or a waterfall start. In the 800 meter race, athletes begin in individual lanes that are staggered before the turn. Runners must remain in their lanes for the first 100 m before cutting in to run as a pack. This rule was introduced to reduce jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. The 1500 meter and longer events typically use a waterfall start, where runners start the race from a standing position along a curved starting line and then immediately cut in towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. Physiologically, middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong endurance.

The 1500 m and mile run events have historically been some of the most prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other&#x27;s 1500 m and mile world records on a number of occasions in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who in 1954 was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute mile, and Jim Ryun&#x27;s exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s until the 2010s, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 and mile events. In the 2020s, Western European athletes have returned to the forefront of the distance, with athletes such as Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway, Jake Wightman, and Josh Kerr (both British milers) winning global titles. 

Beyond the short distances of sprinting events, factors such as an athlete&#x27;s reactions and top speed becomes less important, while qualities such as pace, tactics and endurance become more so.

===Long-distance===
There are three common long-distance running events in track and field competitions: 3000, 5000, and 10,000 metres. The latter two races are both Olympic and World Championship events outdoors, while the 3000 m is held at the IAAF World Indoor Championships. The 5000 m and 10,000 m events have their historical roots in the 3-mile and 6-mile races. The 3000 m was used as a women&#x27;s long-distance event, entering the World Championship programme in 1983 and Olympic programme in 1984, but this was abandoned in favour of a women&#x27;s 5000 m event in 1995. Marathons, while long-distance races, are typically run on street courses, and often are run separately from other track and field events.

In terms of competition rules and physical demands, long-distance track races have much in common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, stamina, and tactics become much greater factors in performances. A number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Saïd Aouita who set world records from 1500 m to 5000 m. The use of pace-setters in long-distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.

Long-distance track events gained popularity in the 1920s by the achievements of the &quot;Flying Finns&quot;, such as multiple Olympic champion Paavo Nurmi. The successes of Emil Zátopek in the 1950s promoted intense interval training methods, but Ron Clarke&#x27;s record-breaking feats established the importance of natural training and even-paced running. The 1990s saw the rise of North and East African runners in long-distance events. Kenyans and Ethiopians, in particular, have since remained dominant in these events.

===Relay races===
Relay races are the only track and field event in which a team of runners directly compete against other teams. Typically, a team is made up of four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.

Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300 yards. Two very common relay events are the 4×100 metres relay and the 4×400 metres relay. Both entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men&#x27;s medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4×100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4×400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inmost part of the circuit. For the second and third baton changeovers, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while members of slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.

In 2017, the IAAF introduced mixed relay events to the World Athletics Relays, in which two men and two women make up the four-person team.

In a shuttle hurdle relay, each of four hurdlers on a team runs the opposite direction from the preceding runner. No batons are used.

The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with 4×100 m and 4×400 m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the 4×200 m, 4×800 m and 4×1500 m relays. Other events include the distance medley relay (comprising legs of 1200, 400, 800, and 1600 metres), which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and was held at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics programme. Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings (or relay carnivals) are focused almost solely on relay events. 

===Hurdling===

Races with hurdles as obstacles were first popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was a variation of the 100-yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic Clubs in 1864 refined this, holding a 120-yard race (110 m) with ten hurdles of 3-foot and 6 inches (1.06 m) in height (each placed 10 yards (9 m) apart), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric (adding 28 cm) and the basics of this race, the men&#x27;s 110 metres hurdles, has changed little. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where around 1860 a competition was held over 440 yards and twelve 1.06 m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics: the distance was fixed to 400 m while ten 3-foot (91.44 cm) hurdles were placed 35 m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45 m and 40 m away from the start and finish, respectively. Women&#x27;s hurdles are slightly lower at 84 cm (2 ft 9 in) for the 100 m event and 76 cm (2 ft 6 in) for the 400 m event.

The most common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110 m hurdles for men and 400 m hurdles for both sexes. The men&#x27;s 110 m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men&#x27;s 400 m was introduced in the second edition of the Games. Women&#x27;s initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100 m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, but it was not until 1984 that a women&#x27;s 400 m hurdles event took place at the Olympics (having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year). Other distances and heights of hurdles, such as the 200 metres hurdles and low hurdles, were once common but are now held infrequently. The 300 metres hurdles is run in some levels of American competition.

Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men&#x27;s 2500 m and 4000 m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked the rise of the 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400 m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men&#x27;s steeplechase in track and field, the women&#x27;s steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance in 2008.

== Field ==
===Jumping===

The long jump is one of the oldest track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra momentum and distance. The modern long jump, standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete&#x27;s body.

The athletics competition at the first Olympics featured a men&#x27;s long jump competition and a women&#x27;s competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride to allow them to take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men&#x27;s version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912. , the men&#x27;s long jump world record is held by Mike Powell, jumping 8.95 meters in 1991.

====Triple jump====
Similar to the long jump, the triple jump takes place on a track heading towards a sandpit. Originally, athletes would hop on the same leg twice before jumping into the pit, but this was changed to the current &quot;hop, step and jump&quot; pattern from 1900 onwards. There is some dispute over whether the triple jump was contested in ancient Greece: while some historians claim that a contest of three jumps occurred at Ancient Games, others such as Stephen G. Miller believe this is incorrect, suggesting that the belief stems from a mythologised account of Phayllus of Croton having jumped 55 ancient feet (around 16.3 m). The Book of Leinster, a 12th-century Irish manuscript, records the existence of &quot;geal-ruith&quot; (triple jump) contests at the Tailteann Games.

The men&#x27;s triple jump competition has been ever-present at the modern Olympics, but it was not until 1993 that a women&#x27;s version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later. The men&#x27;s standing triple jump event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill. The Current world record for the Men&#x27;s triple jump is 18.29 meter (60 ft 0in) held by Jonathan Edwards. The current women&#x27;s world record is 15.67 meters (51 ft 4 3/4in) held by Yulimar Rojas.

====High jump====
The first recorded instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic rules of the modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot to jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men&#x27;s high jump was included in the 1896 Olympics and a women&#x27;s competition followed in 1928.

Jumping technique has played a significant part in the history of the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This technique has become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.

====Pole vault====
In terms of sport, the use of poles for vaulting distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.

The modern event sees athletes run down a strip of track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the horizontal bar before letting go of the pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women&#x27;s world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women&#x27;s Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.
===Throwing===
Track and field contains some of the foremost kinds of throwing sports, and the four major disciplines are the only pure throwing events to feature at the Olympic Games.

====Shot put====
The genesis of the shot put can be traced to pre-historic competitions with rocks: in the Middle Ages the stone put was known in Scotland and the steinstossen was recorded in Switzerland. In the 17th century, cannonball throwing competitions within the English military provided a precursor to the modern sport. The term &quot;shot&quot; originates from the use of round shot-style ammunition for the sport. The modern rules were first laid out in 1860 and required that competitors take legal throws within a square throwing area of seven feet (2.13 m) on each side. This was amended to a circle area with a seven-foot diameter in 1906, and the weight of the shot was standardised to 16 pounds (7.26 kg). Throwing technique was also refined over this period, with bent arm throws being banned as they were deemed too dangerous and the side-step and throw technique arising in the United States in 1876.

The shot put has been an Olympic sport for men since 1896 and a women&#x27;s competition using a 4 kg (8.82 lb) shot was added in 1948. Further throwing techniques have arisen since the post-war era: in the 1950s Parry O&#x27;Brien popularised the 180 degree turn and throw technique commonly known as the &quot;glide&quot;, breaking the world record 17 times along the way, while Aleksandr Baryshnikov and Brian Oldfield introduced the &quot;spin&quot; or rotational technique in 1976.

====Discus throw====
In the discus throw, athletes compete to throw a heavy disc the farthest. In standard competitions, athletes throw the disc from a set circular arc and take turns in a series of throw, with the singular best effort deciding the victor. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5 m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2 kg (4.4 pounds) in weight and 22 cm (8 inches) in diameter in 1907. The women&#x27;s discus was among the first women&#x27;s events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928. The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete František Janda-Suk, who invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus and won the 1900 Olympic silver medal.

====Javelin throw====
As an implement of war and hunting, the javelin throw began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an &quot;ankyle&quot; (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men&#x27;s competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line. The runway measures at a minimum of 30m in length, and is covered with the same surface as the track.

The first Olympic men&#x27;s javelin throw contest was held in 1908 and a women&#x27;s competition was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100 m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and the increasing number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men&#x27;s javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement&#x27;s downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from the record books. The women&#x27;s javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7 m in length and 800 grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3 m and 600 g for women.

====Hammer throw====
The earliest recorded precursors to the modern hammer throw stem from the Tailteann Games of ancient Ireland, which featured events such as throwing either a weight attached to a rope, a large rock on a wooden handle, or even a chariot wheel on a wooden axle. Other ancient competitions included throwing a cast iron ball attached to a wooden handle – the root of the term &quot;hammer throw&quot; due to their resemblance to the tools. In 16th century England, contests involving the throwing of actual blacksmith&#x27;s Sledgehammers were recorded. The hammer implement was standardised in 1887 and the competitions began to resemble the modern event. The weight of the metal ball was set at 16 pounds (7.26 kg) while the attached wire had to measure between 1.175 m and 1.215 m.

The men&#x27;s hammer throw became an Olympic event in 1900 but the women&#x27;s event – using a 4 kg (8.82 lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally featuring on the women&#x27;s Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards as a result of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers were historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.

==Combined events==

Combined (or multi-discipline) events are competitions in which athletes participate in a number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men&#x27;s decathlon (ten events) and the women&#x27;s heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men&#x27;s heptathlon and the women&#x27;s pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.

The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising long jump, javelin, discus, the &quot;stadion&quot; race and wrestling) was a precursor to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men&#x27;s all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.

==Stadiums==
===Outdoor===
The term &quot;track and field&quot; is intertwined with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a track and field stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this track—the field. In earlier competitions, track lengths varied: the Panathinaiko Stadium measured 333.33 metres at the 1896 Summer Olympics, while at the 1904 Olympics the distance was a third of a mile (536.45 m) at Francis Field. As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400 m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M&#x27;s Tartan track (an all-weather running track of polyurethane) gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport. Many track and field stadiums are multi-purpose stadiums, with the running track surrounding a field built for other sports, such as the various types of football.

The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped-down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.

The four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races.

===Indoor===
Basic indoor venues may be adapted gymnasiums, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.

Another common adaptation in the United States is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile; 148m) that fits into a common basketball court-sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60 m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put and weight throw are the only throwing events held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.

In addition to hosting the World Indoor Championships, the IAAF has hosted the IAAF World Indoor Tour since 2016.

In May 2023, World Athletics announced they were renaming &quot;indoor track&quot; and &quot;indoor athletics&quot; to &quot;short track&quot;, effectively expanding the &quot;indoor track&quot; category to allow for the theoretical possibility of an outdoor 200 meter-track being used for valid &quot;indoor&quot; qualification marks. The change took effect at the beginning of 2024.

Various events have been discontinued from the World Athletics Indoor Championships, including 200m and racewalking. Some race distance events have been held in world tour (IAAF World Indoor Tour and IAAF Indoor Permit Meetings in 1997 or later) events, including at Aviva Indoor Grand Prix and the Russian Winter Meeting, but never at the world championships, including:
*300m.
*500m (Millrose Games during Permit Meeting status).
*600m.
*1,000m.
*1 mile.
*2,000m.
*2 miles.
*5,000m.
*4×100m (Sparkassen Cup).
*4x200m (Millrose Games).
*4×800m (Millrose Games during Permit Meeting status).
*400m hurdles (2011 Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix).
*2,000m steeplechase (Indoor Flanders Meeting).

==Starts use in race==

===Track rules===
The rules of track events in athletics as observed in most international athletics competitions are set by the Competition Rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009. Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing. Current World Athletics (WA) Rules are available on WA&#x27;s website . Current USATF (USA) Competition Rules booklet is available on the USATF website . Prior USATF Competition Rules booklets are also available (2002, 2006 to 2020) .

====Starting====

The start of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish.
Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.

All races must be started by the report of the starter&#x27;s gun or approved starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position. An athlete may not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or feet when on their marks.

For sprint races up to 400 m, the starter gives two commands: &quot;on your marks&quot; to instruct athletes to approach the start line, followed by &quot;set&quot; to advise the athletes that the start of the race is imminent. The commands of the starter are typically given in the native language in national competitions, or in English or French in international competitions. Once all athletes are set in their starting position, the gun or an approved starting apparatus must be fired or activated. If the starter is not satisfied that all are ready to proceed, the athletes may be called out of the blocks and the process started over.

There are different types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at the outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800 m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until they reach a set of cones on the track that signal that they can cut in and move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.

An athlete, after assuming a final set position, may not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun, or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgment of the starter or recallers, he does so any earlier, it is considered a false start. It is deemed a false start if, in the judgment of the starter an athlete fails to comply with the commands &quot;on your marks&quot; or &quot;set&quot; as appropriate after a reasonable time; or an athlete after the command &quot;on your marks&quot; disturbs other athletes in the race through sound or otherwise. If the runner is in the &quot;set&quot; position and moves, then the runner is also disqualified. , any athlete making a false start is disqualified.

In International elite competition, electronically tethered starting blocks sense the reaction time of the athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start. Since 2009, the offending athletes are immediately disqualified.

====Running the race====

For sprinting events, except the 4 × 400 m relay and the indoor 400 metres, each athlete must run the race within their allocated lane from start to finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, the beginning of the 800 m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.

Any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.

====The finish====
The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. The finishing position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) are becoming more and more common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a sprint record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).

With the accuracy of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides that there has been a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.

===Field rules===
In general, most field events allow a competitor to take their attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the greatest distance.

==== Vertical Jumps ====
Vertical jumps (high jump and pole vault) set a bar at a particular height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor&#x27;s participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.

==== Horizontal Jumps ====
Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) and all throws must be initiated behind a line. In the case of horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition&#x27;s rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.

==Equipment==

Track and Field athletes wear special shoes with spikes, known as track spikes or simply spikes.

Men and women have different weights for their throwing implements – men&#x27;s javelin is 800 grams compared to 600 for women, men&#x27;s weight throw is 35 pounds compared to 20 for women, men&#x27;s discus is 2 kilograms to women&#x27;s 1, men&#x27;s shot put is 16 pounds compared to 8 pounds for women, and men&#x27;s hammer throw is also 16 pounds to the women&#x27;s 8. Additionally, men&#x27;s high hurdles are at height of 42 inches compared to women&#x27;s hurdles which are 33 inches. For the intermediate hurdles (400 meter hurdles), the men&#x27;s hurdle height is 36 inches compared to 30 inches for women.

==Organizations==
The international governance of track and field falls under the jurisdiction of athletics organisations. World Athletics is the global governing body for track and field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of track and field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track &amp; Field and the Philippine Amateur Track &amp; Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just track and field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local track and field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.

==Competitions==

===Olympics, Paralympics and world championships===

The major global track and field competitions are both held under the scope of athletics. Track and field contests make up the majority of events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.

The other two major international competition for track and field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships has been held every two years since 1985 and this is the only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.

===Other championships===

Similar to the event programmes at the Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships, track and field forms a significant part of continental championships. The South American Championships in Athletics, created in 1919, was the first continental championships and the European Athletics Championships became the second championships of this type in 1934. The Asian Athletics Championships and African Championships in Athletics were created in the 1970s and Oceania started its championships in 1990.

There are also indoor continental competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There has not been a consistent championships for all of North America, which may be (in part) due to the success of both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.

===Multi-sport events===
Mirroring the role that track and field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is featured within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among some of the first of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.

After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the most prominent events for track and field athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from track and field athletes. Track and field is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic track and field athletes.

===Meetings===

One-day track and field meetings form the most common and seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of track and field competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.

The most basic type of meetings are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow people of all ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport.

At the professional level, meetings began to offer significant financial incentives for all athletes in the 1990s in Europe with the creation of the Golden Four competition, comprising meetings in Zürich, Brussels, Berlin and Oslo. This expanded and received IAAF backing as the IAAF Golden League in 1998, which was later supplemented by the branding of selected meetings worldwide as the IAAF World Athletics Tour. In 2010, the Golden League idea was expanded globally as the Diamond League series and this now forms the top tier of professional one-day track and field meetings.

=== World rankings ===
The IAAF World Rankings system was introduced for the 2018 season. An athlete&#x27;s position within the ranking will be determined by points scored based on their performance and importance of the competition. The points will be considered for eligibility for the World Athletics Championships and Olympic Games. This system will affect athlete participation, which has typically been determined by national bodies, either through selection panels or national trials events.

==Records==
Athletes performances are timed or measured at virtually all track and field competitions. Doing so can not only serve as a way of determining the winner in an event, but it can also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s performances are recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete&#x27;s performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.

The IAAF ratifies track and field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first published a world records list in 1914, initially for men&#x27;s events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women&#x27;s events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes were made in the late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in track and field, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.

The next most important record type are those achieved at a specific competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics. All major championships and games have their relevant competition records and a large number of track and field meetings keep a note of their meet records. Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation. Cash bonuses are usually offered to athletes if they break significant records, as doing so can generate greater interest and public attendance in track and field competitions.

==Doping==
Track and field athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain substances by governing bodies for the sport, from the national to the international level. The IAAF&#x27;s constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping and the use of anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes&#x27; performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes&#x27; health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins&#x27; failed drug test due to asthma medication.

Athletes have historically been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted both in and out of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.

Doping has played a significant part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from East Germany in track and field from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems as a result of the regime. A similar state-sponsored doping system was developed in the Soviet Union. According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency&#x27;s officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet competitors were &quot;rescued with [these] tremendous efforts&quot;. Regarding the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said, &quot;There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists&#x27; Games.&quot; In 2016, The New York Times published an article detailing the use of doping by the Soviets in preparation for the 1984 Olympics. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100 metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. The revelation state-sponsored doping in Russia led to an international ban on all its athletes in 2016, with Russians having to apply to the IAAF to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes at events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2017 World Championships in Athletics. Doping has affected countries on all continents and has occurred in individual, team and national settings.

==Related sports==
Track and field bears most similarity to the others categorised under the sport of athletics, specifically cross country running, and road forms of racewalking and running. All these forms of racing tend to record finishing times, have strictly defined start and finish points, and are generally individual in nature. Middle- and long-distance runners usually participate in cross country and road events, in addition to the track. Track racewalkers are most typically road specialists as well. It is unusual for track and field athletes outside of these two groups to compete in cross country or road events.

Varieties of strength athletics, such as the World&#x27;s Strongest Man and highland games, often incorporate forms of footracing, carrying heavy objects, as well as throwing events such as the caber toss and keg toss, which bear similarities to track and field throwing events.

<text>The Ländler () is a European folk dance in time. Along with the waltz and allemande, the ländler was sometimes referred to by the generic term German Dance in publications during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Despite its association with Germany, the ländler was danced in many European countries. Composers from a variety of European nations wrote music for the ländler dance; including Austria, Switzerland, Bohemia, Moravia, Slovenia and northern Italy in addition to Germany. 

==History==
The ländler is a partner dance that strongly features hopping and stamping. It might be purely instrumental or have a vocal part, sometimes featuring yodeling.

When dance halls became popular in Europe in the 19th century, the Ländler was made quicker and more elegant, and the men shed the hobnail boots that they wore to dance it. Along with a number of other folk dances from Germany and Bohemia, it is thought to have influenced the development of the waltz.

A number of classical composers wrote or included Ländler in their music, including Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Anton Bruckner. In several of his symphonies, Gustav Mahler replaced the menuet with a Ländler. The Carinthian folk tune quoted in Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; is a Ländler, and another features in Act II of his opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. The &quot;German Dances&quot; of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn also resemble Ländler. Josef Lanner (1801–1843) wrote several Ländlers. He, along with Johann Strauss I and Johann Strauss II, helped popularize the waltz in Vienna and elsewhere. The Johann Strauss II waltz &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot; features a zither playing in the style of a Ländler. Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes &quot;features a Ländler in the scene where a dance night is occurring in the hall.

&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; Broadway musical, the film, and the American and British live TV broadcasts (&quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Sound of Music Live&quot; (2015)) all feature a scene where the protagonists Maria and Captain von Trapp dance a Ländler. The instrumental tune used in that sequence is a -time rearrangement of the more polka-like &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot;. Compare this one to the &quot;Dornbacher&quot; Ländler by Lanner, and one will hear many similarities. The choreographers for the motion picture researched the traditional Austrian folk dance and integrated it into the choreography of the Ländler danced in the film.

<text>The Battle of Hattin took place on 4 July 1187, between the Crusader states of the Levant and the forces of the Ayyubid sultan Saladin. It is also known as the Battle of the Horns of Hattin, due to the shape of the nearby extinct volcano of that name.

The Muslim armies under Saladin captured or killed the vast majority of the Crusader forces, removing their capability to wage war. As a direct result of the battle, Muslims once again became the eminent military power in the Holy Land, re-capturing Jerusalem and most of the other Crusader-held cities and castles. These Christian defeats prompted the Third Crusade, which began two years after the Battle of Hattin.

==Location==
The battle took place near Tiberias in present-day Israel. The battlefield, near the village of Hittin, had as its chief geographic feature a double hill (the &quot;Horns of Hattin&quot;) beside a pass through the northern mountains between Tiberias and the road from Acre to the east. The Roman road, known to the Arabs as Darb al-Hawarnah, served as the main east–west passage between the Jordan fords, the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean coast.

==Background==
Guy of Lusignan became king of Jerusalem in 1186, in right of his wife, Sibylla, after the death of her son Baldwin V. The Kingdom of Jerusalem was divided between the &quot;court faction&quot; of Guy, consisting of Sibylla and relative newcomers to the kingdom such as Raynald of Châtillon, Gerard of Ridefort and the Knights Templar; versus the &quot;nobles&#x27; faction&quot;, led by Raymond III of Tripoli, who had been a regent for the child-king Baldwin V and had opposed Guy&#x27;s succession. Raymond III of Tripoli had supported the claim of Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister Isabella and Isabella&#x27;s husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, and led the rival faction to the court party. Open warfare was prevented only by Humphrey of Toron swearing allegiance to Guy, which ended the succession dispute. The Muslim chronicler Ali ibn al-Athir claimed that Raymond was in a &quot;state of open rebellion&quot; against Guy.

In the background of those divisions, Saladin had become vizier of Egypt in 1169 and had taken Damascus in 1174 and Aleppo in 1183. He controlled the entire southern and eastern flanks of the crusader states and united his subjects under Sunni Islam, convincing them that he would wage holy war to push the Christian Franks from Jerusalem. Saladin often made strategic truces with the Franks when he needed to deal with political problems in the Muslim world, and one such truce was made in 1185.

It was rumoured by the Franks that Raymond III of Tripoli had made an agreement with Saladin under which Saladin would make him King of Jerusalem in return for peace. That rumour was echoed by Ibn al Athir, whether that was true is unclear. Raymond III was certainly reluctant to engage in battle with Saladin.

In 1187 Raynald of Châtillon raided a Muslim Hajj caravan while the truce with Saladin was still in place. Saladin swore that he would kill Raynald for violating the truce, and he sent his son Al-Afdal and the emir Gökböri to raid the Frankish lands surrounding Acre. Gerard de Ridefort and the Templars engaged Gökböri in the Battle of Cresson in May 1187 and were heavily defeated. The Templars lost around 150 knights and 300 foot-soldiers, who had made up a great part of the military of Jerusalem. Jonathan Phillips states that &quot;the damage to Frankish morale and the scale of the losses should not be underestimated in contributing towards the defeat at Hattin&quot;.

In July, Saladin laid siege to Tiberias, where Raymond III&#x27;s wife, Eschiva of Bures, was trapped. In spite of that, Raymond argued that Guy should not engage Saladin in battle and that Saladin could not hold Tiberias because his troops would not stand to be away from their families for so long. The Knights Hospitaller also advised Guy not to provoke Saladin.

Gerard de Ridefort however advised Guy to advance against Saladin, and Guy took his advice. Norman Housley suggests that that was because &quot;the minds of both men had been so poisoned by the political conflict 1180-1187 that they could only see Raymond&#x27;s advice as designed to bring them personal ruin&quot; and also because he had spent Henry II of England&#x27;s donations in calling the army and was reluctant to disband it without a battle. That was a gamble on Guy&#x27;s part, as he had left only a few knights to defend the city of Jerusalem.

==Siege of Tiberias==
In late May, Saladin assembled the largest army he had ever commanded on the Golan Heights, around 40,000 men including about 12,000 regular cavalry. He inspected his forces at Tell-Ashtara before crossing the River Jordan on 30 June. Saladin had also unexpectedly gained the alliance of the Druze community based in Sarahmul led by Jamal ad-Din Hajji, whose father Karama was an age-old ally of Nur ad-Din Zangi. The city of Sarahmul had been sacked by the crusaders on various occasions and according to Jamal ad-Din Hajji the crusaders even manipulated the Assassins to kill his three elder brothers. Saladin&#x27;s army was organised as a centre and two wings: Gökböri commanded the left of the army, Saladin himself commanded the centre and his nephew, Al-Muzaffar Umar (Taki ad-Din), the right.

The opposing Crusader army amassed at La Saphorie, a well-watered position with a small castle, which had previously served as a mustering point in the event of Muslim intrusions from the east. On this occasion the Crusader force consisted of around 18,000–20,000 men, including 1,200 knights from Jerusalem and Tripoli and 50 from Antioch. Though the army was smaller than Saladin&#x27;s it was still larger than those usually mustered by the Crusaders. The usual levy of those who owed feudal service was extended, on this occasion of extreme threat, to include a call to arms of all able-bodied men in the kingdom.

After reconciling, Raymond and Guy met at Acre with the bulk of the Crusader army. According to some European sources, aside from the knights there were a greater number of lighter cavalry, and perhaps 10,000 foot soldiers, supplemented by crossbowmen from the Italian merchant fleet, and a large number of mercenaries (including indigenous Turcopoles) hired with money donated to the kingdom by Henry II, King of England. The army&#x27;s standard was the relic of the True Cross, carried by the Bishop of Acre, who was sent on behalf of the ailing Patriarch Heraclius.

Saladin decided to lure Guy into moving his field army away from their secure fortified encampment, located by the springs at La Saphorie (an important local source of water). He calculated the Crusaders could be defeated more easily in a field battle than by besieging their fortifications. On 2 July Saladin personally led an assault on Raymond&#x27;s fortress of Tiberias, while the main Muslim army remained at Kafr Sabt. The garrison at Tiberias tried to bribe Saladin to leave the castle undisturbed, but he refused, later stating that &quot;when the people realized they had an opponent who could not be tricked and would not be contented with tribute, they were afraid lest war might eat them up and they asked for quarter... but the servant gave the sword dominion over them.&quot; Within a day, one of the fortress&#x27; towers was mined and collapsed. Saladin&#x27;s troops stormed the breach, killing some of the opposing force and taking prisoners. Raymond&#x27;s wife Eschiva of Bures held out with the surviving Frankish troops in the citadel.

As the Muslim troops began to construct a second mine to attack the citadel on 3 July, Saladin received news that Guy was moving the Frankish army east. The Crusaders had taken the bait. Guy&#x27;s decision to leave La Saphorie was the result of a Crusader war council held on the night of 2 July. Records of this meeting are biased due to personal feuds among the Franks, but it seems Raymond argued that a march from Acre to Tiberias was exactly what Saladin wanted while La Saphorie was a strong position for the Crusaders to defend. Raymond also claimed Guy shouldn&#x27;t worry about Tiberias, which Raymond held personally and was willing to give up for the safety of the kingdom. In response to this argument, and despite their reconciliation (internal court politics remaining strong), Raymond was accused of cowardice by Gerard and Raynald. This led Guy to resolve on an immediate counter-attack against Saladin at Tiberias.

==Battle==
On 3 July the Frankish army started out towards Tiberias, harassed constantly by Muslim archers. They passed the Springs of Turan, which were entirely insufficient to provide the army with water. At midday, Raymond of Tripoli decided that the army would not reach Tiberias by nightfall, and he and Guy agreed to change the course of the march and veer to the left in the direction of the Springs of Kafr Hattin, only 6 miles (9.7 km) away. From there they could march down to Tiberias the following day. The Muslims positioned themselves between the Frankish army and the water so that the Franks were forced to pitch camp overnight on the arid plateau near the village of Meskenah. The Muslims surrounded the camp so closely that &quot;a cat could not have escaped&quot;. According to Ibn al Athir, the Franks were &quot;despondent, tormented by thirst&quot; whilst Saladin&#x27;s men were jubilant in anticipation of their victory.

Throughout the night, the Muslims further demoralized the crusaders by praying, singing, beating drums, showing symbols, and chanting. They set fire to the dry grass, making the crusaders&#x27; throats even drier. The Crusaders were thirsty, demoralized and exhausted. The Muslim army, by contrast, had a caravan of camels bring goatskins of water up from Lake Tiberias (now known as the Sea of Galilee).

On the morning of 4 July the crusaders were blinded by smoke from the fires set by Saladin&#x27;s forces. The Franks came under fire from Muslim mounted archers from the division commanded by Gökböri, who had been resupplied with 400 loads of arrows that had been brought up during the night. Gerard and Raynald advised Guy to form battle lines and attack, which was done by Guy&#x27;s brother Amalric. Raymond led the first division with Raymond of Antioch, the son of Bohemund III of Antioch, while Balian and Joscelin III of Edessa formed the rearguard.

Thirsty and demoralized, the crusaders broke camp and changed direction for the springs of Hattin, but their ragged approach was attacked by Saladin&#x27;s army, which blocked the route forward and any possible retreat. Count Raymond launched two charges in an attempt to break through to the water supply at Lake Tiberias. The second of these enabled him to reach the lake and make his way to Tyre.

After Raymond escaped, Guy&#x27;s position was now even more desperate. Most of the Christian infantry had effectively deserted by fleeing en masse onto the Horns of Hattin, where they played no further part in the battle. Overwhelmed by thirst and wounds, many of Guy&#x27;s soldiers were killed on the spot without resistance while the remainder were taken prisoner. Their plight was such that five of Raymond&#x27;s knights went over to the Muslim leaders to beg that they be mercifully put to death. Guy attempted to pitch the tents again to block the Muslim cavalry. The Christian knights and mounted serjeants were disorganized, but still fought on.

Now the crusaders were surrounded and, despite three desperate charges on Saladin&#x27;s position, were broken up and defeated. An eyewitness account of this is given by Saladin&#x27;s 17-year-old son, al-Afdal. It is quoted by Muslim chronicler Ibn al-Athir:

When the king of the Franks [Guy] was on the hill with that band, they made a formidable charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [Saladin]. I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale. He took hold of his beard and advanced, crying out &quot;Give the lie to the Devil!&quot; The Muslims rallied, returned to the fight, and climbed the hill. When I saw that the Franks withdrew, pursued by the Muslims, I shouted for joy, &quot;We have beaten them!&quot; But the Franks rallied and charged again like the first time and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, &quot;We have beaten them!&quot; but my father rounded on me and said, &quot;Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [Guy&#x27;s] falls.&quot; As he was speaking to me, the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty, and wept for joy.

==Surrender of crusaders==
Prisoners after the battle included Guy, his brother Amalric II, Raynald de Chatillon, William V of Montferrat, Gerard de Ridefort, Humphrey IV of Toron, Hugh of Jabala, Plivain of Botron, Hugh of Gibelet, and other barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Guy of Lusignan and Raynald of Chatillon were brought to Saladin&#x27;s tent. Saladin offered Guy water, which was a sign in Muslim culture that the prisoner would be spared, but Guy was unaware of that. Guy passed the goblet to Raynald, but Saladin struck it from his hands and said, &quot;I did not ask this evil man to drink, and he would not save his life by doing so&quot;. He then charged Raynald with breaking the truce.

Some reports, such as that of Baha al-Din, claim that Saladin himself then executed Raynald with a single stroke of his sword. Others record that Saladin struck Raynald as a sign to his bodyguards to behead him. Guy assumed that he would also be beheaded, but Saladin assured him that &quot;kings do not kill kings.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Crusader battle losses===
The True Cross was supposedly fixed upside down on a lance and sent to Damascus.

The Crusader king, Guy of Lusignan, was taken to Damascus as a prisoner and granted release in 1188, while the other noble captives were eventually ransomed.

After executing Raynald of Chatillon, Saladin ordered that the other captive barons be spared and treated humanely. All 200 of the Templar and Hospitaller Knights taken prisoner were executed on Saladin&#x27;s orders, with the exception of the Grand Master of the Temple. The executions were by decapitation. Saint Nicasius, a Knight Hospitaller later venerated as a Roman Catholic martyr, is said to have been one of the victims. Imad ed-Din, Saladin&#x27;s secretary, wrote: 
Saladin ordered that they should be beheaded, choosing to have them dead rather than in prison. With him was a whole band of scholars and sufis and a certain number of devout men and ascetics; each begged to be allowed to kill one of them, and drew his sword and rolled back his sleeve. Saladin, his face joyful, was sitting on his dais; the unbelievers showed black despair.

Captured turcopoles (locally recruited mounted archers employed by the crusader states) were also executed on Saladin&#x27;s orders. Though the prisoners claimed to be Christians by heritage, Saladin believed the turcopoles to be Christian converts from Islam, which was punishable by death under the form of Islamic jurisprudence followed by the Ayyubid state. Modern historians have corroborated Saladin&#x27;s belief that the turcopoles in the Ayyubid–Crusader wars were mostly recruited from converted Turks and Arabs.

The rest of the captured knights and soldiers were sold into slavery, and one was reportedly bought in Damascus in exchange for some sandals. The high-ranking Frankish barons captured were held in Damascus and treated well. Some of Saladin&#x27;s men left the army after the battle, taking lower-ranking Frankish prisoners with them as slaves.

===Crusader kingdom falls to Saladin===
On Sunday 5 July Saladin marched the six miles (10km) to Tiberias, and Countess Eschiva surrendered the citadel of the fortress. She was allowed to leave for Tripoli with all of her family, followers, and possessions. Raymond of Tripoli, having escaped the battle, died of pleurisy later in 1187.

In fielding an army of 20,000 men, the Crusaders had reduced the garrisons of their castles and fortified settlements. The heavy defeat at Hattin meant there was little reserve with which to defend against Saladin&#x27;s forces. Only some 200 knights escaped the battle. The importance of the defeat is demonstrated by the fact that in its aftermath, fifty-two towns and fortifications were captured by Saladin&#x27;s forces. By mid-September, Saladin had taken Acre, Nablus, Jaffa, Toron, Sidon, Beirut, and Ascalon. Tyre was saved by the arrival of Conrad of Montferrat, resulting in Saladin&#x27;s siege of Tyre being repulsed with heavy losses. Jerusalem was defended by Queen Sibylla, Latin Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem, and Balian, who subsequently negotiated its surrender to Saladin on 2 October (see Siege of Jerusalem).

===Significance in crusading history===
According to the chronicler Ernoul, news of the defeat brought to Rome by Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre caused Pope Urban III to die of shock. Urban&#x27;s successor, Pope Gregory VIII, issued the bull &quot;Audita tremendi&quot; calling for a new crusade within days of his election. In England and France, the Saladin tithe was enacted to raise funds for the new crusade. The subsequent Third Crusade did not get underway until 1189, but was a very successful military operation through which many Christian holdings were restored. Nonetheless, Christian control over territories in the Holy Land remained vulnerable for decades until the Battle of La Forbie of 1244, 57 years after the Battle of Hattin, which marked the final collapse of Crusader military power in Outremer.

<text>The City Hall, Dublin (), originally the Royal Exchange, is a civic building in Dublin, Ireland. It was built between 1769 and 1779, to the designs of architect Thomas Cooley, and is a notable example of 18th-century architecture in the city. Originally used by the merchants of the city, it is today the formal seat of Dublin City Council.

==Location==
City Hall is located on a slope on Dame Street, at the southern end of Parliament Street, on Dublin&#x27;s southern side. It stands in front of part of Dublin Castle, the centre of British government in Ireland until 1922.

==History==

The building occupied the site of what was formerly Cork House, the home of the Earl of Cork until his death in 1643, as well as Lucas&#x27;s Coffee-House. Prior to that point, the site was occupied by the church of St. Mary del Dam from which Dame Street gets its name.

Parliament Street had been laid-out in 1753, providing a continuation of Capel Street on the north bank of the Liffey, across the newly widened Essex Bridge. Originally built as the &quot;Royal Exchange&quot;, the structure was designed by Thomas Cooley, who had won a design competition run for the project between 1768 and 1769. The foundation stone was laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend on 2 August 1769 and was officially opened for business in 1779.

The function of the building was to act as a form of stock exchange and to provide a meeting place for Dublin&#x27;s businessmen. It was also close to the old Custom House making it convenient for overseas merchants. The cost of building the exchange was met by the Parliament of Ireland, and this is reflected by the initials &quot;SPQH&quot;, standing for &quot;Senatus PopulusQue Hibernicus&quot;, meaning &quot;The senate and people of Ireland&quot; (an Irish version of SPQR).

The city government had previously been located in the mediæval Tholsel at the corner of Nicholas Street and Christchurch Place, approximately 300 metres to the west where the Peace Park is now located as well in various other forms and locations including the &quot;Thingmount&quot; near present-day Suffolk Street. In the late 18th century, meetings were held at what is now City Assembly House on South William Street.

In 1815 the metal balustrade of the exchange fell, owing to the pressure against it by a crowd, which led to the death of nine people, with many more injured. This led to crowd restrictions in the building.

In the 1850s, Dublin Corporation bought the Royal Exchange and converted it for use by the city government. The changes included the construction of partitions around the ambulatory, the addition of a new staircase from the rotunda to the upper floors, and the sub-division of the vaults for storage. On 30 September 1852, the Royal Exchange was renamed &quot;City Hall&quot; at the first meeting of Dublin City Council held there. The ward name &quot;Royal Exchange&quot; was retained, corresponding to the current electoral divisions of Royal Exchange A and B. A series of frescos were later added, representing the regions of Ireland.

During the 1916 Easter Rising, the City Hall was used as a garrison for the Irish Citizen Army. Sean Connolly seized the building using a key which he obtained as he worked in the motor department and had access to the building. There were 35 people based here, mostly women. It was in this area where the first casualty of the rising, a guard named James O’Brien, occurred at Dublin Castle and he was shot by Sean Connolly while on duty. In total, the entire siege lasted about 12 hours.

==Structure==

The exterior of the building is primarily made out of white Portland stone from a quarry in Dorset. The carved capitals were by Simon Vierpyl, and plasterwork by the stuccodore Charles Thorpe. The neo-classical building contains a central entrance hall or Rotunda, with a large dome supported by twelve columns which are surrounded by an ambulatory where merchants strolled and discussed business meetings. The twelve columns supporting the dome are high and the dome itself is another high above that.

Patrick Wyse Jackson, curator of the Geological Museum in Trinity College, assessed the building in 1993 as part of his book &quot;The Building Stones of Dublin: A Walking Guide&quot; and made the following observation:
:&quot; &quot;...it is faced with Portland Stone and capped with a fine pattinated-copper green dome. Examination of the stone facing the River Liffey shows that it has deteriorated badly. It is blistered in places and supports a good population of algae and mosses. These plants tend to retain water, which accelerates the breakdown of the Portland Stone&quot;.&quot;

==Use==
Some council meetings take place in City Hall. Dublin Corporation itself was renamed in the early 21st century as &quot;Dublin City Council&quot;, previously the name of the assembly of councillors only. Most City Council staff work in the newer, brutalist style, Civic Offices, controversially built from 1979 on the site of a national monument, the Viking city foundations on Wood Quay, a short distance away.

There is an exhibition on the history of Dublin City, called &quot;Dublin City Hall, The Story of the Capital&quot;, located in the vaults of the building.

<doc id="194910" wikidata="Q781634" url="?curid=194910" title="Steve Earle">
<text>Stephen Fain Earle (; born January 17, 1955) is an American country, rock and folk singer-songwriter. He began his career as a songwriter in Nashville and released his first EP in 1982.

Earle&#x27;s breakthrough album was the 1986 debut album &quot;Guitar Town&quot;; the eponymous lead single peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country chart. Since then, he has released 20 more studio albums and received three Grammy awards each for Best Contemporary Folk Album; he has four additional nominations in the same category. &quot;Copperhead Road&quot; was released in 1988 and is his bestselling single; it peaked on its initial release at number 10 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and had a 21st-century resurgence reaching number 15 on the Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart, buoyed by vigorous online sales. His songs have been recorded by Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Levon Helm, The Highwaymen, Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, Shawn Colvin, Bob Seger, Percy Sledge, Dailey &amp; Vincent, and Emmylou Harris.

Earle has appeared in film and television, most notably as recurring characters in HBO&#x27;s critically acclaimed shows &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;Treme&quot;. He has also written a novel, a play, and a book of short stories. Earle is the father of late singer-songwriter Justin Townes Earle with whom he frequently collaborated.

==Early life==
Earle was born on January 17, 1955, in Fort Monroe, Virginia, where his father was stationed as an air traffic controller. The family moved to Texas before Earle&#x27;s second birthday and he grew up primarily in the San Antonio area.

Earle began learning the guitar at the age of 11 and entered a school talent contest at age 13. He ran away from home at age 14 to search for his idol, singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt. Earle was &quot;rebellious&quot; as a young man and dropped out of school at the age of 16. He moved to Houston with his 19-year-old uncle, also a musician. While in Houston Earle finally met Van Zandt. Earle was opposed to the Vietnam War as he recalled in 2012: &quot;The anti-war movement was a very personal thing for me. I didn&#x27;t finish high school, so I wasn&#x27;t a candidate for a student deferment. I was fucking going.&quot; The end of the Selective Service Act and the draft lottery in 1973 prevented him from being drafted, but several of his friends were drafted, which he credits as the origin of his politicization. Earle also noted that when he was a young man, his girlfriend was able to get an abortion despite the fact that abortion was illegal. Her father was a doctor at the local hospital in San Antonio while several other girls he knew at the time were not able to get abortions; they lacked access to those with the necessary power to arrange an abortion, which he credits as the origin of his pro-choice views.

==Career==
===1974–1999===
In 1974, at the age of 19, Earle moved to Nashville and began working blue-collar jobs during the day and playing music at night. During this period Earle wrote songs and played bass guitar in Guy Clark&#x27;s band and sang on Clark&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Old No. 1&quot;. Earle appeared in the 1976 film &quot;Heartworn Highways&quot;, a documentary on the Nashville music scene which included David Allan Coe, Guy Clark, Townes van Zandt, and Rodney Crowell. Earle lived in Nashville for several years and assumed the position of staff songwriter at the publishing company Sunbury Dunbar. Later Earle grew tired of Nashville and returned to Texas where he started a band called The Dukes.
In the 1980s, Earle returned to Nashville once again and worked as a songwriter for the publishers Roy Dea and Pat Carter. A song he co-wrote, &quot;When You Fall in Love&quot;, was recorded by Johnny Lee and made number 14 on the country charts in 1982. Carl Perkins recorded Earle&#x27;s song &quot;Mustang Wine&quot;, and two of his songs were recorded by Zella Lehr. Later Dea and Carter created an independent record label called &quot;LSI&quot; and invited Earle to begin recording his own material on their label. Connie Smith recorded Earle&#x27;s composition &quot;A Far Cry from You&quot; in 1985 which reached a minor position on the country charts as well.

Earle released an EP called &quot;Pink &amp; Black&quot; in 1982 featuring the Dukes. Acting as Earle&#x27;s manager, John Lomax sent the EP to Epic Records, and they signed Earle to a recording contract in 1983. In 1983, Earle signed a record deal with CBS and recorded a &quot;neo-rockabilly album&quot;.

After losing his publishing contract with Dea and Carter, Earle met producer Tony Brown and after severing his ties with Lomax and Epic Records obtained a seven-record deal with MCA Records. Earle released his first full-length album, &quot;Guitar Town&quot;, on MCA Records in 1986. The title track became a Top Ten single in 1986 and his song &quot;Goodbye&#x27;s All We&#x27;ve Got Left&quot; reached the Top Ten in 1987. That same year he released a compilation of earlier recordings, entitled &quot;Early Tracks&quot;, and an album with the Dukes, called &quot;Exit 0&quot;, which &quot;received critical acclaim&quot; for its blend of country and rock.

Earle released &quot;Copperhead Road&quot; on Uni Records in 1988 which was characterized as &quot;a quixotic project that mixed a lyrical folk tradition with hard rock and eclectic Irish influences such as The Pogues, who guested on the record&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track portrays a Vietnam veteran who uses his family background in running moonshine to become a marijuana grower/seller. It was Earle&#x27;s highest-peaking song to date in the United States and has sold 1.1 million digital copies there as of September 2017. Then Earle began &quot;three years in a mysterious vaporization&quot; according to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

His 1990 album &quot;The Hard Way&quot; had a strong rock sound and was followed by &quot;a shoddy live album&quot; called &quot;Shut Up and Die Like an Aviator&quot;. In August 1991, Earle appeared on the TV show &quot;The Texas Connection&quot; &quot;looking pale and blown out&quot;. In light of Earle&#x27;s &quot;increasing drug use&quot;, MCA Records did not renew his contract and Earle didn&#x27;t record any music for the next four years. By July 1993 Earle was reported to have regained his normal weight and had started to write new material. At that time a writer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called Earle &quot;a visionary symbol of the New Traditionalist movement in country music.&quot;

In 1994, two staff members at Warner/Chappell publishing company and Earle&#x27;s former manager, John Dotson, created an in-house CD of Earle&#x27;s songs entitled &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; and showcased it to some recording artists in Nashville. This resulted in several of Earle&#x27;s songs being recorded by Travis Tritt, Stacy Dean Campbell and Robert Earl Keen. After his recording hiatus, Earle released &quot;Train a Comin&#x27;&quot; on Winter Harvest Records and it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1996. The album was characterized as a return to the &quot;folksy acoustic&quot; sound of his early career.

In 1996, Earle formed his own record label, E-Squared Records, and released the album &quot;I Feel Alright&quot;, which combined the musical sounds of country, rock and rockabilly. Earle released the album &quot;El Corazon&quot; (The Heart) in 1997 which one reviewer called &quot;the capstone of this [Earle&#x27;s] remarkable comeback&quot;.

According to Earle, he wrote the song &quot;Over Yonder&quot; about a death row inmate with whom he exchanged letters before attending his execution in 1998. He made a foray into bluegrass influenced music in 1999 when he released the album &quot;The Mountain&quot; with the Del McCoury Band. In 2000, Earle recorded his album &quot;Transcendental Blues&quot;, which features the song &quot;Galway Girl&quot;.

=== 2000–present ===

Earle presented excerpts of his poetry and fiction writing at the 2000 New Yorker Festival. His novel, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive&quot;, was published in the spring of 2011 and a collection of short stories called &quot;Doghouse Roses&quot; followed that June. Earle wrote and produced an off-Broadway play about the death of Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed since the death penalty was reinstated in Texas.
In the early 2000s, Earle&#x27;s album &quot;Jerusalem&quot; expressed his anti-war, anti-death penalty and his other &quot;leftist views&quot;. The album&#x27;s song &quot;John Walker&#x27;s Blues&quot;, about the captured American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh created controversy. Earle responded by appearing on a variety of news and editorial programs and defended the song and his views on patriotism and terrorism. His subsequent tour featured the &quot;Jerusalem&quot; album and was released as the live album &quot;Just an American Boy&quot; in 2003.

In 2004, Earle released the album &quot;The Revolution Starts Now&quot;, a collection of songs influenced by the Iraq War and the policies of the George W. Bush administration and won a Grammy for best contemporary folk album. The title song was used by General Motors in a TV advertisement. The album was released during the U.S. presidential campaign.

The song &quot;The Revolution Starts Now&quot; was used in the promotional materials for Michael Moore&#x27;s anti-war documentary film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and appears on the album &quot;Songs and Artists That Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. That year Earle was the subject of a documentary DVD called &quot;Just an American Boy&quot;. It was also used in the &quot;Andor Season 2 trailer&quot;.

In 2006, Earle contributed a cover of Randy Newman&#x27;s song &quot;Rednecks&quot; to the tribute album &quot;Sail Away: The Songs of Randy Newman&quot;. Earle hosted a radio show on Air America from August 2004 until June 2007. Later he began hosting a show called &quot;Hardcore Troubadour&quot; on the Outlaw Country channel. Earle is also the subject of two biographies, &quot;Steve Earle: Fearless Heart, Outlaw Poet&quot;, by David McGee and &quot;Hardcore Troubadour: The Life and Near Death of Steve Earle&quot; by Lauren St John.
In September 2007, Earle released his twelfth studio album, &quot;Washington Square Serenade&quot;, on New West Records. Earle recorded the album after relocating to New York City, and this was his first use of digital audio recording. The album features Earle&#x27;s then-wife, Allison Moorer, on &quot;Days Aren&#x27;t Long Enough&quot; and &quot;Down Here Below&quot;. The album includes Earle&#x27;s version of Tom Waits&#x27; song &quot;Way Down in the Hole&quot; which was the theme song for the fifth season of the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot; in which Earle appeared as a recovering drug addict and drug counselor named Walon (Earle&#x27;s character appears in the first, fourth, and fifth seasons). In 2008, Earle produced Joan Baez&#x27;s album &quot;Day After Tomorrow&quot;. Prior to their collaboration on &quot;Day After Tomorrow&quot;, Baez had covered two Earle songs, &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, on previous albums; &quot;Jerusalem&quot; had also become a staple of Baez&#x27; concerts. In the winter, he toured Europe and North America in support of &quot;Washington Square Serenade&quot;, performing both solo and with a disc jockey.

On May 12, 2009, Earle released a tribute album, &quot;Townes&quot;, on New West Records. The album contained 15 songs written by Townes Van Zandt. Guest artists appearing on the album included Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Moorer, and his son Justin. The album earned Earle a third Grammy award, again for best contemporary folk album.

In 2010, Earle was awarded the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty&#x27;s Shining Star of Abolition award. Earle has recorded two other anti-death penalty songs: &quot;Billy Austin&quot;, and &quot;Ellis Unit One&quot; for the 1995 film &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;.

In 2010–2011, Earle appeared in seasons 1 and 2 of the HBO show &quot;Treme&quot; as Harley Wyatt, a talented street musician who mentors another character.

Earle released his first novel and fourteenth studio album, both titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive&quot; after a Hank Williams song, in the spring of 2011. The album was produced by T Bone Burnett and deals with questions of mortality with a &quot;more country&quot; sound than his earlier work. During the second half of his 2011 tour with The Dukes and Duchesses and Moorer, the drum kit was adorned with the slogan &quot;we are the 99%&quot; a reference to the Occupy movement of September 2011.

On February 17, 2015, Earle released his sixteenth studio album, &quot;Terraplane&quot;.

On September 10, 2015, Earle &amp; the Dukes released a new internet single titled &quot;Mississippi, It&#x27;s Time&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics are directed towards the state of Mississippi and their refusal to abandon the Confederate Flag and remove it from their state flag. The song was released for sale the following day with all proceeds going towards the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization.

On June 10, 2016, Earle released an album of duets with Shawn Colvin, titled simply &quot;Colvin And Earle&quot;, which was accompanied by a tour in London and the US.

On June 16, 2017, Earle &amp; the Dukes released his seventeenth studio album, &quot;So You Wannabe An Outlaw&quot;. &quot;GUY&quot;, Earle&#x27;s tribute album to his songwriting hero Guy Clark was released on March 29, 2019.

Earle was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Earle was one of five artists who filed a class action lawsuit against Universal on June 21, in response to an earlier &quot;Times&quot; report on the fire.

Earle was the musical director for the 2020 play Coal Country about the 2010 West Virginia mining disaster where 29 men died. The play by Jessica Blank and Eric Jensen ran at the Public Theater in New York and was cut short by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was nominated for Drama Desk and Lucille Lortel awards for his work on the play&#x27;s music. Songs from the play are on his 2020 album &quot;Ghosts of West Virginia.&quot;

In June 2021 Earle joined Willie Nile on Nile&#x27;s new song &quot;Blood on Your Hands&quot; to be featured on Nile&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;.

In 2023, Earle said he is working on a musical of the film &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;.

Steve Earle features prominently in &quot;Love at the Five and Dime: The Songwriting Legacy of Nanci Griffith&quot; (Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2024).

===The Steve Earle Show===
The Steve Earle Show (formerly known as The Revolution Starts Now) was a weekly radio show on the Air America Radio network hosted by Earle. It highlighted some of Earle&#x27;s favorite artists, blending in-studio performances with liberal political talk and commentary. The show aired Sundays on some Air America affiliates from 10 to 11 PM ET. The show last aired on June 10, 2007, and that was a rebroadcast of a past episode. Earle subsequently started DJing on a show on Sirius Satellite Radio called Hardcore Troubadour.

==Personal life==
Earle has been married seven times, including twice to the same woman. He married Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; Henderson in Houston at the age of 18, but left her to move to Nashville a year later where he met and married his second wife, Cynthia Dunn. Earle married his third wife, Carol-Ann Hunter, who was the mother of their son, singer-songwriter Justin Townes Earle (1982–2020).

Next, he married Lou-Anne Gill (with whom he had a second son, Ian Dublin Earle, in January 1987). In December 1987, a groupie, Theresa Baker, claimed her daughter (Jessica Montana Baker) was fathered by Earle, though the initial DNA test was inconclusive and Earle did not submit to a second. His fifth wife was Teresa Ensenat, an A&amp;R executive for Geffen Records at the time. He then married Lou-Anne Gill a second time, and finally, in 2005, he married singer-songwriter Allison Moorer with whom he had a third son, John Henry Earle, in April 2010. John Henry was diagnosed with autism before age two. In March 2014, Earle announced that he and Moorer had separated. Earle has primary custody of John Henry during the school year and then tours in the summer. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Earle said about John Henry, &quot;I know why I get up in the morning now: to figure out a way to make sure he&#x27;s going to be alright when I’m gone. That&#x27;s my job. That&#x27;s what I do.&quot;

In 1993, Earle was arrested for possession of heroin and in 1994, for cocaine and weapons possession. A judge sentenced him to a year in jail after he admitted possession and failed to appear in court. He was released from jail after serving 60 days of his sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buffalo News 11/3/94&quot;&gt;EARLE MOVED TO DRUG CENTER, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; (Buffalo, New York). November 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He then completed an outpatient drug treatment program at the Cedarwood Center in Hendersonville, Tennessee. As a recovering heroin addict, Earle has used his experience in his songwriting.

Earle&#x27;s sister, Stacey Earle, is also a musician and songwriter.

==Political views and activism==
Earle is outspoken with his political views, and often addresses them in his lyrics and in interviews. Politically, he identifies as a socialist and tends to vote for Democratic candidates, despite not agreeing entirely with their politics. During the 2016 election, he expressed support for Senator Bernie Sanders, whom he considered to have pushed Hillary Clinton to the left on important issues. In a 2017 interview Earle said about President Donald Trump: &quot;We&#x27;ve never had an orangutan in the White House before. There&#x27;s a lot of &#x27;What does this button do?&#x27; going on. It&#x27;s scary. He really is a fascist. Whether he intended to be or not, he&#x27;s a real live fascist.&quot; However, Earle has called for the American left to engage with the concerns of working class Trump voters, saying in 2017: &quot;…maybe that&#x27;s one of the things we need to examine from my side because we&#x27;re responsible. The left has lost touch with American people, and it&#x27;s time to discuss that&quot;. In 2020, he stated: &quot;I thought that, given the way things are now, it was maybe my responsibility to make a record that spoke to and for people who didn&#x27;t vote the way that I did. One of the dangers that we&#x27;re in is if people like me keep thinking that everyone who voted for Trump is a racist or an asshole, then we&#x27;re fucked, because it&#x27;s simply not true.&quot;

In his 1990 song &quot;Justice in Ontario&quot;, Earle sang about the Port Hope 8 case. Earle criticized the conviction of six Satan&#x27;s Choice bikers for a 1978 murder in Port Hope, arguing that the accused were innocent, framed by the ruthless Corporal Terry Hall of the Ontario Provincial Police&#x27;s Special Squad. In the song Earle compares the conviction of the &quot;Port Hope 6&quot; to the massacre of the Black Donnellys in 1880. In 1990, Earle stated in an interview about &quot;Justice in Ontario&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s some concern about reprisals because the O.P.P. (Ontario Provincial Police) is obviously not gonna be thrilled. My hope is that I&#x27;ll be far too out-in-the-open and far too public for the police to do anything and get away with it. But the point is, that&#x27;s not a reason for doing or not doing anything, because…I very nearly went to prison myself for something I didn&#x27;t do, simply because a law enforcement agency didn&#x27;t want to admit that somebody had fucked up—they didn&#x27;t want to open the whole can of worms and all the other complaints that were constantly brought against the Dallas police department. You can&#x27;t stand by and let stuff like that go down without saying anything about it. And I think I especially have a responsibility to do that, &#x27;cause if I didn&#x27;t have any money right now I&#x27;d be in prison in Texas—I&#x27;m convinced of that. It was that close. But I was able to afford decent legal representation. And it comes down to the fact that people who can&#x27;t afford decent legal representation—who are subject to something like this happening and turning out very badly—feed my kids. That&#x27;s where my money comes from and that&#x27;s where my freedom comes from&quot;.

In 2006, Earle, along with other artists, held a protest concert against the Iraq War. Earle is a vocal opponent of capital punishment, which he considers his primary area of political activism. Several of his songs have provided descriptions of the experiences of death row inmates, including &quot;Billy Austin&quot; and &quot;Over Yonder (Jonathan&#x27;s Song)&quot;. Conversely, he has also written a song from the perspective of a prison guard working on death row in &quot;Ellis Unit One&quot;, a song written for the film &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, the title based on the name of the State of Texas men&#x27;s death row. He is pro-choice and has argued that rich Americans have always had access to abortions; he says the political issue in the US is really whether poor women should have access. His 2012 novel &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Get Out of This World Alive&quot; describes the life of a morphine-addicted doctor in 1963 San Antonio before &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; who treats gunshot wounds and provides illegal abortions to poor women. Since his youngest son was diagnosed with autism, Earle has also become an advocate for people on the autism spectrum.

<text>The Mansion House () is a house on Dawson Street, Dublin, which has been the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Dublin since 1715, and was also the meeting place of the Dáil Éireann from 1919 until 1922.

==History==
The first dedicated mayoralty house was built in 1665 by Sir Daniel Bellingham, 1st Baronet at the corner of Castle Street and Fishamble Street.

The modern Mansion House was later commissioned by the merchant and property developer Joshua Dawson. The site he selected was a piece of poor-quality marshy land outside the medieval city walls which he acquired in 1705. The building was designed in the Queen Anne style, built in brick with a stucco finish and was completed in 1710. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing onto Dawson Street. The central section of three bays, which was projected forward, featured an opening formed by a pair of Ionic order columns supporting an entablature. The other bays on the ground floor and all the bays on the first floor were fenestrated with sash windows with stone surrounds and window sills. At roof level, there was a balustraded parapet with a modillioned pediment above the central section. 

Dublin Corporation purchased the house in 1715 for assignment as the official residence of the Lord Mayor. In 1821, the Round Room was built in order to receive King George IV, while the stained glass window on the staircase was made by Joshua Clarke and Sons for the visit of Queen Victoria in 1900.

The First Dáil assembled in the Round Room on 21 January 1919 to proclaim the Irish Declaration of Independence. Two years later, in 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was ratified in the same location.

In the 1930s, plans were made to demolish the building, and all other buildings on the block on which it is located (which covered an area on Dawson Street, Molesworth Street, Kildare Street and the north side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green), to enable the building of a new City Hall. However the decision of the Government to erect a new Department of Industry and Commerce on a site on the same block, on Kildare Street, led to the abandonment of the plans.

On 21 January 1969, a special fiftieth-anniversary joint session of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann assembled in the Round Room and was addressed by the then President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera.

In August 2006, the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force claimed they had planted a bomb in the Mansion House in 1981, in an attempt to wipe out the Sinn Féin leadership at their party conference of that year. The claim led to a security alert at the house, as the Garda Síochána and army searched for a 25-year-old bomb, but none was found.

On 21 January 2019, the one-hundredth anniversary of the First Dáil, another special joint session of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann was held in the Round Room and was again addressed by the Irish President. This time, the President was Michael D. Higgins.

==Occupants==
Its most famous occupants included Lord Mayors:
* Daniel O&#x27;Connell, nineteenth-century nationalist leader
* Alfie Byrne (1930s), longest serving Lord Mayor in the 800-year history of the office
* Jim Mitchell (1976–77), the youngest Lord Mayor of Dublin, aged 29, in the history of the office

<text>Shunryu Suzuki (鈴木 俊隆 &quot;Suzuki Shunryū&quot;, dharma name &quot;Shōgaku Shunryū&quot; 祥岳俊隆, often called Suzuki Roshi; May 18, 1904 – December 4, 1971) was a Sōtō Zen monk and teacher who helped popularize Zen Buddhism in the United States, and is renowned for founding the first Zen Buddhist monastery outside Asia (Tassajara Zen Mountain Center). Suzuki founded San Francisco Zen Center which, along with its affiliate temples, comprises one of the most influential Zen organizations in the United States. A book of his teachings, &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot;, is one of the most popular books on Zen and Buddhism in the West.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Shunryu Suzuki was born May 18, 1904, in Kanagawa Prefecture southwest of Tokyo, Japan. His father, Butsumon Sogaku Suzuki, was the abbot of the village Soto Zen temple. His mother, Yone, was the daughter of a priest and had been divorced from her first husband for being too independent. Shunryu grew up with an older half-brother from his mother&#x27;s first marriage and two younger sisters. As an adult he was about tall.

His father&#x27;s temple, Shōgan-ji, was located near Hiratsuka, a city on Sagami Bay about fifty miles southwest of Tokyo. The temple income was small and the family had to be very thrifty.

Suzuki became aware of his family&#x27;s financial plight when he began school. Suzuki was kind and sensitive, but prone to quick outbursts of anger. He was ridiculed by the other boys because of his shaved head and because he was the son of a priest. He preferred to spend his time in the classroom rather than on the schoolyard and was always at the top of his class. The teacher told him he would become a great man if he left Kanagawa Prefecture and studied hard.

===Apprenticeship===
In 1916, 12-year-old Suzuki decided to train with a disciple of his father, Gyokujun So-on Suzuki. So-on was Sogaku&#x27;s adopted son and abbot of Sogaku&#x27;s former temple Zoun-in. His parents initially thought he was too young to live far from home but eventually allowed it.

Zoun-in is in a small village called Mori, Shizuoka in Japan. Suzuki arrived during a 100-day practice period at the temple and was the youngest student there. Zoun-in was a larger temple than Shōgan-ji.

At 4:00 each morning he arose for zazen. Next he would chant sutras and begin cleaning the temple with the others. They would work throughout the day and then, in the evenings, they all would resume zazen. Suzuki idolized his teacher, who was a strong disciplinarian. So-on often was rough on Suzuki but gave him some latitude for being so young.

When Suzuki turned 13, on May 18, 1917, So-on ordained him as a novice monk (unsui). He was given the Buddhist name Shogaku Shunryu, yet So-on nicknamed him &quot;Crooked Cucumber&quot; for his forgetful and unpredictable nature.

Shunryu began again attending upper-elementary school in Mori, but So-on did not supply proper clothes for him. He was the subject of ridicule. In spite of his misfortune he didn&#x27;t complain. Instead he doubled his efforts back at the temple.

When Shunryu had first come to Zoun-in, eight other boys were studying there. By 1918, he was the only one who stayed. This made his life a bit tougher with So-on, who had more time to scrutinize him. During this period Suzuki wanted to leave Zoun-in but equally didn&#x27;t want to give up.

In 1918 So-on was made head of a second temple, on the rim of Yaizu, called Rinso-in. Shunryu followed him there and helped whip the place back in order. Soon, families began sending their sons there and the temple began to come to life. Suzuki had failed an admissions test at the nearby school, so So-on began teaching the boys how to read and write Chinese.

So-on soon sent his students to train with a Rinzai master for a while. Here Shunryu studied a very different kind of Zen, one that promoted the attainment of satori through the concentration on koans through zazen. Suzuki had problems sitting with his koan. Meanwhile, all the other boys passed theirs, and he felt isolated. Just before the ceremony marking their departure Suzuki went to the Rinzai teacher and blurted out his answer. The master passed Suzuki; later Shunryu believed he had done it simply to be kind.

In 1919, at age 15, Suzuki was brought back home by his parents, who suspected mistreatment by So-on. Shunryu helped out with the temple while there and entered middle school. Yet, when summer vacation came, he was back at Rinso-in and Zoun-in with So-on to train and help out. He didn&#x27;t want to stop training.

In school Suzuki took English and did quite well. A local doctor, Dr. Yoshikawa, hired him to tutor his two sons in English. Yoshikawa treated Suzuki well, giving him a wage and occasional advice.

===Higher education===
In 1924 Shunryu enrolled in a Soto preparatory school in Tokyo not far from Shogan-ji, where he lived on the school grounds in the dorm. From 1925 to 1926 Suzuki did Zen training with Dojun Kato in Shizuoka at Kenko-in. He continued his schooling during this period. Here Shunryu became head monk for a 100-day retreat, after which he was no longer merely considered a novice. He had completed his training as a head monk.

In 1925 Shunryu graduated from preparatory school and entered Komazawa University, the Soto Zen university in Tokyo. During this period he continued his connections with So-on in Zoun-in, going back and forth whenever possible.

Some of his teachers here were discussing how Soto Zen might reach a bigger audience with students and, while Shunryu couldn&#x27;t comprehend how Western cultures could ever understand Zen, he was intrigued.

On August 26, 1926, So-on gave Dharma transmission to Suzuki. He was 22. Shunryu&#x27;s father also retired as abbot at Shogan-ji this same year, and moved the family onto the grounds of Zoun-in where he served as inkyo (retired abbot).

Later that year Suzuki spent a short time in the hospital with tuberculosis, but soon recovered. In 1927 an important chapter in Suzuki&#x27;s life was turned. He went to visit a teacher of English he had at Komazawa named Miss Nona Ransom, a woman who had taught English to such people as the last emperor of China, Pu-yi, and more so his wife, the last empress of China, Jigoro Kano (the Founder of Judo), the children of Chinese president Li Yuanhong, and some members of the Japanese royal family. She hired him that day to be a translator and to help with errands. Through this period he realized she was very ignorant of Japanese culture and the religion of Buddhism. She respected it very little and saw it as idol worship. But one day, when there were no chores to be done, the two had a conversation on Buddhism that changed her mind. She even let Suzuki teach her zazen meditation. This experience is significant in that Suzuki realized that Western ignorance of Buddhism could be transformed.

On January 22, 1929, So-on retired as abbot of Zoun-in and installed Shunryu as its 28th abbot. Sogaku would run the temple for Shunryu. In January 1930 a &quot;ten&#x27;e&quot; ceremony was held at Zoun-in for Shunryu. This ceremony acknowledged So-on&#x27;s Dharma transmission to Shunryu, and served as a formal way for the Soto heads to grant Shunryu permission to teach as a priest. On April 10, 1930, at age 25, Suzuki graduated from Komazawa Daigakurin with a major in Zen and Buddhist philosophy, and a minor in English.

Suzuki mentioned to So-on during this period that he might be interested in going to America to teach Zen Buddhism. So-on was adamantly opposed to the idea. Suzuki realized that his teacher felt very close to him and that he would take such a departure as an insult. He did not mention it to him again.

===Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji===
Upon graduation from Komazawa, So-on wanted Shunryu to continue his training at the well known Soto Zen temple Eihei-ji in Fukui Prefecture. In September 1930 Suzuki entered the training temple and underwent the Zen initiation known as tangaryo. His mother and father stayed on at Zoun-in to care for his temple in his absence.

Eihei-ji is one of the largest Zen training facilities in Japan, and the abbot at this time was Gempo Kitano-roshi. Prior to coming to Japan, Kitano was head of Soto Zen in Korea. He also was one of the founders of Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple located in Los Angeles, California. Suzuki&#x27;s father and Kitano had a tense history between them. Sogaku had trained with Kitano in his early Zen training and felt that he was such a high priest due to familial status and connections. Shunryu did not see this in Kitano, however. He saw a humble man who gave clear instruction, and Shunryu realized that his father was very wrong in his assessment.

Often monks were assigned duties at the monastery to serve certain masters. Shunryu was assigned to Ian Kishizawa-roshi, a well known teacher at the time who had previously studied under two great Japanese teachers: Sōtan Oka and Bokusan Nishiari. He was a renowned scholar on Dōgen&#x27;s Shōbōgenzō, and was also an acquaintance of his father from childhood.

Kishizawa was strict but not abusive, treating Suzuki well. Suzuki learned much from him, and Kishizawa saw a lot of potential in him. Through him Suzuki came to appreciate the importance of bowing in Zen practice through example. In December Suzuki sat his first true sesshin for 7 days, an ordeal that was challenging initially but proved rewarding toward the end. This concluded his first practice period at Eihei-ji.

In September 1931, after one more practice period and sesshin at Eihei-ji, So-on arranged for Suzuki to train in Yokohama at Sōji-ji. Sōji-ji was the other main Soto temple of Japan, and again Suzuki underwent the harsh tangaryo initiation. Sojiji was founded by the great Zen master Keizan and had a more relaxed atmosphere than Eihei-ji. At Sōji-ji Suzuki travelled back to Zoun-in frequently to attend to his temple.

In 1932 So-on came to Sōji-ji to visit with Shunryu and, after hearing of Suzuki&#x27;s contentment at the temple, advised him to leave it. In April of that year Suzuki left Sōji-ji with some regret and moved back into Zoun-in, living with his family there. In May he visited with Ian Kishizawa from Eiheiji and, with So-on&#x27;s blessing, asked to continue studies under him. He went to Gyokuden-in for his instruction, where Kishizawa trained him hard in zazen and conducted personal interviews with him.

Sometime during this period Suzuki married a woman who contracted tuberculosis. The date and name of the woman is unknown, but the marriage was soon annulled. She went back to live with her family while he focused on his duties at Zoun-in.

Suzuki reportedly was involved with some anti-war activities during World War II, but according to David Chadwick, the record is confusing and, at most, his actions were low-key. However, considering the wholesale enthusiastic support for the war expressed by the entire religious establishment in Japan at the time, this fact is significant in showing something of the character of the man.

===San Francisco Zen Center===
On May 23, 1959, Shunryu Suzuki arrived in San Francisco to attend to Soko-ji, at that time the sole Soto Zen temple in San Francisco. He was 55. Suzuki took over for the interim priest, Wako Kazumitsu Kato. Suzuki was taken aback by the Americanized and watered-down Buddhism practiced at the temple, mostly by older immigrant Japanese. He found American culture interesting and not too difficult to adjust to, even commenting once that &quot;if I knew it would be like this, I would have come here sooner!&quot; He was surprised to see that Sokoji was previously a Jewish synagogue (at 1881 Bush Street, now a historic landmark). His sleeping quarters were located upstairs, a windowless room with an adjoining office.

At the time of Suzuki&#x27;s arrival, Zen had become a hot topic amongst some groups in the United States, especially beatniks. Particularly influential were several books on Zen and Buddhism by Alan Watts. Word began to spread about Suzuki among the beatniks through places like the San Francisco Art Institute and the American Academy of Asian Studies, where Alan Watts was once director. Kato had done some presentations at the academy and asked Suzuki to come join a class he was giving there on Buddhism. This sparked Suzuki&#x27;s long-held desire to teach Zen to Westerners.

The class was filled with people wanting to learn more about Buddhism, and the presence of a Zen master was inspiring for them. Suzuki had the class do zazen for 20 minutes, sitting on the floor without a zafu and staring forward at the white wall. In closing, Suzuki invited everyone to stop in at Sokoji for morning zazen. Little by little, more people showed up each week to sit zazen for 40 minutes with Suzuki on mornings. The students were improvising, using cushions borrowed from wherever they could find them.

The group that sat with Suzuki eventually formed the San Francisco Zen Center with Suzuki. The Zen Center flourished so that in 1966, at the behest and guidance of Suzuki, Zentatsu Richard Baker helped seal the purchase of Tassajara Hot Springs in Los Padres National Forest, which they called Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. In the fall of 1969, they bought a building at 300 Page Street near San Francisco&#x27;s Lower Haight neighborhood and turned it into a Zen temple. Suzuki left his post at Sokoji to become the first abbot of one of the first Buddhist training monasteries outside Asia. Suzuki&#x27;s departure from Sokoji was thought to be inspired by his dissatisfaction with the superficial Buddhist practice of the Japanese immigrant community and his preference for the American students who were more seriously interested in Zen meditation, but it was more at the insistence of the Sokoji board, which asked him to choose one or the other (he had tried to keep both roles). Although Suzuki thought there was much to learn from the study of Zen in Japan, he said that it had grown moss on its branches, and he saw his American students as a means to reform Zen and return it to its pure zazen- (meditation) and practice-centered roots.

Suzuki died on December 4, 1971, presumably from cancer.

===Publications===
A collection of his teishos (Zen talks) was published in 1970 in the book &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; during Suzuki&#x27;s lifetime. His lectures on the Sandokai are collected in &quot;Branching Streams Flow in the Darkness&quot;, edited by Mel Weitsman and Michael Wenger and published in 1999. Edward Espe Brown edited &quot;Not Always So: Practicing the True Spirit of Zen&quot; which was published in 2002.

A biography of Suzuki, titled &quot;Crooked Cucumber,&quot; was written by David Chadwick in 1999.
