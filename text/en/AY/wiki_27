<text>René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (; November 22, 1643 – March 19, 1687), was a 17th-century French explorer and fur trader in North America. He explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the Mississippi River. He is best known for an early 1682 expedition in which he canoed the lower Mississippi River from the mouth of the Illinois River to the Gulf of Mexico; there, on April 9, 1682, he claimed the Mississippi River basin for France after giving it the name &quot;La Louisiane&quot;, in honor of Saint Louis and Louis XIV. One source states that &quot;he acquired for France the most fertile half of the North American continent&quot;. A later, ill-fated expedition in 1687 to the Gulf coast of Mexico (today the U.S. state of Texas) gave the United States a putative claim to Texas in the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803; La Salle was assassinated during that expedition.

Although Joliet and Marquette preceded him on the upper Mississippi in their journey of 1673–74, La Salle extended exploration – and France&#x27;s claims – all the way to the river&#x27;s mouth, although the existing historical evidence does not indicate that La Salle ever reached the Ohio/Allegheny Valley.

==Early life==

Robert Cavelier was born on November 22, 1643, into a comfortably well-off family in Rouen, France, in the parish Saint-Herbland. His parents were Jean Cavelier and Catherine Geest. His older brother, Jean Cavelier, became a Sulpician priest. When Robert was young, he enjoyed science and nature. In his teens, he studied with the Jesuit religious order and became a member after taking initial vows in 1660.

Required to reject his father&#x27;s legacy when he joined the Jesuits, La Salle was nearly destitute when he traveled as a prospective colonist to North America. He sailed for New France in the spring of 1666. His brother Jean, had moved there the year before. At La Salle&#x27;s request on March 27, 1667, after he was in Canada, he was released from the Society of Jesus after citing &quot;moral weaknesses&quot;.

La Salle was granted a &quot;seigneurie&quot; on land at the western end of the Island of Montreal, which became known as &quot;Lachine&quot;. La Salle immediately began to issue land grants, set up a village and learn the languages of the several tribes of Iroquois in this area.

===&quot;Sieur de La Salle&quot;===
&quot;Sieur de La Salle&quot; is a French title roughly translating to &quot;Lord of the manor of La Salle.&quot; 
&quot;Sieur&quot; is a French title of nobility, similar to the English &quot;Sir,&quot; but under the French seigneurial system, the title is purchased rather than earned, and does not imply military duty. Robert Cavelier took the title with his seigneurial purchase of Lachine from the Sulpician order at Ville Marie around 1667. It refers to the name of a family estate near Rouen. However, &quot;La Salle&quot; has become closely associated with the person as if it were his name; he is therefore often called Robert La Salle, or simply &quot;La Salle&quot;.

==Expeditions==
===&quot;Ohio&quot; expedition===
The Seneca told La Salle of a great river, called the Ohio, which flowed into the sea, the &quot;Vermilion Sea&quot;. He began to plan for expeditions to find a western passage to China. He sought and received permission from Governor Daniel Courcelle and Intendant Jean Talon to embark on the enterprise. He sold his interests in Lachine to finance the venture.

La Salle left Lachine by the St. Lawrence on July 6, 1669, with a flotilla of nine canoes and 24 men, an unknown number of Seneca guides: himself and 14 hired men in four canoes, the two Sulpicians Dollier de Casson and Abbé René de Bréhan de Galinée with seven new recruits in three canoes, and two canoes of Natives. Having travelled up the St. Lawrence and across Lake Ontario for 35 days, they arrived at what is called today Irondequoit Bay on the southern shore of Lake Ontario at the mouth of Irondequoit Creek, a place now commemorated as La Salle&#x27;s Landing.

There they were greeted by a party of Natives, who escorted them starting the next day to a village some leagues distant, a journey of a few days. At the village, the Seneca vehemently attempted to dissuade the party from proceeding into the lands of their enemies, the Algonquins, telling of the dire fate awaiting them. The necessity of securing guides for the further part of the journey, and the refusal of the Seneca to provide them, delayed the expedition a month. A fortuitous capture by the Natives in the lands to the south of a Dutchman who spoke Iroquois well but French poorly, and was to be burned at the stake for transgressions unknown, provided an opportunity to obtain a guide. The Dutchman&#x27;s freedom was purchased by the party in exchange for wampum.

While at the Native village in September 1669, La Salle was seized with a violent fever and expressed the intention of returning to Ville Marie.

At this juncture, he parted from his company and the narrative of the Jesuits, who continued on to upper Lake Erie. Other accounts have it that some of La Salle&#x27;s men soon returned to New Holland or Ville Marie.

====Further evidence====
Beyond that, the factual record of La Salle&#x27;s first expedition ends, and what prevails is obscurity and fabrication. It is likely that he spent the winter in Ville Marie. The next confirmed sighting of La Salle was by Nicolas Perrot on the Ottawa River near the Rapide des Chats in early summer, 1670, hunting with a party of Iroquois. That would be 700 miles as the crow flies from the Falls of the Ohio, the point supposed by some that he reached on the Ohio River.

La Salle&#x27;s own journal of the expedition was lost in 1756. Two indirect historical accounts exist. The one, &quot;Récit d’un ami de l’abbé de Galliné&quot;, purported to be a recitation by La Salle himself to an unknown writer during his visit to Paris in 1678, and the other &quot;Mémoire sur le projet du sieur de la Salle pour la descouverte de la partie occidentale de l’Amérique septentrionale entre la Nouvelle-France, la Floride et le Mexique&quot;. A letter from Madeleine Cavelier, his now elderly niece, written in 1746, commenting on the journal of La Salle in her possession may also shed some light on the issue.

La Salle himself never claimed to have discovered the Ohio River. In a letter to the intendant Talon in 1677, he claimed &quot;discovery&quot; of a river, the Baudrane, flowing southwesterly below the Great Lakes (well north of the Ohio&#x27;s location) with its head on Lake Erie and emptying into the Saint Louis (i.e. the Mississippi), a hydrography which was non-existent. In those days, maps as well as descriptions were based part on observation and part on hearsay, of necessity. This confounded courses, mouths and confluences among the rivers. At various times, La Salle invented such rivers as the Chucagoa, Baudrane, Louisiane (Anglicized &quot;Saint Louis&quot;), and Ouabanchi-Aramoni.

Confounding fact with fiction started with publication in 1876 of Pierre Margry&#x27;s &quot;Découvertes et Établissements des Français&quot;. Margry was a French archivist and partisan who had private access to the French archives. He came to be the agent of American historian Francis Parkman. Margry&#x27;s work, a massive nine volumes, encompassed an assemblage of documents – some previously published, but many not. In it, he sometimes published a reproduction of the whole document, and sometimes only an extract, or summary, not distinguishing the one from the other. These discrepancies have significantly complicated efforts to retrace and build upon Margry&#x27;s work.

He also used in some cases one or another copies of original documents previously edited, extracted or altered by others, without specifying which transcriptions were original, and which were copies, or whether the copy was dated earlier or later. Reproductions were scattered in fragments across chapters, so that it was impossible to ascertain the integrity of the document from its fragments. Chapter headings were oblique and sensational, so as to obfuscate the content therein. English and American scholars were immediately skeptical of the work, since full and faithful publication of some of the original documents had previously existed. The situation was so fraught with doubt, that the United States Congress appropriated $10,000 in 1873, which Margry wanted as an advance, to have the original documents photostated and witnessed by uninvolved parties as to veracity.

===The intermezzo years===

La Salle undertook several other smaller unknown expeditions between 1671 and 1673. On July 12, 1673, the Governor of New France, Louis de Buade de Frontenac, arrived at the mouth of the Cataraqui River to meet with leaders of the Five Nations of the Iroquois to encourage them to trade with the French. While the groups met and exchanged gifts, Frontenac&#x27;s men, led by La Salle, hastily constructed a rough wooden palisade on a point of land by a shallow, sheltered bay. Originally the fort was named Fort Cataraqui; it was later renamed Fort Frontenac by La Salle, in honor of his patron. The purpose of Fort Frontenac was to control the lucrative fur trade in the Great Lakes Basin to the west. The fort was also meant to be a bulwark against the English and Dutch, who were competing with the French for control of the fur trade. La Salle was left in command of the fort in 1673.

Thanks to his powerful protector, the discoverer managed, during a voyage to France in 1674–75, to secure for himself the grant of Fort Cataraqui and acquired letters of nobility for himself and his descendants. With Frontenac&#x27;s support, he received not only a fur trade concession, with permission to establish frontier forts, but also a title of nobility. He returned and rebuilt Frontenac in stone. An Ontario Heritage Trust plaque describes La Salle at Cataraqui as &quot;[a] major figure in the expansion of the French fur trade into the Lake Ontario region. Using the fort as a base, he undertook expeditions to the west and southwest in the interest of developing a vast fur-trading empire.&quot;
===Great Lakes forts===
After leaving Lower Canada in September 1678, La Salle and his lieutenant Henri de Tonti travelled to Fort Frontenac (now in Kingston, Ontario) and then to Niagara where, in December 1678, they were the first Europeans documented to have seenNiagara Falls; they built Fort Conti at the mouth of the Niagara River. There, they loaded supplies into smaller boats (canoes or bateaux), so they could continue up the shallow and swiftly flowing lower Niagara River to what is now the location of Lewiston, New York. There the Iroquois had a well-established portage route that bypassed the rapids and the cataract later known as Niagara Falls.

The first ship built by La Salle, called the &quot;Frontenac&quot;, was a 10-ton single-decked brigantine or barque; it was lost in Lake Ontario on January 8, 1679. Afterward, La Salle built &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, a seven-cannon, 45-ton barque, on the upper Niagara River, at or near Cayuga Creek; she was launched on August 7, 1679. La Salle sailed in &quot;Le Griffon&quot; up Lake Erie to Lake Huron, then up Huron to Michilimackinac and on to present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin. &quot;Le Griffon&quot; then left for Niagara with a load of furs, but was never seen again.

La Salle continued with his men in canoes down the western shore of Lake Michigan, rounding the southern end to the mouth of the Miami River (now St. Joseph River), where they built a stockade in November 1679. They called it Fort Miami (now known as St. Joseph, Michigan). There they waited for Tonti and his party, who had crossed the Lower Michigan peninsula on foot.

On December 3, 1679, with a group of 40, La Salle and Henri de Tonti headed south from Fort Miami. They canoed up the St. Joseph and followed it to a portage at present-day South Bend, Indiana. They crossed to the Kankakee River and followed it to the Illinois River. In January 1680, they reached an area that is near the current city of Peoria, Illinois. In order to help the local Peoria tribe defend themselves against the Iroquois, La Salle and his group built a stockade and named it Fort Crèvecoeur.

In March 1680, La Salle set off on foot for Fort Frontenac for supplies. There, he discovered that only month after his departure, the soldiers at Ft. Crevecoeur, led by Martin Chartier, mutinied, destroyed the fort, and exiled Tonti, whom he had left in charge.

===Mississippi expedition===

The group later travelled along the Illinois River and arrived at the Mississippi River in February 1682; they built canoes there. The exploration reached an area that is now Memphis, Tennessee, where La Salle built a small fort, named Fort Prudhomme.

In April 1682, the expedition reached the Gulf of Mexico. There, La Salle named the Mississippi basin &quot;La Louisiane&quot; in honor of Louis XIV and claimed it for France.

During 1682–83, La Salle, with Henry de Tonti, established Fort Saint-Louis of Illinois at Starved Rock on the Illinois River to protect and hold the region for France. La Salle then returned to Montreal and later, to France.

===Texas expedition and death===

On July 24, 1684, he departed France and returned to America with a large expedition designed to establish a French colony on the Gulf of Mexico, at the mouth of the Mississippi River. They had four ships and 300 colonists. The expedition was plagued by pirates, Natives defending their land, and poor navigation. One ship was lost to pirates in the West Indies, a second sank in the inlets of Matagorda Bay. The &quot;La Belle&quot; made landfall in Feb. 1685.

They founded a settlement, near the bay which they called the Bay of Saint Louis, on Garcitas Creek in the vicinity of present-day Victoria, Texas. La Salle led a group eastward on foot on three occasions to try to locate the mouth of the Mississippi. In the meantime, the flagship &quot;La Belle&quot;, the only remaining ship, ran aground and sank into the mud, stranding the colony on the Texas coast.

Some of his men mutinied, near the site of present-day Navasota, Texas.

On March 19, 1687, La Salle was slain by Pierre Duhaut during an ambush while talking to Duhaut&#x27;s decoy, Jean L&#x27;Archevêque. They were &quot;six leagues&quot; from the westernmost village of the Hasinai (Tejas) Indians. One source states that Duhaut was a &quot;disenchanted follower&quot;. Duhaut was shot and killed by James Hiems to avenge La Salle. Over the following week, others were killed; confusion followed as to who killed whom.

The colony lasted only until 1688, when Karankawa-speaking Natives killed the 20 remaining adults and took five children as captives. Tonti sent a search mission in 1689 when he learned of the colonizers&#x27; fate, but the expedition ran out of supplies in northern Texas and failed to reach the site.

It is now known that there were 15 survivors of the original 180 colonists at the fort, most of whom had accompanied La Salle on his final eastward trek to locate the mouth of the Colbert (Mississippi) River and escaped the massacre: five children kidnapped by Native Americans at the settlement and later rescued by the Spanish, and 10 other adults, who lived for a while among the Native Americans and were later captured and released by the Spanish. Six found their way to Canada and eventually returned to France. Three others were refused passage by the Spanish; an Italian was imprisoned. For as long as 30 years after the demise of the colony, there were specious accounts of survivors still living among the Native Americans in Texas.

==Personal life==
La Salle never married, but has been linked to Madeleine de Roybon d&#x27;Allonne, an early colonizer of New France.

==Legacy==


In addition to the forts, which also served as authorized agencies for the extensive fur trade, La Salle&#x27;s visits to Illinois and other Natives cemented the French policy of alliance with Natives in the common causes of containing both Iroquois influence and Anglo-American colonization. He also gave the name Louisiana (&quot;La Louisiane&quot;) to the interior North American territory he claimed for France, which lives on in the name of a U.S. state.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; provides this summary of La Salle&#x27;s achievements: &quot;His claim of Louisiana for France, though but a vain boast at the time, pointed the way to the French colonial empire that was eventually built by other men&quot;.

Pierre Berton wrote, &quot;no other man had crammed so much adventure, so much excitement, so many triumphs, and so many heartbreaks into a single career. Though he died at the hands of some of his quarrelling followers in the mud of reeds of the Gulf of Mexico lowlands, he was essentially a man of the lakes, of Ontario and Erie, Huron and Michigan...&quot;

A sculpture of de La Salle is located on the south facade of the Knute Rockne Memorial on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. There is also a statue of him in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park.

=== La Salle Explorers ===
La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adopted the nickname &quot;Explorers&quot; for its athletic teams after René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. La Salle University is named after Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the French priest, educator and founder of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. In 1931, a sportswriter mistakenly referred to the La Salle football team as the &quot;Explorers&quot; thinking the school was named after the French explorer. In 1932 students voted to pick &quot;Explorers&quot; as the official nickname. The La Salle University mascot is The Explorer. 

==Archaeology==
In 1995, La Salle&#x27;s primary ship &quot;La Belle&quot; was discovered in the muck of Matagorda Bay. It has been the subject of archeological research. A search of the wreck and surrounding area during 1996 to 1997 yielded numerous artifacts from the 17th century. Through an international treaty, the artifacts excavated from La Belle are owned by France and held in trust by the Texas Historical Commission. The collection is held by the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. Artifacts from &quot;La Belle&quot; are shown at nine museums across Texas.

The wreckage of his ship &quot;L&#x27;Aimable&quot; has yet to be located. In 1998, The National Underwater and Marine Agency claimed that it had found the wreck in Matagorda Bay but the Texas Historical Commission stated that the wreck was much more recent. 

The possible remains of &quot;Le Griffon&quot; were found in 1898 by lighthouse keeper Albert Cullis, on a beach on the western edge of Manitoulin Island in northern Lake Huron. Results of testing some of the artifacts were disputed. Many of the recovered artifacts were lost and the wreck was washed away in 1942. A possible shipwreck of &quot;Le Griffon&quot; near Poverty Island at the entrance to Green Bay in northern Lake Michigan was located by Steve Libert of the Great Lakes Exploration Group in 2001. The organization prevailed in a lawsuit against the state of Michigan over ownership of artifacts in 2012, and in 2013 was issued a permit to excavate the wreck. Only one artifact, a wood pole, was recovered, and it is indeterminate whether it was from a shipwreck. In 2019, the Discovery Channel featured the story of the ship; divers who were involved in the investigation were convinced that &quot;Le Griffon&quot; sank in the Mississagi Strait.
Historians debated the site of La Salle&#x27;s &quot;Fort St Louis&quot; colony, which had been said to be near Lavaca Bay at Garcitas Creek, and was a significant part of the history of French colonization of Texas. A June 1996 dig at the site that was believed to be the correct location revealed eight French cannon. This led archeologists to excavate the Keeran Ranch site in the area, during 1996–2002; they concluded that the Spanish Presidio La Bahía fort &quot;was built on the La Salle settlement&quot;. Some 10 percent of the artifacts recovered are believed to have originated in France.

<text>Tiberius Hemsterhuis (9 January 16857 April 1766) was a Dutch philologist and critic.

==Life==
Hemsterhuis was born in Groningen. His father, a learned physician, gave him a good early education and he entered the university of his native city in his fifteenth year, where he proved himself the best student of mathematics. After a year or two at Groningen, he was attracted to the University of Leiden by the fame of Perizonius. While there, he was entrusted with the duty of arranging the manuscripts in the library. Though he accepted an appointment as professor of mathematics and philosophy at Amsterdam in his twentieth year, he had already directed his attention to the study of the ancient languages.

In 1717 Hemsterhuis was appointed a professor of Greek at the University of Franeker to replace Lambert Bos, but he did not enter on his duties there till 1720. In 1738 he became a professor of national history as well. Two years afterward, he was called to teach the same subjects at Leiden, where he died on 7 April 1766.

He was the father of Frans Hemsterhuis.

==Works==
In 1706, he completed the edition of Julius Pollux&#x27;s &quot;Onomasticon&quot; begun by Jean-Henri Lederlin (1672–1737), but the praise he received from his countrymen was more than counterbalanced by two letters of criticism from Bentley, which mortified him so keenly that for two months he refused to open a Greek book. Hemsterhuis was the founder of a Dutch school of criticism which had disciples in Lodewijk Caspar Valckenaer, Jacob van Lennep and David Ruhnken.

His major writings were:
*&quot;Luciani colloquia et Timon&quot; (1708)
*&quot;Aristophanis Plutus&quot; (1744)
*&quot;Notae, etc., ad Xenophontem Ephesium&quot; in the &quot;Miscellanea critica&quot; of Amsterdam, vols. iii. and iv.
*&quot;Observationes ad Chrysostomi homilias&quot; (1784)
*&quot;Orationes&quot; (1784)
*a Latin translation of the &quot;Birds&quot; of Aristophanes, in Kuster&#x27;s edition
*notes to Bernard&#x27;s &quot;Thomas Magister&quot;, to Alberti&#x27;s Hesychius of Alexandria, to Johann August Ernesti&#x27;s &quot;Callimachus&quot; and to Pieter Burmann the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Propertius&quot;.

<doc id="189920" wikidata="Q970183" url="?curid=189920" title="Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye">
<text>Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye (17 November 1685 – 5 December 1749) was a French Canadian military officer, fur trader, and explorer. In the 1730s, he and his four sons explored the area west of Lake Superior and established trading posts there. They were part of a process that added Western Canada to the original New France territory that was centred along the Saint Lawrence basin.

He was the first known European to reach present-day North Dakota and the upper Missouri River in the United States. In the 1740s, two of his sons crossed the prairie as far as present-day Wyoming, United States, and were the first Europeans to see the Rocky Mountains north of New Mexico.

==Early life==

Born in Trois-Rivières, New France, Pierre was the eldest son of René Gaultier de Varennes, who came to Canada as a soldier in 1665, and Marie, the daughter of Pierre Boucher, the first Governor of Trois-Rivières. The Gaultier family were minor nobility or landowners who came from the Anjou area of France. Varennes and La Vérendrye were 2 of their estates.

Pierre&#x27;s father died when he was 3, and he was educated at the Jesuit seminary in Quebec. At the age of twelve he received a cadet&#x27;s commission in the French Marines in Canada. In 1704 and 1705 La Vérendrye took part in the raids of Queen Anne&#x27;s War, which was waged by colonists in the English and French areas of North America. He was present at the Raid on Deerfield in present-day Massachusetts. The French and their Abenaki allies took more than a hundred captives from the village, forcing them on the 300-mile journey through the wilderness to return to Montreal. During those years, both sides often took captives for ransom. The next year La Vérendrye participated in an unsuccessful attack on the English settlement of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

At age 22, he enlisted in the French Army, and fought in Flanders during the War of the Spanish Succession; he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Malplaquet. After recovering from his injuries and being given paroled as a prisoner of war, Gaultier returned to Canada and married Marie-Anne, daughter of Louis Dandonneau, Sieur Du Sablé, in 1712. For the next 15 years, he supported his family by farming and fur trading along the Saint Lawrence.

==Explorations==

In 1726 his fortunes changed when his brother Jacques-René was appointed the commander of the &quot;poste du Nord&quot;. This was the north shore of Lake Superior with three main posts: Fort Kaministiquia, which was a terminus for the main route west; a post at the mouth of the Nipigon River; and one near the future site of Wawa, Ontario, which had river connections to James Bay. La Vérendrye began trading in the area and in 1728 was appointed as commandant when his brother left to fight the Fox Indians.

He became involved with the quest to find a route to the Pacific, what was known as the Northwest Passage. Under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Great Britain had taken control of Hudson Bay and thereby blocked the French from using that area. At this time people thought that not far to the west was an inlet from the Pacific called the &quot;mer du couchant&quot;, similar to the equally mythical Strait of Annian. They thought also that travelers could cross the height of land and find a &quot;River of the West&quot; that flowed all the way to the Pacific. (For the area to be explored see Early Canadian canoe routes, Nelson River Basin.)

In 1688 Jacques de Noyon had reached Rainy Lake. In 1717 Zacharie Robutel de La Noue tried to reach Rainy Lake but succeeded only in establishing Fort Kaministiquia. The British on Hudson Bay heard reports of coureurs des bois west of Lake Superior, but they left no records in the French archives. Morton thinks they may have gotten as far as Lake Winnipeg. In 1716 a memoir drawn up by Governor Vaudreuil showed lakes and portages as far as Lake of the Woods, from which flowed a river to the &quot;Sea of the West&quot;. This implies that Frenchmen had explored west of Lake Superior before Vérendrye did so.

La Vérendrye questioned the Natives who came to trade. He learned of the Mandan country on the upper Missouri River. These people were described as white men who lived in big houses. Auchagah, a Cree guide, made a map of the canoe routes between Lake Superior and Lake Winnipeg based on his and other Cree experience. La Vérendrye judged correctly that Lake Winnipeg was the geographic key which had to be reached to allow further exploration.

In 1730 he met Governor Beauharnois at Quebec and worked out a plan. La Vérendrye would build a post on Lake Winnipeg. The expedition would be paid for by Quebec merchants who hoped to profit from the resulting fur trade. This financing was fragile because the merchants lacked the capital and organization to efficiently move supplies so far to the west. An additional goal was to divert furs from being traded to the British on Hudson Bay. In the absence of government funds, exploration was dependent on financing from the fur trade. It is not clear whether La Vérendrye was genuinely interested in exploration or whether exploration was a pretext for expansion of the fur trade. Maurepas, the French Minister of Marine, was very interested in exploration, but would not provide funds. According to Pehr Kalm, La Vérendrye was acting upon orders given by de Beauharnois to explore until he could reach the ocean.

In 1731 La Vérendrye, three of his sons and 50 engagés left Montreal. That autumn his son Jean-Baptiste built Fort St. Pierre on Rainy Lake. Next year they built Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods, which became his headquarters for the next several years. In 1733 Jean-Baptiste got within 20 miles of Lake Winnipeg but was blocked by ice and lack of supplies. In 1734 their party reached Lake Winnipeg. Jean-Baptiste built Fort Maurepas near the mouth of the Red River at the southern end of the lake. In 1734 La Vérendrye went to Quebec to reorganize the finances and returned to the western post the following spring. In 1734 more than half the beaver pelts reaching Quebec came from La Vérendrye&#x27;s posts. But by 1736 it was clear that the supply system was not working, and Jean-Baptiste was forced to go to Lake Superior for supplies. He along with 20 other Frenchmen, 19 voyageurs including the Jesuit missionary priest Jean-Pierre Aulneau who accompanied them, were killed by the Sioux on Massacre Island in Lake of the Woods. La Vérendrye restrained the local Cree from a war of revenge in order to protect the fur trade. In 1737 La Vérendrye returned to Quebec on business.

In Paris, Maurepas was pushing for more exploration. By this time explorers had identified two candidates as the &#x27;River of the West&#x27;. The correct one was the Saskatchewan River, which flows east into Lake Winnipeg. The other was the Missouri River in the Mandan country in what is now North Dakota, United States. The Mandan were said to live in big houses and resemble Frenchmen. La Vérendrye picked the Missouri. In September 1738 he reached Fort Maurepas on Lake Winnipeg and ascended the Assiniboine River to Portage la Prairie, where he built Fort La Reine just south of Lake Manitoba (October 1738).

Joining a large band of Assiniboines, he pushed southwest across the prairie and reached a Mandan village probably somewhere near the modern New Town, North Dakota, about 70 miles east of the Montana border. He did not push on to the Missouri River but sent his son Louis-Joseph to do it for him. In order to get rid of their numerous Assiniboine guests, the Mandan claimed that there was a Sioux war party in the area. The Assiniboines fled, taking with them the Cree interpreter. Unable to talk to the Mandan, La Vérendrye left two Frenchmen to learn the language and returned to Fort La Reine (January 1739).

In 1740 he returned to Quebec on business, and in 1741 started on his fourth and last journey west. From Fort La Reine he sent his son Louis-Joseph exploring westward as far as, probably, the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming (1742–43). (See: Verendrye brothers&#x27; journey to the Rocky Mountains) He worked to consolidate his hold on the chain of lakes that look like a single lake west of Lake Winnipeg, establishing Fort Dauphin (Manitoba), Fort Bourbon and Fort Paskoya. Back in France, Maurepas was growing increasingly irritated with La Vérendrye, who he thought was trading in furs when he should be exploring. In 1742 Maurepas suggested that he be replaced.

In 1743 La Vérendrye resigned. He returned to New France and led the life of a gentleman while doing a considerable business since his sons remained as traders in the west. In 1746 he was reappointed to his old post. He was planning the fifth expedition, this time up the Saskatchewan River, when he died on December 5, 1749. Shortly before his death, he was awarded the Order of Saint Louis.

==Afterwards==
From 1744 to 1746 Nicolas-Joseph de Noyelles de Fleurimont held the command of &quot;poste du Nord&quot;, but accomplished little. After the elder La Vérendrye&#x27;s death, the new governor Jonquière forced his sons out of their father&#x27;s patrimony.

Control of the west was given to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre (1750–53). He built Fort La Jonquière somewhere on the Saskatchewan, but failed in an attempt to ascend that river. He was followed by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne (1753-1756). He built Fort de la Corne on the Saskatchewan. In 1756 the western command was given to Pierre&#x27;s son Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye, but he was unable to travel to the west. During the French and Indian War (1754-1763), the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War, the French gradually abandoned the western posts. With France&#x27;s defeat, the British took control of New France territory east of the Mississippi River.

<text>Pieter Burman (23 October 1713 – 24 June 1778), also known as Peter or Pieter Burmann () and distinguished from his uncle as (&#x27; or&#x27;), was a Dutch philologist.

==Life==
Born at Amsterdam, he was brought up by his uncle in Leiden, and afterwards studied law and philology under CA Duker and Arnold von Drakenborch at Utrecht. In 1735 he was appointed professor of eloquence and history at Franeker, with which the chair of poetry was combined in 1741. In the following year he left Franeker for Amsterdam to become professor of history and philology at the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam. He was subsequently professor of poetry (1744), general librarian (1752), and inspector of the gymnasium (1753). In 1777 he retired, and died on 24 June 1778 at Santhorst, near Wassenaar.

He resembled his more famous uncle in the manner and direction of his studies, and in his violent disposition, which involved him in quarrels with contemporaries, notably Saxe and Christian Adolph Klotz. He was a man of extensive learning, and had a great talent for Latin poetry. His most valuable works are:
*&quot;Anthologia Veterum Latinorum Epigrammatum et Poematum&quot; (1759–1763)
*&quot;Aristophanis comoediae Novem&quot; (1760)
*&quot;Rhetorica&quot;.

He completed the editions of Virgil (1767) and Claudian (1760), which had been left unfinished by his uncle, and commenced an edition of Propertius, one of his best works, which was only half printed at the time of his death. It was completed by L. van Santen and published in 1780.

<text>Marquess of Normanby is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in 1694 in the Peerage of England in favour of John Sheffield, 3rd Earl of Mulgrave. He was a notable Tory politician of the late Stuart period, who served under Queen Anne as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. In 1703 this first Marquess of Normanby was further honoured when he was made Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. These titles became extinct on the death of the 2nd Duke in 1735.

The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 25 June 1838, in favour of Constantine Phipps, 2nd Earl of Mulgrave. He was a noted politician and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as Home Secretary. His great-grandfather William Phipps had married Lady Catherine Annesley, who was the daughter and heiress of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey and his wife Lady Catherine Darnley (an illegitimate daughter of King James II by his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester). Lady Catherine Darnley had later married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and hence Constantine Phipps, 2nd Earl of Mulgrave was the step-great-great-grandson of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. Upon his death, Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby was succeeded by his son, the 2nd Marquess. He was a Liberal politician and also served as Governor of New Zealand. His grandson, the fourth Marquess, served briefly as a Labour Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in 1945 and was also Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire and of North Yorkshire. As of 2013 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the fifth Marquess, who succeeded in 1994. The fifth Marquess also served in the House of Lords until he lost his seat in the House of Lords Act 1999.

The family seat is Mulgrave Castle near Whitby, North Yorkshire.

<doc id="189928" wikidata="Q730541" url="?curid=189928" title="Pieter Burman the Elder">
<text>Pieter Burman (6 July 1668 – 31 March 1741), also known as Peter or Pieter Burmann () and posthumously distinguished from his nephew as &quot;the Elder&quot; (), was a Dutch classical scholar.

==Life==
Burman was born at Utrecht on 6 July 1668, the son of Franz Burmann (&quot;&quot;; 1628–1679) and Maria, daughter of Abraham Heidanus. His father was the son of a Protestant minister who had been driven from France; he officiated as professor of theology at Utrecht, and became known by his writings, especially by his commentaries on the Old Testament. At the age of thirteen Pieter entered the university where he studied under Graevius and Gronovius. He devoted himself particularly to the study of the classical languages, and became unusually proficient in Latin composition. As he was intended for the legal profession, he spent some years in attendance on the law classes. For about a year he studied at Leiden, paying special attention to philosophy and Greek.

On Burman&#x27;s return to Utrecht he took the degree of doctor of laws (March 1688), and after travelling through Switzerland and part of Germany, settled down to the practice of law, without, however, abandoning his classical studies. In December 1691 he was appointed receiver of the tithes which were originally paid to the bishop of Utrecht, and five years later was nominated to the professorship of eloquence and history. To this chair was soon added that of Greek and politics. In 1714 he paid a short visit to Paris and ransacked the libraries. In the following year he was appointed successor to the celebrated Perizonius, who had held the chair of history, Greek language and eloquence at Leiden.

Burman was subsequently appointed professor of history for the United Provinces and in 1724 he became the 9th Librarian of Leiden University. His numerous editorial and critical works spread his fame as a scholar throughout Europe, and engaged him in many of the stormy disputes which were then so common among men of letters.

==Works==

Burman published Latin editions of Phaedrus (1698), Horace (1699), Valerius Flaccus (1702), Petronius (1709), Menander and Philemon (1710), Ovid (1713 &amp; 1727), Velleius Paterculus (1719), Quintilian (1720), Justin the Historian (1722), various minor Latin poets (1731), Suetonius (1736), and Lucan (1740) He died while editing the work of Vergil, an edition that was completed by his nephew.

Burman also emended Thomas Ruddiman&#x27;s edition of George Buchanan&#x27;s Latin works, continued Graevius&#x27;s &quot;Thesauruses&quot; of Italian and Sicilian history, and wrote the treatise &quot;&quot; (1694) and &quot;A Brief Description of Roman Antiquities&quot; (1711). His &quot;Sylloge of Letters Written by Illustrious Men&quot; (1725–27) contains biographical material on scholars. He edited several other volumes of letters as well.

The list of Burman&#x27;s works occupies five pages in Saxe&#x27;s &quot;Onomasticon&quot;. His Latin poems and orations were republished after his death. There is an account of his life in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for April 1742 by Samuel Johnson.

==Legacy==
In his edition of Petronius&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot;, Burman demonstrated that the supplementary material recently added to the text by François Nodot was in fact a forgery.

<doc id="189930" wikidata="Q170515" url="?curid=189930" title="Omar Sharif">
<text>Omar Sharif ( , born Michel Yusef Dimitri Chalhoub ; 10 April 1932 – 10 July 2015) was an Egyptian actor, generally regarded as one of his country&#x27;s greatest male film stars. He began his career in his native country in the 1950s. He is best known for his appearances in American, British, French, and Italian productions, and has been described as &quot;the first Egyptian and Arab to conquer Hollywood&quot;. His career encompassed over 100 films spanning 50 years, and brought him many accolades including three Golden Globe Awards and a César Award for Best Actor.

Sharif played opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole as Sherif Ali in the David Lean epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and portrayed the title role in Lean&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), earning him the Golden Globe for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. He continued to play romantic leads, in films like &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; (1974), and historical figures like the eponymous characters in &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1965), &quot;The Mamelukes&quot; (1965) and &quot;Che!&quot; (1969). His acting career continued well into old age, with a well-received turn as a Muslim Turkish immigrant in the French film &quot;Monsieur Ibrahim&quot; (2003). He made his final film appearance in 2015, the year of his death. 

Sharif spoke five languages: Arabic, English, French, Italian and Spanish. He bridled at travel restrictions imposed by the government of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, leading to self-exile in Europe. He was a lifelong horse racing enthusiast, and at one time ranked among the world&#x27;s top contract bridge players. He was the recipient of high civil honors from multiple countries, including the Egyptian Order of Merit and the French Legion of Honour. He was one of only 25 grantees of UNESCO&#x27;s Sergei Eisenstein Medal, in recognition of his significant contributions to world film and cultural diversity.

==Early life==
Sharif was born Michel Yusef Dimitri Chalhoub ( ) in Alexandria, Kingdom of Egypt (now Republic of Egypt), to a Melkite Greek Catholic family. Although most sources claim he was of Syrian and Lebanese descent, Sharif stated in interviews that all of his ancestors were of Syrian descent, making him and his family members of the Antiochian Greek Christian minority (also known as &quot;Rūm&quot;). He adopted the surname Sharif, meaning &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;nobleman&quot; in Arabic, after he was picked by Egyptian director Youssef Chahine to star in his film &quot;The Blazing Sun&quot;. He later converted to Islam and changed his name legally in order to marry Faten Hamama. 

His father, Yusef Chalhoub, a precious-woods merchant, moved to the port city of Alexandria with his mother in the early 20th century from Zahlé. Sharif was later born in Alexandria. His family moved to Cairo when he was four. His mother, Claire Saada, was a noted society hostess, in whose house Egypt&#x27;s King Farouk was a regular visitor prior to his deposition in 1952.

In his youth, Sharif studied at Victoria College, Alexandria, where he showed a talent for languages, He befriended fellow actor Ahmed Ramzy and Youssef Chahine in school. He later graduated from Cairo University with a degree in mathematics and physics. He worked for a while in his father&#x27;s precious wood business before beginning his acting career in Egypt. In 1955, he adopted the stage name &quot;Omar Sharif&quot;. He married fellow Egyptian actress Faten Hamama.

It has been widely reported that Sharif studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, but the academy told &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; that this was not true.

==Acting career==

===Egyptian film star===
Sharif began his acting career in Egypt with a role in &quot;The Blazing Sun&quot; (1954). He was also in &quot;The Devil of the Desert&quot; (1954). He quickly rose to stardom, appearing in &quot;Our Beautiful Days&quot; (1955), &quot;The Lebanese Mission&quot; (1956) (a French film), &quot;Struggle in the Pier&quot; (1956), &quot;Sleepless&quot; (1957), &quot;Land of Peace&quot; (1957), &quot;Goha&quot; (1958) (a Tunisian film that marked the debut of Claudia Cardinale).

He also starred in &quot;Struggle on the Nile&quot; (1958), &quot;Sayyidat al-Qasr&quot; (1958), &quot;A Beginning and an End&quot; (1960), &quot;A Rumor of Love&quot; (1960), and the &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; adaptation &quot;The River of Love&quot; by Ezz El-Dine Zulficar (1960). He and his wife co-starred in several films as romantic leads. Sharif achieved success through other movies like &quot;Struggle on the Nile&quot; (1959), &quot;A Rumor of Love&quot; (1960), and &quot;There Is a Man in Our House&quot; (1961), which made him a huge competitor to Salah Zulfikar, Shoukry Sarhan and Rushdy Abaza, the Egyptian cinema giants at the time.

===&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;===
Sharif&#x27;s first English-language role was that of the fictitious Sherif Ali in David Lean&#x27;s historical epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; in 1962. Sharif was given the role when Dilip Kumar turned it down, Horst Buchholz proved unavailable and Maurice Ronet could not use the contact lenses necessary to hide his eyes.

Casting Sharif in what is now considered one of the &quot;most demanding supporting roles in Hollywood history&quot; was both complex and risky as he was virtually unknown at the time outside Egypt. However, as historian Steven Charles Caton notes, Lean insisted on using ethnic actors when possible to make the film authentic. Sharif would later use his ambiguous ethnicity in other films: &quot;I spoke French, Greek, Italian, Spanish and even Arabic&quot;, he said. As Sharif noted, his accent enabled him to &quot;play the role of a foreigner without anyone knowing exactly where I came from&quot;, which he stated proved highly successful throughout his career. To secure the role, Sharif had to sign a seven-film contract with Columbia at $50,000 a film.

&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; was a box office and critical sensation. Sharif&#x27;s performance earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, as well as a shared Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor.

Sharif went on to star in another Hollywood film, Anthony Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964) where he played the support role of Sohaemus of Armenia. Sharif was third-billed in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; (1964), playing a priest in the Spanish Civil War alongside Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn. Director Fred Zinnemann said he chose Sharif partly on the suggestion of David Lean. &quot;He said he was an absolutely marvellous actor, &#x27;If you possibly can, take a look at him.&#x27;&quot; Film historian Richard Schickel wrote that Sharif gave a &quot;truly wonderful performance&quot;, especially noteworthy because of his totally different role in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;: &quot;It is hard to believe that the priest and the sheik are played by the same man&quot;. The film, like &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, was a commercial disappointment.

Sharif was one of many stars in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Rolls-Royce&quot; (1964), playing a Yugoslav wartime patriot; the movie was a hit. He had his first lead role in a Hollywood film when he was cast in the title part of &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1965). Produced by Irving Allen and directed by Henry Levin for Columbia, the $4.5 million epic was a box office disappointment. He had a supporting role in a French Marco Polo biopic, &quot;Marco the Magnificent&quot; (1965), starring Buchholz and Quinn.

===&quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;===
While making &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;, Sharif heard that Lean was making &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), an adaptation of Boris Pasternak&#x27;s 1957 novel. Sharif was a fan of the novel and lobbied for one of the supporting roles, but Lean decided instead to cast him in the lead as Yuri Zhivago, a poet and physician.

Film historian Constantine Santas explained that Lean intended the film to be a poetic portrayal of the period, with large vistas of landscapes combined with a powerful score by Maurice Jarre. He noted that Sharif&#x27;s role is &quot;passive&quot;, his eyes reflecting &quot;reality&quot; which then become &quot;the mirror of reality we ourselves see&quot;.In a commentary on the DVD (2001 edition), Sharif described Lean&#x27;s style of directing as similar to a general commanding an army. The film was a huge hit. For his performance, Sharif won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; remains one of the top ten highest-grossing films of all time after adjusting for inflation.

Sharif followed it with a cameo in &quot;The Poppy Is Also a Flower&quot; (1966). He was reunited with &quot;Lawrence&quot; co-star Peter O&#x27;Toole and producer Sam Spiegel for &quot;The Night of the Generals&quot; (1967). His fourth movie for Columbia, Sharif played a German officer in World War II. The film was not a success, nor was the Italian-French fairytale &quot;More Than a Miracle&quot; (1967), despite featuring Sophia Loren as co-star.

===&quot;Funny Girl&quot;===
Sharif was also praised for his portrayal of Nicky Arnstein in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968) for Columbia Pictures. He portrayed the husband of Fanny Brice, played by Barbra Streisand in her first film role. His decision to work alongside Streisand angered Egypt&#x27;s government because she was a vocal supporter of the State of Israel, and the country condemned the film. It was also &quot;immediately banned&quot; in numerous Arab nations. Streisand herself jokingly responded, &quot;You think Cairo was upset? You should&#x27;ve seen the letter I got from my Aunt Rose!&quot; Sharif and Streisand became romantically involved during the filming. He admitted later that he did not find Streisand attractive at first, but her appeal soon overwhelmed him: &quot;About a week from the moment I met her&quot;, he recalled, &quot;I was madly in love with her. I thought she was the most gorgeous girl I&#x27;d ever seen in my life...I found her physically beautiful, and I started &quot;lusting&quot; after this woman.&quot;

===Other films===
&quot;The Mamelukes&quot; (1965), an Egyptian epic film with Nabila Ebeid and Emad Hamdy was not a hit in Egyptian box office despite being his first in Egyptian cinema since &quot;There is a Man in Our House&quot; (1961). Sharif co-starred with Catherine Deneuve in &quot;Mayerling&quot; (1968), and the following year was reunited with Gregory Peck in the western, &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1969), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961). At 20th Century Fox he played Che Guevara in &quot;Che!&quot; which flopped at the box office. &quot;The Appointment&quot; (1969) teamed Sharif with Anouk Aimée and director Sidney Lumet but was not a hit. James Clavell&#x27;s &quot;The Last Valley&quot; (1971) was a huge flop, despite co-starring Michael Caine. &quot;The Horsemen&quot; (1971), directed by John Frankenheimer and the last film under his Columbia contract, also performed poorly at the box office. Sharif later said, &quot;What killed my career was appearing in a succession of films you wouldn&#x27;t turn down. They were by good directors, but they were bad films.&quot; He specifically referenced &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot;, &quot;The Appointment&quot; and &quot;The Horsemen&quot;.

&quot;The Burglars&quot; (1971), a French crime film with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Dyan Cannon was a huge hit in France but little seen in the English speaking world.

Sharif played Captain Nemo for European TV in an adaptation of &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1973). He appeared in a romantic thriller alongside Julie Andrews for Blake Edwards, &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; (1974); it did well at the box office and the critics gave good reviews. He then supported Richard Harris and David Hemmings in a thriller, &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974).

Sharif reprised the role of Nick Arnstein in the sequel to &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, &quot;Funny Lady&quot;, in 1975. He starred in a West German thriller &quot;Crime and Passion&quot; (1976) and had a cameo in Edwards&#x27; &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976). Sharif had a small role in &quot;Ashanti&quot; (1979) and a bigger one in &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979), starring Audrey Hepburn.

&quot;I lost money on gambling, buying horses, things like that&quot;, he later said. &quot;So I made those movies which I knew were rubbish... I&#x27;d call my agent and tell him to accept any part, just to bail myself out.&quot;

===1980s===
Sharif had a lead part in a spy spoof, &quot;S*H*E&quot; (1980) and was second-billed (after James Coburn) in &quot;The Baltimore Bullet&quot; (1980). He had supporting parts in a Chevy Chase comedy &quot;Oh! Heavenly Dog&quot; (1981) and a Ryan O&#x27;Neal thriller &quot;Green Ice&quot; (1981) (which was made in the 1970s), and a small role in the comedy &quot;Top Secret!&quot; (1984).

He appeared on stage in a production of &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; in 1983, saying he &quot;appeared in the bad films of great directors&quot;.

Sharif worked steadily in television, appearing in &quot;Pleasure Palace&quot; (1981), &quot;Peter the Great&quot; (1986), and &quot;&quot; (1986) (as Nicholas II of Russia). He had supporting parts in &quot;Grand Larceny&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Possessed&quot; (1988). His first notable credit in a while was &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot; (1990) but Sharif&#x27;s part was only small. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1989, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel outside his Paris apartment.

===1990s===
Sharif was reunited with O&#x27;Toole again in &quot;The Rainbow Thief&quot; (1990). He went to Egypt for &quot;War in the Land of Egypt&quot; (1991) and France for &quot;Mayrig&quot; (1991) with Claudia Cardinale, an autobiographical tale for Henri Verneuil. The latter was popular enough for a sequel, &quot;588 rue paradis&quot; (1992). Sharif could also be seen in &quot;Memories of Midnight&quot; (1991), &quot;Beyond Justice&quot; (1992), &quot;Catherine the Great&quot; (as Alexei Razumovsky), &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1996), &quot;Heaven Before I Die&quot; (1997), and &quot;Mysteries of Egypt&quot; (1998).
In 1996, Sharif starred in the documentary &quot;Lebanon...Imprisoned Splendour&quot;. The documentary was written and directed by Lebanese-Australian director Daizy Gedeon, who approached Sharif for the project because she wanted someone &#x27;remarkable&#x27; to help her tell the true story of Lebanon: a country which, at the time, was still shrouded in the fog of its Civil War. In the film, Sharif shares personal stories of his upbringing, and recites the poetry of famous Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran.

He had his first decent role in a big Hollywood film in a long time with &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999). The outcome of the film&#x27;s production disappointed Sharif so much that he temporarily retired from film acting, not taking a role in another major film until 2003&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Ibrahim&quot;:
:I said to myself, &#x27;Let us stop this nonsense, these meal tickets that we do because it pays well.&#x27; I thought, &#x27;Unless I find a stupendous film that I love and that makes me want to leave home to do, I will stop.&#x27; Bad pictures are very humiliating, I was really sick. It is terrifying to have to do the dialogue from bad scripts, to face a director who does not know what he is doing, in a film so bad that it is not even worth exploring.&quot;

===&quot;Monsieur Ibrahim&quot; and later films===
Sharif did have a small role in &quot;The Parole Officer&quot; (2001). In 2003 he said, &quot;I went 25 years without making a good film.&quot;In 2003, Sharif received acclaim for his leading role in &quot;Monsieur Ibrahim&quot;, a French-language film adaptation of the novel &quot;Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran&quot;, as a Muslim Turkish merchant who becomes a father figure for a Jewish boy. For this performance, Sharif received the César Award for Best Actor.

Sharif said of the film:
It has nice big chunks of dialogue, which is what I like to do, rather than riding horses or camels. I&#x27;d turned down everything and stopped working for four years. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to stop doing that rubbish and keep some dignity.&#x27; But when I read the script for &#x27;Monsieur Ibrahim,&#x27; I phoned the producers immediately. I said, &#x27;Hang on, I&#x27;m coming, wait for me.&#x27; My problem is finding parts. When you&#x27;re young and successful, they write or adapt parts for you. But when you&#x27;re an old chap, let&#x27;s be frank, you don&#x27;t sell tickets anymore. If they need an old Englishman, American or Italian, there are plenty of actors around. So what&#x27;s open for me? Old Arabs. And that&#x27;s what I play in this film.
Sharif&#x27;s later film roles included performances in &quot;Hidalgo&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2005) playing the title role for Italian television, &quot;One Night with the King&quot; (2005) (again with O&#x27;Toole), and &quot;10,000 BC&quot; (2008) as the narrator.Sharif was seen in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (2006). Also in 2006, Sharif played the artist Hans Canon in &quot;The Crown Prince&quot;, a film about Rudolf, the 19th century crown prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In Egypt, he starred in &quot;Hassan and Marcus&quot; (2008) with Adel Emam and was in &quot;The Traveller&quot; (2009). He had support roles in &quot;The Last Templar&quot; (2009) and &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; (2013).

Sharif&#x27;s final role was as lead actor in the short science education film &quot;1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham&quot;, which was directed by Ahmed Salim and was released as part of the United Nations&#x27; International Year of Light campaign, operated by UNESCO.

==Contract bridge career==
Sharif said bridge was his personal passion and at one time was ranked among the world&#x27;s top 50 contract bridge players.
At the 1964 World Bridge Olympiad he represented the United Arab Republic bridge squad and in 1968 he was playing captain of the Egyptian team in the Olympiad.In 1967 he formed the &quot;Omar Sharif Bridge Circus&quot; to showcase bridge to the world and invited professional players including members of the Italian Blue team, which won 16 World championship titles, to tour and promote the game via exhibition matches including one watched by the Shah of Iran. Touring through Europe, the Circus attracted thousands of spectators who watched the matches via Bridge-O-Rama, a new technology (and predecessor to the modern-day VuGraph) that displayed bidding and cardplay on television monitors. Players included Benito Garozzo (considered by many as the greatest bridge player of all time), plus his Italian compatriots Pietro Forquet and Giorgio Belladonna and Frenchman Claude Delmouly.

In 1970, Sharif and the circus went to London&#x27;s famous Piccadilly Hotel for an 80-rubber match against British experts Jeremy Flint and Jonathan Cansino. The stakes were £1 per point, huge stakes even by today&#x27;s standards. The event was to present bridge as a rich, exciting spectacle and to break through into television to bring the game within the reach of millions. The Circus ultimately won the match by 5,470 points, but Sharif still incurred a net loss after paying all related expenses.

The Circus, under the management of Mike Ledeen, toured Canada and the U.S. in 1970–71. Sharif&#x27;s team joined with the Dallas Aces for a seven-city tour of Chicago, Winnipeg, Los Angeles, Minneapolis–St. Paul, Dallas, Detroit and Philadelphia. In each city, a team of local experts participated in the exhibition.In 1975, sponsored by the Lancia division of Fiat, Sharif and members of the Italian Blue Team faced off in four challenge matches against American teams. Sharif&#x27;s team won in Chicago, but was defeated in New York, Los Angeles and Miami.

The Omar Sharif World Individual Championship held in 1990 offered the largest total purse ($200,000) in the history of bridge.

In 1997, he was a member of the Committee of Honour for the Bermuda Bowl on the first time it was held in an Arab country, Tunisia. He competed in a transnational team (with French, German and Lebanese players) and finished 11th. In 1999 he played in a French senior team at the European Championships in Malta, finishing second. In 2000 at Maastricht, he joined Egypt&#x27;s senior team, finishing in ninth place.

With Charles Goren and later Tannah Hirsch, Sharif contributed to a syndicated newspaper bridge column for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

He was also both the author and co-author of several books on bridge and licensed his name to a bridge video game, &quot;Omar Sharif Bridge&quot;, initially released in an MS-DOS version and Amiga version in 1992 and is still sold in Windows and mobile platform versions. He was also the hand analyst commentator for the Epson worldwide bridge contests.

Sharif was a regular in casinos in France.

By 2000 Sharif had stopped playing bridge entirely. Having once proudly declared the game his passion, he now considered it an addiction: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be a slave to any passion anymore. I gave up card playing altogether, even bridge and gambling.&quot; Sharif, however, continued to license his name to bridge software games, and co-authored a book with bridge writer David Bird, &quot;Omar Sharif Talks Bridge&quot;. Written in 2004, it includes some of his most famous deals and bridge stories.

==Personal life==
===Family and personal relationships===
Sharif lived in Egypt from his birth until he moved to Europe in 1965. He recounted that in 1932, his father &quot;wasn&#x27;t a wealthy man&quot;, but &quot;earned quite a bit of money&quot;. Before the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, King Farouk frequented Sharif&#x27;s family home, and became a friend and card-game partner of Sharif&#x27;s mother. His mother was an elegant and charming hostess who was all too delighted with the association because it gave her the privilege of &quot;consorting only with the elite&quot; of Egyptian society. Sharif also recounted that his father&#x27;s timber business was very successful during that time in ways that Sharif describes as dishonest or immoral. By contrast, after 1952, Sharif stated that wealth changed hands in Egypt under Nasser&#x27;s nationalisation policies and his father&#x27;s business &quot;took a beating&quot;.

In 1954, Sharif starred in the film &quot;Struggle in the Valley&quot; with Faten Hamama, who shared a kiss with him although she had previously refused to kiss on screen. The two fell in love; Sharif converted to Islam, changed his name, and married her. They had one son, Tarek Sharif, born in 1957 in Egypt, who appeared in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; as Yuri at the age of eight. The couple separated in 1966 and their marriage ended in divorce in 1974. Sharif never remarried; he stated that after his divorce he never fell in love with another woman again. Before their divorce, Sharif dated actresses Pat Sheehan and Dodie Marshall.

The Nasser government imposed travel restrictions in the form of &quot;exit visas&quot;, so Sharif&#x27;s travel to take part in international films was sometimes impeded, something he found to be intolerable. These restrictions influenced Sharif&#x27;s decision to remain in Europe between his film shoots, a decision that cost him his marriage, though the couple remained friends. It was a major crossroad in Sharif&#x27;s life and changed him from an established family man to a committed bachelor living in European hotels. When commenting about his fame and life in Hollywood, Sharif said, &quot;It gave me glory, but it gave me loneliness also. And a lot of missing my own land, my own people and my own country&quot;. When Sharif&#x27;s affair with Streisand was made public in the Egyptian press, his Egyptian citizenship was almost withdrawn by the Egyptian government because of Streisand being Jewish and a vocal supporter of Israel, which was then in a state of war with Egypt.
Sharif became friends with Peter O&#x27;Toole during the making of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. They appeared in several other films together and remained close friends. He was also good friends with Egyptologist Zahi Hawass. Actor and friend Tom Courtenay revealed in an interview for the 19 July 2008 edition of BBC Radio&#x27;s Test Match Special that Sharif supported Hull City Association Football Club and in the 1970s he would telephone their automated scoreline from his home in Paris for score updates. Sharif was given an honorary degree by the University of Hull in 2010 and he used the occasion to meet Hull City football player Ken Wagstaff. Sharif also had an interest in horse racing spanning more than 50 years. He was often seen at French racecourses, with Deauville-La Touques Racecourse being his favourite. Sharif&#x27;s horses won a number of important races and he had his best successes with Don Bosco, who won the Prix Gontaut-Biron, Prix Perth and Prix du Muguet. He also wrote for a French horse racing magazine.

In later life, Sharif lived mostly in Cairo with his family and his last partner Andréa Ferréol. In addition to his son Tarek Sharif, he had two grandsons, Omar Sharif Jr (born 1983 in Montreal) and Karim. Omar Sharif Jr is also an actor. 

Sharif was also one of the ambassadors of Egypt&#x27;s bid for the 2010 FIFA World Cup which lost out to South Africa.

=== View on religion ===
Sharif was born into a secular Melkite Greek Catholic family, and later converted to Islam to marry Faten Hamama. In 2004 interview with ABC Australia, when asked about his beliefs, he said &quot;I believe in everything and nothing, I don&#x27;t disbelieve in anything, everything is possible, as far as my brain tells me, I don&#x27;t believe, because I believe that God is Justice. the first thing I learned in Catholicism is that God is Justice, and I can&#x27;t see justice in the world&quot;. He also emphasized the power of belief after seeing his mother on her deathbed calling Mary and Christ, and how after wondering who he would call upon on his deathbed, he decided that he would call upon his mother. 

In a later interview with Daily News Egypt in 2010, commenting on religious issues, he said, &quot;Because when one sees what happens in the world between the religions, the different religions killing each other and murdering each other, it&#x27;s disgusting as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s ridiculous. And so I thought I might be useful. I believe in God and I believe in religion, but religion should belong to you. The extraordinary thing is that the Jews believe that only the Jews can go to paradise, the Christians believe only the Christians can go to paradise and the Muslims believe only the Muslims can go to paradise. Now why should God in his great Justice make somebody born that cannot go to paradise? Why? It&#x27;s absurd.&quot;

Following his death, Sharif received an Islamic funeral as he was registered as a Muslim in Egypt. The funeral was attended by his son Tarik, and he was buried in the historic Sayeda Nafisa cemetery. 

===His position on the 2011 Egyptian revolution===
Sharif was very supportive of the 2011 Egyptian revolution in his home country and called for the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, stating: &quot;Given that the entire Egyptian people don&#x27;t want him and he&#x27;s been in power for 30 years, that&#x27;s enough.&quot;

===Health problems and death===
Sharif had a triple heart bypass operation in 1992 and suffered a mild heart attack in 1994. Until his bypass, Sharif smoked 25 cigarettes a day. He quit smoking after the operation.

In May 2015, it was reported that Sharif was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. His son Tarek Sharif (who portrayed his father&#x27;s character as a child in Doctor Zhivago) said that his father was becoming confused when remembering some of the biggest films of his career; he would mix up the names of his best-known films, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, often forgetting where they were filmed.On 10 July 2015, less than six months after his former wife&#x27;s death at the same age, Sharif died after suffering a heart attack at a hospital in Cairo.

On 12 July 2015, Sharif&#x27;s funeral was held at the Grand Mosque of Mushir Tantawi in eastern Cairo. The funeral was attended by a group of Sharif&#x27;s relatives, friends and Egyptian actors, his coffin draped in the Egyptian flag and a black shroud. His coffin was later taken to the El-Sayeda Nafisa cemetery in southern Cairo, where he was buried.

==Awards==
At the 35th Academy Awards, Sharif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Sherif Ali in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; but lost to Ed Begley. He won two Golden Globe awards in the same year for his role. In 1966, he won a third Golden Globe award for the titular role in the film &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. In November 2005, Sharif was awarded the inaugural Sergei Eisenstein Medal by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in recognition of his significant contributions to world film and cultural diversity. The medal, which is awarded very infrequently, is named after Russian director Sergei Eisenstein. Only 25 have been struck, as determined by the agreement between UNESCO, Russia&#x27;s Mosfilm and the Vivat Foundation.

<text>Småland is a province of Sweden and at the funeral of Gustav Vasa in 1560 the province was granted its arms. Today there are also county arms that are based on the arms of Småland.

==Småland==

The first coat of arms for Småland, granted in 1560, pictured a red crossbow with roses on a golden shield but at the coronation of Johan III in 1569 a new coat of arms was granted. A lion was wielding the crossbow and the roses had fallen off. There was also a revision in 1944, but no alterations were made. Småland is also considered a duchy and has the right to carry a ducal coronet with the arms.

Blazon: &quot;Or a lion rampant Gules langued and armed Azure holding in front paws a Crossbow of the second bowed and stringed Sable with a bolt Argent.&quot;

Official blazon in Swedish: &quot;I gyllene fält ett rött lejon med blå beväring, därest sådan skall förekomma, och hållande i tassarna ett uppåtvänt rött armborst med pilspets av silver samt båge och strängar svarta.&quot;.

==Kronoberg County==
Kronoberg County was formally granted its arms in 1944; however, use of the same was already an established practice. It is a variation of the arms of Småland, with the lion standing on a mountain.

Blazon: &quot;Or, a lion rampant Gules langued and armed Azure holding in front paws a Crossbow of the second bowed and stringed Sable with a bolt Argent, standing on a triple Mount Vert.&quot;

Official blazon in Swedish: &quot;I fält av guld ett på ett grönt treberg stående, upprest, rött lejon med blå beväring, vilket med båda framtassarna håller ett stolpvis ställt rött armborst med svart båge och pil av silver.&quot;.

==Kalmar County==
Kalmar County includes the eastern part of Småland and the island province of Öland. The arms is a combination of the arms of Småland and Öland.

Blazon: &quot;Quartered, the arms of Småland and Öland&quot;

Official blazon in Swedish: &quot;&quot;Sköld kvadrerad av Smålands och Ölands vapen&quot;.

==Jönköping County==
Jönköping County geographically represents the northern part of Småland. The arms of the County, however, are not based on the arms of the province but rather on the combination of the arms for the town of Jönköping and the lesser state arms of Sweden.

Official blazon in Swedish: &quot;I rött fält en från en av en vågskura bildad blå stam uppskjutande krenelerad borg av silver med tre krenelerade torn, det mellersta högst,svarta fönster, dörrar och port samt upphissat portgaller av silver och däröver en med tre bjälkvis ordnade kronor av guld belagd blå ginstam.&quot;&quot;.

==Öland==
Öland is a separate province from Småland, however its arms are included in the arms for Kalmar County.

Blazon: &quot;Azure a Deer Or attired, hoofed and gorged Gules.&quot;

Official blazon in Swedish: &quot;I blått fält en gående hjort av guld med rött halsband och röd beväring, därest sådan skall komma till användning.&quot;

<text>Carl Andreas Duker (1670 – November 5, 1752) was a German classical scholar and jurist.

==Biography==
He was born at Unna in Westphalia, and studied at the University of Franeker under Jacob Perizonius. In 1700 he was appointed teacher of history and eloquence at the Herborn gymnasium, in 1704 vice-principal of the school at The Hague, and in 1716 he succeeded (with Drakenborch as colleague) to the professorship formerly held by Peter Burmann at Utrecht. After eighteen years&#x27; tenure he resigned his post, and lived in retirement at IJsselstein and Vianen. His health finally broke down under excessive study, and he died, almost blind, at the house of a relative in Meiderich near Duisburg, on 5 November 1752.

==Works==
His chief classical works were editions of Florus (1722) and Thucydides (1731, considered his best). He brought out the 2nd edition of Perizonius&#x27;s &quot;Origines Babylonicae et Aegyptiacae&quot; (1736) and his commentary on Pomponius Mela (1736–1737). Duker was also an authority on ancient law, and published &quot;Opuscula varia de latinitate veterum jurisconsultorum&quot; (1711), and a revision of the &quot;Leges Atticae of S. Petit&quot; (1741).

<doc id="189934" wikidata="Q963519" url="?curid=189934" title="Perizonius">
<text>Perizonius (or Accinctus) was the name of Jakob Voorbroek (26 October 1651 – 6 April 1715), a Dutch classical scholar, who was born at Appingedam in Groningen.

He was the son of Anton Perizonius (1626–1672), the author of a once well-known treatise, &quot;De ratione studii theologici&quot;. Having studied at the University of Utrecht, he was appointed in 1682 to the chair of eloquence and history at Franeker through the influence of J. G. Graevius and Nikolaes Heinsius. In 1693 he was promoted to the corresponding chair at Leiden, where he died on 6 April 1715.

The numerous works of Perizonius entitle him to a high place among the scholars of his age. Special interest attaches to his edition of the &quot;Minerva sive de causis linguae latinae&quot; (Salamanca: Renaut, 1587) of Francisco Sánchez de las Brozas, &quot;aka&quot; El Brocense, (ed. C. L. Bauer, 1793–1801), one of the last developments of the study of Latin grammar in its pre-scientific stage, when the phenomena of language were still regarded as for the most part disconnected, conventional or fortuitous.

Mention should also be made of his &quot;Animadversiones historicae&quot; (1685), which may be said to have laid the foundations of historical criticism, and of his treatises on the Roman Republic, alluded to by Niebuhr as marking the beginning of the new era of historical study with which his own name is associated.

== Collection and heritage ==

Perizonius was a collector of rare books and manuscripts. To the Leiden University Library he bequeathed 134 manuscripts, one painting, many printed books and a legacy to buy new books. The manuscripts are kept separate as the Collection Perizonius in the library. One of the famous manuscripts in the Perizonius collection is a manuscript, probably from the Abbey of Saint Gall dating from the 10th century. It includes &quot;1 Maccabees&quot; and the fourth book of &quot;Epitoma Rei Militaris&quot; by Vegetius. The manuscript includes many richly decorated pages depicting the historic invasion of Germany by the Hungarians. The digital version of MS PER F 17 is available on Leiden&#x27;s Digital Collections.

<text>Peter Paul Dobrée (26 June 178224 September 1825) was a British classical scholar and critic.

==Early life and education==
He was born in 1782 in Guernsey, the Channel Islands to the Reverend William Dobrée. He was educated at Reading School under Richard Valpy and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow.

==Career==
Dobrée was an intimate friend of Richard Porson, whom he took as his model in textual criticism, although he showed less caution in conjectural emendation. After Porson&#x27;s death (1808) Dobrée was commissioned with James Henry Monk and Charles James Blomfield to edit his literary remains, which had been bequeathed to Trinity College.

Illness and a subsequent journey to Iglesias, Sardinia to visit Fabrizio Dobre delayed the work until 1820, when Dobree brought out the &quot;Plutus&quot; of Aristophanes (with his own and Porson&#x27;s notes) and all Porson&#x27;s &quot;Aristophanica&quot;. Two years later, he published the &quot;Lexicon&quot; of Photius from Porson&#x27;s transcript of the Gale manuscript in Trinity College library, to which he appended a &quot;Lexicon rhetoricum&quot;, from the margin of a Cambridge manuscript of Harpocration.

He was appointed Regius Professor of Greek in 1823. He died on 24 September 1825 at Trinity College, after a short illness.

James Scholefield, his successor in the Greek professorship, brought out selections from his notes (&quot;Adversaria&quot;, 1831–1833) on Greek and Latin authors (especially the orators), and a reprint of the &quot;Lexicon rhetoricum&quot;, together with notes on inscriptions (1834–1835).

<text>A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit label used to uniquely identify objects in computer systems. The term Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is also used, mostly in Microsoft systems.

When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are, for practical purposes, unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other numbering schemes. While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is generally considered close enough to zero to be negligible.

Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.

Adoption of UUIDs is widespread, with many computing platforms providing support for generating them and for parsing their textual representation.

== History ==

In the 1980s, Apollo Computer originally used UUIDs in the Network Computing System (NCS). Later, the Open Software Foundation (OSF) used UUIDs for their Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). The design of the DCE UUIDs was partly based on the NCS UUIDs, whose design was in turn inspired by the (64-bit) unique identifiers defined and used pervasively in Domain/OS, an operating system designed by Apollo Computer. Later, the Microsoft Windows platforms adopted the DCE design as &quot;Globally Unique IDentifiers&quot; (GUIDs).

 registered a URN namespace for UUIDs and recapitulated the earlier specifications, with the same technical content. When in July 2005 was published as a proposed IETF standard, the ITU had also standardized UUIDs, based on the previous standards and early versions of . On May 7, 2024, was published, introducing 3 new &quot;versions&quot; and clarifying some ambiguities.

== Standards ==

UUIDs are standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).

UUIDs are documented as part of ISO/IEC 11578:1996 &quot;Information technology – Open Systems Interconnection – Remote Procedure Call (RPC)&quot; and more recently in ITU-T Rec. X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8:2014.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published the Standards-Track from the &quot;Revise Universally Unique Identifier Definitions Working Group&quot; as revision for . is technically equivalent to ITU-T Rec. X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, but is now obsolete.

== Format ==

A UUID is 128 bits in size, in which 2 to 4 bits are used to indicate the format&#x27;s variant. The most common variant in use, OSF DCE, additionally defines 4 bits for its version.

The use of the remaining bits is governed by the variant/version selected.

=== Variants ===

The &quot;variant&quot; field indicates the format of the UUID (and in case of the legacy UUID also the address family used for the node field). The following variants are defined:

* The Apollo NCS variant (indicated by the one-bit pattern 0xxx2) is for backwards compatibility with the now-obsolete Apollo Network Computing System 1.5 UUID format developed around 1988. Though different in detail, the similarity with modern UUIDv1 is evident. The variant bits in the current UUID specification coincide with the high bits of the address family octet in NCS UUIDs. Though the address family could hold values in the range 0..255, only the values 0..13 were ever defined. Accordingly, the bit pattern codice_1 avoids conflicts with historical NCS UUIDs, should any still exist in databases. This variant defines &quot;families&quot; as subtype.
* The OSF DCE variant (10xx2) are referred to as RFC 4122/DCE 1.1 UUIDs, or &quot;Leach–Salz&quot; UUIDs, after the authors of the original Internet Draft. This variant defines &quot;versions&quot; as subtype.
* The Microsoft COM/DCOM variant (110x2) is characterized in the RFC as &quot;reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility&quot; and was used for early GUIDs on the Microsoft Windows platform.
* The Reserved variant space is not currently used by any specification.

=== Versions of the OSF DCE variant ===

The OSF DCE variant defines eight &quot;versions&quot; in the standard, and each version may be more appropriate than the others in specific use cases. The version is indicated by the value of the higher nibble (higher 4 bits, or higher hexadecimal digit) of the 7th byte of the UUID. In hex, this is the character after the second dash. For example, the UUID codice_2 is version 4, because of the digit after the second dash is 4 in codice_3.

==== Versions 1 and 6 (date-time and MAC address) ====

Version 1 concatenates the 48-bit MAC address of the &quot;node&quot; (that is, the computer generating the UUID), with a 60-bit timestamp, being the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since midnight 15 October 1582 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the date on which the Gregorian calendar was first adopted by the bulk of Europe. RFC 4122 states that the time value rolls over around 3400 AD, depending on the algorithm used, which implies that the 60-bit timestamp is a signed quantity. However some software, such as the libuuid library, treats the timestamp as unsigned, putting the rollover time in 5623 AD. The rollover time as defined by ITU-T Rec. X.667 is 3603 AD.

A 13-bit or 14-bit &quot;uniquifying&quot; clock sequence extends the timestamp in order to handle cases where the processor clock does not advance fast enough, or where there are multiple processors and UUID generators per node. When UUIDs are generated faster than the system clock could advance, the lower bits of the timestamp fields can be generated by incrementing it every time a UUID is being generated, to simulate a high-resolution timestamp. With each version 1 UUID corresponding to a single point in space (the node) and time (intervals and clock sequence), the chance of two properly generated version-1 UUIDs being unintentionally the same is practically nil. Since the time and clock sequence total 74 bits, 274 (1.8, or 18 sextillion) version-1 UUIDs can be generated per node ID, at a maximal average rate of 163 billion per second per node ID.

In contrast to other UUID versions, version-1 and -2 UUIDs based on MAC addresses from network cards rely for their uniqueness in part on an identifier issued by a central registration authority, namely the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) part of the MAC address, which is issued by the IEEE to manufacturers of networking equipment. The uniqueness of version-1 and version-2 UUIDs based on network-card MAC addresses also depends on network-card manufacturers properly assigning unique MAC addresses to their cards, which like other manufacturing processes is subject to error. Virtual machines receive a MAC address in a range that is configurable in the hypervisor. Additionally some operating systems permit the end user to customise the MAC address, notably OpenWRT.

Usage of the node&#x27;s network card MAC address for the node ID means that a version-1 UUID can be tracked back to the computer that created it. Documents can sometimes be traced to the computers where they were created or edited through UUIDs embedded into them by word processing software. This privacy hole was used when locating the creator of the Melissa virus.

 does allow the MAC address in a version-1 (or 2) UUID to be replaced by a random 48-bit node ID, either because the node does not have a MAC address, or because it is not desirable to expose it. In that case, the RFC requires that the least significant bit of the first octet of the node ID should be set to 1. This corresponds to the multicast bit in MAC addresses, and setting it serves to differentiate UUIDs where the node ID is randomly generated from UUIDs based on MAC addresses from network cards, which typically have unicast MAC addresses.

Version 6 is the same as version 1 except all timestamp bits are ordered from most significant to least significant. This allows systems to sort UUIDs in order of creation simply by sorting them lexically, whereas this is not possible with version 1.

==== Version 2 (date-time and MAC address, DCE security version) ====

 reserves version 2 for &quot;DCE security&quot; UUIDs; but it does not provide any details. For this reason, many UUID implementations omit version 2. However, the specification of version-2 UUIDs is provided by the DCE 1.1 Authentication and Security Services specification.

Version-2 UUIDs are similar to version 1, except that the least significant 8 bits of the clock sequence are replaced by a &quot;local domain&quot; number, and the least significant 32 bits of the timestamp are replaced by an integer identifier meaningful within the specified local domain. On POSIX systems, local-domain numbers 0 and 1 are for user ids (UIDs) and group ids (GIDs) respectively, and other local-domain numbers are site-defined. On non-POSIX systems, all local domain numbers are site-defined.

The ability to include a 40-bit domain/identifier in the UUID comes with a tradeoff. On the one hand, 40 bits allow about 1 trillion domain/identifier values per node ID. On the other hand, with the clock value truncated to the 28 most significant bits, compared to 60 bits in version 1, the clock in a version 2 UUID will &quot;tick&quot; only once every 429.49 seconds, a little more than 7 minutes, as opposed to every 100 nanoseconds for version 1. And with a clock sequence of only 6 bits, compared to 14 bits in version 1, only 64 unique UUIDs per node/domain/identifier can be generated per 7-minute clock tick, compared to 16,384 clock sequence values for version 1.

==== Versions 3 and 5 (namespace name-based) ====

Version-3 and version-5 UUIDs are generated by hashing a namespace identifier and name. Version 3 uses MD5 as the hashing algorithm, and version 5 uses SHA-1.

The namespace identifier is itself a UUID. The specification provides UUIDs to represent the namespaces for URLs, fully qualified domain names, object identifiers, and X.500 distinguished names; but any desired UUID may be used as a namespace designator.

To determine the version-3 UUID corresponding to a given namespace and name, the UUID of the namespace is transformed to a string of bytes, concatenated with the input name, then hashed with MD5, yielding 128 bits. Then 6 or 7 bits are replaced by fixed values, the 4-bit version (e.g. 00112 for version 3), and the 2- or 3-bit UUID &quot;variant&quot; (e.g. 102 indicating a UUIDs, or 1102 indicating a legacy Microsoft GUID). Since 6 or 7 bits are thus predetermined, only 121 or 122 bits contribute to the uniqueness of the UUID.

Version-5 UUIDs are similar, but SHA-1 is used instead of MD5. Since SHA-1 generates 160-bit digests, the digest is truncated to 128 bits before the version and variant bits are replaced.

Version-3 and version-5 UUIDs have the property that the same namespace and name will map to the same UUID. However, neither the namespace nor name can be determined from the UUID, even if one of them is specified, except by brute-force search. recommends version 5 (SHA-1) over version 3 (MD5), and warns against use of UUIDs of either version as security credentials.

==== Version 4 (random) ====

A version 4 UUID is randomly generated. As in other UUIDs, 4 bits are used to indicate version 4, and 2 or 3 bits to indicate the variant (102 or 1102 for variants 1 and 2 respectively). Thus, for variant 1 (that is, most UUIDs) a random version 4 UUID will have 6 predetermined variant and version bits, leaving 122 bits for the randomly generated part, for a total of 2122, or 5.3 (5.3 undecillion) possible version-4 variant-1 UUIDs. There are half as many possible version 4, variant 2 UUIDs (legacy GUIDs) because there is one less random bit available, 3 bits being consumed for the variant.

Per , the seventh octet&#x27;s most significant 4 bits indicate which version the UUID adheres to. This means that the first hexadecimal digit in the third group always starts with a codice_4 in UUIDv4s. Visually, this looks like this codice_5, where codice_6 is the UUID version field. The upper two or three bits of digit codice_7 encode the variant. Values are codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 or codice_11 for the 2 bit indication, values codice_12 or codice_13 for the 3 bit indication. For example, a random UUID version 4, variant 1 could be codice_14.

==== Version 7 (timestamp and random) ====
Version 7 UUIDs (UUIDv7) are designed for keys in high-load databases and distributed systems.

UUIDv7 begins with a 48 bit big-endian Unix Epoch timestamp with approximately millisecond granularity. The timestamp can be shifted by any time shift value. Directly after the timestamp follows the version nibble, that must have a value of 7. The variant bits have to be codice_15. Remaining 74 bits are random seeded counter (optional, at least 12 bits but no longer than 42 bits) and random.

Two counter rollover handling methods can be used together:

* Zero seeded most significant, leftmost guard bit of the counter.
* Increment of the timestamp ahead of the actual time and reinitialize the counter when it overflows.

In DBMS UUIDv7 generator can be shared between threads (tied to a table or to a DBMS instance) or can be thread-local (with worse monotonicity, locality and performance).

==== Version 8 (custom) ====
Version 8 only has two requirements:

* The variant bits have to be codice_16, so the nibble containing the variant must be 8 (codice_17), 9 (codice_18), A (codice_19), or B (codice_20).
* The version nibble has to be the value of 8.

Those requirements tell the system that it is a version 8 UUID. The remaining 122 bits are up to the vendor to customize. The difference with version 4 is that those 122 bits are random, but the 122 bits in UUID version 8 are not, because they follow vendor specific rules.

=== Special values ===

==== Nil UUID ====

The &quot;nil&quot; UUID is the UUID codice_21; that is, all bits set to zero.

==== Max UUID ====

The &quot;max&quot; UUID, sometimes also called the &quot;omni&quot; UUID, is the UUID codice_22; that is, all bits set to one.

== Encoding ==

=== Binary representation ===

Initially, Apollo Computer designed the UUID with the following wire format:

Later, the UUID was extended by combining the legacy family field with the new variant field. Because the family field only had used the values ranging from 0 to 13 in the past, it was decided that a UUID with the most significant bit set to 0 was a legacy UUID. This gives the following table for the family group:

The legacy Apollo NCS UUID has the format described in the previous table. The OSF DCE UUID variant is described in . The Microsoft COM / DCOM UUID has its variant described in the Microsoft documentation.

==== Endianess ====

When saving UUIDs to binary format, they are sequentially encoded in big-endian. For example, codice_23 is encoded as the bytes codice_24 codice_25 codice_26 codice_27 codice_28.

An exception to this are Microsoft&#x27;s variant 2 UUIDs (&quot;GUID&quot;): historically used in COM/OLE libraries, they use a little-endian format, but appear mixed-endian with the first three components of the UUID as little-endian and last two big-endian. Microsoft&#x27;s GUID structure defines the last eight bytes as an 8-byte array, which are serialized in ascending order, which makes the byte representation appear mixed-endian. For example, codice_23 is encoded as the bytes codice_30 codice_31 codice_32 codice_27 codice_28.

=== Textual representation ===

In most cases, UUIDs are represented as hexadecimal values. The most used format is the 8-4-4-4-12 format, codice_35, where every codice_36 represents 4 bits. Other well-known formats are the 8-4-4-4-12 format with braces, codice_37, like in Microsoft&#x27;s systems, e.g. Windows, or codice_38, where all hyphens are removed. In some cases, it is also possible to have codice_38 with the &quot;0x&quot; prefix or the &quot;h&quot; suffix to indicate hexadecimal values. The format with hyphens was introduced with the newer variant system. Before that, the legacy Apollo format used a slightly different format: codice_40. The first part is the time (time_high and time_low combined). The reserved field is skipped. The family field comes directly after the first dot, so in this case codice_41 (13 in decimal) for DDS (Data Distribution Service). The remaining parts, each separated with a dot, are the node bytes.

The lowercase form of the hexadecimal values is the generally preferred format. Specifically in some contexts such as those defined in ITU-T Rec. X.667, lowercase is required when the text is generated, but the uppercase version must also be accepted.

A UUID can be represented as a 128 bit integer. For example, the UUID codice_42 can also be represented as 113059749145936325402354257176981405696. Note that it is possible to have both signed and unsigned values if the first bit of the UUID is set to 1.

A UUID can be represented as a 128 bit binary number. For example, the UUID codice_42 can also be represented as 01010101000011101000010000000000111000101001101101000001110101001010011100010110010001000110011001010101010001000000000000000000.

 registers the &quot;uuid&quot; namespace. This makes it possible to make URNs out of UUIDs, like codice_44. The normal 8-4-4-4-12 format is used for this. It is also possible to make a OID URN out of UUIDs, like codice_45. In that case, the unsigned decimal format is used. The &quot;uuid&quot; URN is recommended over the &quot;oid&quot; URN.

== Collisions ==

Collision occurs when the same UUID is generated more than once and assigned to different referents. In the case of standard version-1 and version-2 UUIDs using unique MAC addresses from network cards, collisions are unlikely to occur, with an increased possibility only when an implementation varies from the standards, either inadvertently or intentionally.

In contrast to version-1 and version-2 UUIDs generated using MAC addresses, with version-1 and -2 UUIDs which use randomly generated node ids, hash-based version-3 and version-5 UUIDs, and random version-4 UUIDs, collisions can occur even without implementation problems, albeit with a probability so small that it can normally be ignored. This probability can be computed precisely based on analysis of the birthday problem.

For example, the number of random version-4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of at least one collision is 2.71 quintillion, computed as follows:

: formula_1

This number would be equivalent to generating 1 billion UUIDs per second for about 86 years. A file containing this many UUIDs, at 16 bytes per UUID, would be about 43.4 exabytes (37.7 EiB).

The smallest number of version-4 UUIDs which must be generated for the probability of finding a collision to be &quot;p&quot; is approximated by the formula

: formula_2

Thus, the probability to find a duplicate within 103 trillion version-4 UUIDs is one in a billion.

Collisions have occurred when manufacturers assign a default UUID to a product, such as a motherboard, and then fail to over-write the default UUID later in the manufacturing process. For example, UUID 03000200-0400-0500-0006-000700080009 occurs on many different units of Gigabyte-branded motherboards.

== Uses ==

=== Filesystems ===

Significant uses include ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem userspace tools (e2fsprogs uses libuuid provided by util-linux), LVM, LUKS encrypted partitions, GNOME, KDE, and macOS, most of which are derived from the original implementation by Theodore Ts&#x27;o.
The &quot;partition label&quot; and the &quot;partition UUID&quot; are both stored in the superblock. They are both part of the file system rather than of the partition. For example, ext2–4 contain a UUID, while NTFS or FAT32 do not. The superblock is a part of the file system, thus fully contained within the partition, hence doing leaves both sda1 and sdb1 with the same label and UUID.

=== Remoting ===

There are several flavors of GUIDs used in Microsoft&#x27;s Component Object Model (COM):

* – interface identifier; (The ones that are registered on a system are stored in the Windows Registry at )
* – class identifier; (Stored at )
* – type library identifier; (Stored at )
* – category identifier; (its presence on a class identifies it as belonging to certain class categories, listed at )

=== Databases ===

UUIDs are commonly used as a unique key in database tables. The function in Microsoft SQL Server version 4 Transact-SQL returns standard random version-4 UUIDs, while the function returns 128-bit identifiers similar to UUIDs which are committed to ascend in sequence until the next system reboot. The Oracle Database function does not return a standard GUID, despite the name. Instead, it returns a 16-byte 128-bit RAW value based on a host identifier and a process or thread identifier, somewhat similar to a GUID. PostgreSQL contains a datatype and can generate most versions of UUIDs through the use of functions from modules. MySQL provides a function, which generates standard version-1 UUIDs.

==== Combined Time-GUID ====

The random nature of standard UUIDs of versions 3, 4, and 5, and the ordering of the fields within standard versions 1 and 2 may create problems with database locality or performance when UUIDs are used as primary keys. For example, in 2002 Jimmy Nilsson reported a significant improvement in performance with Microsoft SQL Server when the version-4 UUIDs being used as keys were modified to include a non-random suffix based on system time. This so-called &quot;COMB&quot; (combined time-GUID) approach made the UUIDs significantly more likely to be duplicated, as Nilsson acknowledged, but Nilsson only required uniqueness within the application. By reordering and encoding version 1 and 2 UUIDs so that the timestamp comes first, insertion performance loss can be averted.

COMB-like arrangements of UUID payloads were eventually standardized in as UUIDv6 and UUIDv7.

<text>James Henry Monk (12 December 1784 – 6 June 1856) was an English divine and classical scholar.

==Life==

He was born at Buntingford, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Norwich School, Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1809 was elected Regius Professor of Greek in succession to Porson. The establishment of the classical tripos was in great measure due to his efforts. In 1822 he was appointed Dean of Peterborough; in 1830, bishop of Gloucester (with which the see of Bristol was amalgamated in 1836). He took his seat in the House of Lords in July 1831.

==Works==

He is best known as the author of a &quot;Life of Bentley&quot; (1830) and as the editor (with CJ Blomfield) of Porson&#x27;s &quot;Adversaria&quot; (1812).

<text>James Scholefield (15 November 1789 – 4 April 1853) was an English classical scholar.

== Life and career ==
James Scholefield was born at Henley-on-Thames on 15 November 1789. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was in 1825 appointed professor of Greek in the university. He was for some time curate to Charles Simeon, the evangelical churchman, and his low church views involved him in disputes with his own parishioners at St Michael&#x27;s, Cambridge, of which he was perpetual curate from 1823 till his death at Hastings on 4 April 1853. From 1849 until his death he was canon of Ely.

Scholefield was an excellent teacher with his students coming up with the name Duke Scholefield to pay tribute to his muscular physique and exceptionally wide shoulders. His most useful work was his edition of the &quot;Adversaria&quot; of PP Dobree, his predecessor in the chair of Greek. He also published editions of Aeschylus (1828), in which he dealt very conservatively with the text, and of Porson&#x27;s four plays of Euripides. His &quot;Hints for an improved Translation of the New Testament&quot; met with considerable success. He was one of the examiners in the first Classical Tripos (1824). The Scholefield Theological Prize at Cambridge was established in commemoration of him in 1856.

<doc id="189941" wikidata="Q1784829" url="?curid=189941" title="Passing (sociology)">
<text>Passing is the ability of a person to be regarded as a member of an identity group or category, such as racial identity, ethnicity, caste, social class, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age or disability status, that is often different from their own. Passing may be used to increase social acceptance to cope with stigma by removing stigma from the presented self and could result in other social benefits as well. Thus, passing may serve as a form of self-preservation or self-protection if expressing one&#x27;s true or prior identity may be dangerous.

Passing may require acceptance into a community and may lead to temporary or permanent leave from another community to which an individual previously belonged. Thus, passing can result in separation from one&#x27;s original self, family, friends, or previous living experiences. Successful passing may contribute to economic security, safety, and stigma avoidance, but it may take an emotional toll as a result of denial of one&#x27;s previous identity and may lead to depression or self-loathing. When an individual deliberately attempts to &quot;pass&quot; as a member of an identity group, they may actively engage in performance of behaviors that they believe to be associated with membership of that group. Passing practices may also include information management of the passer in attempting to control or conceal any stigmatizing information that may reveal disparity from their presumed identity.

Etymologically, the term is simply the nominalisation of the verb &quot;pass&quot; in its phrasal use with &quot;for&quot; or &quot;as&quot;, as in a counterfeit &quot;passing for&quot; the genuine article or an impostor &quot;passing as&quot; another person. It has been in popular use since at least the late 1920s.

== Academic framework ==

Passing, as a sociological concept, was first coined by Erving Goffman as a term for one response to possessing some kind of stigma that is often less visible. Stigma, according to Goffman&#x27;s framework in his work Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963), &quot;refer[s] to an attribute that is deeply discrediting&quot; or &quot;an undesired differentness from what [was] anticipated&quot;.  According to Goffman, &quot;This discrepancy, when known about or apparent, spoils his social identity; it has the effect of cutting him off from society and from himself so that he stands a discredited person facing an unaccepting world&quot;.

Thus, inhabiting an identity associated with stigma may be particularly dangerous and harmful. According to Link and Phelan, Roschelle and Kaufman, and Marvasti, it may lead to loss of opportunities due to status loss and discrimination, alienation and marginalization, harassment and embarrassment, and social rejection. These can be a persistent source of psychological issues.

To resist, manage, and avoid stigma and its associated consequences, individuals might choose to pass as a non-stigmatized identity. According to Nathan Shippee, &quot;Passing communicates a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; self, one that does not apparently possess the stigma.&quot; According to Patrick Kermit, &quot;To be suspected of being &quot;not quite human&quot; is the essence of stigmatisation, and passing is a desperate means to the end of appearing fully human in the sense of being like most other people.&quot;

When making the decision of whether to pass or not, there are many factors stigmatized actors may consider. Firstly, there is the notion of visibility. How visible their stigma is may problematize how much ease or difficulty they may face in attempting to pass. However, how visible their stigma is may also determine the intensity and frequency of adversity they may face from others as a result of their stigma. Goffman explains, &quot;Traditionally, the question of passing has raised the issue of the &quot;visibility&quot; of a particular stigma, that is, how well or how badly-the stigma is adapted to provide means of communicating that the individual possesses it.&quot; Other scholars further emphasize the cruciality of visibility and conclude that &quot;whether a stigma is evident to the audience can mark the difference between being discredited or merely discredit&quot;able&quot;.&quot;

Other factors may include risk, context, and intimacy. Different contexts and situations may make passing more easy or difficult and/or more safe or risky. How well others know the passer may impede their abilities as well. One scholar explains, &quot;Individuals may pass in some situations but not others, effectively creating different arenas of life (depending on whether the stigma is known or not). Goffman claimed that actors develop theories about which situations are risky for disclosure, but risk is only one factor: intimacy with the audience can lead actors to disclose, or to feel guilty for not doing so.&quot; In addition to guilt, since passing can sometimes involve the fabrication of a false personal history to aid in concealment of their stigma, passing can complicate personal relationships and cause feelings of shame at having to be dishonest about their identity.
According to Goffman, &quot;It can be assumed that the possession of a discreditable secret failing takes on a deeper meaning when the persons to whom the individual has not yet revealed himself are not strangers to him but friends. Discovery prejudices not only the current social situation, but established relationships as well; not only the current image others present have of him, but also the one they will have in the future; not only appearances, but also reputation.&quot; Relating to this experience of passing, actors may have an ambivalent attachment to their stigma that can cause them to fluctuate between acceptance and rejection of their stigmatized identity. Thus, there may be times when the stigmatized individual will feel more inclined to pass and others when they feel less inclined.

Despite the potentially-distressing and dangerous parts of passing, some passers have expressed a habituation with it. In one study, Shippee accounts that &quot;participants often portrayed it as a normal or mundane event.&quot; For those whose stigma invites particularly hostile responses from most of society, passing may become a regular part of everyday life that is necessary to survive in that society.

Regardless, the stigma that passers are subject to is not inherent. As Goffman explains, stigma exists not within the person but between an attribute and an audience. As a result, stigma is socially constructed and differs based on the cultural beliefs, social structures, and situational dynamics of various contexts. Thus, passing is also immersed in different contexts of the socially-structured meaning and behavior of daily life and passing implies familiarity with that knowledge.

Passing has been interpreted in sociology and cultural studies through different analytical lenses such as that of information management by Goffman and that of as cultural performance by Bryant Keith Alexander.

=== Passing as information management ===
Goffman defines passing as &#x27;the management of undisclosed discrediting information about self.&quot; Similarly, other scholars add that &quot;Passing is mostly associated with strategies of information management that the discreditable use to pass for normal [in everyday life]&quot;. Whereas some individuals&#x27; stigma is immediately apparent, passers deal with different problems in that their stigma is not always so obvious. Goffman elaborates &quot;The issue is not that of managing tension generated during social contacts, but rather that of managing information about his failing. To display or not to display; to tell or not to tell; to let on or not to let on; to lie or not to lie; and in each case, to whom, how, when, and where.&quot;

In Goffman&#x27;s understanding, individuals possess various symbols that convey social information about us. There are prestige symbols that convey creditable information and there are stigma symbols that convey discrediting information. By managing the visibility and apparentness of their stigma symbols, passers prevent others from learning of their discredited and stigmatized status and remain discreditable. Passing may also include the adoption of certain prestige symbols and personal history or biography of social information that aids to conceal and draw attention away from their actual stigmatized status.

Goffman also briefly notes, &quot;The concealment of creditable facts-reverse passing-of course occurs.&quot; Reverse passing, related to terms like &quot;blackfishing&quot;, has emerged as a topic of discourse as critics raise concerns over cultural appropriation and accuse nonstigmatized individuals, such as prominent celebrities Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande, of concealing creditable information about themselves for some social benefit. Notions of cultural appropriation, racial fetishization, and reverse passing entered public debate particularly in 2015, after a former college instructor and president of the Spokane, Washington, NAACP, Rachel Dolezal, was discovered to be white with no black racial heritage after she had presented herself as black for several years. As many point out, reverse passing crucially differs from passing in that individuals who reverse pass are not stigmatized and therefore are not subject to the harms of stigma that may force stigmatized individuals to pass.

=== Passing as cultural performance ===
Bryant Keith Alexander, a professor of Communication, Performance and Cultural Studies at Loyola Marymount University, defines cultural performance as &quot;a process of delineation using performative practices to mark membership and association.&quot; Using this definition, passing is reframed as a method to maintain cultural performance and choose both consciously and unconsciously to participate in other performances. Rather than through the management of symbols and the social information they convey, passers assume &quot;the necessary and performative strategies that signal membership.&quot; Alexander reiterates, &quot;Cultural membership is thus maintained primarily through recognizable performative practices.&quot; Hence, to successfully pass is to have your cultural performance assessed and validated by others.

With that interpretation, avoiding stigma by passing necessitates intimate understanding and awareness of social constructions of meaning and expected behaviors that signal membership. Shippee explains that &quot;far from merely appraising situations to determine when concealment is required, passing encompasses active interpretations of several aspects of social life. It requires an understanding of cultural conventions, namely: what is considered &quot;normal&quot; and what is required to maintain it; customs of everyday interaction; and the symbolic character of the stigma itself... Passing, then, embodies a creative mobilization of situational and cultural awareness, structural considerations, self-appraisals, and sense-making&quot;. Alexander recognizes that and then asserts that &quot;passing is a product (an assessed state), a process (an active engagement), performative (ritualized repetition of communicative acts), and a reflection of one&#x27;s positionality (politicized location), knowing that its existential accomplishment always resides in liminality.&quot;

==Ethnicity and race==


Historically and genealogically, the term passing has referred to mixed-race, or biracial Americans identifying as or being perceived as belonging to a different racial group. In &quot;Passing and the Fictions of Identity&quot;, Elaine Ginsberg cites an ad for escaped slave Edmund Kenney as an example of racial passing; Edmund Kenney, a biracial person, was able to pass as white in the United States in the 1800s. In the entry &quot;Passing&quot; for the GLBTQ Encyclopedia Project, Tina Gianoulis states that &quot;for light-skinned African Americans during the times of slavery and the intense periods of racial resegregation that followed, passing for white was a survival tool that allowed them to gain education and employment that would have been denied them had they been recognized as &quot;colored&quot; people.&quot; The term passing has since been expanded to include other ethnicities and identity categories. Discriminated groups in North America and Europe may modify their accents, word choices, manner of dress, grooming habits, and even names in an attempt to appear to be members of a majority group or of a privileged minority group.

Nella Larsen&#x27;s 1929 novella, &quot;Passing&quot;, helped to establish the term after several years of prior use. The writer and subject of the novella is a mixed African-American/Caucasian who passes for white. The novella was written during the Harlem Renaissance, when passing was commonly found in both reality and fiction. Since the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, racial pride has decreased the weight that is given to passing as an important issue for black Americans. Still, it is possible and common for biracial people to pass based on appearance or by hiding or omitting their backgrounds.

In &quot;Adjusting the Borders: Bisexual Passing and Queer Theory,&quot; Lingel discusses bell hooks&#x27; notion of racial passing in conjunction with discussion of bisexual engagement in passing.

Romani people have a history of passing as well, particularly in the United States and often tell outsiders that they belong to other ethnicities such as Latino, Greek, Middle Eastern, or Native American.

==Social class and caste==
Class passing, similar to racial and gender passing, is the concealment or misrepresentation of one&#x27;s social class. In &quot;Class-Passing: Social Mobility in Film and Popular Culture&quot;, Gwendolyn Audrey Foster suggests that racial and gender passing is often stigmatized but that class passing is generally accepted as normative behavior. Class passing is common in the United States and is linked to the notions of the American Dream and of upward class mobility.

===Popular culture===
English-language novels that feature class passing include &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, and Horatio Alger novels. Films featuring class-passing characters include &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, &quot;Pinky&quot;, &quot;ATL&quot;, and &quot;Andy Hardy Meets Debutante&quot;. Class passing also figures into reality television programs such as &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; in which contestants are often immersed in displays of great material wealth or may have to conceal their class status.

==Sexuality and gender==

The perception of an individual&#x27;s sexual orientation is often based on their visual identity. The term visual identity refers to the expression of personal, social, and cultural identities through dress and appearance. In &quot;Visible Lesbians and Invisible Bisexuals: Appearance and Visual Identities Among Bisexual Women&quot; it is proposed that through the expression of a visual identity, others &quot;read&quot; a person&#x27;s appearance and make assumptions about their wider identity. Therefore, visual identity is a prominent tool of non-verbal communication. The concept of passing is showcased in research by Jennifer Taub in her &quot;Bisexual Women and Beauty Norms.&quot; Some participants in the study stated that they attempted to dress as what they perceived as heterosexual when they partnered with a man, and others stated that they tried to dress more like a &quot;lesbian.&quot; That exemplifies how visual identities can greatly alter people&#x27;s immediate assumptions of sexuality. Therefore, presenting oneself as &quot;heterosexual&quot; is effectively &quot;passing.&quot;

Passing by sexual orientation occurs when an individual&#x27;s perceived sexual orientation or sexuality differs from the sexuality or sexual orientation with which they identify. In the entry &quot;Passing&quot; for the GLBTQ Encyclopedia Project, Tina Gianoulis notes &quot;the presumption of heterosexuality in most modern cultures,&quot; which in some parts of the world, such as the United States, may be effectively compulsory, &quot;most gay men and lesbians in fact spend a great deal of their lives passing as straight even when they do not do so intentionally.&quot; The phrase &quot;in the closet&quot; may be used to describe individual who hide or conceal their sexual orientation. In &quot;Passing: Identity and Interpretation in Sexuality, Race, and Religion&quot;, Maria Sanchez and Linda Schlossberg state that &quot;the dominant social order often implores gay people to stay in the closet (to pass).&quot; Individuals may choose to remain &quot;in the closet&quot; or to pass as heterosexual for a variety of reasons, including a desire to maintain positive relationships with family and policies or requirements associated with employment such as &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;, a policy that required passing as heterosexual within the military or armed forces.

Bisexual erasure causes some bisexual individuals to feel the need to engage in passing within presumed predominantly-heterosexual circles and even within LGBTQ circles for fear of stigma. In &quot;Adjusting the Borders: Bisexual Passing and Queer Theory&quot;, Jessica Lingel notes, &quot;The ramifications of being denied a public sphere in which to practice a sexual identity that isn&#x27;t labeled licentious or opportunistic leads some women to resort to manufacturing profiles of gayness or straightness to pledge membership within a community.&quot;

Gender passing refers to individuals who are perceived as belonging to a gender identity group that differs from the gender with which they were assigned at birth. In &quot;Passing and the Fictions of Identity&quot;, Elaine Ginsberg provides the story of Brandon Teena, who was assigned female at birth but lived as a man, as an example of gender passing in the United States. In 1993, Brandon moved to Falls City, Nebraska, where he initially passed as a man. However, community members discovered that Brandon had been assigned female at birth, and two men in it shot and murdered him. Ginsberg cites for another example of gender passing Billy Tipton, a jazz musician who was also assigned female at birth but lived and performed as a man until his death in 1989.

Within the transgender community, passing refers to the perception or recognition of trans individuals as belonging to the gender identity to which they are transitioning rather than the sex or gender they were assigned at birth.

==Religion==

Passing as a member of a different religion or as not religious at all is not uncommon among minority religious communities. In the entry &quot;Passing&quot; for the GLBTQ Encyclopedia Project, Tina Gianoulis states &quot;at times of rabid anti-Semitism in Europe and the Americas, many Jewish families also either converted to Christianity or passed as Christian&quot; for the sake of survival. Circumcised Jewish males in Germany during World War II attempted to restore their foreskins as part of passing as Gentile. The film &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; explores that theme.

Shia Islam has the doctrine of &quot;taqiyya&quot; in which one is lawfully allowed to disavow Islam and profess another faith but secretly remain a Muslim if one&#x27;s life is at risk. The concept has also been practised by various minority faiths in the Middle East such as the Alawites and Druze.

== Ability or disability ==
Disability passing may refer to the intentional concealment of impairment to avoid the stigma of disability, but it may also describe the exaggeration of an ailment or impairment to receive some benefit, which may take the form of attention or care. In &quot;Disability and Passing: Blurring the Lines of Identity&quot;, Jeffrey Brune and Daniel Wilson define passing by ability or disability as &quot;the ways that others impose, intentionally or not, a specific disability or non-disability identity on a person.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;Compulsory Able-Bodiedness and Queer/Disabled Existence,&quot; Robert McRuer argues that &quot;the system of compulsory able-bodiedness...produces disability.&quot;

=== Passing as disabled ===
People with disabilities may exaggerate their disabilities when they are evaluated for medical care or accommodations often for fear of being denied support. &quot;There are too many agencies out there with the ostensible purpose of helping us that still believe that as long as we technically can do something, like crab-walking our way into a subway station, we should have to do it,&quot; writes Gabe Moses, a wheelchair user who has a limited ability to walk. Those pressures may result in disabled people exaggerating symptoms or tiring out their body before an evaluation so that they are seen on a &quot;bad day,&quot; instead of a &quot;good day.&quot;

In sports, some mobility impaired individuals have been observed strategically exaggerating the extent of their disability to pass as more disabled than they are and be placed in divisions in which they may be more competitive. In quadriplegic rugby, or wheelchair rugby, some players are described as having &quot;incomplete&quot; quadriplegia in which they may retain some sensation and function in their lower limbs that may allow them to stand and walk in limited capacities. Based on a rule from the United States Quad Rugby Association (USQRA) that states that players need only a combination of upper- and lower-extremity impairment that precludes them from playing able-bodied sports, the incomplete quads may play alongside other quadriplegics who have no sensation or function in their lower limbs. That is justified by classifications the USQRA has developed in which certified physical therapists compare arm and muscle flexibility, trunk and torso movement, and ease of chair operation between players and rank them by injury level.

However, inconsistencies between medical diagnoses of injury and those classifications allows players to perform higher levels of impairment for the classifiers and pass for being more disabled than they are. As a result, their ranking may underestimate their capacity and they may attain a competitive advantage over teams with players whose capacity is not equivalent. That policy has raised questions from some about the ethics and fairness of comparing disabilities, as well as about how competition, inclusion, and ability should be defined in the world of sports.

=== Passing as non-disabled ===
Individuals with invisible disabilities such as people with mental illness; intellectual or cognitive disabilities; or physical disabilities that are not immediately obvious to others such as IBS, Crohn&#x27;s disease, or ulcerative colitis may choose whether or not to reveal their identity or to pass as &quot;normal.&quot; Passing as non-disabled may protect against discrimination but may also result in lack of support or accusations of faking.

Autistic people may employ strategies known as &quot;masking&quot; or &quot;camouflaging&quot; to appear non-autistic. That can involve behavior like suppressing or redirecting repetitive movements (stimming), maintaining eye contact despite discomfort, mirroring the body language and tone of others, or scripting conversations. Masking may be done to reduce the risk of ostracism or abuse. Autistic masking is often exhausting and linked to adverse mental health outcomes such as burnout, depression, and suicide. However, that perspective has been challenged in a 2023 review of autistic masking by Valentina Petrolini, Ekaine Rodríguez-Armendariz, and Agustín Vicente who question whether all autistic people see &quot;being autistic&quot; as a central aspect of their identity and whether all autistic people are capable of truly hiding their autistic status. Both conditions, they argue, would have to be fulfilled for the analogy to hold and conclude that only a subgroup of autistic people experiences masking as passing.

Individuals with visible physical impairments or disabilities, such as people with mobility impairment, including individuals who use wheelchairs or scooters, face greater challenges in concealing their disability.

In a study on individuals&#x27; experience with prosthetics, the ability of users to be able to pass as if they were &quot;like everybody else&quot; with their prosthetic based on the realistic or unrealistic appearance of the prosthetic was one factor in predicting whether patients would accept or reject prosthetic use. Cosmetic prosthetics that were, for example, skin-colored or had the added appearance of veins, hair, and nails were often harder to adapt to and use, but many individuals expressed a preference for them over more functional and more conspicuous prosthetics to maintain their personal conceptions of social and bodily identity.

One user of prosthetics characterized her device as one that could &quot;maintain her humanness (&#x27;half way human&#x27;), which in turn prevented her, quite literally, from being seen to have an &#x27;odd&#x27; body.&quot; Users also discussed wanting prosthetics that could help them maintain a walking gait, which would attract no stares and prosthetics that could be disguised or concealed under clothes in efforts to pass as non-disabled.

== Intersectional ==
Though passing may occur on the basis of a single subordinate identity such as race, often people&#x27;s intersectional locations involve multiple marginalized identities. Intersectionality provides a framework for seeing the interconnected nature of oppressive systems and how multiple identities interact within them. Gay Asian men possess two key subordinated identities; in combination, they create unique challenges for them when passing. Sometimes, those men must pass as straight to avoid stigma, but around other gay men, they may attempt to pass as a non-racialized person or white to avoid the disinterest or fetishization often encountered upon revealing their Asian identities. By recognizing the hidden intersection of the gendered aspects of gay and Asian male stereotypes, these two distinct experiences make even more sense. Gay men are often stereotyped as effeminate and thereby insufficiently masculine as men. Stereotypes characterizing Asian men as too sexual (overly masculine) or too feminine (hypo-masculine) or even both also exhibit the gendered nature of racial stereotypes. Thus, passing as the dominant racial or sexuality category also often means passing as gender correct.

When Black transgender men transition in the workplace from identifying as female to passing as cisgender men, gendered racial stereotypes characterizing Black men as overly masculine and violent may affect how previously acceptable behaviors will be interpreted. One such Black trans man discovered that he had gone from &quot;being an obnoxious Black woman to a scary Black man&quot; and therefore had to adapt his behavior to gendered scripts to pass.

<doc id="189943" wikidata="Q338153" url="?curid=189943" title="Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby">
<text>Constantine Henry Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby, (15 May 1797 – 28 July 1863), styled Viscount Normanby between 1812 and 1831 and known as The Earl of Mulgrave between 1831 and 1838, was a British Whig politician and author. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1835 to 1839 and as Home Secretary from 1839 to 1841 and was British Ambassador to France between 1846 and 1852.

==Early life and education==
Normanby was the son of Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave and Martha Sophia, daughter of Christopher Thompson Maling. His great-grandfather William Phipps had married Lady Catherine Annesley, who was the daughter and heiress of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey and his wife Lady Catherine Darnley (an illegitimate daughter of King James II by his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester). Lady Catherine Darnley had later married John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, and hence Constantine Phipps, 2nd Earl of Mulgrave and later 1st Marquess of Normanby was the step-great-great-grandson of the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was the second President of the Cambridge Union Society.

Lt.-Gen. Sir Henry Warre was his first cousin, born to his mother&#x27;s youngest sister, who married Sir William Warre.

==Political career==

After attaining his majority, he was returned on his father&#x27;s interest for Scarborough in 1818. However, in the summer of 1819, he began to break with his family&#x27;s Tory politics, and signalised his conversion to the Whigs by joining Brooks&#x27; Club on 3 December. When Parliament was dissolved in 1820, Normanby was in Florence, Italy, to which he was a regular visitor. His brother Charles kept up the family interest with the Scarborough corporation, and Normanby was returned in absentia in March, despite being politically at odds with his father. This state of affairs was not to last long: in May, Normanby was compelled to take the Chiltern Hundreds by Lord Mulgrave, to vacate the seat for Mulgrave&#x27;s brother Edmund.

His standing as a former Tory minister&#x27;s son made Normanby valuable to the Whigs, and they hoped to return him to Parliament in another seat. An attempt was made to have him put in at St Ives at a by-election in 1821, but support proved to be lacking, and Normanby withdrew without contesting the seat. The illness and death of William Plumer in the beginning of 1822 allowed him to take his seat in February for Higham Ferrers, a pocket borough of the Whig grandee Earl Fitzwilliam. He made a considerable reputation by political pamphlets and by his speeches in the house. He was returned for Malton at the general election of 1826, another one of Fitzwilliam&#x27;s boroughs. He was already known as a writer of romantic tales, &quot;The English in Italy&quot; (1825); in the same year he made his appearance as a novelist with &quot;Matilda&quot;, and in 1828 he produced another novel, &quot;Yes and No&quot;. He declined to be nominated again for Malton in 1830, anticipating the imminent death of his father, and was thus out of Parliament when Lord Grey formed a government in November 1830. Normanby hoped for employment by the foreign office, but none was forthcoming. Through Lord Durham, Normanby solicited a writ in acceleration from Grey in early 1831, which would have brought him up to the House of Lords before his father&#x27;s death; but Normanby succeeded to the Earldom of Mulgrave on his father&#x27;s death in April, rendering it moot.

In 1832, Mulgrave was sent out as Governor of Jamaica and was afterwards appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1835–1839). On his visit to Wexford in 1836 he heard a Congratulatory Address in the ancient Forth and Bargy dialect, then already on the point of becoming extinct. He was created Marquess of Normanby on 25 June 1838, and held successively the offices of colonial secretary and home secretary in the last years of Lord Melbourne&#x27;s ministry. While Colonial Secretary, he wrote a letter of instructions to William Hobson, in which the government&#x27;s policy for the sovereignty of New Zealand was set out.

==Diplomatic career==
From 1846 to 1852 he was ambassador at Paris, and from 1854 to 1858 minister at Florence. The publication in 1857 of a journal kept in Paris during the stormy times of 1848 (&quot;A Year of Revolution&quot;), brought him into violent controversy with Louis Blanc, and he came into conflict with Lord Palmerston and William Ewart Gladstone, after his retirement from the public service, on questions of French and Italian policy.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Normanby married Maria Liddell (1798–1882), daughter of Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth, in 1818. They had one son:

* George Augustus Constantine Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby (23 Jul 1819 - 3 April 1890)

==Death==
Normanby died in London on 28 July 1863, aged 66, and was succeeded in his titles by his son George. The Marchioness of Normanby died in October 1882, aged 84.

<doc id="189944" wikidata="Q3525622" url="?curid=189944" title="Thomas Tyrwhitt">
<text>Thomas Tyrwhitt (; 27 March 173015 August 1786) was an English writer, classical scholar, and critic. He was best known for his edition of The Canterbury Tales in which he modernized the language and provided extensive notes as well as a glossary.

==Early life and education==
He was born in London, where he also died. He was educated at Eton College and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He was elected a fellow of Merton College, Oxford in 1755. In 1756, he was appointed under-secretary at war, in 1762 clerk of the House of Commons. In 1768, he resigned his post, and spent the remainder of his life in learned retirement. In February 1771, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1784, he was elected a trustee of the British Museum, to which he bequeathed a portion of his valuable library.

==Works==
His principal classical works are:
*&quot;Fragmenta Plutarchi II. inedita&quot; (1773), from a Harleian manuscript
*&quot;Dissertatio de Babrio&quot; (1776), containing some fables of Aesop, hitherto unedited, from a Bodleian manuscript
*the pseudo-Orphic &quot;De lapidibus&quot; (1781), which he assigned to the age of Constantius
*&quot;Conjecturae in Strabonem&quot; (1783)
*&quot;Isaeus De Meneclis hereditate&quot; (1785)
*Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetica&quot;, his most important work, published after his death under the superintendence of Thomas Burgess, bishop of Salisbury, in 1794.

Special mention is due of his editions of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (1775–1778); and of &quot;Poems&quot;, supposed to have been written at Bristol by &quot;Thomas Rowley&quot; and others in the 15th century (1777–1778), with an appendix to prove that the poems were all the work of Thomas Chatterton. Tyrwhitt&#x27;s bibliophile friend Thomas Crofts is credited with introducing Tyrwhitt in 1776 to George Catcott, the owner of the &quot;manuscripts&quot; of the poems. Initially Tyrwhitt was convinced that they were authentic, and pressed for publication in 1777. It was only when the third edition was published that Tyrwhitt changed his mind and pronounced the poems forgeries.

In 1782, he published a &quot;Vindication&quot; of the Appendix in reply to the arguments that they were authentic. While clerk of the House of Commons he edited &quot;Proceedings and Debates of the House of Commons, 1620–1621&quot; from the original manuscript in the library of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and Henry Elsynge&#x27;s &quot;The Manner of Holding Parliaments in England&quot; (1768).

<doc id="189945" wikidata="Q1328905" url="?curid=189945" title="USS Nevada (BB-36)">
<text>USS &quot;Nevada&quot; (BB-36), the third United States Navy ship to be named after the 36th state, was the lead ship of the two s. Launched in 1914, &quot;Nevada&quot; was a leap forward in dreadnought technology; four of her new features would be included on almost every subsequent US battleship: triple gun turrets, oil in place of coal for fuel, geared steam turbines for greater range, and the &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor principle. These features made &quot;Nevada&quot;, alongside her sister ship , the first US Navy &quot;standard-type&quot; battleships.

&quot;Nevada&quot; served in both World Wars. During the last few months of World War I, &quot;Nevada&quot; was based in Bantry Bay, Ireland, to protect supply convoys that were sailing to and from Great Britain. In World War II, she was one of the battleships trapped when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. &quot;Nevada&quot; was the only battleship to get underway during the attack, making the ship &quot;the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal and depressing morning&quot; for the United States. Still, the ship was hit by one torpedo and at least six bombs while steaming away from Battleship Row, forcing the crew to beach the stricken ship on a coral ledge. The ship continued to flood and eventually slid off the ledge and sank to the harbor floor. &quot;Nevada&quot; was subsequently salvaged and modernized at Puget Sound Navy Yard, allowing her to serve as a convoy escort in the Atlantic and as a fire-support ship in five amphibious assaults (the invasions of Attu, Normandy, Southern France, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa).

At the end of World War II, the Navy decided that, due to age, &quot;Nevada&quot; would not be retained as part of the active fleet and she was instead assigned as a target ship for the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the blast from atomic bomb Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, &quot;Nevada&quot; was decommissioned on 29 August 1946, and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948, in Operation Crossroads.

== Design ==


As the first second-generation battleship in the US Navy, &quot;Nevada&quot; has been described as &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;as radical as was in her day&quot; by present-day historians. At the time of the ship&#x27;s completion in 1916, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that the new warship was &quot;the greatest [battleship] afloat&quot; because she was so much larger than other contemporary American battleships: her displacement was nearly three times that of the obsolete 1890 pre-dreadnought , almost twice that of the 1904 battleship , and almost greater than that of one of the first American dreadnoughts, —built just seven years prior to &quot;Nevada&quot;.

&quot;Nevada&quot; was the first battleship in the US Navy to have triple gun turrets, a single funnel, and an oil-fired steam power plant. In particular, the use of the more-efficient oil gave the ship an advantage over earlier coal-fired plants. &quot;Nevada&quot; was also the first US battleship with geared turbines, which also helped increase fuel economy and thus range compared to earlier direct drive turbines. The ability to steam great distances without refueling was a major concern of the General Board at that time. In 1903, the Board felt all American battleships should have a minimum steaming radius of so that the US could enforce the Monroe Doctrine. One of the main purposes of the Great White Fleet, which sailed around the world in 1907–1908, was to prove to Japan that the US Navy could &quot;carry any naval conflict into Japanese home waters&quot;. Possibly as a result of this, battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to &quot;steam 8,000 miles at cruising speeds&quot;; given the distance between San Pedro, where the fleet would be based, and Manila, where the Fleet was expected to have to fight under War Plan Orange, was , endurance was obviously a major concern for the U.S. Navy. Also, oil allowed for the boiler-room crew to be reduced—the engineer on &quot;Delaware&quot; estimated that 100 firemen (stokers) and 112 coal passers could be adequately replaced by just 24 men, which would allow some crew&#x27;s quarters to be eliminated; this would save weight and also reduce the amount of fresh water and provisions that the ship would have to carry.

In addition to all of this, &quot;Nevada&quot; had maximum armor over critical areas, such as the magazines and engines, and none over less important places, even though previous battleships had armor of varying thickness depending on the importance of the area it was protecting. This radical change became known as the &quot;all or nothing&quot; principle, which most major navies later adopted for their own battleships. With this new armor scheme, the armor on the battleship was increased to 41.1% of the displacement.

As a result of all of these design modifications from previous battleships, &quot;Nevada&quot; was the first of the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Standard&quot; type battleships. &quot;Standards&quot; were characterized by the use of oil fuel, the &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor scheme, and the arrangement of the main armament in four triple or twin turrets without any turrets located in the middle of the ship. The Navy was to create a fleet of modern battleships similar in long-range gunnery, speed, turning radius, and protection. &quot;Nevada&quot; was followed by 11 other battleships of this type, although significant improvements were made in subsequent designs as naval technology rapidly progressed. An additional seven standard type battleships ( and the six of the ) were never completed due to the Washington Naval Treaty.

The two battleships of the &quot;Nevada&quot; class were virtually identical except in their propulsion. &quot;Nevada&quot; and her sister were fitted with different engines to compare the two, putting them &#x27;head-to-head&#x27;: &quot;Oklahoma&quot; received older vertical triple expansion engines, which had proven more fuel-efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships, while &quot;Nevada&quot; received geared Curtis steam turbines.

== Construction and trials ==
&quot;Nevada&quot;″s construction was authorized by an Act of Congress on 4 March 1911. The contract went to Fore River Shipbuilding Company on 22 January 1912, for a total of $5,895,000 (not including the armor and armament), and the time of construction was originally to be 36 months. A secondary contract was signed on 31 July 1912, for $50,000 to cover the additional cost of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft; this also extended the planned construction time by five months. Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1912, and by 12 August 1914, the ship was 72.4% complete. &quot;Nevada&quot; was launched on 11 July 1914; she was sponsored by Miss Eleanor Anne Seibert, niece of Governor Tasker Oddie of Nevada and a descendant of the first Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert. The launch was attended by several prominent members of the government, including Governor Oddie, Governor David I. Walsh of Massachusetts, Senator Key Pittman of Nevada, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would later become the 32nd President of the United States.

&quot;Nevada&quot; then had to undergo many different tests and trials prior to her commissioning to ensure that she met the terms of the original contract. These began on 4 November 1915, when the ship conducted a twelve-hour endurance run &quot;up and down the New England coast&quot;, reaching a top speed of . Though her &quot;acceptance trials&quot; were interrupted on 5 November, because of a gale and rough seas, they were continued on the 6th with a test of her fuel economy; this consisted of a 24-hour run where &quot;Nevada&quot; steamed at . The test results were positive: the oil consumption of the battlewagon was 6 lb per knot lower than the contract had demanded. Another test was conducted for 12 hours at , with an even better result of 10 lb per knot lower than the contract specifications. After completing all of these tests and running trials off Rockland, Maine, &quot;Nevada&quot; sailed to the Boston and New York Navy Yards for equipment, torpedo tubes, and ammunition hoists. When all of the preliminaries were completed, &quot;Nevada&quot; was commissioned on 11 March 1916, at the Charlestown Navy Yard, and William S. Sims was the first captain of the new ship, followed by Joseph Strauss on 30 December 1916.

== World War I ==
After fitting out in the Boston and New York Navy Yards, &quot;Nevada&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet in Newport, Rhode Island on 26 May 1916. Prior to the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, she conducted many training cruises and underwent many exercises out of her base in Norfolk, Virginia, sailing as far south as the Caribbean on these cruises. The US entered the war in April 1917, but &quot;Nevada&quot; was not sent to the other side of the Atlantic because of a shortage of fuel oil in Britain. Instead, four coal-fired battleships of Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9) (, , , and ) departed the US to join the British Grand Fleet on 25 November 1917. They arrived on 7 December and were designated as the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. joined them after damage from a grounding on Block Island was repaired; she departed on 30 January, and arrived in Scotland on 11 February. It was not until 13 August 1918, that &quot;Nevada&quot;, then under command of Andrew T. Long , left the US for Britain, becoming the last American ship to join the Fleet overseas.

After a 10-day voyage, she arrived in Berehaven, Ireland, on 23 August. Along with and her sister , the three were nicknamed the &quot;Bantry Bay Squadron&quot;; officially, they were Battleship Division Six (BatDiv 6) under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers, who chose &quot;Utah&quot; as his flagship. For the rest of the war, the three ships operated from the bay, escorting the large and valuable convoys bound for the British Isles to ensure no German heavy surface ships could slip past the British Grand Fleet and annihilate the merchant ships and their weak escorts of older cruisers. This never came to pass, and the war ended on 11 November, with &quot;Nevada&quot;, then under command of William Carey Cole , not getting a chance to engage an enemy during the war.

On 13 December 10 battleships, including &quot;Nevada&quot;, and 28 destroyers escorted the ocean liner , with president Woodrow Wilson embarked, into Brest, France, during the last day of Wilson&#x27;s journey to the country so he could attend the Paris Peace Conference. The flotilla met &quot;George Washington&quot; and her escorts (&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and four destroyers) just off Brest and escorted them into the port. The 10 battleships sailed for home at 14:00 on the next day, 14 December. They took less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic, and arrived in New York on 26 December to parades and celebrations.

== Interwar period ==
Between the two World Wars, &quot;Nevada&quot;, under the successive commands of Thomas P. Magruder , followed by William Dugald MacDougall , served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Though she had originally been equipped with 21 five-inch (127 mm)/51 cal guns to defend against enemy destroyers, this number was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine.

&quot;Nevada&quot;, then under command of Luke McNamee , and with the battleship , represented the United States at the Peruvian Centennial Exposition in July 1921. A year later, with Douglas E. Dismukes in command, and in company with this time, &quot;Nevada&quot; returned to South America as an escort to the steamer &quot;Pan America&quot; with Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes embarked; they all attended the Centennial of Brazilian Independence in Rio de Janeiro, celebrated from 5 to 11 September 1922. The &quot;New York Times&quot; later credited the crew of &quot;Nevada&quot; for bringing baseball and that sport&#x27;s unique terminology to Brazil, allowing the country to &quot;make the Yankee game an institution of their own&quot;. At the end of 1922, John M. Luby assumed command. Three years later, then under command of David W. Todd , &quot;Nevada&quot; took part in the US Fleet&#x27;s &quot;goodwill cruise&quot; to Australia and New Zealand, from July–September 1925. During this cruise, the ships had only limited replenishment opportunities, but they still made it to Australia and back without undue difficulty. This demonstrated to those allies and Japan that the US Navy had the ability to conduct transpacific operations and meet the Imperial Japanese Navy in their home waters, where both Japanese and American war plans expected the &quot;decisive battle&quot; to be fought, if it should come.
After the cruise, &quot;Nevada&quot;, with Clarence S. Kempff commanding, put into Norfolk Navy Yard to be modernized between August 1927 and January 1930. Hilary H. Royall took over command during this period. Work on the ship included exchange of her &quot;basket&quot; masts for tripod masts and her steam turbines for those from the recently stricken battleship . These were geared turbines that had been retrofitted to &quot;North Dakota&quot; in 1917, replacing her original direct drive turbines to increase her range. Additionally, many different adaptations and additions were made: her main guns&#x27; elevation was increased to 30° (which upped the range of the guns from to ), anti-torpedo bulges were added, her 12 original Yarrow boilers were replaced with 6 more efficient Bureau Express boilers in a new arrangement to accommodate those bulges, two catapults were added for three Vought O2U-3 Corsair biplane spotter aircraft, eight /25 cal AA guns were added, a new superstructure was installed, and her 5-inch (127 mm) 51 cal secondary battery was relocated above the hull in an arrangement similar to that of the . &quot;Nevada&quot; then served in the Pacific Fleet for the next eleven years. During this time, she was commanded by John J. Hyland , William S. Pye , Adolphus Staton , Robert L. Ghormley , Claude B. Mayo ,
Robert Alfred Theobald and Francis W. Rockwell.

== World War II ==
=== Attack on Pearl Harbor ===
On 6 December 1941, a Saturday, all of the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s battleships were in port for the weekend for the first time since 4 July. Normally, they took turns spending time in port: six would be out with Vice Admiral William S. Pye&#x27;s battleship Task Force One one weekend, while the next weekend would find three ranging with Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr.&#x27;s aircraft carrier task force. However, because Halsey could not afford to take the slow battleships with his fast carriers on his dash to reinforce Wake Island&#x27;s Marine detachment with fighters and because it was Pye&#x27;s turn to rest in port and the harbor was where it was considered safe, none of the battleships were sailing on that morning. When the sun rose over &quot;Nevada&quot; on the 7th, the ship&#x27;s band was playing &quot;Morning Colors&quot;; but planes then appeared on the horizon and the attack on Pearl Harbor began.

Aft of &quot;Arizona&quot; during the attack, &quot;Nevada&quot; was not moored alongside another battleship off Ford Island, and therefore was able to maneuver, unlike the other seven battleships present. Commanding officer Francis W. Scanland , was ashore when the attack began. The Officer of the Deck, Ensign Joe Taussig (son of the admiral of the same name), had earlier that morning ordered a second boiler lit off, planning to switch the power load from one boiler to the other around 0800. As &quot;Nevada&#x27;s&quot; gunners opened fire and her engineers started to raise steam, a single Type 91 Mod 2 torpedo exploded against Frame 41 about above the keel at 0810. Seconds later, the same Kate torpedo bomber that dropped the torpedo was shot down by &quot;Nevada&quot;″s gunners. The torpedo bulkhead held, but leaking through joints caused flooding of port side compartments below the first platform deck between frames 30 and 43 and a list of 4–5°. Her damage control crew corrected the list by counter-flooding and &quot;Nevada&quot; got underway at 0840, her gunners already having shot down four planes. Ensign Taussig&#x27;s efficiency paid off, likely saving his ship, but he lost a leg in the attack.

&quot;Nevada&quot; became a prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers during the second wave. Japanese pilots intended to sink her in the channel, ostensibly to block the harbor. This was poor target selection on the part of the pilots; she could not be sunk by 14–18 dive bombers attacking with 250 kg bombs and the channel&#x27;s width of 1200 feet made bottling up the harbor impossible. As she steamed past Ten-Ten Dock at about 09:50, &quot;Nevada&quot; was struck by five bombs. One exploded over the crew&#x27;s galley at Frame 80. Another struck the port director platform and exploded at the base of the stack on the upper deck. Yet another hit near No. 1 turret inboard from the port waterway and blew large holes in the upper and main decks. Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15; one passed out through the side of the second deck before exploding, but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship.

The gasoline fires that flared up around Turret 1 might have caused more critical damage if the main magazines had not been empty. For several days prior to the attack, all of the 14-inch-gun (356 mm) battleships had been replacing their standard-weight main battery projectiles with a new heavier projectile that offered greater penetration and a larger explosive charge in exchange for a slight decrease in range. All of the older projectiles and powder charges had been removed from the magazines of &quot;Nevada&quot;, and the crew had taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new powder charges on Sunday.
As bomb damage became evident, &quot;Nevada&quot; was ordered to proceed to the west side of Ford Island to prevent her from sinking in deeper water. Instead, she was grounded off Hospital Point at 10:30, with the help of and , though she managed to force down three more planes before she struck the shore. Gasoline fires prevented damage control parties from containing flooding forward of the main torpedo defense system. Flooding the main magazine and counterflooding to keep the ship stable lowered the bow allowing water to enter the ship at the second deck level. Lack of watertight subdivision between the second and main decks from frame 30 to frame 115 allowed water entering through bomb holes in the forecastle to flow aft through the ship&#x27;s ventilation system to flood the dynamo and boiler rooms.

Over the course of the morning, &quot;Nevada&quot; suffered a total of 60 killed and 109 wounded. Two more men died aboard during salvage operations on 7 February 1942, when they were overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas from decomposing paper and meat. The ship suffered a minimum of six bomb hits and one torpedo hit, but &quot;it is possible that as many as ten bomb hits may have been received, [...] as certain damaged areas [were] of sufficient size to indicate that they were struck by more than one bomb.&quot;

=== Attu ===
On 12 February 1942, now with Captain Harry L. Thompson commanding, &quot;Nevada&quot; was refloated and underwent temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so she could get to Puget Sound Navy Yard for major repairs and modernization. Then under command of Captain Howard F. Kingman , the overhaul was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship&#x27;s appearance so she slightly resembled a &quot;South Dakota&quot; from a distance.

Her 5&quot;/51s and 5&quot;/25s were replaced with sixteen 5&quot;/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts. &quot;Nevada&quot;, with Captain Willard A. Kitts commanding, then sailed for Alaska, where she provided fire support from 11 to 18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu. &quot;Nevada&quot; then departed for Norfolk Navy Yard in June for further modernization.

=== D-Day ===
After completion, in mid-1943 &quot;Nevada&quot; went on Atlantic convoy duty. Old battleships such as &quot;Nevada&quot; were attached to many convoys across the Atlantic to guard against the chance that a German capital ship might head out to sea on a raiding mission.

After completing more convoy runs, &quot;Nevada&quot; set sail for the United Kingdom to prepare for the Normandy Invasion, arriving in April 1944, with Captain Powell M. Rhea in command. Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus).

She was chosen as Rear Admiral Morton Deyo&#x27;s flagship for the operation. During the invasion, &quot;Nevada&quot; supported forces ashore from 6–17 June, and again on 25 June; during this time, she employed her guns against shore defenses on the Cherbourg Peninsula, &quot;[seeming] to lean back as [she] hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries.&quot; Shells from her guns ranged as far as inland in attempts to break up German concentrations and counterattacks, even though she was straddled by counterbattery fire 27 times (though never hit).

&quot;Nevada&quot; was later praised for her &quot;incredibly accurate&quot; fire in support of beleaguered troops, as some of the targets she hit were just from the front line. &quot;Nevada&quot; was the only battleship present at both Pearl Harbor and the Normandy landings.

=== Southern France ===
After D-Day, the Allies headed to Toulon for another amphibious assault, codenamed Operation Dragoon. To support this, many ships were sent from the beaches of Normandy to the Mediterranean, including five battleships (the United States&#x27; &quot;Nevada&quot;, , , the British , and the Free French ), three US heavy cruisers (, and ), and many destroyers and landing craft were transferred south.

&quot;Nevada&quot; supported this operation from 15 August – 25 September 1944, &quot;dueling&quot; with &quot;Big Willie&quot;: a heavily reinforced fortress with four 340 mm (13.4 in) guns in two twin turrets. These guns had been salvaged from the French battleship &quot;Provence&quot; after the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon; the guns had a range of nearly 19 nautical miles (35 km) and they commanded every approach to the port of Toulon. In addition, they were fortified with heavy armor plate embedded into the rocky sides of the island of Saint Mandrier. Due to these dangers, the fire-support ships assigned to the operation were ordered to level the fortress. Beginning on 19 August, and continuing on subsequent days, one or more heavy warships bombarded it in conjunction with low-level bomber strikes. On the 23rd, a bombardment force headed by &quot;Nevada&quot; struck the &quot;most damaging&quot; blow to the fort during a 6½ hour battle, which saw 354 salvos fired by &quot;Nevada&quot;. Toulon fell on the 25th, but the fort, though it was &quot;coming apart at the seams&quot;, held out for three more days.

&quot;Nevada&quot; then headed to New York to have her gun barrels relined. In addition, the three 14&quot;/45 caliber guns (356 mm) of Turret 1 were replaced with Mark 8 guns formerly on and in the relining process at the time of Pearl Harbor; these new guns were relined to Mark 12 specifications.

=== Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Japan ===

After re-fitting, and with Captain Homer L. Grosskopf commanding, she sailed for the Pacific, arriving off Iwo Jima on 16 February 1945 to &quot;[prepare] the island for invasion with heavy bombardment&quot;; which she did through 7 March. During the invasion, she moved to be within from shore to provide maximum firepower for the troops that were advancing.

On 24 March 1945, &quot;Nevada&quot; joined Task Force 54 (TF 54), the &quot;Fire Support Force&quot;, off Okinawa as bombardment began prior to the invasion of Okinawa. The ships of TF 54 then moved into position on the night of the 23rd, beginning their bombardment missions at dawn on the 24th. Along with the rest of the force, &quot;Nevada&quot; shelled Japanese airfields, shore defenses, supply dumps, and troop concentrations. However, after the fire support ships retired for the night, dawn &quot;came up like thunder&quot; when seven &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacked the force while it was without air cover. One plane, though hit repeatedly by antiaircraft fire from the force, crashed onto the main deck of &quot;Nevada&quot;, next to turret No. 3. It killed 11 and wounded 49; it also knocked out both guns in that turret and three 20 mm anti-aircraft weapons. Another two men were lost to fire from a shore battery on 5 April. Until 30 June, she was stationed off Okinawa; she then departed to join the 3rd Fleet from 10 July to 7 August, which allowed &quot;Nevada&quot; to come within range of the Japanese home islands during the closing days of the war, though she did not bombard them.

== Post-war ==
&quot;Nevada&quot;, then with her final commanding officer, Captain Cecil C. Adell , returned to Pearl Harbor after a brief stint of occupation duty in Tokyo Bay. &quot;Nevada&quot; was surveyed and, at 32⅓ years old, was deemed too old to be kept in the post-war fleet. As a result, she was assigned to be a target ship in the first Bikini atomic experiments (Operation Crossroads) of July 1946. The experiment consisted of detonating two atomic bombs to test their effectiveness against ships. &quot;Nevada&quot; was the bombardier&#x27;s target for the first test, codenamed &#x27;Able&#x27;, which used an air-dropped weapon. To help distinguish the target from surrounding vessels, &quot;Nevada&quot; was painted a reddish-orange. However, even with the high-visibility color scheme, the bomb fell about off-target, exploding above the attack transport instead. Due in part to the miss, &quot;Nevada&quot; survived. The ship also remained afloat after the second test—&#x27;Baker&#x27;, a detonation some below the surface of the water—but was damaged and extremely radioactive from the spray. &quot;Nevada&quot; was later towed to Pearl Harbor and decommissioned on 29 August 1946.
After she was thoroughly examined, and two other vessels used &quot;Nevada&quot; as a practice gunnery target 65 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor on 31 July 1948. The ships did not sink &quot;Nevada&quot;, so she was given a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; with an aerial torpedo hit amidships.

=== Wreck ===

On 11 May 2020, it was announced that a joint expedition by Ocean Infinity, with its ship the &quot;Pacific Constructor&quot;, and the operations center of SEARCH Inc., headed by Dr. James Delgado had discovered &quot;Nevada&quot;&#x27;s wreck. &quot;Nevada&quot; is located at a depth of off the coast of Hawaii and about 65 nautical miles southwest of Pearl Harbor. The wreck lies upside down, with the main hull carrying the scars of shell fire and torpedo hits. Nearby is a large debris field with the turrets, which fell off the ship as she capsized, and the bow and stern, both of which were torn free. Archaeologists also documented the two tripod masts, portions of the bridge, sections of deck and superstructure, and one of four tanks, an M26 Pershing, placed on the deck for the atomic bomb tests. The hull was still painted and the number &quot;36&quot; was visible on the stern.

One of the former &quot;Arizona&quot; guns mounted on &quot;Nevada&quot; is paired with a gun formerly on &quot;Missouri&quot; at the Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza just east of the Arizona State Capitol complex in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. It is part of a memorial representing the start and end of the Pacific War for the United States.

A large model of the ship built for the 1970 film, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, survives today in Los Angeles and often appears at local parades.

<text>Fisk University is a private historically black liberal arts college in Nashville, Tennessee. It was founded in 1866 and its campus is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1930, Fisk became the first historically black institution to gain accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Fisk is the oldest institution for higher education in Nashville.

==History==


=== Founding ===
Fisk Free Colored School opened on January 9, 1866, during the Reconstruction era shortly after the end of the Civil War. It was founded by John Ogden, Erastus Milo Cravath, and Edward Parmelee Smith of the American Missionary Association for the education of freedmen in Nashville. Fisk was one of several schools and colleges that the Association helped found across the South to educate freed slaves. The school is named for Clinton B. Fisk, a Union general and assistant commissioner of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau of Tennessee. Fisk secured a site to house the school in a former military barracks near Union Station and provided $30,000 of government funds for its endowment.

The American Missionary Association&#x27;s work was supported by the Congregationalist church, which retains an affiliation with Fisk. Fisk is the oldest higher education institution in Nashville.

=== 19th century ===
Enrollment rose to 900 in the first several months following the school&#x27;s opening, indicating the strong desire for education among local freedmen. Student ages ranged from seven to 70.

During the nation&#x27;s Reconstruction era, the Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation to enable free public education, which caused a need to increase teacher training. In 1867 the Fisk Free Colored School was reorganized and incorporated as Fisk University to focus on higher education. James Dallas Burrus, John Houston Burrus, Virginia E. Walker, and America W. Robinson were the first students to enroll at the institution. In 1875, the two Burruses and Walker graduated from Fisk and became the first African-American students to graduate from a liberal arts college south of the Mason–Dixon line.

The Tennessee Constitution of 1870 was ratified with a provision, Article XI § 12, that prohibited public schools from enrolling both Black and White students. In 1869, the University of Tennessee (then Eastern Tennessee University) had been designated a federal land-grant university, which meant that it was required to enroll all qualified citizens of the state, regardless of race or color. To get around the requirement of integration, ETU paid tuition for Black students with State Scholarships to enroll at Fisk University in 1881–83. The contract was changed to Knoxville College in 1884.

In 1870, Adam K. Spence became the school&#x27;s principal. Spence developed plans to expand and move the school to a larger campus in north Nashville on a site that had been Fort Gillem, a Union army base. To raise money for the school&#x27;s initiatives, his wife Catherine Mackie Spence traveled throughout the United States to set up mission Sunday schools in support of Fisk students, organizing endowments through the American Missionary Association. With a strong interest in religion and the arts, Adam Spence supported the founding of a student choir; they were the start of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

With the school facing financial distress, the choir went on tour to raise funds in 1871, led by professor and university treasurer George L. White. They toured the U.S. and Europe and became a sensation, singing before Ulysses S. Grant, Mark Twain, Queen Victoria; popularizing spirituals written by Wallace Willis such as &quot;Swing Low Sweet Chariot&quot;; and changing racial stereotypes. Their tour raised nearly $50,000 (~$ in ) and funded construction of Jubilee Hall. (In W.E.B. Du Bois&#x27; book entitled &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;, this number is quoted at $150,000). It was the first building built for the education of freedmen in the South and is now a National Historic Landmark.

Fisk co-founder Cravath returned in 1875 and became the institution&#x27;s first president. He oversaw an active construction program and expansion of the school&#x27;s curriculum offerings to include liberal arts, theology, and teacher training. By the turn of the 20th century, it had strengthened its reputation, built several campus buildings, added African-American teachers and staff, and enrolled a second generation of students.

=== 20th century ===
James Griswold Merrill served as acting president of Fisk from 1899 to 1901, then continued as the institution&#x27;s president from 1901 to 1908. Fisk University&#x27;s dedication to liberal arts education at the turn of the century distinguished it from many other black colleges and universities that emphasized vocational training. The school established a department of social science in 1910, founded and directed by George E. Haynes. It was the first social work training center for African-American graduate students and a model for those established at other institutions. The school was criticized by some at the time for fostering an elitist reputation.

From 1915 to 1925, Fayette Avery McKenzie was president of Fisk. McKenzie&#x27;s tenure, before and after World War I, was during a turbulent period in American history. In spite of many challenges, McKenzie developed Fisk as the premier all-Black college or university in the United States, secured Fisk&#x27;s academic recognition as a standard college by the Carnegie Foundation, Columbia University and the University of Chicago, raised a $1 million endowment fund to ensure quality faculty, and laid a foundation for Fisk&#x27;s accreditation and future success. McKenzie was eventually forced to resign when his strict policies on dress code, extracurricular activities, and other aspects of student life led to student protests in 1924 and 1925.

Thomas Elsa Jones became the institution&#x27;s fourth president in 1925. He sought to diversify Fisk&#x27;s faculty and further build the school&#x27;s reputation. In 1930, Fisk became the first historically black college to gain accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. It was also the first such institution approved by the Association of American Universities in 1933. Accreditations for specialized programs soon followed.

In 1946, Charles S. Johnson became Fisk&#x27;s sixth president and first African-American president. Johnson was a premier sociologist, a scholar who had also been the editor of &quot;&quot; magazine, a noted periodical of the Harlem Renaissance. Johnson expanded the school&#x27;s Institute of Race Relations, which was established in 1942. The institute conducted research and fostered discussion about racial disparity in the U.S. and would later help develop strategies for desegregation in schools, employment, and the military. In 1949, Fisk received the Stieglitz Collection of modern art from photographer and arts patron Alfred Stieglitz.

In 1952, Fisk was the first predominantly black college to earn a Phi Beta Kappa charter. Organized as the Delta of Tennessee Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa National Honor Society that December, the chapter inducted its first student members on April 4, 1953. Established in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most prestigious academic honor society in the U.S.

In 1960, Fisk students joined other black leaders in the Nashville sit-ins, nonviolent protests against segregation at lunch counters in the city during the civil rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr., spoke at the institution in May 1960 in response to civil rights movement in the city. Fisk students John Lewis and Diane Nash were leaders during the protests, which led to Nashville becoming the first major city in the South to desegregate lunch counters. The two became early leaders of the national Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).

On April 8, 1967, a riot occurred near the Fisk and Tennessee State University campuses after Stokely Carmichael spoke at Vanderbilt University. Although it was viewed as a &quot;race riot&quot;, it had classist characteristics. Protestors marched from Fisk to the Nashville courthouse to protest police brutality during the riots.

In 1978 Fisk&#x27;s campus was recognized as a National Historic Landmark. The campus underwent significant restoration in the 1990s through assistance from a U.S. Congressional Grant.

=== 21st century ===
From 2004 to 2013, Fisk was directed by its 14th president, Hazel O&#x27;Leary, former Secretary of Energy under President Bill Clinton. She was the second woman to serve as president of Fisk. On June 25, 2008, Fisk announced that it had successfully raised $4 million (~$ in ) during the fiscal year ending June 30. It ended nine years of budget deficits and qualified for a Mellon Foundation challenge grant. However, Fisk still faced significant financial hardship, and said that it may need to close its doors unless its finances improved.

H. James Williams served as president from February 2013 to September 2015. Williams had been dean of the Seidman College of Business at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, and previously an accounting professor at Georgetown University, Florida A&amp;M, and Texas Southern University. Williams was succeeded by interim president Frank Sims. In March 2017 the Fisk board of trustees announced that Kevin Rome would be Fisk university&#x27;s seventeenth president.

In June 2017, a service in memory of 1892 lynching victim Ephraim Grizzard was held in the Fisk Memorial Chapel. A plaque memorializing Grizzard and two other lynching victims—his brother Henry and Samuel Smith—was installed at St. Anselm&#x27;s Episcopal church in Nashville.

In 2018 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the institution on probation. The accreditor cited failings related to financial responsibility, control of research funds, and federal and state responsibility. Fisk announced a fundraising record and increased enrollment the following year. In 2020, Fisk was taken off probation and maintained its accreditation.

==Campus==
Fisk&#x27;s 40-acre campus was dedicated in 1876. It sits on a small hill approximately two miles northwest of downtown that was previously Fort Gillem, a Union fort during the Civil War. The campus lies on Jefferson Street, a historic center of Nashville&#x27;s African-American community.

The Fisk University Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Notable campus buildings that contribute to the historic district include:

* The Carl Van Vechten Gallery was built in 1888. It served as the school&#x27;s gymnasium before becoming an art gallery. The building houses Fisk&#x27;s renowned Stieglitz Collection of modern art. It is named for photographer Carl Van Vechten.
* Carnegie Hall was originally built as a library in 1908. It is the first major building by Moses McKissack III, co-founder of the first African-American owned architecture firm in the United States.
* Cravath Hall, named for the institution&#x27;s first president Erastus Milo Cravath and completed in 1930, is an eight-story building originally used as a library. It was designed by Henry Hibbs. The building features a series of murals by painter Aaron Douglas, which he described as a &quot;panorama of the development of Black people in this hemisphere, in the new world.&quot; The murals have been described as the most ambitious works of his career. The building now houses administrative offices.
* Fisk Memorial Chapel was built in 1892 in the Victorian style. At the time it was the largest building for African Americans to gather in the country. The chapel hosts campus functions and public events such as concerts, lectures, and graduations. The building was restored and rededicated in 1992.
* Jubilee Hall, completed in 1876, is the oldest permanent building for the higher education of African Americans in the United States. It is named for the Fisk Jubilee Singers who toured the country to raise funds for its construction. The six-story, L-shaped building is noted for its Victorian Gothic architecture.
* Talley Brady Hall, built in 1931, is the first modern chemistry building at a historically black college or university. It is named for Thomas E. Talley and St. Elmo Brady, two notable African American chemists and faculty members.

Additional campus buildings listed on the register include Little Theater, Harris Music Building, numerous residential structures, and a limestone wall built around 1873.

In the 1930s, Fisk hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to lead a master design of its campus at this time, resulting in the Beaux-Arts landscape.

==Music, art, and literature collections==
=== Library collections ===
Fisk is the home of a music literature collection founded by the noted Harlem Renaissance figure Carl Van Vechten, for whom the campus museum is named. It also holds a substantial collection of materials associated with Charles W. Chestnutt.

Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas was commissioned to paint murals for the new campus library, Cravath Hall, in 1930. Douglas described them a &quot;panorama of the development of Black people in this hemisphere, in the new world.&quot; Douglas returned to Fisk in 1939 to teach and later served as chair of the art department. The murals were restored in 2003.

===Alfred Stieglitz collection===
In 1949, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, wife and executrix of her late husband&#x27;s estate, in accordance with the terms of his will, donated to Fisk a number of paintings that had belonged to her husband, the photographer and art patron Alfred Stieglitz. The collection consists of 101 works by important artists, including European modernists Paul Cézanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera, as well as American artists Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth and works by O&#x27;Keeffe.

In 2005, mounting financial difficulties and deteriorating conditions in the gallery led the trustees to vote to sell two of the paintings, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s &quot;Radiator Building&quot; and Hartley&#x27;s &quot;Painting No. 3,&quot; together estimated to be worth up to $45 million U.S. The sale was challenged by the Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum, the legal guardians of her estate. This challenge failed. A joint agreement was established between Fisk University and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. The two museums now share the works&#x27; presentation and display rights of the Stieglitz collection; ownership remains with Fisk University, in accord with the terms of Stieglitz&#x27;s estate. Presentation and display rights rotate between Fisk University and Crystal Bridges Museum every two years. In 2016, as part of the institution&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebration, the collection was displayed at the newly renovated Carl Van Vechten Gallery.

==Science programs==
Fisk University has a strong record of academic excellence: it has graduated more African Americans who go on to earn PhDs in the natural sciences than any other institution.

=== Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge Program ===
Started in 2004, the Fisk-Vanderbilt bridge program helps underrepresented groups gain access to PhD programs in STEM fields. The partnership between a small, historically black college and a major research university aims to diversify doctoral study. The program, which has received money from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, provides a scholarship for a master&#x27;s degree at Fisk University and close mentorship for students who go on to a PhD Since 2004, 21 students in the program have completed a PhD, with another 56 currently pursuing graduate study. The program has a success rate far higher than the national average for completion of PhD programs, which is about 50%.

==Rankings==

<doc id="189947" wikidata="Q14919" url="?curid=189947" title="Air guitar">
<text>Air guitar is a form of dance and movement in which the performer pretends to play an imaginary rock or heavy metal-style electric guitar, including riffs and solos. Playing an air guitar usually consists of exaggerated strumming and picking motions, and is often coupled with loud singing or lip-synching. Air guitar is generally used in the imaginary simulation of loud electric or acoustic guitar music.

== History ==

Before the existence of air guitar, the popularity of the phonograph in the 1930s led to the phenomenon of &quot;shadow conducting&quot;, in which listeners would pretend to conduct an orchestra.

Air guitar had a seminal moment at the Woodstock music festival in 1969, when singer Joe Cocker mimicked the playing of the keyboard and guitar during his performance of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;. Cocker&#x27;s elaborate signature moves helped introduce the concept of air guitar to the public.

Neal Kay, founder of the Soundhouse heavy metal club in Kingsbury, London, recalls one night in 1976 a club regular named Rob &quot;Loonhouse&quot; Yeatman arrived at the club carrying a piece of hardboard cut into the shape of a Flying V guitar, with no frets or strings. &quot;Suddenly Rob appears in front of everyone and he starts playing it along with the solo and he&#x27;s absolutely perfect.&quot;

One of the first air guitar contests was held at Florida State University in 1978. The term &quot;air guitar&quot; subsequently gained popularity in the 1980s as more contests were held in Sweden and the United States. Since 1996, the annual Air Guitar World Championships have been organized in Oulu, Finland. The first competitions were arranged as part of Oulu Music Video Festival. Since 2011 it has been produced by Airnest Productions Ltd, which also administers the official Air Guitar World Championships Network of licensed national championships. The idea of the contest was originated a joke that was intended to be a side attraction for the music video festival but has since become a major draw in its own right.

==Contests==


Air guitar contests have much in common with the figure skating scoring system, especially using 6.0 score system. The most common set of rules are as following:

* Each participant has to play air guitar on stage in two rounds, each lasting for one minute.
** Round 1: participant plays a selection of his or her choice. Typically the song has been edited (or a medley has been created) to fit the 60-second format.
** Round 2: participant plays a section of the song chosen by an organizer or competitor; usually the song is not announced beforehand and kept secret until the round begins so the participant has to improvise.
* Participant plays alone; backing bands, either with real or air instruments are not allowed; roadies and groupies are allowed to make up some image but they must leave the stage before performance.
* Participant has to play air guitar (i.e. air drums, piano and other instruments are not allowed). Air guitar can be acoustic, electric or both.
* Generally, there is no dress code and participant is encouraged to use any clothing and props that would add character and make the performance more interesting. Any real musical equipment or crew (instruments, amplifiers, effect pedals, and backing band members) are strictly forbidden. Some events make an exception for a real guitar pick.
* Jury consists of independent judges, usually B-list musicians, music critics, comedians, or other members of the media.
* Judges use the same 6.0 score system as in the traditional figure skating system: there are several varying criteria, and each judge must give the contestant a score from 4.0 to 6.0 on each of the following:
** Technical merit—how much the performance looks like the real playing, including accurate reproduction of all fretwork, chords, solos and technical moves.
** Mimesmanship—how convincingly the performers can mime their performance, and create the illusion of an invisible guitar, apart from the technical accuracy of the fretwork
** Stage presence—a charisma of rock star, the ability to rock, lack of stage fright and power to drive thousands of listeners; involves guitar showmanship and other emotional demonstrations.
** Airness—the most subjective criterion, as &quot;presentation&quot; in figure skating—how much the performance was an object of art by itself, not only a simulation of playing guitar.

===World===

Annual Air Guitar World Championships were first held in 1996 as part of the Oulu Music Video Festival in Oulu, Finland, and now held there each August. According to the competition ideology, &quot;wars will end, climate change will stop and all bad things will vanish when all the people in the world play the air guitar&quot;.

Participants from all over the world compete in skills of playing air guitar. The judges represent professionals of performing arts and culture, the guitarist Juha Torvinen among others. The winner gets a custom-made guitar, &#x27;Flying Finn&#x27;, by Matti and Saara Nevalainen. One year, Brian May, the lead guitarist of Queen, donated a VOX BM Special amplifier for the winner.

Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Air Guitar World Championships were not held in 2020 and 2021. In lieu of a 2021 championship, the Air Guitar World Championships organized a virtual Champion of Champions Championships on August 27, 2021, won by Justin &quot;Nordic Thunder&quot; Howard.

===United States===
In 2003, Cedric Devitt and Kriston Rucker founded US Air Guitar, the official governing body of air guitar in the US.

The 2004 US Air Guitar Championships featured regional competitions in five cities. MiRi &quot;Sonyk-Rok&quot; Park, winner of the New York City regional, took the national crown by defeating Fatima &quot;The Rockness Monster&quot; Hoang from Los Angeles. She went to Finland, where she tied for first place, becoming the 2004 World Air Guitar Co-Champion.

By 2008, US Air Guitar had expanded to include regional competitions in 24 cities. The 2006 US Air Guitar Champion, Craig &quot;Hot Lixx Hulahan&quot; Billmeier, went on to defeat 2005 Champion Fatima &quot;The Rockness Monster&quot; Hoang and 2007 Champion Andrew &quot;William Ocean&quot; Litz &quot;en route&quot; to his second national title. In Finland, Hulahan won, securing the United States&#x27; third world title and becoming the 2008 World Air Guitar Champion.

William Ocean won his second national title in 2009, earning him a spot in Finland at the 2009 World Air Guitar Championships. Ocean and defending World Air Guitar Champion Hulahan tied for second place, behind Sylvain &quot;Gunther Love&quot; Quimene of France.

In 2020 and 2021, US Air Guitar moved to online competitions, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 US Air Guitar season ended with a live, in-person finals in Chicago, IL.

===United Kingdom===
The Air Guitar UK Championship was created in 2006 by twice air guitar world champion Zac &#x27;the Magnet&#x27; Monroe (the first non-Finn to win the competition) and is affiliated with the Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu, Finland, forming part of the World Air Guitar Network.

In September 2011, Air Guitar UK launched Air Guitar Wales and Air Guitar Northern Ireland to join Air Guitar Scotland (first launched by AGUK in 2009) as part of the Air Guitar UK Network.

Air Guitar UK events are held in support of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

====UKAG====
UK Air Guitar (UKAG) works regularly with charities including RAFA, The 1800 Club and Action Medical Research.

==Innovations==

Multiple technological innovations allow air guitar to be played as a real instrument, producing sounds that depend on the air guitarist&#x27;s actions. In 2005, students from the Helsinki University of Technology developed a system that translates hand movements into electric guitar sounds, resulting in a functional air guitar. The system, consisting of a pair of brightly coloured gloves and an infrared camera, is one of the most popular exhibits at the Helsinki Science Center. The camera recognizes the distance between the two gloves and the strumming movements made by the wearer to synthesize an electric guitar tune, working using only six notes.

In November 2006, researchers at the Australian government&#x27;s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) announced they had developed a tee-shirt that senses human movement to &quot;showcase its expertise in designing and manufacturing electronic and intelligent textiles with which people effortlessly control computers&quot;, publicising it as an air guitar shirt.

In 2007, toy company Silverlit introduced V-Beat Air Guitar, a device that consists of a motion-sensing guitar pick, a neck part with four buttons and a guitar body. By changing the distance between body and neck, and pressing a combination of the four buttons on the neck part, up to 48 tones and chords can be played. The V-Beat Air Guitar was won &#x27;Best Music Gadget&#x27; on the television program The Gadget Show.

In 2007, a Japanese toy company Takara Tomy introduced Air Guitar Pro (Guitar Rockstar), a functional guitar simulator. Fitting in one hand, the device uses heat and motion sensors to detect the other hand motions and produce guitar sounds.

In March 2008, Jada Toys of California introduced the Air Guitar Rocker toy that included patented technology in a belt buckle. When the user strums a magnetic pick in front of the belt buckle, guitar music plays through a portable amplifier attached to the users pants or belt. The Air Guitar Rocker is marketed with the popular Guitar Hero license and was created by toy inventor David Führer and his team.

<text>Thomas Kidd (177027 August 1850) was an English classical scholar and schoolmaster.

He was born in Yorkshire, and educated at Giggleswick School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the father of John Tyrwhitt Davy Kidd who served in India for many years and Richard Bentley Porson Kidd, who was rector of Potter Heigham church among other duties in Norwich, Norfolk. The last of these had a son, Richard Hayward Kidd, who was Colonial Chaplain of Hong Kong until his death in 1879.

Kidd held numerous scholastic and clerical appointments. In 1818 he was appointed headmaster of King&#x27;s Lynn School; he next became master of Wymondham School, and then of Norwich School. His last appointment was as rector of Croxton, near Cambridge, where he died. Kidd was an intimate friend of Richard Porson and Charles Burney the younger. He contributed largely to periodicals, chiefly on classical subjects, but his reputation mainly rests upon his editions of the works of other scholars:

*&quot;Opuscula Ruhnkeniana&quot; (1807), the minor works of the great Dutch scholar David Ruhnken
*&quot;Tracts and Miscellaneous Criticisms of Richard Porson&quot; (1815).
*&quot;Miscellanea Critica&quot; of Richard Dawes (2nd ed., 1827)

He also published an edition of the works of Horace (1817) based upon Richard Bentley&#x27;s recension.

<text>Duivendrecht () is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Ouder-Amstel, and lies about 6 km southeast of Amsterdam’s city centre. It is a suburb of Amsterdam.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1308 as Doevendrecht, and means &quot;ferry of Doeve (person).&quot; Duivendrecht started to developed in the 19th century and has become encircled by Amsterdam, Diemen and the Bijlmermeer.

The Catholic St Urbanus Church is a single aisled cruciform church with a double tower. It was built between 1877 and 1878 as a replacement of the 1840 church.

The local Duivendrecht railway station is a major interchange point on the Dutch railway network. It opened in 1993 and is on the Amsterdam to Arnhem railway line, the Weesp to Leiden line as well as the Amsterdam Metro.

== Radio Stations (local) ==
The local radio station for Duivendrecht is Jamm fm 104.9 Smooth &amp; Funky.

<doc id="189951" wikidata="Q24364" url="?curid=189951" title="Force carrier">
<text>In quantum field theory, a force carrier is a type of particle that gives rise to forces between other particles. They serve as the quanta of a particular kind of physical field. Force carriers are also known as messenger particles, intermediate particles, or exchange particles.

== Particle and field viewpoints ==

Quantum field theories describe nature in terms of fields. Each field has a complementary description as the set of particles of a particular type. A force between two particles can be described either as the action of a force field generated by one particle on the other, or in terms of the exchange of virtual force-carrier particles between them.

The energy of a wave in a field (for example, an electromagnetic wave in the electromagnetic field) is quantized, and the quantum excitations of the field can be interpreted as particles. The Standard Model contains the following force-carrier particles, each of which is an excitation of a particular force field:
*Gluons, excitations of the strong gauge field.
*Photons, W bosons, and Z bosons, excitations of the electroweak gauge fields.
*Higgs bosons, excitations of one component of the Higgs field, which gives mass to fundamental particles.
In addition, composite particles such as mesons, as well as quasiparticles, can be described as excitations of an effective field.

Gravity is not a part of the Standard Model, but it is thought that there may be particles called gravitons which are the excitations of gravitational waves. The status of this particle is still tentative, because the theory is incomplete and because the interactions of &quot;single&quot; gravitons may be too weak to be detected.

== Forces from the particle viewpoint ==
When one particle scatters off another, altering its trajectory, there are two ways to think about the process. In the field picture, we imagine that the field generated by one particle caused a force on the other. Alternatively, we can imagine one particle emitting a virtual particle which is absorbed by the other. The virtual particle transfers momentum from one particle to the other. This particle viewpoint is especially helpful when there are a large number of complicated quantum corrections to the calculation since these corrections can be visualized as Feynman diagrams containing additional virtual particles.

Another example involving virtual particles is beta decay where a virtual W boson is emitted by a nucleon and then decays to e± and (anti)neutrino.

The description of forces in terms of virtual particles is limited by the applicability of the perturbation theory from which it is derived. In certain situations, such as low-energy QCD and the description of bound states, perturbation theory breaks down.

== History ==
The concept of messenger particles dates back to the 18th century when the French physicist Charles Coulomb showed that the electrostatic force between electrically charged objects follows a law similar to Newton&#x27;s Law of Gravitation. In time, this relationship became known as Coulomb&#x27;s law. By 1862, Hermann von Helmholtz had described a ray of light as the &quot;quickest of all the messengers&quot;. In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the existence of a light-particle in answer to the question: &quot;what are light quanta?&quot;

In 1923, at the Washington University in St. Louis, Arthur Holly Compton demonstrated an effect now known as Compton scattering. This effect is only explainable if light can behave as a stream of particles, and it convinced the physics community of the existence of Einstein&#x27;s light-particle. Lastly, in 1926, one year before the theory of quantum mechanics was published, Gilbert N. Lewis introduced the term &quot;photon&quot;, which soon became the name for Einstein&#x27;s light particle. From there, the concept of messenger particles developed further, notably to massive force carriers (e.g. for the Yukawa potential).

<text>The municipalities of Puerto Rico (Spanish: &quot;municipios de Puerto Rico&quot;) are the second-level administrative divisions in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. There are 78 such administrative divisions covering all 78 incorporated towns and cities. Each municipality is led by a mayor and divided into barrios, third-level administrative divisions, though the latter are not vested with any political authority. Every municipality is governed as stated by the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991, which establishes that every municipality must have an elected strong mayor with a municipal legislature as the form of government. Each legislature must be unicameral, with the number of members related to adequate representation of the total population of the municipality. In contrast to other jurisdictions, both the mayors and the municipal legislators are elected on the same date and for the same term of four years in office.

From a political and ekistic perspective, several differences and similarities exist between municipalities of differing population sizes. For instance, municipalities with 50,000 inhabitants or more are considered incorporated cities, while those with fewer than 50,000 are considered incorporated towns. Size affects the autonomy exercised by the jurisdiction: cities provide and manage their own services, while towns typically depend on nearby cities for certain services. Demographically, municipalities in Puerto Rico are equivalent to counties in the United States, and Puerto Rican municipalities are registered as county subdivisions in the United States census. Statistically, the municipality with the largest number of inhabitants is San Juan, with 342,259, while Culebra is the smallest, with around 1,792. Arecibo is the largest in terms of geography, with around 125 mi2, and Cataño the smallest, with around 4.8 mi2.

All municipalities have a barrio called &quot;pueblo&quot; proper, officially called &quot;barrio-pueblo&quot; (literally &quot;district-town&quot;), which typically is the site of the historic Spanish colonial settlement, administrative center and urban core of the municipality. However, municipalities with large populations may have an urban core that consist of several barrios.

==Overview==

In &quot;Recent Civic Architecture in Porto Rico&quot; by Adrian C. Finlayson, architect for the Insular Department of the Interior Architecture, writing for the publication &quot;Architectural Record&quot; in 1920, the Puerto Rican municipality is accurately described as:

Having been a Spanish possession until 1898, the system of local government in Puerto Rico bears more resemblance to that of the Hispanophone nations of the Americas than to local government in the United States. Thus, there are no literal first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, as defined by the U.S. Federal Government. Instead, Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities as the secondary unit of administration. For U.S. Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents. The municipalities are grouped into eight electoral districts, but these do not possess administrative functions. In 1991, the Autonomous Municipalities Act was passed, which slightly modified the rights and responsibilities of Puerto Rican municipalities with the aim of decentralizing control and improving government services.

Every municipality is composed of &quot;barrios&quot;, except for Florida, which has only one barrio. The municipality of Ponce has the largest number of barrios, 31.

Every municipality, except San Juan, also has an urban area made up of one or more barrios. When the urban area is made up of only one barrio, it is called &quot;Barrio Pueblo&quot;. Some urban areas are made up of multiple barrios: Ponce&#x27;s urban area, for example, is made up of 12 barrios. All of San Juan&#x27;s barrios are urban barrios, and the municipality of San Juan is composed of urban barrios only - thus, the entire municipality of San Juan consists of one large urban zone.

==Municipalities==

&quot;For a list of municipal demonyms&quot; 

Puerto Rico is administratively divided into the following 78 municipalities (alphabetically ordered): 

===Most populated municipalities===

==Racial composition==
The following is an alphabetical list of the municipalities and their population together with a breakdown of their racial composition.

==Politics==
The municipalities elect a mayor and a municipal legislature in the general elections every four years.

==Finances==
In 2012, 36 of the 78 municipalities (46%) were experiencing a budget deficit. In total, the combined debt carried by the municipalities stands at about US$590 million.

==Proposed amalgamation==
Multiple times, politicians have discussed and proposed consolidating Puerto Rico&#x27;s municipalities but so far no proposals has been adopted. In 1902 the Puerto Rico legislature, under pressure from the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, passed a law consolidating the then-76 municipalities of Puerto Rico into 46. The law was repealed three years later. In October 2009, a Puerto Rican legislator proposed a bill that would reduce the current 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico down to 20. The bill called for a referendum to take place on June 13, 2010, which would let the people decide on the matter. However, the bill never made into law. With the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis that emerged in the first half of 2010s, a new plan to consolidate municipalities was again circulated in the legislature in 2017 as a way to alleviate the government debt crisis. In March 2019, then Governor Ricardo Rosselló created an initiative that would preserve the existing municipalities but create regional consolidation by sharing service overhead in the form of counties but he resigned prior to anything coming of his proposal.

<doc id="189954" wikidata="Q79857" url="?curid=189954" title="Konya">
<text>Konya is a major city in central Turkey, on the southwestern edge of the Central Anatolian Plateau, and is the capital of Konya Province. During antiquity and into Seljuk times it was known as Iconium. In 19th-century accounts of the city in English its name is usually spelt Konia or Koniah. In the late medieval period, Konya was the capital of the Seljuk Turks&#x27; Sultanate of Rum, from where the sultans ruled over Anatolia.

As of 2023, the population of the Metropolitan Province was just over 2.3 million, making it the sixth most populous city in Turkey, and second most populous of the Central Anatolia Region, after Ankara. Konya is served by TCDD high-speed train (YHT) services from Istanbul, Ankara and Karaman. The local airport (Konya Havalimanı, KYA) is served by frequent flights from Istanbul whereas flights to and from İzmir are offered few times a week.

== Name ==

Konya is believed to correspond to the Late Bronze Age toponym &quot;Ikkuwaniya&quot; known from Hittite records. This placename is regarded as Luwian in origin. During classical antiquity and the medieval period it was known as () in Greek and as in Latin.

A folk etymology holds that the name was derived from (&#x27;icon&#x27;), referring to an ancient Greek legend according to which the hero Perseus vanquished the native population with an image of the &quot;Gorgon Medusa&#x27;s head&quot; before founding the city.

Konya was known as to the Rum Seljuks.

== History ==

=== Overview ===
The Konya region has been inhabited since the third millennium BC and fell at different times under the rule of the Hittites, the Phrygians, the Greeks, the Persians and the Romans. In the 11th century the Seljuk Turks conquered the area and began ruling over its Rûm (Byzantine Greek) inhabitants, making Konya the capital of their new Sultanate of Rum. Under the Seljuks, the city reached the height of its wealth and influence. Following their demise, Konya came under the rule of the Karamanids, before being taken over by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. After the Turkish War of Independence the city became part of the modern Republic of Turkey.

=== Ancient history ===

Excavations have shown that the region was inhabited during the Late Copper Age, around 3000 BC.

The Phrygians established their kingdom in central Anatolia in the eighth century BC and Xenophon describes Iconium (as the city was originally called) as the last city of Phrygia. The region was overwhelmed by Cimmerian invaders . Later it formed part of the Persian Empire, until Darius III was defeated by Alexander the Great in 333 BC. Alexander&#x27;s empire broke up shortly after his death and the town came under the rule of Seleucus I Nicator.

During the Hellenistic period the town was ruled by the kings of Pergamon. As Attalus III, the last king of Pergamon, was about to die without an heir, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Republic. Once incorporated into the Roman Empire, under emperor Claudius, the city&#x27;s name was changed to Claudiconium. During the reign of emperor Hadrianus it was known as Colonia Aelia Hadriana.

=== Saint Paul and Iconium ===
Paul and Silas probably visited Konya during Paul&#x27;s Second Missionary Journey in about AD 50, as well as near the beginning of his Third Missionary Journey several years later. 

According to the apocryphal Acts of Paul and Thecla, Iconium was also the birthplace of Saint Thecla, who saved the city from attack by the Isaurians in 354.

=== Byzantine Era===

Under the Byzantine Empire, the city became the seat of a bishop, and in was raised to the status of a metropolitan see for Lycaonia, with Saint Amphilochius as the first metropolitan bishop. In the 7th century it became part of the Anatolic Theme and was, together with the nearby (Caballa) Kaballah Fortress (Turkish: &quot;Gevale Kalesi&quot;) (location) a frequent target of Arab attacks during the Arab–Byzantine wars in the eighth to tenth century, being captured by Arabs in 723–724. The rebellious general Andronikos Doukas used the Kaballah fortress as his base in 905–906. During the tenth or eleventh century the church of Saint Amphilochius was constructed inside the citadel of Kaballa, housing the tomb of the saint which the Turks later believed to be the tomb of Plato, renaming the church to Eflâtun Mescidi (mosque of Plato). The monastery of Saint Chariton, another local from Iconium, was located a few miles away in Sylata.

The Seljuk Turks first raided the area in 1069, but a period of chaos overwhelmed Anatolia after the Seljuk victory in the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and the Norman mercenary leader Roussel de Bailleul rose in revolt at Iconium. The city was finally conquered by the Seljuks in 1084.

=== Seljuk and Karamanid eras===

Iconium became the second capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum after the fall of Nicaea until 1243. It was briefly occupied by the army of the First Crusade (August 1097) and Frederick Barbarossa (May 18, 1190) after the Battle of Iconium (1190). The area was reoccupied by the Turks after the Crusaders left.

Konya reached the height of its wealth and influence in the second half of the 12th century when the Seljuk sultans of Rum also subdued the Anatolian beyliks to their east, especially that of the Danishmends, thus establishing their rule over virtually all of eastern Anatolia. They also acquired several port towns along the Mediterranean (including Alanya) and the Black Sea (including Sinop) and even gained a brief foothold in Sudak, Crimea. This golden age lasted until the first decades of the 13th century.

Many Persians and Persianised Turks from Persia and Central Asia migrated to Anatolian cities either to flee the invading Mongols or to benefit from the opportunities for educated Muslims in a newly established kingdom.

Following the fall of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate in 1307, Konya became the capital of the Karamanids, a Turkish beylik, which lasted until 1322 when the city was captured by the neighbouring Beylik of Karamanoğlu. In 1420, the Beylik of Karamanoğlu fell to the Ottoman Empire and, in 1453, Konya was made the provincial capital of the Karaman Eyalet.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Under Ottoman rule, Konya was administered by the Sultan&#x27;s sons (&quot;Şehzade&quot;), starting with Şehzade Mustafa and Şehzade Cem (the sons of Sultan Mehmed II), and continuing with the future Sultan Selim II.

Between 1483 and 1864, Konya was the administrative capital of the Karaman Eyalet. During the reforming Tanzimat period, it became the seat of the larger Vilayet of Konya which replaced the Karaman Eyalet, as part of the new vilayet system introduced in 1864.

In 1832 Anatolia was invaded by Mehmed Ali Paşa of Kavala whose son, İbrahim Paşa, occupied Konya. Although he was driven out with the help of the European powers, Konya went into a decline after this, as described by the British traveller, William Hamilton, who visited in 1837 and found a scene &#x27;of destruction and decay&#x27;, as he recorded in his &quot;Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia&quot;, published in 1842.

Konya&#x27;s textile and mining industries flourished under the Ottomans.

=== Turkish Republic ===

During the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922) Konya was a major air base. In 1922, the air force, renamed as the Inspectorate of Air Forces, was headquartered in Konya.
Before 1923, 4,000 Orthodox, Turkish-speaking and Greek-speaking Christians lived there. The Greek community numbered approximately 2,500 people who maintained, at their own expense, a church, a boys&#x27; school and a girls&#x27; school.

<doc id="189956" wikidata="Q334505" url="?curid=189956" title="George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby">
<text>George Augustus Constantine Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby (23 July 1819 – 3 April 1890), styled Viscount Normanby between 1831 and 1838 and Earl of Mulgrave between 1838 and 1863, was a British Liberal politician and colonial governor of Nova Scotia, Queensland, New Zealand and Victoria.

==Early life==
Normanby was born in London, the eldest son of Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby and his wife the Hon Maria Liddell, daughter of Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth. He gained the courtesy title Viscount Normanby when his father succeeded to the Earldom of Mulgrave in 1831. When his father was created Marquess of Normanby in 1838, he became known by the courtesy title Earl of Mulgrave. 

==Military service==
Normanby entered the Coldstream Guards as an ensign and became a lieutenant in 1838.

==Political and administrative career==
Normanby was returned to parliament for Scarborough in 1847, a seat he held until 1851 and again between 1852 and 1857. He was appointed Comptroller of the Household by Lord John Russell in 1851. When Lord Aberdeen became prime minister in early 1852, he became Treasurer of the Household, a post he held until 1858 the last three years under the premiership of Lord Palmerston. In the latter year he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, which he remained until 1863. Whilst he served as Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, he and his wife had the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and his brother Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as their guests at Government House.

In 1863 Normanby succeeded his father in the marquessate and took his seat in the House of Lords.

Normanby returned to the government in 1868 when he was appointed a Lord-in-waiting by William Ewart Gladstone. The following year he was promoted to Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms. From 1871 to 1874, he was Governor of Queensland. He was then Governor of New Zealand from 1874 to 1879 and Governor of Victoria from 1879 to 1884.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Normanby married Laura Russell, daughter of Captain Robert Russell RN, in 1844. The couple had seven children.

* Lady Laura Elizabeth Minnie Phipps (3 June 1845 – 12 October 1934); married John Vivian Hampton-Lewis (1835–1890) on 2 June 1868.
* Constantine Charles Henry Phipps, 3rd Marquess of Normanby (29 August 1846 – 25 August 1932); married Gertrude Stansfeld Forster on 30 December 1903 and had issue.
* Lord William Brook Phipps (13 August 1847 – 19 February 1880); married Constance Emma Keyser (d. 1932) on 31 March 1875 and had issue.
* Lady Katherine Louisa Phipps (31 January 1850 – 23 September 1926); married Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere, and had issue.
* Lord Henry George Russell Phipps (26 January 1851 – 27 November 1905); married Norma Caroline Georgina Leith-Hay on 17 January 1878 and had issue.
* Lady Constance Mary Phipps (1852 - 31 October 1883)
* Lord Hervey Lepell Phipps (6 May 1854 – 21 April 1887); unmarried.

==Honours==

* Privy Councillor (PC), 1851.
* Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), 1874.
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), 1877.
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), 1885.

<text>François Hemsterhuis (27 December 1721 – 7 July 1790) was a Dutch writer on aesthetics and moral philosophy.

==Biography==
The son of Tiberius Hemsterhuis, he was born at Franeker in the Netherlands. He was educated at the University of Leiden, where he studied Plato. Failing to obtain a professorship, he entered the service of the state, and for many years acted as secretary to the state council of the United Provinces. He died at the Hague on 7 July 1790. Through his philosophical writings he became acquainted with many distinguished persons—Goethe, Herder, Princess Adelheid Amalie Gallitzin, and especially Jacobi, with whom he had much in common. His most valuable contributions are in the department of aesthetics or the general analysis of feeling. His philosophy has been characterized as Socratic in content and Platonic in form. Its foundation was the desire for self-knowledge and truth, untrammelled by the rigid bonds of any particular system.

==Works==
His most important works, all of which were written in French, are:
*&quot;Lettre sur la sculpture&quot; (1769), in which occurs the well-known definition of the Beautiful as &quot;that which gives us the greatest number of ideas in the shortest space of time&quot;
*its continuation, &quot;Lettre sur les désirs&quot; (1770)
*&quot;Lettre sur l&#x27;homme et ses rapports&quot; (1772), in which the &quot;moral organ&quot; and the theory of knowledge are discussed
*&quot;Sophyle&quot; (1778), a dialogue on the relation between the soul and the body, and also an attack on materialism
*&quot;Aristée&quot; (1779), the &quot;theodicy&quot; of Hemsterhuis, discussing the existence of God and his relation to man
*&quot;Simon&quot; (1787), on the four faculties of the soul, which are the will, the imagination, the moral principle (which is both passive and active)
*&quot;Alexis&quot; (1787), an attempt to prove that there are three golden ages, the last being the life beyond the grave
*&quot;Lettre sur l&#x27;athéisme&quot; (1787).

A collected edition of his works was made by P. S. Meijboom (1846-1850); see also S. A. Gronemann, &quot;F. Hemsterhuis, de Nederlandische Wijsgeer&quot; (Utrecht, 1867); E. Grucker, &quot;François Hemsterhuis, sa vie et ses œuvres&quot; (Paris, 1866); E. Meyer, &quot;Der Philosoph Franz Hemsterhuis&quot; (Breslau, 1893), with bibliographical notice; Augustinus P. Dierick, &quot;Pre-Romantic Elements in the aesthetic and moral writings of François Hemsterhuis (1721-1790).&quot; Studies in Eighteenth Century Culture 26 (1998), 247–271. A bilingual French-Dutch edition was published, introduced and commented on by Michael John Petry in 2001, titled &quot;Wijsgerige werken / Frans Hemsterhuis&quot;.

<text>&quot;New Hampshire&quot; (BB-25) was the sixth and final pre-dreadnought battleship, the last vessel of that type built for the United States Navy. Like most contemporary battleships, she was armed with an offensive armament that consisted of four large-caliber guns and several medium-caliber 7 and 8-inch (178 and 203 mm) guns. The ship was laid down in May 1905, launched in June 1906, and commissioned in March 1908, a little over a year after the revolutionary all-big-gun rendered ships like &quot;New Hampshire&quot; obsolescent.

Despite being rapidly surpassed by new American dreadnoughts, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; had an active career. She made two trips to Europe in 1910 and 1911, and she sank the old battleship , which had been converted into a target ship. &quot;New Hampshire&quot; was particularly active in the Caribbean during this period, as several countries, including Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico devolved into internal political conflicts. These actions included the United States occupation of Veracruz, during which the ship&#x27;s commander was awarded the Medal of Honor.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the ship was used primarily to train gunners and engine room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, and after the war ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France. &quot;New Hampshire&quot; remained in service for only a few years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, the ship was sold for scrap in November 1923.

==Design==
The followed the s, but corrected some of the most significant deficiencies in the earlier design, most notably the superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns. A heavier tertiary battery of guns replaced the guns that had been used on all previous US designs. Despite the improvements, the ships were rendered obsolescent by the revolutionary British battleship , completed before most of the members of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class.

&quot;New Hampshire&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. She had a crew of 827 officers and men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch /45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /45 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating. The secondary turrets had 7 in of frontal armor. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
&quot;New Hampshire&quot; was laid down on 1 May 1905 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 30 June 1906. The ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 19 March 1908; her first commander was Captain Cameron Winslow. After completing final fitting-out work, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; transported a Marine Expeditionary Regiment to Colón, Panama on 20 June, arriving six days later. She then made a series of visits to ports on the eastern coast of North America, including Portsmouth, New York, and Bridgeport, along with a stop in the Canadian province of Quebec. The ship was then overhauled in New York, followed by training exercises in the Caribbean Sea. On 22 February 1909, she participated in a Naval Review for President Theodore Roosevelt to greet the return of the Great White Fleet in Hampton Roads, Virginia. During this period, Ernest King, later the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, served aboard the ship in the engine room.

&quot;New Hampshire&quot; conducted training exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean through late 1910. On 1 November that year, she steamed out of Hampton Roads with the Second Battleship Division for a visit to Europe. There, the ships stopped in Cherbourg, France and Weymouth, the United Kingdom. The Division departed Weymouth on 30 December and returned to the Caribbean for training, before proceeding to Norfolk on 10 March 1911. On 21–22 March, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; conducted gunnery training with the target ship &quot;San Marcos&quot;—the old battleship —in Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. Over the course of the two days of firing, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; inflicted severe damage to the old ship, sinking her in shallow water. A cursory inspection of the wreck noted that the interior of the ship above the waterline was destroyed and that she had been holed multiple times below the waterline.

She then prepared for another trip to Europe. This time the ships cruised into the Baltic Sea, stopping in several ports in Germany, Russia, and Scandinavia, before returning to New England on 13 July. &quot;New Hampshire&quot; spent the next three years training midshipmen on summer cruises and patrolling the Caribbean. In December 1912, she steamed off the island of Hispaniola during unrest in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic. From 14 June to 29 December 1913, she patrolled the Caribbean coast of Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. The following year, she took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico, starting on 15 April. During the operations, the ship&#x27;s commander, Edwin Anderson, Jr., led a landing party that came under fire from the Heroica Escuela Naval Militar academy (Heroic Naval Military School), though gunfire from cruisers in the harbor silenced the Mexican snipers. Anderson and several others were awarded the Medal of Honor for the action. &quot;New Hampshire&quot; departed the area on 21 April for an overhaul in Norfolk. Exercises off the east coast of the United States followed before the ship returned to Veracruz in August 1915.

===World War I===

The ship was back in Norfolk on 30 September and remained in American waters late 1916. On 2 December, she steamed to Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, where the United States had instituted a military government under Rear Admiral Harry Knapp in an attempt to put an end to the political instability there. &quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s captain was involved in the government while the ship was in the country. In February 1917, she returned to Norfolk for an overhaul; this work was still ongoing when the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April. Over the course of the next eighteen months, the ship was occupied with training gunners and engine room personnel for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. During training on 1 June 1918, the crews for three of the 7-inch guns aboard &quot;New Hampshire&quot; accidentally began firing at one of the submarine chasers present; they fired several salvos before they received the order to cease fire. One of the shells struck the nearby battleship , killing one man and wounding several more. While the ships stopped to regain control of the situation, a lookout reported a periscope from a U-boat; &quot;New Hampshire&quot; and the battleship opened fire with their 6-inch guns to no effect. The submarine chasers could not find a U-boat in the area.

In September 1918, she was assigned to convoy escort duty, with the first such mission on 6 September. The ship departed with the battleship and the dreadnought to protect a fast HX troopship convoy. On 16 September, the three battleships left the convoy in the Atlantic and steamed back to the United States, while other escorts brought the convoy into port. On the 17th, &quot;South Carolina&quot;″s starboard propeller fell off, which forced her to reduce speed to using only the port shaft. &quot;New Hampshire&quot; and &quot;Kansas&quot; remained with &quot;South Carolina&quot; to escort her back to port. This duty did not last long, as the Germans signed the Armistice that ended the war on 11 November. On 24 December, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; began the first of four trips to bring soldiers back from the battlefields of Europe. On the first trip, she steamed with &quot;Louisiana&quot;, the two ships arriving in Brest, France on 5 January 1919. Between the two of them, they returned 2,169 men, including eight civilians.

===Postwar career===
By 1919, the ship had had all of her 7-inch guns and eight of the 3-inch guns removed, and a pair of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns had been installed. On 22 June 1919, the ship went into drydock in Philadelphia for an overhaul. A year later, on 5 June 1920, she began a training cruise for midshipmen to the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal. The cruise took the ship to Hawaii and several cities on the western coast of the United States. She was back in Philadelphia by 11 September. From 18 October to 12 January 1921, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; served as the flagship for a mission to Haiti. On 25 January she crossed the Atlantic to Europe for the final time to carry the remains of August Ekengren, the Swedish envoy to the United States. She arrived in Stockholm on 14 February; on the return voyage, she also stopped in Kiel, Germany, and Gravesend, United Kingdom. The ship reached Philadelphia on 24 March, where she was decommissioned on 21 May. According to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; was sold on 1 November 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

<text>Jacob Bernays (11 September 182426 May 1881) was a German philologist and philosophical writer.

==Life==
Jacob Bernays was born in Hamburg to Jewish parents. His father, Isaac Bernays (1792–1849) was a man of wide culture and the first orthodox German rabbi to preach in the vernacular; his brother, Michael Bernays, was also a distinguished scholar.

Between 1844 and 1848, Bernays studied classical philology at the University of Bonn under Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, Christian August Brandis, and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl, of whom Bernays became a favourite pupil.

In 1853, he accepted the chair of classical philology at the newly founded Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau, where he formed a close friendship with Theodor Mommsen. In 1866, when Ritschl left Bonn for Leipzig, Bernays returned to his old university as extraordinary professor and chief librarian. He remained in Bonn until his death on 26 May 1881. Upon his death, he bequeathed his Hebrew library to the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau.

==Scholarship==
Bernays was most famous for his book &quot;Grundzüge der verlorenen Abhandlung des Aristoteles über Wirkung der Tragödie&quot;. His medical interpretation of catharsis greatly influenced Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud.

Bernays was the first scholar to suggest that Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Protrepticus&quot; inspired Cicero to write the &quot;Hortensius&quot;. He further suggested that the &quot;Hortensius&quot; should be used as the base by which the &quot;Protrepticus&quot; could be reconstructed.

==Works==
His chief works, which deal mainly with the Greek philosophers, are:
*&quot;Joseph Justus Scaliger&quot; (1855)
*&quot;Über das Phokylidische Gesicht&quot; (1856)
*&quot;Grundzüge der verlorenen Abhandlung des Aristoteles über Wirkung der Tragödie&quot; (1857)
*&quot;Über die Chronik des Sulpicius Severus&quot; (1861)
*&quot;Die Dialoge des Aristoteles im Verhältniss zu seinen übrigen Werken&quot; (1863)

<text>Gilberto Hernández (born February 1, 1957), usually credited as Gilbert Hernandez and also by the nickname Beto (), is an American cartoonist. He is best known for his &quot;Palomar&quot;/&quot;Heartbreak Soup&quot; stories in &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;, an alternative comic book he shared with his brothers Jaime and Mario.

==Early life==
Gilbert Hernández was born and grew up in Oxnard, California to a Mexican father and Texas-born mother. He had five brothers and one sister, raised by their mother and grandmother, as their father was rarely around. They were exposed to comic books early in life through their mother, who passed on her love of the medium to her children. Young Gilbert read all he could, with the exception of romance comics. He set his passions on becoming a graphic storyteller, learning everything he could by studying what he found in comics, while developing his drawing skills through constant practice.

The radio was always on at home, and he grew up listening to the rock and roll of The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones. Hernandez found high school boring, sympathizing neither with the jock nor the nerd crowds, and called himself and his brothers &quot;just regular rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guys&quot;, and would make his way to Los Angeles for excitement. His drawing skills were admired by his peers, who urged him to aim at a career in drawing superheroes. Hernandez tried to learn more formal drawing skills, taking night classes in figurative drawing, but the apathy of his teacher drove him to quit. He made the decision to focus on comics when he got into high school, and upon finishing high school he devoted what energy he could towards that goal.

He was particularly enamored with the work that Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko produced for Marvel Comics, as well as Hank Ketcham&#x27;s &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and the Archie comics line. His brother Mario was responsible for introducing Gilbert to the underground comix movement when he smuggled a copy of &quot;Zap Comix&quot; into the house. Another big influence on Hernández&#x27;s work has been rock music, including punk, new wave and glitter rock. In particular, the &quot;Brothers Hernández&quot; were influenced by the energy and diversity of the late 1970s California punk and hardcore scene. Hernández has credited punk rock with giving him the confidence to start drawing his own comics.

==Career==

In the early 1980s, both Jaime and Gilbert created flyer and cover art for local bands. He also did the cover artwork for the record &quot;Limbo&quot; by Throwing Muses. The alternative rock band Love and Rockets was named after the Hernández brothers&#x27; comic book.

The first wider recognition of Gilbert and his brothers&#x27; work occurred in 1982, after they had sent in a copy of their &quot;Love &amp; Rockets&quot; comic, which up to that point they had been self publishing, to the Comics Journal, the foremost U.S. magazine of news and criticism pertaining to comic books and strips. This led to their work being published by the then just established Fantagraphics books. Between 1996 and 2001, the &quot;Love &amp; Rockets&quot; series was temporarily suspended, while each brother, including Gilbert, pursued solo projects. During this time Gilbert created &quot;New Love&quot;, &quot;Luba&quot;, and &quot;Luba&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. After its resumption, &quot;Love &amp; Rockets&quot; continued to be published by Fantagraphics on an annual basis.
In 1981, Hernandez and his brothers Jaime and Mario published the first issue of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;, which was quickly picked up by Fantagraphics Books, who republished the earliest materials in a new series starting in 1982. The magazine-sized comic book became known for its genre-bending, its punk-rock DIY ethic, and its multiracial (particularly Mexican-American) characters.

In 1983, Hernandez published the first part of the first &quot;Heartbreak Soup&quot; story in &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; #3. This began &quot;Palomar&quot;, Hernandez&#x27; magic realist &quot;magnum opus&quot; which was completed in 1996. These stories take place in the fictional rural Latin American village of Palomar, where modern technology and rampant consumerism have yet to reach—or even phone lines. The focus on the stories was on the characters, with their variety of personalities, rather than on action as in superhero comics, or on shock value as in underground comix. Over the years, the &quot;Palomar&quot; stories became longer, more complex and more daring, especially in the long story &quot;Human Diastrophism&quot;, in which a serial killer appears in Palomar, whose identity is only known by an unstable artist who slowly loses his mind.

Unusual in the male-dominated comic-book world of the time, &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; gained a large female audience, largely due its sympathetically portrayed and prominent female characters, who were not merely the objects of male lust.

The first volume of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; came to an end in 1996, with its fiftieth issue. Hernandez brought the &quot;Palomar&quot; stories to an end with a devastating earthquake, which briefly brings together many of the characters who had moved out of the village. The story closes with Luba and her family leaving for the United States to escape from hitmen. Jaime and Gilbert went their separate ways. Gilbert continued with Luba and her family in series such as &quot;Luba&quot;, &quot;Luba&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, and edited to the children&#x27;s anthology &quot;Measles&quot; before its early demise.

Hernandez collaborated with Peter Bagge on the series &quot;Yeah!&quot; for DC Comics in 1999–2000, about &quot;a teen girl rock band who performed in outer space&quot;, aimed at pre-teen girls. Bagge provided the script—the first time he worked on a project he hadn&#x27;t written. The wearying pace at which he needed to work on the series, combined with a lack of reader interest, led to its cancellation after nine issues

In 2001, &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; returned with a second volume, published roughly quarterly. The new series was published in standard comic-book size, and in it Hernandez focused on shorter stories that didn&#x27;t rely on continuity. For his longer stories, he also began creating stand-alone graphic novels, such as &quot;Sloth&quot; (2006), about a teenager from a small town who wills himself into a coma.

The second volume of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; came to an end after twenty issues. A third volume, called &quot;Love and Rockets: New Stories&quot; began in 2008. While Jaime continued with his &quot;Locas&quot; characters in the series, Gilbert focused on new characters.

In 2009, Gilbert published &quot;The Troublemakers&quot;, his second solo graphic novel with the publisher, inspired by pulp novels and heist films. This has continued a trend he started with &quot;Chance in Hell&quot; and &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;; all three books are faux adaptations of fictional B-movies.

==Influences==
Hernandez has said that, at a young age, he was particularly enamored with superhero comics—particularly 1960s Marvel Comics artists such as Jack Kirby&#x27;s work on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and Steve Ditko, and the cartoony art of DC Comics artists such as Carmine Infantino and Dick Sprang. He also said he drew a large influence from humorously exaggerated, naturalistic artists such as Dan DeCarlo, Harry Lucey and Bob Bolling&#x27;s work on various Archie Comics titles. He was impressed by the longer, &quot;epic&quot; stories he found, for example, in &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;, or in issue #2 of &quot;Charlton Premiere Comics&quot;

==Critical analysis and reception==

The style of Gilbert&#x27;s work has been described as magic realism or as &quot;magic-realist take on Central American soap opera&quot;. A common theme is the portrayal of independent women, and their strength, with the main example being Luba of Palomar. His stories often deal with issues relevant to Latino culture in the United States. According to Dominican-American writer and MIT creative writing professor Junot Díaz, Gilbert Hernández ideally would be considered &quot;one of the greatest American storytellers&quot;.

Along with his brother Jaime, Gilbert has been named as one of &quot;Time&quot;’s &quot;Top 100 Next Wave Storytellers&quot; in 2009. He is also co-creator and co-star (with his wife, Carol Kovinick) of &quot;The Naked Cosmos&quot;, an eccentric low-budget TV show about a cosmic prophet known as Quintas.

<text>&quot;March On, Bahamaland&quot; is the national anthem of The Bahamas. Timothy Gibson composed the music and authored the lyrics. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1973, when the country gained independence from the United Kingdom.

==History==
The Bahamas became a crown colony within the British Empire in 1717. Internal autonomy was eventually granted to the islands in 1964. Negotiations on independence commenced eight years later, when the Progressive Liberal Party emerged victorious in the 1972 elections after campaigning in favour of sovereignty. Consequently, a contest was held to determine a composition for a forthcoming national anthem.

In the end, lyrics and music written by Timothy Gibson were selected. Gibson was a school music teacher and also wrote the music to the country&#x27;s national song, &quot;God Bless Our Sunny Clime&quot;, together with E. Clement Bethel. The song was officially adopted in 1973, the year the country gained independence. One of the first public occasions where the anthem was played was at the midnight flag hoisting ceremony held at Clifford Park in Nassau on 10 July 1973, marking the end of British rule over the Bahamas.

Since the Bahamas continued to be a Commonwealth realm after independence, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was retained as the country&#x27;s royal anthem. That anthem was twice played by mistake at the 1982 Commonwealth Games medal ceremony, when Shonel Ferguson won gold in women&#x27;s long jump. She stepped off the podium on each occasion and expressed her wish that &quot;March On, Bahamaland&quot; be played. The officials realized that they did not have a recording of that song, so the Bahamian delegation sang their anthem themselves.

<text>Hatikvah (, ; ) is the national anthem of the State of Israel. Part of 19th-century Jewish poetry, the theme of the Romantic composition reflects the 2,000-year-old desire of the Jewish people to return to the Land of Israel in order to reclaim it as a free and sovereign nation-state. The piece&#x27;s lyrics are adapted from a work by Naftali Herz Imber, a Jewish poet from Złoczów, Austrian Galicia. Imber wrote the first version of the poem in 1877, when he was hosted by a Jewish scholar in Iași.

==History==
===Text===
The text of Hatikvah was written in 1878 by Naftali Herz Imber, a Jewish poet from Zolochiv (), a city nicknamed &quot;The City of Poets&quot;, then in Austrian Poland, today in Ukraine. His words &quot;Lashuv le&#x27;eretz avotenu&quot; (to return to the land of our forefathers) expressed its aspiration.

In 1882, Imber emigrated to Ottoman-ruled Palestine and read his poem to the pioneers of the early Jewish villages—Rishon LeZion, Rehovot, Gedera, and Yesud Hama&#x27;ala. In 1887, Shmuel Cohen, a very young (17 or 18 years old) resident of Rishon LeZion with a musical background, sang the poem by using a melody he knew from Romania and making it into a song, after witnessing the emotional responses of the Jewish farmers who had heard the poem. Cohen&#x27;s musical adaptation served as a catalyst and facilitated the poem&#x27;s rapid spread throughout the Zionist communities of Palestine.

Imber&#x27;s nine-stanza poem, (, &quot;Our Hope&quot;), put into words his thoughts and feelings following the establishment of Petah Tikva (literally &quot;Opening of Hope&quot;). Published in Imber&#x27;s first book , was subsequently adopted as an anthem by the Hovevei Zion and later by the Zionist Movement.

===Before the founding of Israel===
The Zionist Organization conducted two competitions for an anthem, the first in 1898 and the second, at the Fourth Zionist Congress, in 1900. The quality of the entries were all judged unsatisfactory and none was selected. Imber&#x27;s &quot;Tikvatenu&quot;, however, was popular, and a sessions at the Fifth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1901 concluded with the singing of the poem. During the Sixth Zionist Congress at Basel in 1903, the poem was sung by those opposed to accepting the proposal for a Jewish state in Uganda, their position in favor of the Jewish homeland in Palestine expressed in the line &quot;An eye still gazes toward Zion&quot;.

Although the poem was sung at subsequent congresses, it was only at the Eighteenth Zionist Congress in Prague in 1933 that a motion passed formally adopting &quot;Hatikvah&quot; as the anthem of the Zionist movement.

The British Mandate government briefly banned its public performance and broadcast from 1919, in response to an increase in Arab anti-Zionist political activity. 

A former member of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; reported that the song was spontaneously sung by Czech Jews at the entrance to the Auschwitz-Birkenau gas chamber in 1944. While singing they were beaten by Waffen-SS guards.

===Adoption as the Israeli national anthem===
When the State of Israel was established in 1948, &quot;Hatikvah&quot; was unofficially proclaimed the national anthem. It did not officially become the national anthem until November 2004, when an abbreviated and edited version was sanctioned by the Knesset in an amendment to the Flag and Coat-of-Arms Law (now renamed the Flag, Coat-of-Arms, and National Anthem Law).

In its modern rendering, the official text of the anthem incorporates only the first stanza and refrain of the original poem. The predominant theme in the remaining stanzas is the establishment of a sovereign and free nation in the Land of Israel, a hope largely seen as fulfilled with the founding of the State of Israel.

===Melody and its origins===
The melody for &quot;Hatikvah&quot; is based from &quot;La Mantovana&quot;, a 16th-century Italian song, composed by Giuseppe Cenci (Giuseppino del Biado) ca. 1600 with the text &quot;Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi da questo cielo&quot;. Its earliest known appearance in print was in the del Biado&#x27;s collection of madrigals. It was later known in early 17th-century Italy as . This melody gained wide currency in Renaissance Europe, under various titles, such as the , and the . It also served as a basis for a number of folk songs throughout Central Europe, for example the popular Slovenian children song . The best-known use of the melody prior to it becoming the Zionist anthem was by Czech composer Bedřich Smetana in his set of six symphonic poems celebrating Bohemia, &quot;Má vlast&quot; (&quot;My Homeland&quot;), namely in the second poem named after the river which flows through Prague, Vltava (also known as &quot;The Moldau&quot;). The melody was also used by the French composer Camille Saint-Saëns in &quot;Rhapsodie bretonne&quot;.

====Zionist adaptation====
The adaptation of the music for &quot;Hatikvah&quot; was set by Samuel Cohen in 1888. Cohen himself recalled many years later that he had hummed &quot;Hatikvah&quot; based on the melody from the song he had heard in Romania, &quot;Carul cu boi&quot; (the ox-driven cart).

The melody of &quot;Hatikvah&quot; follows a minor scale, which is often perceived as mournful in tone and is uncommon in national anthems. As the title &quot;The Hope&quot; and the words suggest, the import of the song is optimistic and the overall spirit uplifting.

===2017 boycott in UAE===
In October 2017, after Israeli judoka Tal Flicker won gold in the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Slam in the United Arab Emirates, officials played the International Judo Federation (IJF) anthem, instead of &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, which Flicker sang privately.

===Usage in film===
American composer John Williams adapted &quot;Hatikvah&quot; in the 2005 historical drama film &quot;Munich&quot;.

&quot;Hatikvah&quot; is also used both in the adaptation of Leon Uris&#x27;s novel, &quot;Exodus&quot;, and in the 1993 film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.

In 2022 Roman Shumunov filmed a TV series titled &quot;&quot; about the Israeli youth encounter with The Holocaust.

===Renditions, interpretations, and usage in popular music===
Barbra Streisand performed &quot;Hatikvah&quot; in 1978 at a televised music special called &quot;The Stars Salute Israel at 30&quot;, a performance which included a conversation by telephone and video link with former Prime Minister Golda Meir.

American musician Anderson .Paak&#x27;s 2016 release &quot;Come Down&quot; contains a sample of &quot;Hatikvah&quot; in English translation, attributed to producer Hi-Tek.

A 2018 rendition of the anthem by Israeli Jewish singer Daniel Sa&#x27;adon that took inspiration from the Levantine music and dance style dabke caused controversy and accusations of appropriation of Palestinian culture, as well as consternation from some Israelis due to the tune&#x27;s popularity with Hamas. Sa&#x27;adon, however, said that his desire was to &quot;show that the unity of cultures is possible through music&quot;, and that he has a longtime appreciation for Southwest Asian and North African musical styles, having grown up with Tunisian music in the home. Sa&#x27;adon said that despite receiving &quot;abusive comments&quot; from both the right and the left of the political spectrum, he also received praise from friends and colleagues in the music world, including Arab citizens of Israel.

On 25 May 2021, four days after the ceasefire that ended the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Israeli singers Omer Adam and Noa Kirel released a pop remix of &quot;Hatikvah&quot; under the title &quot;Hope&quot;. Produced by Scott Storch, it contains additional lyrics in English. It received mixed reviews, with some Israelis deeming it direspectful. Adam and Kirel donated their proceeds from the song to YAHAD United for Israel&#x27;s Soldiers.

==Text==
The official text of the Israeli national anthem corresponds to the first stanza and amended refrain of the original nine-stanza poem by Naftali Herz Imber. Along with the original Hebrew, the corresponding transliteration and English translation are listed below.
===Official Hebrew lyrics===
===English translation===
=== Original lyrics ===
=== Interpretation ===
Some people compare the first line of the refrain, &quot;Our hope is not yet lost&quot; (&quot;&quot;), to the opening of the Polish national anthem, &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot; (&quot;&quot;) or the Ukrainian national anthem, &quot;Ukraine Has Not Yet Perished&quot; (&quot;&quot;). This line may also be a Biblical allusion to Ezekiel&#x27;s &quot;Vision of the Dried Bones&quot; (Ezekiel 37: &quot;…Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost (Hebrew:אבדה תקותנו)&quot;), describing the despair of the Jewish people in exile, and God&#x27;s promise to redeem them and lead them back to the Land of Israel.

The official text of &quot;Hatikvah&quot; is relatively short; indeed it is a single complex sentence, consisting of two clauses: the subordinate clause posits the condition (&quot;As long as… A soul still yearns… And… An eye still watches…&quot;), while the independent clause specifies the outcome (&quot;Our hope is not yet lost… To be a free nation in our land&quot;).

==Objections and alternate proposals==
===By religious Jews===
Some religious Jews have criticised &quot;Hatikvah&quot; for the song&#x27;s lack of religious emphasis: there is no mention of God or the Torah in its lyrics.

Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook wrote an alternative anthem titled &quot;HaEmunah&quot; (&quot;The Faith&quot;) which he proposed as a replacement for &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, while still endorsing the original anthem.

J. Simcha Cohen wrote that Dovid Lifshitz used &quot;Lihyot am dati&quot;: &quot;to be a religious nation [in our land].&quot; 

===By non-Jewish Israelis===
&quot;Liberalism and the Right to Culture&quot;, written by Avishai Margalit and Moshe Halbertal, provides a social scientific perspective on the cultural dynamics in Israel, a country that is a vital home to many diverse religious groups. More specifically, Margalit and Halbertal cover the various responses towards &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, which they establish as the original anthem of a Zionist movement, one that holds a 2,000-year-long hope of returning to the homeland (&quot;Zion and Jerusalem&quot;) after a long period of exile.

To introduce the controversy of Israel&#x27;s national anthem, the authors provide two instances where &quot;Hatikvah&quot; is rejected for the estrangement that it creates between the minority cultural groups of Israel and its national Jewish politics. Those that object find trouble in the mere fact that the national anthem is exclusively Jewish while a significant proportion of the state&#x27;s citizenry is not Jewish and lacks any connection to the anthem&#x27;s content and implications, despite the fact that many other religious countries also have anthems emphasising their religion.

As Margalit and Halbertal continue to discuss, &quot;Hatikvah&quot; symbolises for many Arab-Israelis the struggle of loyalty that comes with having to dedicate oneself to either their historical or religious identity.

Specifically, Israeli-Arabs object to &quot;Hatikvah&quot; due to its explicit allusions to Jewishness. In particular, the text&#x27;s reference to the yearnings of &quot;a Jewish soul&quot; is often cited as preventing non-Jews from personally identifying with the anthem. Notable persons whose refusal to sing Hatikvah was brought to public attention include Druze politician Saleh Tarif, the first non-Jew appointed to the Israeli cabinet between 2001 and 2022, Raleb Majadale, the first Muslim to be appointed as a minister in the Israeli cabinet between 2007 and 2009, and Salim Joubran, an Israeli Arab who served as a Supreme Court justice between 2003 and 2017. For this reason from time to time proposals have been made to change the national anthem or to modify the text to make it inclusive of non-Jewish Israelis.

<text>Michael Bernays (27 November 183425 February 1897) was a German literary historian, and an important Goethe and Shakespeare scholar.

==Life==
He was born in Hamburg. His father, Isaac Bernays, died when he was fourteen years old. His adjustments were radically different from that of his two brothers, Jacob Bernays (1824-1881) and Berman Bernays (1826-1879), due to the traumatic loss of his father at an early age or other factors. He studied first law and then literature at Bonn and Heidelberg.

==Career==
He obtained a considerable reputation by his lectures on Shakespeare at Leipzig and an explanatory text to Beethoven&#x27;s music to Egmont. Having refused in 1866 an invitation to take part in the editorship of the &quot;Preussische Jahrbücher&quot;, in the same year he published his celebrated &quot;Zur Kritik und Geschichte des Goetheschen Textes&quot;.

He confirmed his reputation by his lectures at the university of Leipzig, and in 1873 accepted the post of extraordinary professor of German literature at Munich specially created for him by Ludwig II of Bavaria. Thus, he became first ever professor of modern German literary history at Munich University. He was for a while reader to Ludwig II of Bavaria. In 1874 he became an ordinary professor, a position which he resigned only in 1889 when he settled at Carlsruhe. He died there on 25 February 1897.

He along with Ludwig Geiger started a critical Goethe philosophy. Geiger edited the influential &quot;Goethe-Jahrbuch&quot; for more than thirty years. 

At an early age he became a Jewish Christian, whereas his brother Jakob remained a Rabbinical Jew. Among his other publications were: &quot;Briefe Goethes an F. A. Wolf&quot; (1868); &quot;Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Schlegelschen Shakespeare&quot; (1872); and an introduction to Hirzel&#x27;s collection entitled &quot;Der junge Goethe&quot; (1875). He also edited a revised edition of Voss&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. From his literary remains were published &quot;Schriften zur Kritik und Litteraturgeschichte&quot; (1895–1899).

<doc id="189970" wikidata="Q208296" url="?curid=189970" title="Cromer">
<text>Cromer ( ) is a coastal town and civil parish on the north coast of the English county of Norfolk. It is north of Norwich, north-northeast of London and east of Sheringham on the North Sea coastline.
The local government authorities are North Norfolk District Council, whose headquarters is on Holt Road in the town, and Norfolk County Council, based in Norwich. The civil parish has an area of and at the 2011 census had a population of 7,683.

The town is notable as a traditional tourist resort and for the Cromer crab, which forms the major source of income for local fishermen. The motto &quot;Gem of the Norfolk Coast&quot; is highlighted on the town&#x27;s road signs.

==History==

The town has given its name to the &quot;Cromerian Stage&quot; or &quot;Cromerian Complex&quot;, also called the &quot;Cromerian&quot;, a stage in the Pleistocene glacial history of north-western Europe.

Cromer is not mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. The place-name &#x27;Cromer&#x27; is first found in a will of 1262 and could mean &#x27;Crows&#x27; mere or lake&#x27;. There are other contenders for the derivation, a north-country word &#x27;cromer&#x27; meaning &#x27;a gap in the cliffs&#x27; or less likely a direct transfer from a Danish placename.

It is reasonable to assume that the present site of Cromer, around the parish church of Saints Peter and Paul, is what was in 1337 called Shipden-juxta-Felbrigg, and by the end of the 14th century known as Cromer. A reference to a place called Crowemere Shipden can be seen in a legal record, dated 1422, (1 Henry VI), the home of John Gees. The other Shipden is now about a quarter of a mile to the north east of the end of Cromer Pier, under the sea. Its site is marked by Church Rock, now no longer visible, even at a low spring tide. In 1888 a small pleasure steamer called &quot;Victoria&quot; struck the remains of the church tower, and the rock was subsequently blown up for safety. In the present day, members of Great Yarmouth sub-aqua club dived at the site, and salvaged artefacts from both the medieval church and the wreck of &quot;Victoria.&quot;

Cromer became a resort in the early 19th century, with some of the rich Norwich banking families making it their summer home. Visitors included the future King Edward VII, who played golf here. The resort&#x27;s facilities included the late-Victorian Cromer Pier, which is home to the Pavilion Theatre. In 1883 the London journalist Clement Scott went to Cromer and began to write about the area. He named the stretch of coastline, particularly the Overstrand and Sidestrand area, &quot;Poppyland&quot;, and the combination of the railway and his writing in the national press brought many visitors. The name &quot;Poppyland&quot; referred to the numerous poppies which grew (and still grow) at the roadside and in meadows.

Cromer suffered several bombing raids during the Second World War. Shortly after one raid, Cromer featured as the location for an episode of &quot;An American In England&quot;, written by Norman Corwin with the narrator staying in the &quot;Red Lion Hotel&quot; and retelling several local accounts of life in the town at wartime. The radio play first aired in the United States on 1 December 1942 on the CBS/Columbia Workshop programme starring Joe Julian. The account mentions some of the effects of the war on local people and businesses and the fact that the town adopted a , .

On 5 December 2013 the town was affected by a storm surge which caused significant damage to the town&#x27;s pier and seafront.

In 2016, the Cromer shoal chalk beds, thought to be Europe&#x27;s largest chalk reef, were officially designated as a Marine Conservation Zone.

==Economy==
Traditionally, Cromer was a fishing town. It grew as a fishing station over the centuries, and was a year-round fishery into the 20th century, with crabs and lobsters in the summer, drifting for longshore herring in the autumn and long-lining, primarily for cod, in the winter. The pattern of fishing has changed since the 1980s, and it is now almost completely focused on crabs and lobsters. The town is famous for the Cromer crab, which is now the major source of income for the local fishermen. In 2016, about ten boats plied their trade from the foot of the gangway on the east beach, with shops in the town selling fresh crab, whenever the boats go to sea. By 2018, experienced crabmen were having difficulty attracting young people to the business, perhaps because of the long working hours required during the season. Lobster trapping was also continuing.
Tourism developed in the town during the Victorian period and is now an important part of the local economy. The town is a popular resort and acts as a touring base for the surrounding area. The coastal location means that beach holidays and fishing are important, with the beach and pier being major draws. Visitor attractions within the town include Cromer Pier and the Pavilion Theatre on the pier. Close to the town&#x27;s pier the RNLI Henry Blogg Museum is housed inside the early 21st century Rocket House. The museum has the Cromer Lifeboat &quot;H F Bailey III&quot; (ON 777) as its centrepiece and illustrates the history of the town&#x27;s lifeboats and lifeboatman Henry Blogg&#x27;s most famous rescues.

The South American themed Amazona zoo park opened to the public in 2006 and is to the south of the town. The park covers of former brick kilns and woodland on the outskirts of the town and includes animals including jaguar and puma.

==Culture and community==

For one week in August the town celebrates its Carnival Week. Attractions include the crowning of a &#x27;royal family&#x27; including carnival queen, a street parade and a fancy dress competition. The event&#x27;s 50th anniversary was held in 2019.

Cromer is twinned with Nidda, Germany and Crest, France. The town has an Air Training Corps Squadron and an Army Cadet Force Platoon, based at Cromer High School.

The town has a Friday market and a number of independent retailers in its centre. Cromer Hospital provides services across the North Norfolk area. It includes a minor injuries unit and is run by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

Cromer Museum opened in 1978 and is housed in former fishermen&#x27;s cottages adjacent to the parish church on Church Street. The museum managed by Norfolk County Council contain items relating to the history of Cromer, including paintings and Poppyland china. It has two permanent galleries on the pioneering photographer, Olive Edis - Britain&#x27;s first female war photographer. A mock-up of a Victorian cottage and galleries containing geology and fossil remnants of the area which include part of the West Runton Mammoth.

==Landmarks==
Cromer stands between stretches of coastal cliffs which, to the east, are up to high. According to palaeontologist Dr James Neenan, from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, the cliffs are part of a Norfolk coastline area rich in Pleistocene fossils. In 2017 a prehistoric rhino was found in West Runton, dating back 700,000 years to the Cromerian Interglacial.

Cromer Pier dominates the sea front and is long. It features the Pavilion Theatre and dates from 1901. Cromer Lighthouse stands on the cliffs to the east of the town. The tower is tall. and stands above sea level. The light has a range of .
The Church of St Peter and St Paul dates from the 14th century and is in the centre of the town. After falling into disrepair it was rebuilt in the late 19th century by architect, Arthur Blomfield. At the Bell tower is the highest in the county. Also, of note are the vast stained glass windows which commemorate various members of the lifeboat crew and other features of the resort.

The Hotel de Paris was originally built in 1820 as a coastal residence for Lord Suffield. In 1830 the building was converted into a hotel by Pierre le Francois. Norfolk-born architect George Skipper extensively remodelled the building between 1895 and 1896. Today, the hotel which occupies an elevated location overlooking the town&#x27;s pier still provides accommodation to visitors. Other notable hotels include the 17th century Red Lion Hotel, the Victorian Sandcliff Hotel and the Edwardian Cliftonville Hotel.

Cromer Hall is located to the south of the town in Hall Road. The original hall was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt in 1829 in a Gothic Revival style, by Norfolk architect William John Donthorne. Henry Baring, of the Baring banking family, acquired the estate around this time. Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer was born at the hall in 1841. In 2010 the building was the home of the Cabbell Manners family. In 1901, author Arthur Conan Doyle was a guest at the hall. After hearing the legend of the Black Shuck, a ghostly black dog, he is thought to have been inspired to write the classic novel &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.
The Old Town hall, which was once the main public events venue in the town, was completed in 1890.

===Lifeboat station===

The fishermen also crewed Cromer&#x27;s two lifeboats. Most famous of the lifeboatmen was Henry Blogg, who received the RNLI gold medal for heroism three times, and the silver medal four times. Cromer Lifeboat Station was founded in 1804, the first in Norfolk. Rowing lifeboats were stationed there through the 19th century.

In the 1920s a lifeboat station was built at the end of the pier, enabling a motor lifeboat to be launched beyond the breakers. A number of notable rescues carried out between 1917 and 1941 made the lifeboat and the town well known throughout the United Kingdom and further afield. The area covered by the station is large, as there is a long run of coastline with no harbour – Great Yarmouth is 40 miles (65 km) by sea to the south east and the restricted harbour of Wells next the Sea 25 miles (40 km) to the west. Today the offshore lifeboat on the pier performs about a dozen rescues a year, with about the same number for the inshore lifeboat stationed on the beach.

The Duke of Kent officially named the town&#x27;s new lifeboat, &quot;Lester&quot;, in a ceremony on 8 September 2008.

==Transport==
Cromer railway station is a stop on the Bittern Line, which provides generally hourly services between and . Services are operated by Greater Anglia.

The railway came to Cromer in 1877, with the opening of Cromer High station by the Great Eastern Railway. Ten years later, a second station, &quot;Cromer Beach&quot;, was opened by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, bringing visitors in from the East Midlands; only this station remains today and it was renamed &quot;Cromer&quot; in 1969, following the closure of Cromer High station. Direct services were operated from London, Manchester, Leicester, Birmingham, Leeds, Peterborough and Sheffield. The now-closed Cromer tunnel linked Beach station with the Mundesley line to the east; it was the only railway tunnel to be built in Norfolk.

Bus services are provided by Sanders Coaches, which link the town with local destinations including Norwich, Sheringham, Holt, Wells-next-the-sea and North Walsham.

The A140 links Cromer with Norwich, the A148 (direct) and A149 (coast road) to King&#x27;s Lynn, and the A149 to the Norfolk Broads and Great Yarmouth. The B1159 is a coastal road out towards Mundesley.

The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. A private airfield, Northrepps Aerodrome, is located south-east of the town.

==Education==
Cromer Academy is the town&#x27;s only secondary school. It educates children aged 11 to 16. For sixth-form education, children travel to Sheringham, Paston College in North Walsham, or Norwich. The town also has a junior school educating children from 5 to 11 years of age, an infants school (Suffield Park infants) and an attached nursery.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either one of the two local relay transmitters (Overstrand and West Runston). 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk on 95.6 FM, Heart East on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly North Norfolk Radio) on 103.2 FM, and Poppyland Community Radio, a community online based station which broadcast from the town.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;North Norfolk News&quot; and &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;.

==Sport and leisure==

Cromer has sports clubs and leisure facilities. Situated on the cliffs between the town and Overstrand to the east, the Royal Cromer Golf Club was founded in 1888 and given royal status by the Prince of Wales, one of the founding members, in the same year. The course was originally designed by Old Tom Morris and hosted the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship in 1905, before which an unofficial match was held between British and American ladies, the first international golf match to be played. The club, which is the second oldest in Norfolk, has hosted PGA events.

Cromer Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club that is based on The Norton Warnes Cricket Ground on Overstrand Road.
Cromer CC have 2 Saturday senior XI teams that compete in the Norfolk Cricket Alliance League, a Women&#x27;s softball team in the NCB Women’s Softball Cricket League, and a junior section that play competitive cricket in the Junior Tier Groups of the Norfolk Cricket Alliance League.

Cabbell Park has been the home of Cromer Town F.C. since 1922. The long established club plays in the Premier Division of the Anglian Combination. The town&#x27;s tennis and squash courts are located at Norwich Road and are open to the public.

The Norfolk Coast Path passes through the town and is also the termination of the Weavers&#x27; Way. The Norfolk Coast Cycleway runs parallel to the coast and passes through a mixture of &quot;quiet roads&quot; and country lanes to link the town with Kings Lynn to the west and Great Yarmouth in the east.

Sea angling is popular and mixed catches including cod can be made from the town&#x27;s beaches. The pier provides the opportunity to capture specimen sized bass. Established in 2007, the North Norfolk Surf Lifesaving Club (North Norfolk SLSC) has its clubhouse on the town&#x27;s main promenade. Surfing is also carried out on the town&#x27;s beaches close to the pier. Equipment and lessons can be hired in season.

<text>Wallsend () is a town in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear, England, at the eastern end of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. It has a population of 43,842 and lies east of Newcastle upon Tyne.

==History==
===Roman Wallsend===
In Roman times, this was the site of the fort of Segedunum. This fort protected the eastern end of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which did not terminate at the western wall of the fort, but continued from its south-eastern corner down to the shore of the River Tyne. As David Breeze writes, &quot;In the early nineteenth century, as recorded by Bruce, John Buddle the Younger had often seen the Wall foundations extending far into the river when swimming there as a boy.&quot;

===Pre-Conquest===
The withdrawal of the Romans from the Wall immediately brought the Picts from the north and shortly afterwards the Angles, sailing from near the mouth of the River Elbe with frequent raids both from sea and from land. Ida the Saxon laid waste to the whole of the north in 547 and Wallsend doubtless suffered in the general devastation. It was not until the golden age of Northumberland under Edwin of Northumbria, and the subsequent introduction of the Christian faith by King Oswald of Northumbria (635-642) and St Aidan, that Wallsend enjoyed a time of peace and progress. This time of peace came to an abrupt end in 794 when the Danes (or Vikings) swarmed up the Tyne in great numbers. In the years before the Norman conquest there was a struggle for mastery between Danes and Angles.

===19th century to present===
Several urban sanitary districts were formed in the parish in the late 19th century: Willington Quay, Howdon and Wallsend itself. The first two joined to form the Willington Quay urban district under the Local Government Act 1894, with the portion of the parish outside any urban sanitary district forming the parish of Willington in Tynemouth Rural District. Wallsend was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1901, and in 1910 took over Willington Quay and Willington, and also part of the parish of Longbenton.
St Peter&#x27;s Church, Wallsend (Church of England) has four fine stained glass windows by Michael Healy of An Túr Gloine: &quot;St Patrick, St Peter and St Luke&quot; (1913); &quot;Our Lord with the Nativity and the Shepherds&quot; (1919); &quot;Angel of the Resurrection with St George and St Christopher&quot; (1921); &quot;Our Lord walking on water&quot; (1921); and a window by Ethel Rhind, also of An Túr Gloine, depicting &quot;The Good Shepherd, Mary of Bethany, David&quot; (1921).

===Shipbuilding===

Wallsend has a history of shipbuilding and was the home of the Wigham Richardson shipyard, which later amalgamated to form Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson, probably best known for building the RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot;. This express liner held the Blue Riband, for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic, for 22 years.

Other famous ships included the RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot; which rescued the survivors from the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, and the icebreaker &quot;Krasin&quot; (launched as &quot;Sviatogor&quot;) which rescued the Umberto Nobile expedition on Spitzbergen in 1928, when Roald Amundsen perished. The story is retold in the movie &quot;The Red Tent&quot;, starring Sean Connery and Peter Finch.

Charles Parsons launched his revolutionary &quot;Turbinia&quot; here in 1894, thus not only revolutionising the navies of the world, but also, through the large-scale production of affordable electricity, making a significant contribution to the modern age. He features in a BBC film called &quot;The Inventor of the Twentieth Century&quot;.

Russian novelist Yevgeny Zamyatin worked at Swan Hunter in 1916–17, and used it as background for his great anti-utopian work &quot;We&quot; which was a major influence on George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

World War II ships built here include and which took part in the sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Other ships built there include the new HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in the 1980s.

The shipyard closed in 2007. The musical &quot;The Last Ship&quot; by Sting is set in the shipyard. The former Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Company Shipyard continues to operate, constructing offshore oil rigs and as a TV studio: productions from there include the hit ITV drama &quot;Vera&quot; starring Brenda Blethyn and &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot; starring Martin Shaw.

===Coal mining===
Much of Wallsend&#x27;s early industry was driven by coal mining. The Wallsend Colliery consisted of seven pits which were active between 1778 and 1935. In the 1820s the pits became incorporated as Russell&#x27;s Colliery, which then became the Wallsend and Hebburn Coal Company Ltd. By 1924 the colliery employed 2,183 people. Its most prominent manager was mining and railway engineer John Buddle who helped develop the Davy Lamp.

Between 1767 and 1925 there were 11 major incidents recorded at the colliery resulting in over 209 deaths. On 18 June 1835 a gas explosion in one of the tunnels killed 102 miners, the youngest of whom was aged eight and the oldest 75. Many of the dead were found with their cloth caps in their mouths. This is believed to have been an attempt to prevent inhalation of the gas which eventually killed them. The bodies were extracted and buried in St Peter&#x27;s churchyard at the top of the bank overlooking the Wallsend Burn. A plaque has been erected within the churchyard to commemorate this tragedy.

===Twentieth century===
The town has expanded greatly in terms of housing since the end of World War II, and since the 1960s.
Wallsend Town Centre—including the main shopping area known as the &quot;Wallsend Forum&quot;—is in fact to the west of the land covered by the town. To the north of this area lies the older estate of High Farm and the new estate of Hadrian Lodge. The town centre of Wallsend is separated from the eastern areas of the town by the Wallsend Burn, a stream running through a small glacial valley from north-west to south-east and through the Willington Gut into the River Tyne. To the east of the Burn is the old area of Holy Cross, which contains the ruins of a medieval church, the pre-war estate of Rosehill and the mainly post-war estate of Howdon. To the south of Howdon lies Willington Quay which, as its name suggests, once served shipping but which is now dominated by industry and housing. East Howdon forms a small enclave between Willington Quay and North Shields.

The town&#x27;s principal thoroughfare and shopping street is the High Street. To the north of this street is Wallsend Green, the town&#x27;s most picturesque area, consisting of large houses as well as the Sir G B Hunter Memorial Hospital, surrounding a green square. Behind the Green, where the Burn runs through the parkland of the Hall Grounds lies Wallsend Park, a traditional British municipal park, whose restoration has frequently been demanded by local residents and is planned with many improvements such as a skate and BMX park, better pathways, and a rebuilding of the Duffy Memorial Fountain. On Rheydt Avenue in Wallsend is Centurion Park Golf Club, previously named Wallsend Golf Club. It has 18 holes and a driving range.

The town is home to Wallsend Boys Club, which has produced many famous football players such as Alan Shearer, Lee Clark, Steve Watson, Peter Beardsley, Robbie Elliott, Mick Tait and Michael Carrick. It is also hometown and birthplace to internationally successful musician Sting, whose song &quot;All This Time&quot; refers to the Roman wall and fort. The musical &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, composed and written by Sting, is set in Wallsend.

Wallsend Town Hall, a large Edwardian Baroque style building in High Street East, was completed in 1908.

===Commemorating Roman history===
In dedication to its Roman heritage, Wallsend&#x27;s historic name &quot;Segedunum&quot; is shown in many places in the town, and signs with Latin wordings can also be found. Wallsend Metro Station has some signs in English and Latin. Such translations tend to amuse, with contrasts between today&#x27;s and ancient times. Segedunum Roman Fort Museum has displays on Roman history as well as reconstructions of a bath house and a section of the Roman Wall which once stood on the site.

==Demography==
In 2011, Wallsend had a population of 43,826 compared with 42,842 in the previous census.

In Wallsend, 4.9% of the population is non-white British, which is the same as the surrounding borough. It also has the same percentage of Asian people, but has slightly more black people. Wallsend is the second least ethnically diverse major urban subdivision in Tyneside and has a larger percentage of white British people compared with Tynemouth which is also slightly larger in population. However it has more ethnic minorities than Jarrow, which is south of the river Tyne.

<text>Sabbatai Zevi (August 1, 1626 – ) was an Ottoman Jewish mystic, and ordained rabbi from Smyrna (now İzmir, Turkey). His family origins may have been Ashkenazi or Sephardi. Active throughout the Ottoman Empire, Zevi claimed to be the long-awaited Jewish Messiah and founded the Sabbatean movement. Central to his teachings was the belief that, during the Messianic age, acts traditionally considered sinful would transform into righteous ones. This antinomian doctrine led Zevi and his followers to deliberately violate Jewish commandments, a controversial practice that later inspired movements like the Frankists.

Upon arriving in Constantinople in February 1666, Sabbatai was imprisoned on the order of the grand vizier Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha. In September of that same year, after being moved from different prisons around the capital to the imperial courts&#x27; seat in Adrianople (now Edirne), he was judged on accusations of fomenting sedition. Sabbatai was given the choice of either facing death by some type of ordeal or of converting to Islam by the Grand Vizier representing Sultan Mehmed IV. He seems to have chosen the latter course, donning a turban from that time on. The heads of the Ottoman state then rewarded him with a generous pension for complying with their political and religious plans. About 300 families who followed Zevi also converted to Islam and became known as Dönme.

Subsequently, the Ottomans banished him twice, first to Constantinople, and, when he was heard singing Psalms with Jews, to a small town known today as Ulcinj in present-day Montenegro. He later died in isolation.

==Early life and education==
Sabbatai Zevi was born in the Ottoman city of Smyrna, supposedly on Tisha B&#x27;Av—one of Judaism&#x27;s full fast days—in 1626. In Hebrew, &quot;Sabbatai&quot; means &quot;Saturn&quot;, and in Jewish tradition, &quot;the reign of Sabbatai&quot;, the highest planet, was often linked to the advent of the Messiah. Zevi&#x27;s family was from Patras and of either Ashkenazi (according to &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot;) or Spanish descent (according to &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;). His father, Mordecai, was a poultry dealer in the Morea. During the wars between Turkey and Venice, Smyrna became the center of Levantine trade, and Mordecai became the Smyrna agent of an English trading house, achieving some wealth in the process.

Following the prevailing Jewish custom of the time, Sabbatai&#x27;s father had him study the Talmud. He attended a yeshiva under the rabbi of Smyrna, Joseph Escapa. Studies in &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) did not appeal to him, but apparently, Zevi did attain proficiency in the Talmud. At the same time, he was fascinated by mysticism and the Kabbalah and was influenced by Isaac Luria. The practical Kabbalah, whose devotees used asceticism to communicate with God and the angels, to predict the future, and perform miracles, was especially appealing to him. As well as Luria&#x27;s writings, he read the &quot;Zohar&quot; and practiced asceticism and purification exercises called &quot;tikkunim&quot;.

==Personal history==

===Influence of English millenarianism===
During the first half of the 17th century, millenarian ideas about the approach of the messianic time were popular. They included ideas about the redemption of the Jews and their return to the land of Israel with independent sovereignty. The apocalyptic year was identified by Christian authors as 1666, and millenarianism was widespread in England. This belief was so prevalent that Menasseh Ben Israel, in his letter to Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament, appealed to it as a reason to readmit Jews into England, saying, &quot;[T]he opinions of many Christians and mine do concur herein, that we both believe that the restoring time of our Nation into their native country is very near at hand.&quot;

As he was the agent for an English trading house in Smyrna, Sabbatai&#x27;s father must have had business contact with English people. His son may have learned something about Western millenarian expectations at home. Scholars are still assessing how much influence English and Dutch Calvinist millenarianism had on the messianic movement that developed around Zevi&#x27;s activities.

===Claims to being the expected Jewish Messiah===

Along with general messianic beliefs, there was another computation, based on a passage in the &quot;Zohar&quot; (a famous Jewish mystical text), that Israel would be redeemed by the long-awaited Jewish Messiah in 1648.

In 1648, Sabbatai announced to his followers in Smyrna that he was the anticipated messianic redeemer. To prove this, he started to pronounce the Tetragrammaton, an act which Judaism prohibited to all but the High Priest of Israel in the Temple in Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. This act was, therefore, highly symbolic for scholars acquainted with rabbinic and Kabbalistic literature. Sabbatai also claimed he could fly but told his followers that he could not do so publicly because they were &quot;not worthy enough&quot; to witness such a sight. He also claimed to have visions of God. Sabbatai revealed his claim to being the Messiah early on to Isaac Silveyra and Moses Pinheiro, the latter a brother-in-law of the Italian rabbi and Kabbalist Joseph Ergas.

However, at a mere 22, Sabbatai was still too young to be considered an established rabbinic authority; his influence on the local community was limited. Even though he had led the pious life of a mystic in Smyrna for several years, the older, more established rabbinic leadership was suspicious of his activities and the local college of rabbis. Headed by his teacher, Joseph Escapa, they watched him. When his messianic pretensions became too bold, he and his followers were subjected to an edict of &quot;ḥerem&quot;, a type of excommunication in Judaism.

In about 1651 (or 1654), the rabbis banished Sabbatai and his disciples from Smyrna. It is uncertain where he went from there, but by 1658, he surfaced in Constantinople. There, he met a preacher, Abraham Yachini, a disciple of the Talmudic scholar Joseph Trani, who confirmed his messianic mission. Yachini is said to have forged a manuscript in archaic characters that bore testimony to Sabbatai&#x27;s claim to being the Messiah. It was entitled &quot;The Great Wisdom of Solomon&quot; and began:
===In Salonica, Cairo, and Jerusalem===
Equipped with this document, Sabbatai chose Salonica, which was then a hub of Kabbalistic dialogue, as his base. He proclaimed himself the Messiah, or &quot;anointed one,&quot; and attracted a large following by hosting various mystical events. For instance, he celebrated his marriage to the Torah, referring to it as the &quot;One Without End&quot; (the &quot;Ein Sof&quot;), and organized a solemn festival to which he invited his friends. However, the rabbis of Salonica, led by Rabbi Hiyya Abraham Di Boton, expelled him from the city. Reports vary on his subsequent movements, with Alexandria, Athens, Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Smyrna mentioned as possible temporary bases he might have taken. Eventually, he settled in Cairo, where he lived for about two years (1660–1662).

There he befriended Raphael Joseph Halabi (of Aleppo), a wealthy and influential Jew who held the high position of mint-master and tax-farmer in Cairo under the Ottoman government. Raphael Joseph led an ascetic life, which included fasting, bathing in cold water, and scourging himself at night, and used his great wealth for charity, supporting poor Talmudists and Kabbalists, 50 of whom reportedly dined at his table regularly. He became a supporter and promoter of Sabbatai&#x27;s messianic claims.

In about 1663, Sabbatai moved on to Jerusalem, where he resumed his former ascetic practice of frequent fasting and other penances. Many saw this as proof of his extraordinary piety. He was said to have a good voice and attracted large audiences when he sang psalms all night long or Spanish love songs to which he gave mystical interpretations. At other times, he prayed and cried at the graves of pious men and women or distributed sweetmeats to children on the streets. Gradually, he gathered a larger circle of adherents.

At the time, the Jewish community in Jerusalem desperately needed money to pay the heavy taxes levied by the Ottoman government. Known as the favourite of the rich and powerful Raphael Joseph Halabi in Cairo, Sabbatai was chosen to appeal to him for money and support, and his success in getting the funds to pay off the Turks raised his prestige. His followers dated his public career from this journey to Cairo.

===Marriage to Sarah===
Another significant event during his second stay in Cairo contributed to Sabbatai&#x27;s reputation in the Jewish community. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising in Poland, a young Jewish orphan named Sarah was discovered by Christians and sent to a convent for care. After ten years, at around sixteen, she escaped—claiming it was through a miracle—and made her way to Amsterdam. Subsequently, she traveled to Livorno, where reports indicated that she led a life of prostitution while also embracing the belief that she would become the bride of the Messiah, whose arrival was thought to be imminent.

When a report of her adventures reached Cairo, Sabbatai claimed that such a consort had been promised to him in a dream because he, as the Messiah, was bound to fall in love with an unchaste woman. He reportedly sent messengers to Livorno to bring Sarah to him, and they were married at Halabi&#x27;s house. Her beauty and eccentricity reportedly helped him gain new followers. Through her, a new romantic and licentious element entered Sabbatai&#x27;s career. The overturning of her past life was interpreted by Sabbatai&#x27;s followers as further confirmation of his messiahship, following the Biblical story of the prophet Hosea, who had also been commanded to take a &quot;wife of whoredom&quot; as the first symbolic act of his calling.

===Nathan of Gaza===

With Halabi&#x27;s financial and political backing, a charming wife, and many additional followers, Sabbatai returned to Jerusalem in triumph. Passing through the city of Gaza, which at the time had an important Jewish community, he met Nathan Benjamin Levi, known since as Nathan of Gaza (), who became very active in Sabbatai&#x27;s messianic career, serving as his right-hand man and declaring himself to be the risen Elijah, who, it was predicted, would proclaim the arrival of the Messiah. In 1665, Nathan announced that the Messianic Age would begin in 1666 with the conquest of the world without bloodshed. The Messiah would lead the Ten Lost Tribes back to the Holy Land, &quot;riding on a lion with a seven-headed dragon in its jaws&quot;.

The rabbis of Jerusalem viewed Sabbatai&#x27;s movement with great suspicion and threatened its followers with excommunication. Acknowledging that Jerusalem was not the best place to carry out his plans, Sabbatai left for his native Smyrna. Nathan proclaimed that, henceforth, Gaza, rather than Jerusalem, would be the sacred city. On his way from Jerusalem to Smyrna, Sabbatai was greeted enthusiastically in Aleppo. In Smyrna, which he reached in the autumn of 1665, great homage was paid to him. After some hesitation, he declared himself to be the expected Messiah during Rosh Hashanah in 1665; his declaration was made in the synagogue, with the blowing of shofars, and shouts of &quot;Long live our King, our Messiah!&quot;

His followers then began to refer to him as &quot;AMIRAH&quot;, a Hebrew acronym for the phrase &quot;Our Lord and King, his Majesty be exalted&quot; (&quot;Adoneinu Malkeinu Yarum Hodo&quot;).

===Proclaimed messiah===

Sabbatai became the community leader, assisted by his wife, and used his power to crush any opposition. He deposed the existing rabbi of Smyrna, Aaron Lapapa, and appointed Chaim Benveniste in his place. Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands were already centres of his messianic movement, and the Jews of Hamburg and Amsterdam learned of the events in Smyrna from Christians. Henry Oldenburg, a German savant who became the first secretary of the Royal Society, wrote to Baruch Spinoza (&quot;Spinozae Epistolae&quot; No. 33): &quot;All the world here is talking of a rumour of the return of the Israelites ... to their own country. ... Should the news be confirmed, it may bring about a revolution in all things.&quot;

Sabbatai&#x27;s followers soon included many prominent rabbis, such as Isaac Aboab da Fonseca, Moses Raphael de Aguilar, Moshe ben Yonatan Galante, Moses ben Mordecai Zacuto, and Chaim Benveniste. Benjamin Musaphia, an adherent of Spinoza, also became a follower. Meanwhile, fantastic reports circulated and were widely believed. For example, it was said, &quot;In the north of Scotland a ship had appeared with silken sails and ropes, manned by sailors who spoke Hebrew. The flag bore the inscription &#x27;The Twelve Tribes of Israel&#x27;.&quot; The Jewish community of Avignon, France, prepared to emigrate to the new kingdom in the spring of 1666.

Jewish readiness to believe Sabbatai Zevi&#x27;s messianic claims may largely be explained by the desperate state of European Jewry in the mid-17th century. The bloody pogroms of Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the cossack riots had wiped out an estimated 10,000–20,000 Jews in Eastern Europe and destroyed many centres of Jewish learning and communal life. 

===Spread of Sabbatai Zevi&#x27;s influence===

Probably with his consent, Sabbatai&#x27;s adherents planned to abolish most of the &quot;Halakha&quot;, including the &quot;mitzvos&quot;, because, according to a minority opinion in the Talmud, in the messianic time there would no longer be holy obligations. The fast of the Tenth of Tevet became a day of feasting and rejoicing. In contrast to this viewpoint, Professor Maoz Kahane demonstrated that Shabbtai Zevi himself did not aim to alter the entirety of halakha, but rather sought to modify specific aspects of it. Furthermore, each of these modifications was justified by a halakhic rationale. Samuel Primo, who became Sabbatai&#x27;s secretary when he went to Smyrna, directed the following circular to all of the Jews in the name of the Messiah:

The first-begotten Son of God, Shabbethai Tebi, Messiah and Redeemer of the people of Israel, to all the sons of Israel, Peace! Since ye have been deemed worthy to behold the great day and the fulfilment of God&#x27;s word by the Prophets, your lament and sorrow must be changed into joy, and your fasting into merriment; for ye shall weep no more. Rejoice with song and melody, and change the day formerly spent in sadness and sorrow into a day of jubilee, because I have appeared.

Primo&#x27;s message was considered blasphemous, as Sabbatai wanted to celebrate his own birthday rather than the holy day. There was outrage and dissension in the communities, while many leaders sympathetic to the movement were shocked by such radical innovations. Solomon Algazi, a prominent Talmudist of Smyrna, and other members of the rabbinate who opposed the abolition of the fast, narrowly escaped death at the hands of Sabbatai&#x27;s followers.

===In Constantinople===
At the beginning of 1666, Sabbatai left Smyrna for Constantinople (İstanbul in present-day Turkey), possibly forced out by city officials. Since Nathan of Gaza had prophesied that, once in Constantinople, Sabbatai would place the sultan&#x27;s crown on his own head, the grand vizier, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmet Paşa, ordered his immediate arrest and had him imprisoned, maybe to avoid any doubts as to the power still wielded by the Sultanate. However, his imprisonment discouraged neither Sabbatai nor his followers. He was treated well in prison, perhaps because of bribes, strengthening his followers&#x27; belief in him. Meanwhile, Nathan of Gaza, Abraham Yachini, and others circulated reports about the activities performed by the Messiah claimant supposedly performing in the Ottoman capital, and the messianic expectations in the Jewish diasporas continued to rise.

===At Abydos (&quot;Migdal Oz&quot;)===
After two months&#x27; imprisonment in Constantinople, Sabbatai was moved to the state prison castle at Abydos, Hellespont, accompanied by some of his friends. The Sabbataeans then renamed the fortress &quot;Migdal Oz&quot; (&quot;Tower [of] Strength&quot;). As Sabbatai had arrived on the day preceding Passover, he slew a paschal lamb for himself and his followers and ate it with its fat, a violation of &quot;Halakha&quot;. He is said to have pronounced over it the benediction: &quot;Blessed be God who hath restored again that which was forbidden.&quot;

The immense sums sent to him by his rich followers, the charms of the queenly Sarah, and the cooperation shown by the Ottoman officials and others enabled Sabbatai to show off almost royal splendor in prison at Abydos. Accounts of his life there were exaggerated and spread among Jews in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in some parts of Europe, Jews began to unroof their houses and prepare for a new &quot;exodus&quot;. In almost every synagogue, Sabbatai&#x27;s initials were posted, and prayers for him were inserted in the following form: &quot;Bless our Lord and King, the holy and righteous Sabbatai Zevi, the Messiah of the God of Jacob.&quot; In Hamburg, the council introduced the custom of praying for Sabbatai not only on Shabbat but also on Monday and Thursday; unbelievers were compelled to remain in the synagogue and join in the prayer with a loud &quot;Amen&quot;. Sabbatai&#x27;s picture was printed with that of King David in most prayer books, along with his Kabbalistic formulas and penances.

Such innovations caused great commotion in some communities. In Moravia, excitement reached such a pitch that the government had to intervene, while at Sale, Morocco, the emir ordered a persecution of the Jews. During this period, Sabbatai declared the fasts of the Seventeenth of Tammuz and the Ninth of Av (his birthday) would henceforth be feast days and contemplated converting the Day of Atonement to one of celebration.

===Nehemiah ha-Kohen===

While Sabbatai was in Abydos prison, an incident ultimately led to his downfall. Polish Jewish communities, hearing of Sabbatai&#x27;s Messianic claims, sent the Kabbalist Nehemiah Ha-Kohen to interview him in his captivity. Nehemiah reached Abydos, after a journey of three months at the beginning of September 1666. The meeting did not go well—Nehemiah declared Sabbatai an impostor. Some Sabbataians are said to have contemplated murdering Nehemiah as a rival.

===Conversion to Islam===
Nehemiah, however, escaped to Constantinople, where he pretended to embrace Islam to get an audience with the &quot;kaymakam&quot; to tell him of Sabbatai&#x27;s ambitions. The &quot;kaymakam&quot; informed Sultan Mehmed IV and Sabbatai was removed from Abydos and taken to Adrianople, where the vizier gave him three choices; subject himself to a trial of his divinity in the form of a volley of arrows (should the archers miss, his divinity would be proven); be impaled; or convert to Islam.

On the following day (September 16, 1666), Zevi appeared before the sultan, cast off his Jewish garb, and put a Turkish turban on his head, thereby accomplishing his conversion to Islam. Satisfied, the sultan rewarded Sabbatai by conferring on him the title (Mahmed) &quot;Effendi&quot; and appointing him as his doorkeeper on a generous salary. Sarah and approximately 300 families among his followers also converted to Islam. Thereafter, these new Muslims were known as Dönme. Sabbatai was ordered to take a second wife to confirm his conversion. Some days afterwards, he wrote to the community in Smyrna: &quot;God has made me an Ishmaelite; He commanded, and it was done. The ninth day of my regeneration.&quot;

===Disillusionment===

Sabbatai&#x27;s conversion devastated his followers, and Muslims and Christians alike ridiculed them. Despite his apostasy, many of his adherents still believed in him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the messianic scheme. Those such as Nathan of Gaza and Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement, encouraged such belief. In many communities, the Seventeenth of Tammuz and the Ninth of Av were still observed as feast days despite bans and excommunications by the rabbis.

At times, Sabbatai assumed the role of a pious Muslim and reviled Judaism; at others, he associated with Jews as one of their own faith. In March 1668, he announced that he had been filled with the Holy Spirit at Passover and had received a revelation.

Either Sabbatai or one of his followers published a mystical work claiming he was the true Messiah despite his conversion and that his goal was to bring thousands of Muslims to Judaism. However, he told the sultan that he was trying to convert Jews to Islam, and the sultan permitted him to associate with other Jews and preach in their synagogues.

===Last years===
Gradually, the Turks tired of Sabbatai&#x27;s antics, ending his doorkeeper&#x27;s salary. At the beginning of 1673, the sultan had Zevi exiled to Ulcinj (&quot;Dulcigno&quot;, ), where his wife died in 1674. Zevi then married Esther, the daughter of rabbi Joseph Filosoff of Thessaloniki.

===Death===
In August 1676, Sabbatai wrote to the Jewish community in Berat, Albania, requesting religious books. Shortly thereafter, he died in isolation—according to some accounts, on September 17, 1676, the High Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Upon his death, his widow, brother, and children by his first wife moved to Thessaloniki.

His tomb was believed to have been in Berat at a &quot;tekke&quot; built in the yard of the Imperial Mosque (), where a tomb stood until 1967. Research done in 1985 suggested that he was actually buried in Dulcigno. His biographer, Gershom Scholem, mentioned that his tomb was visited by Dönme pilgrims from Salonika until the early 20th century.

&quot;By the 1680s, the Dönme had congregated in Salonica, the cosmopolitan and majority-Jewish city in Ottoman Greece. For the next 250 years, they would lead an independent communal life—intermarrying, doing business together, maintaining their own shrines, and handing down their secret traditions.&quot;

== Legacy ==
By the 19th century, the Dönme had become prominent in the tobacco and textile trades. They established progressive schools and some members became politically active. Many joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the revolutionary party known as the Young Turks. With the major Dönmeh city of Selanik (now Thessaloniki) becoming part of Greece in 1912, Greece expelled the Muslims, including the Dönme, from its territory, with most migrating to Turkey. This was finalized with the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. By the mid-20th century they were becoming highly assimilated.

Although little is known about them, various groups called Dönme continue to follow Sabbatai Zevi today, mostly in Turkey. Estimates of the numbers vary. As of 2016 there are &#x27;perhaps 2,000&#x27; believing Dönme still living in Turkey, though this is dwarfed by the numbers of individual with descent from the group. They have been described as presenting themselves as Muslim in public whilst practising their own forms of messianic/mystical Jewish beliefs in private. Some claim that Dönme still play a role in Turkish politics (one of interference), particularly some political parties in Turkey like the MHP. However, others dismiss it as an antisemitic conspiracy theory. 

The Dönme eventually split into three sects, each with quite different beliefs, as Ottoman Jewish scholars Abraham Danon, and Joseph Néhama pointed out in French-language Jewish Studies journal articles over a hundred years ago. In the 1930s a comprehensive study on the history of the sects was also published in French by Abraham Galanté. More recently, Professor Cengiz Şişman has published a new study called &quot;The Burden of Silence&quot;. According to a review published in the Israeli newspaper &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, the branch known as Karakaş follow Sufi-influenced practices, while the Kapancıs have not been influenced by Islam at all and are now completely secular.

A house in the centre of İzmir close to the Agora has long been associated with Sabbetai Zevi. Having been left in ruins as recently as 2015, it has since been restored to its original style.

<text>Jarrow ( or ) is a town in South Tyneside in the county of Tyne and Wear, England. Historically in County Durham, it is on the south bank of the River Tyne, about from the east coast. The 2011 census area classed Hebburn and the Boldons as part of the town, it had a population of 43,431. It is home to the southern portal of the Tyne Tunnel and east of Newcastle upon Tyne. 

In the eighth century, St Paul&#x27;s Monastery in Jarrow (now Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey) was the home of the Venerable Bede, who is regarded as the greatest Anglo-Saxon scholar and the father of English history. The town is part of the historic County Palatine of Durham. From the middle of the 19th century until 1935, Jarrow was a centre for shipbuilding, and was the starting point of the Jarrow March against unemployment in 1936.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Jarrow&#x27;s name is first recorded in the 8th century. It derives from the Gyrwe, an Anglian tribe that lived here. The Gyrwe&#x27;s name means &quot;fen dwellers&quot;, perhaps in reference to Jarrow Slake (a now-drained wetland that lay at the confluence of the Tyne and the Don). The place-name would normally have developed into &quot;Yarrow&quot; in modern English, but as with Jesmond, Norman influence resulted in the initial becoming .

===Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey===

The Monastery of Paul of Tarsus in Jarrow, part of the twin foundation Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey, was once the home of the Venerable Bede, whose most notable works include &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; and the translation of the Gospel of John into Old English. Along with the abbey at Wearmouth, Jarrow became a centre of learning and had the largest library north of the Alps, primarily due to the widespread travels of Benedict Biscop, its founder. In 794 Jarrow became the second target in England of the Vikings, who had plundered Lindisfarne in 793. The monastery was later dissolved by Henry VIII. The ruins of the monastery are now associated with and partly built into the present-day church of St. Paul, which stands on the site. One wall of the church contains the oldest stained glass window in the world, dating from about AD 600. Just beside the monastery is Jarrow Hall, a working museum dedicated to the life and times of Bede. This incorporates Jarrow Hall, a grade II listed building and significant local landmark.

The world&#x27;s oldest complete Bible, written in Latin to be presented to the then Pope (Gregory II), was produced at this monastery – the Codex Amiatinus. It is currently safeguarded in the Laurentian Library, Florence, Italy.

Originally three copies of the Bible were commissioned by Ceolfrid in 692. This date has been established as the double monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow secured a grant of additional land to raise the 2000 head of cattle needed to produce the vellum for the Bible&#x27;s pages. Saint Ceolfrid accompanied one copy (originally intended for Gregory I) on its journey to be presented to Gregory II, but he died en route to Rome. The book later appears in the ninth century in the Abbey of the Saviour, Monte Amiata in Tuscany (hence the description &quot;Amiatinus&quot;), where it remained until 1786 when it passed to the Laurentian Library in Florence.

===19th century to present===
Jarrow remained a small mid-Tyne town until the introduction of heavy industries such as coal mining and shipbuilding. Charles Mark Palmer established a shipyard – Palmer&#x27;s Shipbuilding and Iron Company – in 1852 and became the first armour-plate manufacturer in the world. &quot;John Bowes&quot;, the first iron screw collier, revived the Tyne coal trade, and Palmer&#x27;s was also responsible for the first modern cargo ship, as well as a number of notable warships. Around 1,000 ships were built at the yard, they also produced small fishing boats to catch eel within the River Tyne, a delicacy at the time. Jarrow Town Hall was erected in Grange Road and officially opened in 1904.

Palmer&#x27;s employed as much as 80% of the town&#x27;s working population until its closure in 1933 following purchase by National Shipbuilders Securities Ltd. (NSS). This organisation had been set up by Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s Conservative government in the 1920s, but the first public statement had been made in 1930 whilst the Labour Party was in office. The aim of NSS was to reduce capacity within the British shipyards. In fact Palmer&#x27;s yard was relatively efficient and modern, but had serious financial problems. As from 1935, Olympic, the sister ship of RMS Titanic, was partially demolished at Jarrow, being towed in 1937 to Inverkeithing, Scotland for final scrapping.

The Great Depression brought so much hardship to Jarrow that the town was described by &quot;Life&quot; as &quot;cursed.&quot; The closure of the shipyard was responsible for one of the events for which Jarrow is best known. Jarrow is marked in history as the starting point in 1936 of the Jarrow March to London to protest against unemployment in Britain. Jarrow Member of Parliament (MP) Ellen Wilkinson wrote about these events in her book &quot;The Town That Was Murdered&quot; (1939). Some doubt has been cast by historians as to how effective events such as the Jarrow March actually were but there is some evidence that they stimulated interest in regenerating &#x27;distressed areas&#x27;. 1938 saw the establishment of a ship breaking yard and engineering works in the town, followed by the creation of a steelworks in 1939.

The Jarrow rail disaster was a train collision that occurred on the 17 December 1915 at the Bede junction on a North Eastern Railway line. The collision was caused by a signalman&#x27;s error and seventeen people died in the collision.

The Second World War revived the town&#x27;s fortunes as the Royal Navy was in need of ships to be built. After 1945 the shipbuilding industries were nationalised. The last shipyard in the town closed in 1980.

In August 2014 a group of mothers from Darlington organised a march from Jarrow to London to oppose the privatisation of the NHS. The march took place in September 2014 and 3,000–5,000 people participated in the event.

==Education==
Jarrow&#x27;s needs for secondary education are currently served by Jarrow School, formerly Springfield Comprehensive. Springfield was merged with another of Jarrow&#x27;s secondary schools, Hedworthfield Comprehensive at Fellgate, following a gradual reduction of the number of new pupils for the yearly intake of 11-year-olds to the point where keeping both schools open was no longer viable. As of 2008 plans to revamp Jarrow School have come into action. Building work was completed in 2009 turning the school into a modern learning facility with Specialist Engineering Status. The head teacher at the school plans to improve the school&#x27;s grade point average, by improving the learning facilities, costing millions of pounds.

==Demography==
In 2011, Jarrow had a population of 43,431, compared to 27,526 in 2001. This gives Jarrow a similar population to Wallsend and Whitley Bay. The large increase in population is mainly due to boundary changes.

The fact that only 2.9% of Jarrow&#x27;s population is non White British, makes Jarrow the least ethnically diverse major urban subdivision in Tyneside and less ethnically diverse than its surrounding borough, South Tyneside. Jarrow contains areas such as Fellgate and Hedworth, which border onto Greenbelt in the south of the town, which have very high White British populations. In South Tyneside, 5.0% of the population are non-White British, which is almost double the figure for Jarrow, also the borough has twice the percentage of Asian people compared to this riverside town.

Compared to the rest of the North East of England Jarrow does have a greater rate of unemployment, average unemployment figures in 2013 put the north east at 5.4% as opposed to Jarrow at 6.1%. In September 2016 1,680 people living in Jarrow were in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance or Universal Credit, 370 people aged between 18 and 24 were on receipt of benefits in September 2016 down by 30 from the previous year, a drop of 7.5%.

<doc id="189975" wikidata="Q7860496" url="?curid=189975" title="Tyne Tunnel">
<text>The Tyne Tunnel is the name given to a pair of two-lane vehicular toll tunnels under the River Tyne in North East England. Originally opened in 1967 and expanded in 2011, the tunnels connect the town of Jarrow on the south bank of the river with North Shields and Wallsend on the northern side. The tunnels are approximately downstream, to the east of Newcastle upon Tyne. The Tyne Tunnel constitutes a part of the A19 road.

==History==

A scheme for the construction of a set of three tunnels under the Tyne was put forward by the Durham and Northumberland county councils in 1937. After prolonged negotiations with the Ministry of Transport, the scheme was approved in 1943. The (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. xl), the legislative instrument necessary to enable the construction of the tunnels, received royal assent in 1946. Postwar restrictions on capital expenditure delayed the construction of the vehicular tunnel, but work started on the smaller tunnels for pedestrians and cyclists in 1947.

==First Tyne motor vehicle tunnel==

The vehicle tunnel is long and has a diameter of with a roadbed . It was built by Edmund Nuttall Limited and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 October 1967, but commenced operational use only in 1968, on completion of the northern link roads. It was designed to handle 25,000 vehicles per day. The original toll for cars was 2s 6d (12.5p). On completion of the second Tyne road tunnel, which opened with a single lane in each direction, the original 1967 Tyne Tunnel closed in February 2011 for a complete revamp, which included the installation of a safety corridor throughout its length. Once this work was complete, it reopened in November 2011 as the northbound tunnel, leaving the new tunnel to handle southbound traffic.

==Second Tyne motor vehicle tunnel==
In March 2004 the Tyne and Wear Integrated Transport Authority launched a scheme to build a second, £139 million tunnel. The tunnel is slightly to the east of the existing tunnel, and the pairing allows each tunnel to serve two lanes of traffic, each travelling in the same direction; the original tunnel had two single lanes of traffic in opposing directions, representing an avoidable risk. The tunnel is in length.

The UK government gave the go-ahead for the scheme in July 2005. Construction work started in spring 2008, with the new tunnel opening to two-lane bi-directional traffic on 25 February 2011, at which point the original tunnel closed for a ten-month refurbishment.

The timeline for the new Tyne Tunnel was as follows:
* Transfer tunnels and staff to concessionaire: 1 February 2008
* Main work started: Spring 2008
* New tunnel opened: end of February 2011
* Existing tunnel closed for refurbishment: end of February 2011
* Both existing and new tunnel fully operational and open: end of November 2011. Originally this was planned for January 2012; however, both refurbishment of the old tunnel was completed earlier than expected and both tunnels were open by lunchtime on 21 November 2011.
The tunnel was constructed under a private finance initiative 30-year &quot;design–build–finance–operate&quot; contract by Bouygues Construction.

Onshore sections of the new tunnel were built using the cut-and-cover method. Under-river sections of the tunnel were prefabricated, floated into position, immersed into a dredged trench, and covered with rocks. By beginning of November 2009, the land approaches to the tunnel had been excavated, and construction of the tunnel, in four sections, had been completed nearby. The dredger used to excavate the river section of the tunnel cutting arrived on site on 4 November 2009 to excavate 400,000 cubic metres of sediment, which was used to infill the defunct Tyne Dock, reclaiming of land for use by Port of Tyne. 
Both ends of the tunnel finally met on 26 May 2010.

== Safety ==

The new tunnel is fitted with a fixed fire suppression system which releases a fine mist to contain fires to help motorists leave safely and to prevent damage to the tunnel structure. There is also a separate evacuation corridor which runs adjacent to the main tunnel. The old tunnel, now fully refurbished, includes many of the same safety features.

The New Tyne crossing is claimed to be one of the safest in the UK, thanks to a state-of-the-art active fire suppression system which is now included in its design. It is the first in the UK to be fitted with a water mist active fire suppression system, and will further ensure the safety of thousands of people who will travel through it every day.

The original 1960s-built tunnel was slated as of one of the least safe in Europe in 2000, according to a study. Inspectors visited 25 major tunnels around Europe after fire devastated the Mont Blanc Tunnel under the Alps between France and Italy. The Tyne Tunnel was officially rated as &quot;poor&quot; and languished near the bottom of the European league table. The inspectors found it had no automatic fire alarm system, poor lighting, no laybys or hard shoulder, and an emergency walkway that could be reached only by able-bodied people. They also criticised its smoke extraction system. These deficiencies were addressed during the refurbishment of the original road tunnel in 2011.

==Tolls==
As of 2024 the toll charge is £2.40 for cars and light vans. Trucks and buses pay £4.80. Motorcycles use the tunnel free and Blue Badge holders can apply for an exemption account. A 10% discount is available to those who pre-pay via the Internet.

In May 2020, the operator of the Tyne Tunnel, TT2, introduced an option to &#x27;pay later&#x27;.

In November 2021, the Tyne Tunnel launched open-road-tolling, a cashless system that saw the complete removal of barriers and physical payment booths.

<text>Foxton Locks () are ten canal locks consisting of two &quot;staircases&quot; each of five locks, located on the Leicester line of the Grand Union Canal about west of the Leicestershire town of Market Harborough. They are named after the nearby village of Foxton.

They form the northern terminus of a summit level that passes Husbands Bosworth, Crick and ends with the Watford flight

Alongside the locks is the site of the Foxton Inclined Plane, built in 1900 to resolve the operational restrictions imposed by the lock flight. It was not a commercial success and only remained in full-time operation for ten years. It was dismantled in 1926, but a project to re-create it commenced in the 2000s, since the locks remain a bottleneck for boat traffic.

==Description==
Staircase locks are used where a canal needs to climb a steep hill, and consist of a group of locks where each lock opens directly into the next, that is, where the bottom gates of one lock form the top gates of the next. Foxton Locks are the largest flight of such staircase locks on the English canal system. The locks are equipped with side pounds, with white paddles emptying a lock into a side pound, and red paddles filling the next lock downstream from the pound. This saves water compared to the more common riser staircases, since changing the direction of traffic does not require emptying/filling almost all the locks.
Building work on the locks started in 1810 and took four years. The locks were opened on 1 October 1813.

Little changed until the building of the inclined plane resulted in the reduction in size of some of the side pounds. While the inclined plane was in operation the locks were allowed to fall into decline to an extent and in 1908 the committee released £1,000 to bring the locks back into full (nightly) operation.

In 2008, the locks became part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage, a network which seeks to recognize the most important industrial heritage sites in Europe.

The locks are usually staffed during the cruising season from Easter to October and padlocked outside operating hours. This is done to prevent water shortages due to misuse and to ensure a balance between those wishing to ascend and descend. There can be lengthy delays at busy times but the actual transit should take approximately 45 minutes to one hour to complete; it is made quicker by the fact that the locks are narrow beam and the gates are light.
== Tourism==
The Grade II* listed locks are a popular tourist attraction and the county council has created a country park at the top. At the bottom, where the junction with the arm to Market Harborough is located, there are two public houses, a shop, trip boat and other facilities. The area is popular with ramblers, interested enthusiasts and similar.

The Foxton Canal Museum is located in the former boiler house for the plane&#x27;s steam engine. The museum covers the history of the locks and the plane, the lives of the canal workers, and other aspects of the local canal. There is also a collection of Measham pottery. The museum opened in 1989 and is accredited by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.

<doc id="189977" wikidata="Q3042670" url="?curid=189977" title="Irish Declaration of Independence">
<text>The Declaration of Independence (, ) was a document adopted by Dáil Éireann, the revolutionary parliament of the Irish Republic, at its first meeting in the Mansion House, Dublin, on 21 January 1919. It followed from the Sinn Féin election manifesto of December 1918. Texts of the declaration were adopted in three languages: Irish, English and French.

==Scope==
The Irish Republic claimed jurisdiction over the whole island of Ireland. The declaration made no mention of the independence of the 32-county geographic island, just the independence of the &quot;Irish nation&quot; or &quot;Irish people&quot;. It was rivalled by the British administration of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but as the Irish War of Independence went on, it increased its legitimacy in the eyes of most Irish people. It was taken over by the Irish Free State in 1922, after the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

Under international law, the declaration satisfied the principle of the &quot;declarative theory of statehood,&quot; but in 1919 almost all states followed the &quot;constitutive theory of statehood&quot; and therefore did not recognise the Irish Republic.

==Ratification of 1916 Proclamation==
By the Declaration of Independence, the Dáil ratified the earlier Proclamation of the Irish Republic of Easter 1916. This proclamation had not been adopted by an elected body but merely by the Easter rebels claiming to act in the name of the Irish people. Unlike the proclamation, the Declaration of Independence was followed by the establishment of some &quot;de facto&quot; political organs. In its crucial line the declaration pronounced that:

==English garrison==
Differing meanings were given to the occupying &#x27;English garrison&#x27;. This was the closest that the Irish Republic came to declaring war on Britain in January 1919, arguing that an invasion had taken place, and therefore any military action from then on was to remove the invaders. The government in London refused to take this as a declaration of war, considering that it was worded for an Irish audience. When the Irish War of Independence started with some haphazard shootings on the same day at Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary, it was treated by the British as a police matter. The Dáil had no claim to control the Irish Republican Army (IRA) until the latter swore an oath of allegiance to it in August 1920.

==700 years==
This was based on the &#x27;apostolic succession&#x27; of revolts against the English and later, British administrations, placing the last fully free Ireland in the Gaelic world of about the 1160s, before the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland of 1168–71. The declaration saw the wars and revolts of 1594–1603, 1641–50, 1689–91, 1798, 1803, 1848, 1867 and 1916 as a continuing attempt at regaining Irish self-government, with or without links to the crown.

==Aim of international recognition==

An important element in the 1918 Sinn Féin election manifesto was to secure recognition at the forthcoming peace conference that would end the World War of 1914 to 1918. President Woodrow Wilson of the United States had suggested that the Versailles Peace Conference would be inclusive and even-handed, but his &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; had called for &quot;equal weight&quot; between parties at arbitration in article 5, and not outright declarations of independence.

In June 1920, a &quot;Draft Treaty between the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Republic of Ireland&quot; was circulated in Dublin. E. H. Carr, the historian of early Bolshevism, considered that &quot;.. the negotiations were not taken very seriously on either side.&quot; The RSFSR was a pariah state at the time.

<text>FAO Schwarz is an American toy brand and retail chain. The company is known for its high-end toys, life-sized stuffed animals, interactive experiences, brand integrations, and games.

FAO Schwarz claims to be the oldest toy retailer in the United States, founded by its namesake, Frederick August Otto Schwarz, in 1862 in Baltimore before moving to New York City, where it has moved between several locations since 1870. The &quot;dance-on piano&quot;, made famous by the 1988 Tom Hanks film &quot;Big&quot;, brought international attention to the brand. FAO filed for bankruptcy twice in 2003 before temporarily shuttering the Fifth Avenue location in January 2004. In May 2009, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. acquired FAO Schwarz, but in 2015, it closed the Fifth Avenue location for good. ThreeSixty Group then acquired the brand, who opened the new FAO Schwarz location at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in November 2018. In 2019, ThreeSixty opened locations in Chicago, Beijing, London and Dublin. 

The &quot;FAO Schwarz&quot; brandname and trademarks are owned by the FAO Schwarz Family Foundation and exclusively licensed to the ThreeSixty Group who own and operate the retail locations.

==History==

===Early history===
FAO Schwarz was founded in 1862 in Baltimore under the name &quot;Toy Bazaar&quot; by German immigrant Frederick August Otto Schwarz.

In 1870, Schwarz opened a New York City location known as the &quot;Schwarz Toy Bazaar&quot; at 765 Broadway, which moved to 42 E. 14th Street in Union Square in 1880 and operated at that location until April 28, 1897, when it took over two vacant store locations at 39 and 41 W. 23rd Street. That year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared Schwarz as &quot;the largest dealer in toys in this city.&quot;

Beginning in November 1869, the Schwarz Toy Bazaar held an exhibition of toys that would be available for the Christmas season. In 1896, Schwarz proclaimed the store as the &quot;Original Santa Claus Headquarters&quot; in New York. The FAO Schwarz holiday catalog has been published annually since 1876.

In 1931, the New York City location moved to 745 Fifth Avenue, where it operated for 55 years. In 1963, &quot;Parent&#x27;s&quot; Magazine Enterprises purchased FAO Schwarz. The terms of the deal read that it would license the name FAO Schwarz and continue using it for a maximum of five years before dropping the name, while still paying the Schwarz family a royalty on sales. However, the lease was renewed as the owners felt the name was too significant to lose. Part of the price of keeping the name was to keep the royalty agreement, and the Schwarz family set up a foundation to fund opportunities for young people to work in nonprofit with the income the royalties were making. Nine percent of the company remained in the hands of the Schwarz family. The company subsequently sold to W.R. Grace in 1970, and then to toy retailer Franz Carl Weber of Zurich, Switzerland, in 1974.
In 1985, Christiana Companies, a company based in San Diego, California, owned FAO Schwarz for one year. In 1986, Peter Harris, with the help of Philadelphia investment banker Peter Morse, bought the company under Morse Partners Ltd. and moved the toy store across 58th Street to the General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Avenue at 58th Street. FAO Schwarz was sold to Netherlands-based NV Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer (later renamed Royal Vendex/KBB NV) in 1990. Throughout the 1990s, new FAO Schwarz stores opened across the United States; by 2000, the company had 40 locations.

===Right Start, FAO Inc. and bankruptcy===
In 2001, the Calabasas-based toy retailer Right Start, Inc. purchased 23 of the 40 stores, including the Fifth Avenue flagship store, from Royal Vendex for somewhere between $50 million and $60 million.

In 2002, Right Start Inc. changed its corporate name to FAO Inc. operating stores under The Right Start, Zany Brainy and FAO Schwarz names. On December 17, the company projected they would file for bankruptcy if its bank did not relax borrowing restrictions. On January 13, 2003, FAO Inc. filed for bankruptcy, but emerged from it three months later in April. The company filed for bankruptcy a second time in December 2003. All 13 remaining FAO Schwarz locations closed in January 2004 as a result of the bankruptcy, with the flagship Fifth Avenue store expected to reopen in July of that year but the others closing for good. The Fifth Avenue store reopened several months later than planned on Thanksgiving Day 2004, redesigned and renovated to accommodate a growing number of tourists, and the Las Vegas location at The Forum Shops at Caesars ultimately remained open until 2010.

===D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.===
In February 2004, investment firm D. E. Shaw &amp; Co., L.P., acquired the FAO Schwarz stores in New York and Las Vegas, as well as FAO Schwarz&#x27;s catalog and internet business. The New York and Las Vegas stores reopened on Thanksgiving Day 2004. In November 2007, FAO Schwarz acquired premium children&#x27;s clothing company Best &amp; Co., which had plans to expand, but the company ceased business in 2009.

===Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Inc.===
In May 2009, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. acquired FAO Schwarz. In 2009, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us subsequently put temporary FAO Schwarz boutiques in its U.S. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores for the holidays, and in October 2010, the concept was expanded into permanent boutiques in Toys &quot;R&quot; Us stores. In addition, FAO Schwarz-branded infant and toddler items are available in all of its Babies &quot;R&quot; Us stores nationwide. The company closed the Las Vegas location in January 2010, followed by its previous flagship New York store. 
===ThreeSixty Group===
In October 2016, ThreeSixty Group, Inc. acquired FAO Schwarz from Toys ‘R’ Us, Inc.

The FAO Schwarz brand is currently the property of the descendants of the founder through the FAO Schwarz Family Foundation but is exclusively operated by ThreeSixty Group. In August 2018, ThreeSixty Group announced plans to open two new FAO Schwarz stores in New York. The one at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Rockefeller Center opened on November 16, 2018. The store features live toy demonstrations and carries many toys that are hard to find in the United States such as BRIO. Public transit access is available at 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station. The second opened at LaGuardia Airport in December 2018.

In October 2018, FAO Schwarz pop-up stores opened at 90 Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company stores across Canada, just ahead of the Christmas holiday season, to remain open through the holidays.

In March 2019, a store opened at Midway International Airport in Chicago.

Also in 2019, an F.A.O. Schwartz shop opened in Arnotts department store in Ireland, replacing its original toy shop.

In November 2021, a store opened in Milan.

In spring 2024, a new location opened in Paris at Galeries Lafayette Haussmann department store.

==Brand==
FAO Schwarz is known for its large assortment of plush animals and the Piano Dance Mat, a smaller replica of The Walking Piano featured in the Tom Hanks film &quot;Big&quot;. FAO Schwarz also features limited-quantity luxury items including a drivable, child-size automobile encrusted with over 40,000 crystals and valued at US$25,000.

In addition to its own line of products, FAO Schwarz carries brands including Steiff, the world&#x27;s oldest (founded 1880) German designer of stuffed animals; Melissa &amp; Doug, a leading designer and manufacturer of educational toys; and Build-A-Bear Workshop, a make-your-own experience featuring a selection of exclusive FAO Schwarz stuffed animals and accessories, among other in-store retail partners.

When &quot;Kinectimals: Now with Bears!&quot; was released, the brand also released an exclusive teddy bear plush with a scan tag.

===Logo===
Through the years, the FAO Schwarz logo has had versions that included a teddy bear, toy blocks, a toy soldier, rocking horse and an animated clock tower. In 2010, the FAO Schwarz logo was redesigned in colors of red and silver. The new logo emphasized the initials of company founder, Frederick August Otto Schwarz. It also debuted a company mascot, Wit. In 2017, FAO Schwarz hired design studio, Mattson Creative, to rebrand the FAO Schwarz logo and packaging. Mattson Creative also created the store&#x27;s reopening tagline and hashtag, &quot;Return to Wonder&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

In the 1972 short story &quot;The Lesson&quot;, the store is cast as an instance of immense wealth disparity between classes to a group of poor children.

The New York store is featured in the 1988 Tom Hanks film &quot;Big&quot;, in which Hanks and Robert Loggia dance &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot; and &quot;Chopsticks&quot; on the store&#x27;s large dance-on piano.

The store&#x27;s interior was the inspiration for the fictional &quot;Duncan&#x27;s Toy Chest&quot; featured in the 1992 film &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.&quot;
The store is featured in Woody Allen&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot; in the final scene where main characters Lenny and Linda have a chance encounter. It is also featured in &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987) and &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988), among others.

In the 1999 remake of the musical film &quot;Annie&quot;, during the song &quot;NYC&quot;, the characters Oliver Warbucks, Grace, and Annie join a crowd of people all admiring an impressive Christmas-themed window display containing a sign that reads &quot;F.A.O. Schwarz&quot;.

In the 2010 film &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, when Buzz Lightyear is captured, Lots-o-Huggin&#x27; Bear unties him and indirectly references FAO Schwarz in a euphemism: &quot;Oh F-A-O my Schwarz&quot;.

The store is featured in the 2011 film &quot;The Smurfs&quot; during a chase scene. Scenes from the movie were shot over five nights in May 2011.

In the 2019 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Crystal Blue-Haired Persuasion&quot;, a healing crystal shop is named &quot;FAO Quartz&quot;.

In the 2021 series &quot;Hawkeye&quot;, the climax of the battle between Kate Bishop and Wilson Fisk occurs in the 30 Rockefeller Plaza location. The actual name of the shop is obscured. One shot features Bishop standing on the dance-on piano.

<doc id="189981" wikidata="Q270853" url="?curid=189981" title="Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)">
<text>The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. As it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;, although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer disapproved of the name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst at his Maiernigg villa in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler&#x27;s works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910.

The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler&#x27;s early works. In his &quot;middle&quot; compositional period after 1901, a change of style led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional: instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of Veni creator spiritus (&quot;Come, Creator Spirit&quot;), a ninth-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes.

Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work&#x27;s significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer&#x27;s death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson, and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler&#x27;s other symphonies. Conversely, it has been compared by Deryck Cooke to Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 as a defining human statement for its century.

==History==

===Background===
By the summer of 1906, Mahler had been director of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; (&quot;Songs on the Death of Children&quot;).

Until 1901, Mahler&#x27;s compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (&quot;The Youth&#x27;s Magic Horn&quot;), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler&#x27;s many &quot;Wunderhorn&quot; settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler&#x27;s music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the &quot;Wunderhorn&quot; collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as &quot;more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration&quot;.

Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer&#x27;s wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was &quot;haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration&quot;; Mahler&#x27;s recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his Eighth Symphony.

===Composition===
Two notes in Mahler&#x27;s handwriting dating from June 1906 show that early schemes for the work, which he may not at first have intended as a fully choral symphony, were based on a four-movement structure in which two &quot;hymns&quot; surround an instrumental core. These outlines show that Mahler had fixed on the idea of opening with the Latin hymn, but had not yet settled on the precise form of the rest. The first note is as follows:

# Hymn: Veni creator
# Scherzo
# Adagio: Caritas (&quot;Christian love&quot;)
# Hymn: &quot;Die Geburt des Eros&quot; (&quot;The birth of Eros&quot;)

The second note includes musical sketches for the Veni creator movement, and two bars in B minor which are thought to relate to the &quot;Caritas&quot;. The four-movement plan is retained in a slightly different form, still without specific indication of the extent of the choral element:

# Veni creator
# Caritas
# &quot;Weihnachtsspiele mit dem Kindlein&quot; (&quot;Christmas games with the child&quot;)
# &quot;Schöpfung durch Eros. Hymne&quot; (&quot;Creation through Eros. Hymn&quot;)

From Mahler&#x27;s later comments on the symphony&#x27;s gestation, it is evident that the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (&quot;das Ewige-Weibliche&quot;). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the &quot;Faust&quot; epic to music, &quot;and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble.&quot; In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: &quot;I saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes, and only needed to write it down as though it were being dictated to me.&quot;

The work was written at a frantic pace—&quot;in record time&quot;, according to the musicologist Henry-Louis de La Grange. It was completed in all its essentials by mid-August, even though Mahler had to absent himself for a week to attend the Salzburg Festival. Mahler began composing the Veni creator hymn without waiting for the text to arrive from Vienna. When it did, according to Alma Mahler, &quot;the complete text fitted the music exactly. Intuitively he had composed the music for the full strophes [verses].&quot; Although amendments and alterations were subsequently carried out to the score, there is very little manuscript evidence of the sweeping changes and rewriting that occurred with his earlier symphonies as they were prepared for performance.

With its use of vocal elements throughout, rather than in episodes at or near the end, the work was the first completely choral symphony to be written. Mahler had no doubts about the ground-breaking nature of the symphony, calling it the grandest thing he had ever done, and maintaining that all his previous symphonies were merely preludes to it. &quot;Try to imagine the whole universe beginning to ring and resound. There are no longer human voices, but planets and suns revolving.&quot; It was his &quot;gift to the nation ... a great joy-bringer.&quot;

===Reception and performance history===

====Premiere====
Mahler made arrangements with the impresario Emil Gutmann for the symphony to be premiered in Munich in the autumn of 1910. He soon regretted this involvement, writing of his fears that Gutmann would turn the performance into &quot;a catastrophic Barnum and Bailey show&quot;. Preparations began early in the year, with the selection of choirs from the choral societies of Munich, Leipzig and Vienna. The Munich &quot;Zentral-Singschule&quot; provided 350 students for the children&#x27;s choir. Meanwhile, Bruno Walter, Mahler&#x27;s assistant at the Vienna Hofoper, was responsible for the recruitment and preparation of the eight soloists. Through the spring and summer these forces prepared in their home towns, before assembling in Munich early in September for three full days of final rehearsals under Mahler. His youthful assistant Otto Klemperer remarked later on the many small changes that Mahler made to the score during rehearsal: &quot;He always wanted more clarity, more sound, more dynamic contrast. At one point during rehearsals he turned to us and said, &#x27;If, after my death, something doesn&#x27;t sound right, then change it. You have not only a right but a duty to do so.&#x27;&quot;

For the premiere, fixed for 12 September, Gutmann had hired the newly built Neue Musik-Festhalle, in the Munich International Exhibition grounds near Theresienhöhe (now a branch of the Deutsches Museum). This vast hall had a capacity of 3,200; to assist ticket sales and raise publicity, Gutmann devised the nickname &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;, which has remained the symphony&#x27;s popular subtitle despite Mahler&#x27;s disapproval. Among the many distinguished figures present at the sold-out premiere were the composers Richard Strauss, Camille Saint-Saëns and Anton Webern; the writers Thomas Mann and Arthur Schnitzler; and the leading theatre director of the day, Max Reinhardt. Also in the audience was the 28-year-old British conductor Leopold Stokowski, who six years later would lead the first United States performance of the symphony.

Up to this time, receptions of Mahler&#x27;s new symphonies had usually been disappointing. However, the Munich premiere of the Eighth Symphony was an unqualified triumph; as the final chords died away there was a short pause before a huge outbreak of applause which lasted for twenty minutes. Back at his hotel Mahler received a letter from Thomas Mann, which referred to the composer as &quot;the man who, as I believe, expresses the art of our time in its profoundest and most sacred form&quot;.

The symphony&#x27;s duration at its first performance was recorded by the critic-composer Julius Korngold as 85 minutes. This performance was the last time that Mahler conducted a premiere of one of his own works. Eight months after his Munich triumph, he died at the age of 50. His remaining works—&quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Earth&quot;), his Symphony No. 9 and the unfinished Symphony No. 10—were all premiered after his death.

====Subsequent performances====

On the day following the Munich premiere Mahler led the orchestra and choruses in a repeat performance.
During the next three years, according to the calculations of Mahler&#x27;s friend Guido Adler the Eighth Symphony received a further 20 performances across Europe. These included the Dutch premiere, in Amsterdam under Willem Mengelberg on 12 March 1912, and the first Prague performance, given on 20 March 1912 under Mahler&#x27;s former Vienna Hofoper colleague, Alexander von Zemlinsky. Vienna itself had to wait until 1918 before the symphony was heard there.
In the U.S., Leopold Stokowski persuaded an initially reluctant board of the Philadelphia Orchestra to finance the American premiere, which took place on 2 March 1916. The occasion was a great success; the symphony was played several more times in Philadelphia before the orchestra and choruses travelled to New York, for a series of equally well-received performances at the Metropolitan Opera House.

At the Amsterdam Mahler Festival in May 1920, Mahler&#x27;s completed symphonies and his major song cycles were presented over nine concerts given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra and choruses, under Mengelberg&#x27;s direction. The music critic Samuel Langford, who attended the occasion, commented that &quot;we do not leave Amsterdam greatly envying the diet of Mahler first and every other composer afterward, to which Mengelberg is training the music-lovers of that city.&quot; The Austrian music historian Oscar Bie, while impressed with the festival as a whole, wrote subsequently that the Eighth was &quot;stronger in effect than in significance, and purer in its voices than in emotion&quot;. Langford had commented on the British &quot;not being very eager about Mahler&quot;, and the Eighth Symphony was not performed in Britain until 15 April 1930, when Sir Henry Wood presented it with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The work was played again eight years later by the same forces; among those present in the audience was the youthful composer Benjamin Britten. Impressed by the music, he nevertheless found the performance itself &quot;execrable&quot;.

The years after World War II saw a number of notable performances of the Eighth Symphony, including Sir Adrian Boult&#x27;s broadcast from the Royal Albert Hall on 10 February 1948, the Japanese premiere under Kazuo Yamada in Tokyo in December 1949, and the Australian premiere under Sir Eugene Goossens in 1951. A Carnegie Hall performance under Stokowski in 1950 became the first complete recording of the symphony to be issued. After 1950 the increasing numbers of performances and recordings of the work signified its growing popularity, but not all critics were won over. Theodor W. Adorno found the piece weak, &quot;a giant symbolic shell&quot;; this most affirmative work of Mahler&#x27;s is, in Adorno&#x27;s view, his least successful, musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies. The composer-critic Robert Simpson, usually a champion of Mahler, referred to Part II as &quot;an ocean of shameless kitsch.&quot; Mahler biographer Jonathan Carr finds much of the symphony &quot;bland&quot;, lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer&#x27;s other symphonies. Deryck Cooke, on the other hand, compares Mahler&#x27;s Eighth to Beethoven&#x27;s Choral (Ninth) Symphony. To Cooke, Mahler&#x27;s is &quot;the Choral Symphony of the twentieth century: like Beethoven&#x27;s, but in a different way, it sets before us an ideal [of redemption] which we are as yet far from realising—even perhaps moving away from—but which we can hardly abandon without perishing&quot;.

In the late 20th century and into the 21st, the symphony was performed in all parts of the world. A succession of premieres in the Far East culminated in October 2002 in Beijing, when Long Yu led the China Philharmonic Orchestra in the first performance of the work in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Sydney Olympic Arts Festival in August 2000 opened with a performance of the Eighth by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under its chief conductor Edo de Waart. The popularity of the work, and its heroic scale, meant that it was often used as a set piece on celebratory occasions; on 15 March 2008, Yoav Talmi led 200 instrumentalists and a choir of 800 in a performance in Quebec City, to mark the 400th anniversary of the city&#x27;s foundation. In London on 16 July 2010 the opening concert of the BBC Proms celebrated the 150th anniversary of Mahler&#x27;s birth with a performance of the Eighth, with Jiří Bělohlávek conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was its eighth in the history of the Proms.

==Analysis==

===Structure and form===
The Eighth Symphony&#x27;s two parts combine the sacred text of the 9th-century Latin hymn Veni creator spiritus with the secular text from the closing passages from Goethe&#x27;s 19th-century dramatic poem &quot;Faust&quot;. Despite the evident disparities within this juxtaposition, the work as a whole expresses a single idea, that of redemption through the power of love. The choice of these two texts was not arbitrary; Goethe, a poet whom Mahler revered, believed that Veni creator embodied aspects of his own philosophy, and had translated it into German in 1820. Once inspired by the Veni creator idea, Mahler soon saw the &quot;Faust&quot; poem as an ideal counterpart to the Latin hymn. The unity between the two parts of the symphony is established, musically, by the extent to which they share thematic material. In particular, the first notes of the Veni creator theme —
:E → B → A: &lt;score&gt; \new Staff \with { \remove &quot;Time_signature_engraver&quot; } \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key ees \major \override Stem #&#x27;transparent = ##t ees4 bes aes&#x27; } &lt;/score&gt;
— dominate the climaxes to each part; at the symphony&#x27;s culmination, Goethe&#x27;s glorification of &quot;Eternal Womanhood&quot; is set in the form of a religious chorale.

In composing his score, Mahler temporarily abandoned the more progressive tonal elements which had appeared in his most recent works. The symphony&#x27;s key is, for Mahler, unusually stable; despite frequent diversions into other keys the music always returns to its central E major. This is the first of his works in which familiar fingerprints—birdsong, military marches, Austrian dances—are almost entirely absent. Although the vast choral and orchestral forces employed suggest a work of monumental sound, according to critic Michael Kennedy &quot;the predominant expression is not of torrents of sound but of the contrasts of subtle tone-colours and the luminous quality of the scoring&quot;.

For Part I, most modern commentators accept the sonata-form outline that was discerned by early analysts. The structure of Part II is more difficult to summarise, being an amalgam of many genres. Analysts, including Specht, Cooke and Paul Bekker, have identified Adagio, Scherzo and Finale &quot;movements&quot; within the overall scheme of Part II, though others, including La Grange and Donald Mitchell, find little to sustain this division. The musicologist Ortrun Landmann has suggested that the formal scheme for Part II, after the orchestral introduction, is a sonata plan without the recapitulation, consisting of exposition, development and conclusion.

===Part I: Veni creator spiritus ===

Mitchell describes Part I as resembling a giant motet, and argues that a key to its understanding is to read it as Mahler&#x27;s attempt to emulate the polyphony of Bach&#x27;s great motets, specifically &quot;Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied&quot; (&quot;Sing to the Lord a new song&quot;). The symphony begins with a single tonic chord in E major, sounded on the organ, before the entry of the massed choirs in a fortissimo invocation: &quot;Veni, veni creator spiritus&quot;.

The three note &quot;creator&quot; motif is immediately taken up by the trombones and then the trumpets in a marching theme that will be used as a unifying factor throughout the work.

After their first declamatory statement the two choirs engage in a sung dialogue, which ends with a short transition to an extended lyrical passage, the plea &quot;Imple superna gratia&quot; (&quot;Fill with divine grace&quot;).

Here, what Kennedy calls &quot;the unmistakable presence of twentieth-century Mahler&quot; is felt as a solo soprano introduces a meditative theme. She is soon joined by other solo voices as the new theme is explored before the choirs return exuberantly, in an A episode in which the soloists compete with the choral masses.

In the next section, &quot;Infirma nostri corporis / virtute firmans perpeti&quot; (&quot;Our weak frames fortify with thine eternal strength&quot;), the tonic key of E major returns with a variation of the opening theme. The section is interrupted by a short orchestral interlude in which the low bells are sounded, adding a sombre touch to the music. This new, less secure mood is carried through when &quot;Infirma nostri corporis&quot; resumes, this time without the choruses, in a subdued D minor echo of the initial invocation.

At the end of this episode another transition precedes the &quot;unforgettable surge in E major&quot;, in which the entire body of choral forces declaims &quot;Accende lumen sensibus&quot; (&quot;Illuminate our senses&quot;).

The first children&#x27;s chorus follows, in a joyful mood, as the music gathers force and pace. This is a passage of great complexity, in the form of a double fugue involving development of many of the preceding themes, with constant changes to the key signature. All forces combine again in the recapitulation of the Veni creator section in shortened form. A quieter passage of recapitulation leads to an orchestral coda before the children&#x27;s chorus announces the doxology Gloria sit Patri Domino (&quot;Glory be to God the Father&quot;).

Thereafter the music moves swiftly and powerfully to its climax, in which an offstage brass ensemble bursts forth with the &quot;&quot;Accende&quot; theme while the main orchestra and choruses end on a triumphant rising scale.

===Part II: Closing scene from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;===
 The second part of the symphony follows the narrative of the final stages in Goethe&#x27;s poem—the journey of Faust&#x27;s soul, rescued from the clutches of Mephistopheles, on to its final ascent into heaven. Landmann&#x27;s proposed sonata structure for the movement is based on a division, after an orchestral prelude, into five sections which he identifies musically as an exposition, three development episodes, and a finale.

The long orchestral prelude (166 bars) is in E minor and, in the manner of an operatic overture, anticipates several of the themes which will be heard later in the movement. The exposition begins in near-silence; the scene depicted is that of a rocky, wooded mountainside, the dwelling place of anchorites whose utterances are heard in an atmospheric chorus complete with whispers and echoes.

A solemn baritone solo, the voice of Pater Ecstaticus, ends warmly as the key changes to the major when the trumpets sound the &quot;Accende&quot;&quot; theme from Part I. This is followed by a demanding and dramatic aria for bass, the voice of Pater Profundus, who ends his tortured meditation by asking for God&#x27;s mercy on his thoughts and for enlightenment. The repeated chords in this section are reminiscent of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;. The mood lightens with the entry of the angels and blessed boys (women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s choruses) bearing the soul of Faust; the music here is perhaps a relic of the &quot;Christmas Games&quot; scherzo envisioned in the abortive four-movement draft plan.

The atmosphere is festive, with triumphant shouts of &quot;Jauchzet auf!&quot; (&quot;Rejoice!&quot;) before the exposition ends in a postlude which refers to the &quot;Infirma nostri corporis&quot; music from Part I.

The first phase of development begins as a women&#x27;s chorus of the younger angels invoke a &quot;happy company of blessed children&quot; who must bear Faust&#x27;s soul heavenwards. The blessed boys receive the soul gladly; their voices are joined by Doctor Marianus (tenor), who accompanies their chorus before breaking into a rapturous E major paean to the Mater Gloriosa, &quot;Queen and ruler of the world!&quot;. As the aria ends, the male voices in the chorus echo the soloist&#x27;s words to an orchestral background of viola tremolos, in a passage described by La Grange as &quot;emotionally irresistible&quot;.

In the second part of the development, the entry of the Mater Gloriosa is signalled in E major by a sustained harmonium chord, with harp arpeggios played over a pianissimo violin melody which La Grange labels the &quot;love&quot; theme.

Thereafter the key changes frequently as a chorus of penitent women petition the Mater for a hearing; this is followed by the solo entreaties of Magna Peccatrix, Mulier Samaritana and Maria Aegyptiaca. In these arias the &quot;love&quot; theme is further explored, and the &quot;scherzo&quot; theme associated with the first appearance of the angels returns. These two motifs predominate in the trio which follows, a request to the Mater on behalf of a fourth penitent, Faust&#x27;s lover once known as Gretchen, who has come to make her plea for the soul of Faust. After Gretchen&#x27;s entreaty, a solo of &quot;limpid beauty&quot; in Kennedy&#x27;s words, an atmosphere of hushed reverence descends. The Mater Gloriosa then sings her only two lines, in the symphony&#x27;s opening key of E major, permitting Gretchen to lead the soul of Faust into heaven.

The final development episode is a hymnlike tenor solo and chorus, in which Doctor Marianus calls on the penitents to &quot;Gaze aloft&quot;.

A short orchestral passage follows, scored for an eccentric chamber group consisting of piccolo, flute, clarinet, harmonium, celesta, piano, harps and a string quartet. This acts as a transition to the finale, the Chorus Mysticus, which begins in E major almost imperceptibly—Mahler&#x27;s notation here is &quot;Wie ein Hauch&quot;, &quot;like a breath&quot;.

The sound rises in a gradual crescendo, as the solo voices alternately join or contrast with the chorus. As the climax approaches, many themes are reprised: the love theme, Gretchen&#x27;s song, the &quot;Accende&quot; from Part I. Finally, as the chorus concludes with &quot;The eternal feminine draws us on high&quot;, the off-stage brass re-enters with a final salute on the Veni creator motif, to end the symphony with a triumphant flourish.

==Instrumentation==
===Orchestra===
The symphony is scored for a very large orchestra, in keeping with Mahler&#x27;s conception of the work as a &quot;new symphonic universe&quot;, a synthesis of symphony, cantata, oratorio, motet, and lied in a combination of styles. La Grange comments: &quot;To give expression to his cosmic vision, it was ... necessary to go beyond all previously known limits and dimensions.&quot; The orchestral forces required are, however, not as large as those deployed in Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, completed in 1911. The orchestra consists of:
* Woodwinds
** 2 piccolos (1st doubling 5th flute)
** 4 flutes
** 4 oboes
** cor anglais
** 3 B clarinets
** E clarinet
** bass clarinet
** 4 bassoons
** contrabassoon
* Brass
** 8 horns
** 8 trumpets (four offstage)
** 7 trombones (three offstage)
** tuba
* Percussion
** 4 timpani
** bass drum
** cymbals
** triangle
** tam-tam
** 2 tuned bells in A and A
** glockenspiel (used only in part II)
* Keyboards
** organ
** celesta (used only in part II)
** piano (used only in part II)
** harmonium (used only in part II)
* Strings
** mandolin (used only in part II)
** 2 harps (used only in part II)
** 1st violins
** 2nd violins
** violas
** cellos
** double basses
Mahler recommended that in very large halls, the first player in each of the woodwind sections should be doubled and that numbers in the strings should also be augmented. In addition, the piccolos, e-flat clarinet, harps and mandolin, and the first offstage trumpet, should have &quot;several to the part&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

===Choral and vocal forces===
* 3 soprano solos (3rd used only in part II)
* 2 alto solos
* tenor solo
* baritone solo
* bass solo
* 2 SATB choirs
* children&#x27;s choir

In Part II the soloists are assigned to dramatic roles represented in Goethe&#x27;s text, as illustrated in the following table.

La Grange draws attention to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in Part II is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions to be heard over the choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.

==Publication==
Only one autograph score of Symphony No. 8 is known to exist. Once the property of Alma Mahler, it is held by the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. In 1906 Mahler signed a contract with the Viennese publishing firm Universal Edition (UE), which thus became the main publisher of all his works. The full orchestral score of the Symphony was published by UE in 1912. A Russian version, published in Moscow by Izdatel&#x27;stvo Muzyka in 1976, was republished in the United States by Dover Publications in 1989, with an English text and notes. The International Gustav Mahler Society, founded in 1955, has as its main objective the production of a complete critical edition of all of Mahler&#x27;s works. As of 2016 its critical edition of the Eighth remains a project for the future.

==Recordings==
Sir Adrian Boult&#x27;s 1948 broadcast performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra was recorded by the BBC, but not issued until 2009 when it was made available in MP3 form. The first commercially issued recording of the complete symphony was performed by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Eduard Flipse. It was recorded live by Philips at the 1954 Holland Festival. In 1962, the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein made the first stereo recording of Part I for Columbia Records. This was followed in 1964 by the first stereo recording of the complete symphony, performed by the Utah Symphony conducted by Maurice Abravanel.

Since the symphony was first recorded, at least 70 recordings have been made by many of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras and singers, mostly during live performances.

<text>L&#x27;Île-Dorval () is a city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is coterminous with Dorval Island (), an island in Lake Saint-Louis off the Island of Montreal. It lies a short distance offshore from the city of Dorval and is connected with a seasonal ferry service.

A cottaging spot, it had only 30 permanent residents as of the Canada 2021 Census, making it one of the smallest municipalities in Canada, both in terms of area and population. In the 2001 census the official population had dropped to zero, according to Statistics Canada. However, because not only permanent residents but also property owners are eligible to vote in municipal elections in Quebec, there were 50 registered voters in 2004.

==History==

In 1691, the fief of Fort La Presentation, which included the island, was acquired by Jean-Baptiste Bouchard (born around 1658), who used to sign his name as Jean-Baptiste Bouchard Dorval. &quot;d&#x27;Orval&quot; (French for &quot;of Orval&quot;) referred to his father&#x27;s hometown of Orval in Montigny-Lengrain, France.

Around the middle of the 19th century, the island was acquired by George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson Bay Company, who held an elaborate reception for the Prince of Wales at the island in August 1860.

The formation of the island into a town was the initiative of the Dorval Island Park Company and a group of businessmen who wanted to provide the island with electricity, water, streets, and even a tram to support residential development. On March 5, 1915, Ville d&#x27;Ile Dorval was created by separating from the City of Dorval (orthography was adjusted in 1969 to Île-Dorval and in 1987 to L&#x27;Île-Dorval). Between 1949 and 1970, a seasonal post office operated there under the English name Dorval Island.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, it merged with the city of Montreal to become part of the borough of Dorval–L&#x27;Île-Dorval. After a change of government and a 2004 referendum it became independent once again, effective January 1, 2006.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, L&#x27;Île-Dorval had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Local government==
L&#x27;Île-Dorval forms part of the federal electoral district of Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle and has been represented by Anju Dhillon of the Liberal Party since 2015. Provincially, L&#x27;Île-Dorval is part of the Marquette electoral district and is represented by Enrico Ciccone of the Quebec Liberal Party since 2018.

<text>Richard Porson (25 December 1759 – 25 September 1808) was an English classical scholar. He was the discoverer of Porson&#x27;s Law. The Greek typeface &quot;Porson&quot; was based on his handwriting.

==Early life==
Richard Porson was born at East Ruston, near North Walsham, Norfolk, the eldest son of Huggin Porson, parish clerk. His mother was the daughter of a shoemaker from the neighbouring village of Bacton. He was sent first to the Bacton village school, kept by John Woodrow, and then to that of Happisburgh, kept by Mr Summers, where his extraordinary powers of memory and aptitude for arithmetic were discovered. His literary skill was partly due to the efforts of Summers, who long afterwards stated that in fifty years of scholastic life he had never come across boys so clever as Porson and his two brothers. He was well grounded in Latin by Summers, remaining with him for three years. His father also took pains with his education, making him repeat at night the lessons he had learnt in the day. He would frequently repeat perfectly a lesson he had learnt one or two years before and never seen in the interval. For books he had only what his father&#x27;s cottage supplied – a book or two of arithmetic, James Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;An Essay towards a practical English Grammar&quot;, John Jewel&#x27;s &quot;Apology of the Church of England&quot;, an odd volume of the Chambers&#x27; &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; picked up from a wrecked coaster, and eight or ten volumes of &quot;The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure&quot;.

==Education==
When Porson was eleven, the rector of East Ruston took charge of his education. Thomas Hewitt taught him with his own boys, taking him through Julius Caesar, Terence, Ovid and Virgil; he had already made great progress in mathematics. In addition, Hewitt brought him to the notice of John Norris of Witton Park, who sent him to Cambridge to be examined by James Lambert, the two tutors of Trinity College, Cambridge (Thomas Postlethwaite and Collier), and the mathematician George Atwood, then assistant tutor; the result was so favourable that Norris decided in 1773 to provide for his education. It was impossible to get him into Charterhouse School and he was entered at Eton College in August 1774.

Porson did not care for Eton, but he was popular there; two dramas he wrote for performance in Long Chamber (the scholars&#x27; dormitory) were remembered. His memory was noticed; but he seems not to have lived up to expectations, as his composition was weak, and he fell behind through gaps in his knowledge. He went to Eton too late to have any chance of a scholarship at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1777 his patron John Norris died; but contributions from Etonians helped fund his maintenance at the university, and he found a new patron in Sir George Baker, then president of the College of Physicians. With his help Porson entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner (i. e. a student who paid for his tuition and board, rather than a sizar or scholar) on 28 March 1778, matriculating in April. What first set his mind towards literary criticism was the gift of a copy of Jonathan Toup&#x27;s &quot;Longinus&quot; by the headmaster of Eton; but it was Richard Bentley and Richard Dawes to whom he looked as his immediate masters.

Porson became a scholar of Trinity in 1780, won the Craven university scholarship in 1781, and took his degree of BA in 1782, as third senior optime (i. e. with the third best result of those achieving a second-class degree in that year), obtaining soon afterwards the first Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for classical studies. The same year he was elected a fellow of Trinity, an unusual appointment for a junior bachelor of arts, under a regulation which lasted until 1818. Porson graduated MA in 1785.

==Early published work==
His first appearance in print was in a short notice of Christian Gottfried Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Aeschylus&quot; in Paul Henry Maty&#x27;s &quot;Review&quot;, written in 1783. This review contains several other essays by him, including those on Richard François Brunck&#x27;s &quot;Aristophanes&quot;, Stephen Weston&#x27;s &quot;Hermesianax&quot;, and George Isaac Huntingford&#x27;s &quot;Apology for the Monostrophics&quot;. He also began a correspondence with David Ruhnken, the veteran scholar of Leiden, requesting fragments of Aeschylus that Ruhnken had come across in his collection of unpublished lexicons and grammarians, and sending him his restoration of a corrupt passage in the &quot;Supplices&quot; (673–677), with the help of a nearly equally corrupt passage of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Eroticus&quot;.

The Cambridge University Press was proposing a new edition of Thomas Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Aeschylus&quot;, and the editorship was offered to Porson; but he declined to reprint Stanley&#x27;s corrupt text and incorporate the variorum notes. He was especially anxious that the Medicean manuscript at Florence should be collated for the new edition, and offered to undertake the collation; but the syndics refused the offer, the vice-chancellor John Torkington, master of Clare Hall (the then name of Clare College), observing that Porson might collect his manuscripts at home.

In 1786, a new edition of Thomas Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; of Xenophon was called for, and Porson was asked by the publisher to supply notes, which he did in conjunction with Walter Whiter. These are a good example of the terse style of Latin notes he practised. They also show his acquaintance with his two favourite authors, Plato and Athenaeus, and a familiarity with Eustathius of Thessalonica&#x27;s commentary on Homer.

The following year Porson wrote his &quot;Notae breves ad Toupii emendationes in Suidam&quot;, though this treatise did not appear until 1790 in the new edition of Jonathan Toup&#x27;s book published at Oxford. These first made Porson&#x27;s name known as a scholar and carried his fame beyond England. The letters he had from Christian Gottlob Heine and Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann were preserved in the library of Trinity College.

During 1787 he wrote three letters on John Hawkins&#x27;s &quot;Life of Johnson&quot; for the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which were reprinted by Thomas Kidd in his &quot;Tracts and Criticisms of Porson&quot;, and in a volume of Porson&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence&quot;. They are specimens of dry humour, and allude to English dramatists and poets. In the same periodical during 1788 and 1789 appeared the &quot;Letters to Archdeacon Travis&quot; against George Travis, on a debated Biblical verse called the &quot;Comma Johanneum&quot; (1 John 5:7). Edward Gibbon&#x27;s verdict on the book was that it was &quot;the most acute and accurate piece of criticism since the days of Bentley.&quot; But it was then the unpopular side: the publisher is said to have lost money on the book; and one of his early friends, Mrs Turner of Norwich, cut down a legacy she had left Porson to £30 on being told that he had written a book against the Bible.

After 1787 Porson continued to contribute to the leading reviews, writing in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; the articles on Joseph Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Parian Chronicle&quot;, Thomas Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Plutarch on Education&quot;, and Richard Payne Knight&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Greek Alphabet&quot;. He gave assistance to William Beloe in one or two articles in the &quot;British Critic&quot;, and probably wrote also in the &quot;Analytical Review&quot; and the &quot;Critical Review&quot;.

==Loss of fellowship==
In 1792 his fellowship ceased to be tenable by a layman; and Porson decided not to take holy orders. The Master, Thomas Postlethwaite, who had the nomination to one of the two permanent lay fellowships, used his privilege to nominate John Heys, his nephew. Porson was without means of support, but a subscription was got up among his friends to provide an annuity; Cracherode, Cleaver Banks, Burney and Samuel Parr took the lead, and enough was collected to produce about £100 a year. He accepted it on the condition that he should receive the interest during his lifetime and that the principal should be returned to the donors on his death. When this occurred, part of the sum was used to found the Porson Prize in 1816 at Cambridge, and remainder for the foundation of the Porson Scholarship, first awarded in 1855.

He continued chiefly to reside in London, in chambers in Essex Court, Temple, London — occasionally visiting his friends, such as Joseph Goodall at Eton College and Samuel Parr at Hatton, Warwickshire. It was at Goodall&#x27;s house that the &quot;Letters to Travis&quot; were written. At Hatton, in the evenings, he would collect the young men of the house about him and pour forth from memory torrents of literature. In 1792 the Regius Greek Professorship at Cambridge became vacant with the resignation of William Cooke. Porson was elected without opposition and held the chair until his death. The duties consisted of taking a part in the examinations for the university scholarships and classical medals. It was said he wished to give lectures; but lecturing was not in fashion in those days.

==Later work==
Porson worked mainly on the tragedians, Aristophanes, Athenaeus, and the lexicons of Suidas, Hesychius and Photius. This last he twice transcribed (the first transcript was destroyed by a fire at James Perry&#x27;s house) from the original among the Gale manuscripts in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was pleased when he found how often in Aristophanes he had been anticipated by Bentley, and when Niels Iversen Schow&#x27;s collation of the unique manuscripts of Hesychius appeared and proved him right in some instances.

In 1795 there appeared from Foulis&#x27;s press at Glasgow an edition of Aeschylus in folio, printed with the same type as the Glasgow Homer, without a word of preface or any clue to the editor. Many new readings were inserted in the text with an asterisk affixed, while an obelus was used to mark many others as corrupt. It was at once recognised as Porson&#x27;s work; he had superintended the printing of a small edition in two octavo volumes, but this was kept back by the printer and not issued till 1806, still without the editor&#x27;s name. It was printed from a copy of Jan Cornelis de Pauw&#x27;s edition corrected, which is preserved in the library of Trinity College.

Soon after, in 1797, appeared the first instalment of what was intended to be a complete edition of Euripides–an edition of the &quot;Hecuba&quot;.

===Reception===

Porson&#x27;s work did not escape attack. Gilbert Wakefield had published a &quot;Tragoediarum delectus&quot;. Conceiving himself slighted, as there was no mention of his work in the new &quot;Hecuba&quot;, he wrote a &quot;diatribe extemporalis&quot; against it. Gottfried Hermann of Leipzig had also written a work on Greek metres and issued an edition of the &quot;Hecuba&quot;, in which Porson&#x27;s theories were attacked. Porson at first took no notice of either, but went on with his Euripides, publishing the &quot;Orestes&quot; in 1798, the &quot;Phoenissae&quot; in 1799 and the &quot;Medea&quot; in 1801, the last printed at the Cambridge press, and with the editor&#x27;s name on the title page. But there are many allusions to his antagonists in the notes; and in the &quot;Medea&quot; he holds Hermann to scorn by name in caustic language. Hermann&#x27;s attack may have provoked the supplement to the preface to the &quot;Hecuba&quot;, in the second edition published at Cambridge in 1802. There the laws of the iambic metre are fully explained. A third edition of the &quot;Hecuba&quot; appeared in 1808, and he left corrected copies of the other plays, of which new editions appeared soon after his death; but these four plays were all that was finished of the projected edition of the poet.

Porson lived six years after the second edition of the &quot;Hecuba&quot; was published, but he put off the work. He found time, however, to execute his collation of the Harleian manuscript of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, published in the Grenville Homer in 1801, and to present to the Society of Antiquaries his conjectural restoration of the Rosetta Stone.

==Later life and death==
In 1806, when the London Institution was founded in Old Jewry, Porson was appointed principal librarian, with a salary of £200 a year and a suite of rooms. This assured him financial ease in his latter years.

Among his intimate friends was James Perry, editor of &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;. He married Perry&#x27;s sister, Mrs Lunan, in November 1796. Porson then drank less; but she died a few months after her marriage (12 April 1797), and he returned to his chambers in the Temple and his old habits. Perry&#x27;s friendship induced him to spend his time in writing for &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;.

For some months before his death he had appeared to be failing; his memory was not what it had been, and he had some symptoms of intermittent fever, but on 19 September 1808 he was seized in the street with a fit of apoplexy, and after partially recovering, died on the 25th. He was buried in Trinity College Chapel, close to the statue of Newton, at the opposite end of the chapel to the remains of Richard Bentley.

==Legacy==
Porson did not discriminate between the manuscripts he used or point out the relative value of early copies. Thus he collates minutely Lascaris&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Medea&quot;, mentioning even misprints in the text. His most brilliant emendations are convincing.

His library was divided into two parts, one of which was sold by auction, while the other, containing the transcript of the &quot;Gale Photius&quot;, his books with his notes, and some letters from foreign scholars, was bought by Trinity College for 1000 guineas. His notebooks were careful; they have been rearranged, and illustrate his penmanship. Much remains unpublished. James Henry Monk, his successor as Greek professor, and Charles James Blomfield edited the &quot;Adversaria&quot;, consisting of the notes on Athenaeus and the Greek poets, and his prelection on Euripides; Peter Paul Dobree, afterwards Greek professor, the notes on Aristophanes and the lexicon of Photius. Besides these, from other sources, Thomas Gaisford edited his notes on Pausanias and Suidas, and Thomas Kidd collected his scattered reviews. When Thomas Burgess attacked his literary character over his &quot;Letters to Travis&quot;, Thomas Turton came forward to defend him.

For the first thirty years of the 19th century, he was often regarded as the author of a very popular poem, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Thoughts&quot; (later entitled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Walk&quot;). It was actually written by Robert Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

<text>Analog recording is a category of techniques used for the recording of analog signals. This enables later playback of the recorded analog audio.

Analog audio recording began with mechanical systems such as the phonautograph and phonograph. Later, electronic techniques such as wire and tape recording were developed.

Analog recording methods store analog signals directly in or on the media. The signal may be stored as a physical texture on a phonograph record, or a fluctuation in the field strength of a magnetic recording. Analog transmission methods use analog signals to distribute audio content. These are in contrast to digital audio where an analog signal is sampled and quantized to produce a digital signal which is represented, stored and transmitted as discrete numbers.

<text>Alb-Donau-Kreis is a (district) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Biberach, Reutlingen, Göppingen and Heidenheim, the two Bavarian districts Günzburg and Neu-Ulm, and the city of Ulm.

== History ==

The history of the region is linked with the history of Ulm and the Swabian Jura.

Listing of towns and municipalities in the former Ulm district:
The district of Alb-Donau was established in 1973 by merging the former districts of Ulm and Ehingen, some municipalities of the Münsingen district and the municipalities of Oberbalzheim and Unterbalzheim of the Biberach district.

== Geography ==

The city of Ulm is surrounded by the district. It is the administrative seat of the Alb-Donau district, although it is not part of the district.

The district is named after the Danube River and the Swabian Jura mountains. The Danube enters the district in the southwest, runs through the southern parts of the district and leaves eastwards to Ulm. North of the Danube banks, the hills of the Swabian Jura rise. The hill chain extends from southwest to northeast parallel to the course of the Danube River and is continued on either side of the district. An affluent of the Danube, the Iller River, forms the southeastern border of the Alb-Donau district, before it meets the Danube in Ulm.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms is identical to the coat of arms of the former district of Ulm. The eagle was the heraldic animal of the Free Imperial City of Ulm. The shield displays the deer antlers of Württemberg and the red and white stripes of the Austrian county of Burgau (which the southern parts of the district once belonged to).

<text>John Greenwood (1556 – 6 April 1593) was an English Separatist Puritan, or Brownist, minister who was executed for his faith. He led the London underground church from 1587 to 1593 and wrote several works of Brownist apologetics, working closely with Henry Barrow.

==Life==
Greenwood was born in 1556 in Heptonstall, West Riding, Yorkshire, England. He entered as a sizar at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 18 March 1577/1578, and commenced B.A. 1581.

Whether he was directly influenced by the teaching of Robert Browne, a graduate of the same college, is uncertain; in any case he held strong Puritan opinions, which ultimately led him to Separatism of the most rigid type. In 1581 he was chaplain to Lord Rich, at Rochford, Essex. He had been made deacon by John Aylmer, Bishop of London, and priest by Thomas Cooper, Bishop of Lincoln. He was appointed Vicar of All Saints, Rackheath, in Norfolk, just five miles from the surviving Brownist church of Norwich. Around September 1585, Greenwood embraced Brownism, renounced this ordination as &quot;wholly unlawful,&quot; resigned from All Saints, and travelled to London to join the underground church.

Details of the next few years are lacking; but by 1586 he was the recognized leader of the London Separatists, of whom a considerable number had been imprisoned at various times since 1567. Greenwood was arrested on 8 October 1586, along with 20 others, when their service was raided in the house of Henry Martin in the parish of St Andrew-by- the Wardrobe, and held in the Clink prison.

Greenwood was interrogated at the Newgate Sessions under the 1581 Recusancy Act, fined £260 and moved to the Fleet Prison. During his imprisonment he wrote some controversial tracts in conjunction with his fellow prisoner Henry Barrow, Mrs Greenwood smuggling the pages out of prison and their maid Cycely smuggling the books back in. He was formerly thought to have been at liberty in the autumn of 1588; but this was probably merely &quot;the liberty of the prison.&quot; However, Greenwood was released in July 1592, after four years in the Fleet, and he was elected &quot;teacher&quot; of the underground church.

Meanwhile, in 1590, Greenwood wrote &quot;An Answer to George Gifford&#x27;s pretended Defence of Read Prayers&quot;, which like much of his writing argued that prayer must be spontaneous, and even the Lord&#x27;s Prayer should not be used in worship. On 5 December 1592 he was again arrested; and in March 1593 he was tried, together with Barrowe, and condemned to death on a charge of &quot;devising and circulating seditious books.&quot; After two respites, one at the foot of the gallows, he was hanged on 23 May 1593 in Tyburn, Middlesex.

<text>The English-only movement, also known as the Official English movement, is a political movement that advocates for the exclusive use of the English language in official United States government communication through the establishment of English as the only official language in the United States. The United States has never had an official national language. However, at some times and places, there have been various moves to promote or require the use of English, such as in Native American boarding schools.

Support for the English-only movement began in 1907, under US President Theodore Roosevelt, and continues today as studies prove high percentage in approval ratings. Republican candidates have supported this movement during elections.

The English-only movement has received criticism and rejection within societies and educational systems. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has stated that English-only laws are inconsistent with both the First Amendment right to communicate with or petition the government, as well as free speech and the right to equality, because they bar government employees from providing non-English language assistance and services.

On February 28, 2025, President Donald Trump made English the United States&#x27; official language by executive order, although agencies will be able to provide documents and services in other languages as they wish.

==Early efforts==
Disputes between citizens and immigrants over English have been waged since the 1750s, when street signs were changed in Pennsylvania to include both English and German languages to accommodate the many German immigrants. The German-English debate continued until World War I when international hostility resulted in the rejection of all things German, including the prohibition of the German language and German-language materials, particularly books.

In 1803, as a result of the Louisiana Purchase, the United States acquired French-speaking populations in Louisiana. As a condition to admittance to the Union, Louisiana included in its constitution a provision, which was later repealed, that required all official documents be published in the language &quot;in which the Constitution of the United States is written&quot;. Today, Louisiana has no law stating that English is the official language of the State.

After the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), the United States acquired about 75,000 Spanish speakers in addition to several indigenous language-speaking populations.

An 1847 law authorized Anglo-French instruction in public schools in Louisiana. In 1849, the California constitution recognized Spanish language rights. French language rights were abolished after the American Civil War. In 1868, the Indian Peace Commission recommended English-only schooling for the Native Americans. In 1878–79, the California constitution was rewritten to state that &quot;[a]ll laws of the State of California, and all official writings, and the executive, legislative, and judicial proceedings shall be conducted, preserved, and published in no other than the English language.&quot;

In the late 1880s, Wisconsin and Illinois passed English-only instruction laws for both public and parochial schools.

In 1896, under the Republic of Hawaii government, English became the primary medium of public schooling for Hawaiian children. After the Spanish–American War, English was declared &quot;the official language of the school room&quot; in Puerto Rico. In the same way, English was declared the official language in the Philippines, after the Philippine–American War.

In 1907, US President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, &quot;We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house.&quot;

During World War I, there was a widespread campaign against the use of the German language in the US; this included removing books in the German language from libraries. (A related action took place in South Australia as well with the Nomenclature Act of 1917. The legislation renamed 69 towns, suburbs, or areas that had German names.)

In 1923, a bill drafted by Congressman Washington J. McCormick became the first proposed legislation regarding the United States&#x27; national language that would have made &quot;American&quot; the national language in order to differentiate the United States&#x27;s language from that of England. This bill did not pass in Congress despite significant support—especially from Irish immigrants who were resentful of British influence.

==Support==
U.S. English is an organization that advocates for Official English, founded in the 1980s by former United States Senator S. I. Hayakawa and John Tanton. ProEnglish is another group founded by Tanton that advocates Official English.

In 2018, a Rasmussen poll found that 81% of American adults thought that English should be the official language of the United States, while 12% did not.

In 2021, a Rasmussen poll found that 73% of Americans thought that English should be the official language, only 18% disagreed.

==Modern==
In 1980, Miami-Dade County, Florida voters approved an &quot;anti-bilingual ordinance&quot;. However, this was repealed by the county commission in 1993, after &quot;racially orientated redistricting&quot; led to a change in government.

In 1981, English was declared the official language in the commonwealth of Virginia.

In 1983, John Tanton and U.S. Senator S. I. Hayakawa founded a political lobbying organization, U.S. English. (Tanton was a former head of the Sierra Club&#x27;s population committee and of Zero Population Growth, and founder of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an immigration reductionist group.) In 1986, Tanton wrote a memo containing remarks about Hispanics claimed by critics to be derogatory, which appeared in the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; newspaper, leading to the resignations from U.S. English board member Walter Cronkite and executive director Linda Chavez; Tanton would also sever his ties to the organization as a result. That same year, 1986, Larry Pratt founded English First, while Lou Zaeske, an engineer from Bryan, Texas, established the American Ethnic Coalition. Mauro Mujica, a Chilean immigrant, was later named Chairman and CEO in 1993.

In 1994, John Tanton and other former U.S. English associates founded ProEnglish specifically to defend Arizona&#x27;s English-only law. ProEnglish rejects the term &quot;English-only movement&quot; and asks its supporters to refer to the movement instead as &quot;Official English&quot;.

The U.S. Senate voted on two separate changes to an immigration bill in May 2006. The amended bill recognized English as a &quot;common and unifying language&quot; and gave contradictory instructions to government agencies on their obligations for non-English publications.

In what was essentially a replay of the 2006 actions, on June 6, 2007 the US Senate again voted on two separate amendments to a subsequent immigration reform bill that closely resembled the amendments to the 2006 Senate bill. Ultimately, neither the 2006 nor 2007 immigration reform bill has become law.

On January 22, 2009, voters in Nashville, Tennessee rejected a proposal under a referendum election to make &quot;Nashville the largest city in the United States to prohibit the government from using languages other than English, with exceptions allowed for issues of health and safety.&quot; The initiative failed by a vote of 57% to 43%.

In March 2012, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum was criticized by some Republican delegates from Puerto Rico when he publicly took the position that Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking territory, should be required to make English its primary language as a condition of statehood.

In 2015 during a debate, then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said, &quot;This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.&quot;

On February 6, 2019, the 116th Congress introduced a bill in House establishing English as the official language of the United States. The House of Representatives named it the English Language Unity Act of 2019. Within this bill, there is a framework for implementation. They strive to enforce English as the only language by testing it during the naturalization process. This bill has yet to be passed.

In 2023 then U.S. senator and current U.S. Vice President JD Vance introduced a bill that would have established English as the official language of the United States.

==Criticism==
The modern English-only movement has met with rejection from the Linguistic Society of America, which passed a resolution in 1986–87 opposing &quot;&#x27;English only&#x27; measures on the grounds that they are based on misconceptions about the role of a common language in establishing political unity, and that they are inconsistent with basic American traditions of linguistic tolerance.&quot;

Linguist Geoffrey Pullum, in an essay entitled &quot;Here come the linguistic fascists&quot;, charges English First with &quot;hatred and suspicion of aliens and immigrants&quot; and points out that English is far from under threat in the United States, saying &quot;making English the official language of the United States of America is about as urgently called for as making hotdogs the official food at baseball games.&quot; Rachele Lawton, applying critical discourse analysis, argues that English-only&#x27;s rhetoric suggests that the &quot;real motivation is discrimination and disenfranchisement.&quot;

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has stated that English-only laws are inconsistent with both the First Amendment right to communicate with or petition the government, as well as free speech and the right to equality, because they bar government employees from providing non-English language assistance and services. On August 11, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166, &quot;Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency.&quot; The Executive Order requires Federal agencies to examine the services they provide, identify any need for services to those with limited English proficiency (LEP), and develop and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can have meaningful access to them.

While the judicial system has noted that state English-only laws are largely symbolic and non-prohibitive, supervisors and managers often interpret them to mean English is the mandatory language of daily life. In one instance, an elementary school bus driver prohibited students from speaking Spanish on their way to school after Colorado passed its legislation. In 2004 in Scottsdale, a teacher claimed to be enforcing English immersion policies when she allegedly slapped students for speaking Spanish in class. In 2005 in Kansas City, a student was suspended for speaking Spanish in the school hallways. The written discipline referral explaining the decision of the school to suspend the student for one and a half days, noted: &quot;This is not the first time we have [asked the student] and others to not speak Spanish at school.&quot;

One study both of laws requiring English as the language of instruction and compulsory schooling laws during the Americanization period (1910–1930) found that the policies moderately increased the literacy of some foreign-born children but had no impact on immigrants&#x27; eventual labor market outcomes or measures of social integration. The authors concluded that the &quot;very moderate impacts&quot; of the laws were probably because foreign languages were declining naturally, without the help of English-only laws.

==Current law==

The United States federal government does not specify an official language; however, all official documents in the U.S. are written in English, though some are also published in other languages.

<doc id="190009" wikidata="Q1952919" url="?curid=190009" title="And All That Could Have Been">
<text>And All That Could Have Been is a double album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on January 22, 2002, by Nothing and Interscope Records. The live album contains music recorded during the Fragility v2.0 US tour in 2000. Disc one is a live album of most of the band&#x27;s normal set list of the time, while disc two contains a studio album titled Still, containing &quot;deconstructed&quot; versions of previous Nine Inch Nails songs and some new material. The double DVD set, sold separately, includes video recordings of the songs performed on the CD, as well as additional song performances and footage from the tour.

==Fragility==
Trent Reznor said that work on this release would serve as a transition between the tour and the next album.
He spent most of a year producing it in a manner similar to his studio production, with the songs flowing into each other.
The release was delayed from late 2001 to January 2002.

Although Reznor said &quot;I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it&quot; while producing the DVD, he later wrote that &quot;I can&#x27;t watch it at all. I was sick for most of that tour and I really don&#x27;t think it was Nine Inch Nails at its best.&quot;

==CD version==
There are two retail versions of the CD set: a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; limited edition, packaged in a gray cloth case that contains both the &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;Still&quot; CDs together in a fold-out digipak, and the standard edition that contains only the &quot;Live&quot; disc in a single digipak. The &quot;Still&quot; disc is also available separately, originally via mail order from the official Nine Inch Nails website.

===&quot;Live&quot;===
The &quot;Live&quot; disc is a &quot;loud&quot; recording of performances from the &quot;Fragility 2.0&quot; tour. Without introduction, it begins immediately with &quot;Terrible Lie&quot;.

The songs are arranged differently from their studio versions.

===&quot;Still&quot;===
&quot;Still&quot; contains subdued renditions of older songs and five new songs. According to the NIN website, four of the songs were &quot;recorded live in a deconstructed fashion.&quot; Instruments include piano, acoustic guitar, electric piano, or other &quot;real&quot; instruments backed by computer-generated synth textures.

Reznor said that &quot;Adrift and at Peace&quot; is the conclusion of &quot;La Mer&quot; from &quot;The Fragile&quot;.
Some of the tracks off &quot;Still&quot; are evolutions of rejected themes that were originally written for Mark Romanek&#x27;s &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;.
&quot;Leaving Hope&quot; is also the name under which Reznor has published music since the beginning of his songwriting career. Reznor later allowed &quot;Leaving Hope&quot; to be used in a public service announcement for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief.

Videos for the performances of &quot;Something I Can Never Have&quot;, &quot;Gone, Still&quot; (with Jerome Dillon), and &quot;The Becoming&quot; (with Dillon and Danny Lohner) were published on the official NIN website.

The band also performed an intimate acoustic set at the Chicago Recording Company during the Fragility 2.0 tour, which is available online and on bootleg CD, as &quot;The CRC Sessions&quot;; it includes arrangements of &quot;Something I Can Never Have&quot; and &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; that prefigure their &quot;Still&quot; recordings, as well as two versions of &quot;Hurt&quot; and full band performances of &quot;The Fragile&quot;, &quot;Even Deeper&quot;, and &quot;The Big Come Down&quot;. Nine Inch Nails&#x27; studio musician, Keith Hillebrandt, had filled in on keyboards for the absent Clouser at the session.

==DVD==

The DVD version, produced by Trent Reznor and directed by Rob Sheridan, comprises video footage from the 2000 Fragility 2.0 tour. Sheridan and other members of the band&#x27;s crew filmed the tour using consumer DV cameras, and the DVD was then put together internally at Reznor&#x27;s New Orleans studio, where Sheridan and Reznor edited it on a Mac using Final Cut Pro and compiled it with DVD Studio Pro.

Although Reznor originally hired a filming company, he changed his mind based on cost and his experience from &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; tour, wanting to capture the shows from a more realistic point of view. This decision allowed the crew to review the shots each night on the tour bus so they could tell what to focus on during the next show. As a result, the video is dark and smoky rather than polished, the cameras are sometimes shaky and there are no sweeping crane shots.

There are two different versions of the DVD set: one with a 5.1 Dolby Digital surround soundtrack and the other with a 5.1 DTS surround soundtrack. Releasing them separately allowed the picture quality to remain optimal on both versions. The DTS version does not allow on-the-fly alternate angle switching, but all the additional performances found via the hidden easter eggs on the DTS version are included in DTS 5.1 surround; on the Dolby version they are in Dolby 2.0 stereo only. Other than this, both sets are identical. This video was also released on one VHS tape.

The menus were designed to appear uniquely upon each viewing.
The DVD package includes a clear, plastic slip with a message from Reznor.

Video artist Bill Viola created the multi-screen magnified imagery for &quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;The Great Below&quot;, and &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot;.

===Bonus features and easter eggs===
The DVD version has a number of bonus features and hidden easter eggs. In disc 1, there are alternate stationary camera angles for &quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;The Great Below&quot; and &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot;. A stationary angle version for &quot;Gave Up&quot; is found by hitting ENTER at 26:58, or from the supplemental content menu on the DTS version.

Disc 2 includes a photo gallery and an audio commentary by Bill Viola discussing his video effects for &quot;La Mer&quot;, &quot;The Great Below&quot; and &quot;The Mark Has Been Made&quot;. The NinetyNine commercial (0:30) can be viewed by highlight &quot;Main Menu&quot; in the supplemental content menu, then pressing LEFT, UP, then ENTER. A performance of &quot;Reptile&quot; (6:24) can be found by pressing UP then ENTER during &quot;Suck&quot; at 1:06. A performance of &quot;The Day the World Went Away&quot; (6:36) featuring clips from a scrapped music video can be viewed by pressing LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP, ENTER at 16:10.
If ENTER is pressed at 24:15 during &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot;, then a video plays in which Marilyn Manson appears on stage to sing the end of that song, followed by a performance of &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; by Nine Inch Nails and Manson at the Madison Square Garden.

If &quot;7&quot; (or &quot;6&quot; on some versions) is pressed at 11:19 on Disc 2, the &quot;Beneath The Surface&quot; menu appears, which allows access to the aforementioned easter eggs as well as promo spots for &quot;The Fragile&quot; (0:30) and its remix album &quot;Things Falling Apart&quot; (1:02).

===Track listing===
Also contains an unlisted mix of &quot;The New Flesh&quot; and &quot;Pinion&quot; that serves as an introduction before &quot;Terrible Lie&quot;. The DVD version comes on two discs, splitting the concert between &quot;Complication&quot; and &quot;Suck&quot;.

<text>John Aylmer (Ælmer or Elmer; 1521 – 3 June 1594) was an English bishop, constitutionalist and a Greek scholar.

==Early life and career==
He was born at Aylmer Hall, Tilney St. Lawrence, Norfolk. While still a boy, his precocity was noticed by Henry Grey, 3rd Marquess of Dorset, later 1st Duke of Suffolk, who sent him to Cambridge, where he seems to have become a fellow of Queens&#x27; College. About 1541 he was made chaplain to the duke, and tutor of Greek to his daughter, Lady Jane Grey.

His first preferment was to the archdeaconry of Stow, in the diocese of Lincoln, but his opposition in Convocation to the doctrine of transubstantiation led to his deprivation and to his flight into Switzerland. While there he wrote a reply to John Knox&#x27;s famous &quot;Blast against the Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot;, under the title of &quot;An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subjects, etc.&quot;, and assisted John Foxe in translating the &quot;Acts of the Martyrs&quot; into Latin. On the accession of Elizabeth he returned to England. &quot;God is English&quot;, Aylmer proclaimed in 1558, attempting to fill his parishioners with piety and patriotism. In 1559 he resumed the Stow archdeaconry, and in 1562 he obtained that of Lincoln. He was a member of the convocation of 1563, which reformed and settled the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England.

In 1577 he was consecrated Bishop of London, and while in that position made himself notorious by his harsh treatment of all who differed from him on ecclesiastical questions, whether Puritan or Roman Catholic. Various efforts were made to remove him to another see. He is frequently assailed in the famous &quot;Marprelate Tracts&quot;, and is characterised as &quot;Morrell,&quot; the bad shepherd, in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Shepheard&#x27;s Calendar (July)&quot;. His reputation as a scholar hardly balances his inadequacy as a bishop in the transitional time in which he lived. His &quot;Life&quot; was written by John Strype (1701).

He died in 1594 and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He had several children; his eldest son Samuel was the High Sheriff of Suffolk for 1626.

==Works==
&quot;Aylmer, like John Ponet and Stephen Gardiner before him, is an important figure in the story of the reception of classical mixed government in Tudor England.&quot; John Aylmer wrote his work &quot;An harborowe for faithful and trewe subiectes&quot; (1559), to defend the female monarchy of Elizabeth I associating &quot;the rule of boyes and women, or effeminate persons&quot; and on another basis; &quot;that cytie is at pits brinks, wherein magistrate ruleth lawes, and not the lawes the magistrate: What could any kyng in Israell do in that common wealth, besides the pollycie appointed by Moyses?&quot;. His effort to familiarise his fellow countrymen with the &quot;strange and alluring vocabulary of politics&quot;, introducing them to the classical forms and terminology, must be viewed as secondary to this primary goal.

Aylmer nevertheless described England as not &quot;a mere monarchy, as some for lack of consideration think, nor a mere oligarchy, nor democracy, but a rule mixed of all these.&quot; 1 He goes on to say that in the mixed state, &quot;each one of these have or should have like authority.&quot; He argued that in the king-in-Parliament, or, in Elizabeth&#x27;s case, the queen-in-Parliament, was not the &quot;image&quot; of a mixed state &quot;but the thing in deed.&quot; It was in Parliament that one found the three estates: &quot;the king or queen, which representeth the monarchy; the noble men which be the aristocracy; and the burgesses and knights the democracy.&quot; As he says, &quot;In like manner, &quot;if&quot; the Parliament use their privileges: the king can ordain nothing without them.&quot; Parliamentary restraint of a queen&#x27;s feminine vices would, according to Aylmer, ameliorate the disadvantages of female monarchy.

His work, particularly his characterisation of England as a mixed monarchy, would be important to later English constitutionalists.

<doc id="190020" wikidata="Q538094" url="?curid=190020" title="Connop Thirlwall">
<text>Connop Thirlwall (11 January 1797 – 27 July 1875) was an English bishop (in Wales) and historian.

==Early life==
Thirlwall was born at Stepney, London, to Thomas and Susannah Thirlwall. His father was an Anglican priest who claimed descent from a Northumbrian family, served for some years as chaplain to Bishop Thomas Percy before becoming rector of Bowers Gifford in Essex in 1814. The young Connop was a prodigy, learning Latin at three, Greek at four, and writing sermons at seven.

He went to Charterhouse School, where George Grote and Julius Hare were among his schoolfellows. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1814. gained the Craven university scholarship and the chancellor&#x27;s classical medal and served as Secretary of the Cambridge Union Society in the Lent term, 1817. In October 1818 he was elected to a fellowship, and went for a year&#x27;s travel on the Continent. In Rome he made friends with Christian Charles Josias Bunsen, which had a most important influence on his life. On his return, &quot;distrust of his own resolutions and convictions&quot; led him to abandon for the time his intention of being a clergyman, and he settled down to study law, though he did not lose interest in other subjects. In the meantime, he took on the task of translating and prefacing Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher&#x27;s essay on the Gospel of St Luke. He further rendered two of Johann Ludwig Tieck&#x27;s most recent &quot;Novellen&quot; into English. In 1827 he made up his mind to finish with law, and was ordained deacon the same year.

Thirlwall now joined Hare in translating Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;; the first volume appeared in 1828. The translation was attacked in the &quot;Quarterly&quot; as favourable to scepticism, and the translators jointly replied. In 1831 they established the &quot;Philological Museum&quot;, which lasted only six numbers. Among Thirlwall&#x27;s contributions was his masterly paper &quot;On the Irony of Sophocles&quot;, which pioneered the concept of dramatic irony.

On Hare&#x27;s departure from Cambridge in 1832, Thirlwall became assistant college tutor, which led him to join in the great controversy upon the admission of Dissenters which arose in 1834. Thomas Turton, the regius professor of divinity (afterwards dean of Westminster and bishop of Ely), had written a pamphlet objecting to the admission. Thirlwall replied by pointing out that no provision for theological instruction was made by the colleges except compulsory attendance at chapel. This attack on a time-hallowed piece of college discipline brought a demand for his resignation as assistant tutor. He complied at once; his friends thought that he ought to have sat it out.

The event marked him out for promotion by a Liberal Government, and in the autumn he received from Lord Brougham as chancellor the living of Kirby Underdale in Yorkshire.

==&quot;History of Greece&quot;==
Though devoted to his parochial duties, he found time to begin his principal work, the &quot;History of Greece&quot;. This work was a commission from Dionysius Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopaedia&quot;, and was originally intended to be condensed into two or three duodecimo volumes. The scale was enlarged, but Thirlwall always felt cramped. Compared with Grote&#x27;s history it lacks enthusiasm for a definite political ideal and is written entirely from the standpoint of a scholar. It shows a more impartial treatment of the evidence, especially in respect of the aristocratic and absolute governments of Greece. For these reasons its popularity was not so immediate as that of Grote&#x27;s work, but its substantial merits were later recognised. A letter from Thirlwall to Grote, and Grote&#x27;s generous reply, are published in the life of the latter. John Sterling pronounced Thirlwall &quot;a writer as great as Thucydides and Tacitus, and with far more knowledge than they.&quot; The first volume was published in 1835, the last in 1847.

==Bishop of St David&#x27;s==
In 1837, Thirlwall was proposed as bishop of Norwich but his appointment was opposed by both King William IV and William Howley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, due to his liberal views.

In 1840 Thirlwall was raised to the see of St David&#x27;s. The promotion was entirely the act of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne, an amateur in theology, who had read Thirlwall&#x27;s introduction to Schleiermacher, and satisfied himself of the propriety of the appointment. &quot;I don&#x27;t intend to make a heterodox bishop if I know it,&quot; he said. In most essential points he was a model bishop, and he acquainted himself with Welsh, so as to preach and conduct services in that language. He was also the first bishop of St David&#x27;s to be enthroned in person for many years.

He was not greatly loved by his clergy, who found him both taciturn and sarcastic. The great monument of his episcopate is the eleven famous charges in which he from time to time reviewed the position of the English Church with reference to whatever might be the most pressing question of the day—addresses at once judicial and statesmanlike, full of charitable wisdom and massive sense.

His attempts to allay ecclesiastical panic, and to promote liberality of spirit, required no ordinary moral courage. He was one of four prelates who refused to prevent Bishop Colenso from preaching in their dioceses, and the only one who withheld his signature from the addresses calling upon Colenso to resign his see. He took the liberal side in the questions of Maynooth, of the admission of Jews to parliament, of the Gorham case, and of the educational conscience clause.

He was the only bishop who voted for the disestablishment of the Irish Church, though a scheme of concurrent endowment would have been much more agreeable to him. He would have made an admirable successor to Howley in the primacy, but such was the complexion of ecclesiastical politics that the elevation of the most impartial prelate of his day would have been resented as a piece of party spirit.

==Character==
Thirlwall&#x27;s private life was happy and busy. Though never married, he was fond of children and of all weak things except weak-minded clergymen. He had a very judicial mind, and John Stuart Mill said he was the best orator he had ever heard. During his latter years he took great interest in the revision of the authorised version of the Bible, and was chairman of the revisers of the Old Testament.

He resigned his see in May 1874, and retired to Bath, where he died. He was buried in Westminster Abbey in the same grave as Grote. His bust on his monument was sculpted by Edward Davis.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, as scholar, critic and ecclesiastical statesman Thirlwall stood very high. He was not a great original thinker; he lacked the creative faculty and the creative impulse. His character, with its mixture of greatness and gentleness, was thus read by Carlyle: &quot;A right solid, honest-hearted man, full of knowledge and sense, and, in spite of his positive temper, almost timid.&quot;

<text>Thomas Wade Landry ( ; September 11, 1924 – February 12, 2000) was an American professional football coach, player, and World War II veteran. Regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time, he was the first head coach of the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League (NFL), a position he held for 29 seasons. During his coaching career, he created many new formations and methods, such as the now default 4–3 defense that is used by a majority of teams in the NFL, and the &quot;flex defense&quot; system made famous by the &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot; squads he built during his tenure with the Cowboys. His 29 consecutive years from 1960 to 1988 as the coach of one team is an NFL record, along with his 20 consecutive winning seasons, which is considered to be his most impressive professional accomplishment.

In addition to his record 20 consecutive winning seasons from 1966 to 1985, Landry won two Super Bowl titles in Super Bowl VI and XII, five NFC titles, and 13 divisional titles. He compiled a 270–178–6 record, the fourth-most wins all-time for an NFL coach, and his 20 career playoff victories are the third-most of any coach in NFL history. Landry was also named the NFL Coach of the Year in 1966 and the NFC Coach of the Year in 1975.

From 1966 to 1982, a span of 17 years, Dallas played in 12 NFL or NFC Championship games. Furthermore, the Cowboys appeared in 10 NFC Championship games in the 13-year span from 1970 to 1982. Leading the Cowboys to three Super Bowl appearances in four years between 1975 and 1978, and five in nine years between 1970 and 1978, along with being on television more than any other NFL team, resulted in the Cowboys receiving the label of &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot;, a title Landry did not appreciate because he felt it would bring on extra motivation from the rest of the league to compete with the Cowboys. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990 as a head coach.

== Early life ==
Born in Mission, Texas, to Ray (an auto mechanic and volunteer fireman) and Ruth (Coffman) Landry, Tom was the second of four children (Robert, Tom, Ruthie, and Jack). Landry&#x27;s father had suffered from rheumatism, and relocated to the warmer climate of Texas from Illinois. Ray Landry was an athlete, making his mark locally as a pitcher and football player. Tom played quarterback and punter for Mission High School, where he led his team to a 12–0 record in his senior season. The Mission High School football stadium is named Tom Landry Stadium and is home to the Mission Eagles and Mission Patriots which also bears the Pro Football Hall of Fame logo.

Landry attended the University of Texas at Austin as an industrial engineering major. Landry had given thought to enrolling at Mississippi State University, where his friend John Tripson was an All-American, but did not want to be far away from his friends and family in Texas. The main driving force in keeping him from enrolling at Mississippi State University was the notion that it would be too long a travel for his parents to see him play college football.

== U.S. Army Air Corps ==
He interrupted his education after a semester to serve in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. Landry was inspired to join the armed forces by his brother Robert Landry, who had enlisted in the Army Air Corps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While ferrying a B-17 over to England, Robert Landry&#x27;s plane had gone down over the North Atlantic, close to Iceland. Several weeks passed before the Army was able to officially declare Robert Landry dead. Landry began his basic training at Sheppard Field near Wichita Falls, Texas (now Sheppard AFB), and his preflight training at Kelly Field (now Kelly Field), located near San Antonio, Texas. Landry&#x27;s first experience as a bomber pilot was a tough one. A few minutes after takeoff, Landry noticed that the pilot seemed to be working furiously, causing him to realize that the plane&#x27;s engine had died. Despite this experience, Landry was committed to flying. At the age of 19, Landry was transferred to Sioux City, Iowa, where he trained as a copilot on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber. In 1944, Landry got his orders, and from Sioux City he went to Liverpool, England, where he was assigned to the Eighth Air Force, in Ipswich. Landry earned his wings and a commission as a Second Lieutenant at Lubbock Army Air Field, and was assigned to the 493d Bombardment Group at RAF Debach, England, in the 860th Bombardment Squadron. From November 1944 to April 1945, he completed a combat tour of 26 missions, (his entire crew went on 29 missions and Landry did not go on 3 of them), he also survived a crash landing in Belgium after his bomber ran out of fuel.
He returned to his studies at the University of Texas in the fall of 1946. On the football team, he played fullback and defensive back on the Texas Longhorns&#x27; bowl game winners on New Year&#x27;s Day of 1948 and 1949. At UT, he was a member of the Texas Cowboys and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Omega Chi chapter). He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from UT in 1949. In 1952, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in industrial engineering from the University of Houston.

== Playing career ==
Landry was selected in the 19th round (128th overall) of the 1948 AAFC Draft. He played one season in the All-America Football Conference for the New York Yankees, then moved in 1950 across town to the New York Giants.

Landry was also selected by the New York Giants in the 20th round (184th overall) of the 1947 NFL draft.

After the 1949 season, the AAFC folded, and the Yankees were not among the teams absorbed by the NFL. The New York Giants exercised their territorial rights and selected Landry in a dispersal draft. Under the guidance of Giants head coach Steve Owen, Landry got his first taste of coaching. Instead of explaining the 6–1–4 defense to the players, Owen called Landry up to the front, and asked him to explain the defense to his teammates. Landry got up, and explained what the defense would do to counter the offense, and this became Landry&#x27;s first coaching experience. The 1953 season would be a season to forget, with the lowest point coming in a 62–10 loss at the hands of the Cleveland Browns. This loss would ultimately cost Coach Owen his job, and would again have Landry pondering his future. In 1954, he was selected as an All-Pro. He played through the 1955 season, and acted as a player-assistant coach the last two years, 1954 through 1955, under the guidance of new Giants head coach Jim Lee Howell. Landry ended his playing career with 32 interceptions in only 80 games, which he returned for 404 yards and three touchdowns. He also recovered 10 fumbles (seven defensive), returning them for 67 yards and two touchdowns.

== Coaching career ==
For the 1954 football season, Landry became the defensive coordinator for the Giants, opposite Vince Lombardi, who was the offensive coordinator. Landry stayed on as a full-time defensive coordinator after his retirement, and led one of the best defensive units in the league from 1956 to 1959. The two coaches created a fanatical loyalty on a team that they coached to three appearances in the NFL championship game in four years. The Giants beat the Paddy Driscoll-led Chicago Bears 47–7 in 1956, but lost to the Baltimore Colts in 1958 and 1959.

In 1960, he became the first head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, a position he held for 29 seasons (1960–88). The Cowboys started with difficulties, recording an 0–11–1 record during their first season, with five or fewer wins in each of their next four. Despite this early futility, in 1964, Landry was given a 10-year extension by owner Clint Murchison Jr. It would prove to be a wise move, as Landry&#x27;s hard work and determination paid off, and the Cowboys improved to a 7–7 record in 1965. In 1966, they surprised the NFL by posting 10 wins and making it all the way to the NFL Championship game. Dallas lost the game to Lombardi&#x27;s Green Bay Packers, but this season was but a modest display of what lay ahead.

=== The Great Innovator ===

Landry developed the now-popular &quot;4–3 defense&quot; while serving as Giants defensive coordinator. It was called &quot;4–3&quot; because it featured four down lineman (two ends and two defensive tackles on either side of the offensive center) and three linebackers – middle, left, and right. The innovation was the middle linebacker. Previously, a lineman was placed over the center. But Landry had this person stand up and move back two yards. The Giants&#x27; middle linebacker was the legendary Sam Huff.

When he came to Dallas, Landry refined the 4–3 even further, specifically to counter Lombardi&#x27;s &quot;run to daylight&quot; strategy. Lombardi&#x27;s offense was built around sending the running back through any open space, rather than a specific assigned hole. Landry reasoned that the best counter was a defense that blotted out the daylight. The result was the &quot;Flex Defense,&quot; which assigned the defenders specific areas of the field to cover. When Landry first implemented it in 1964, fans were initially mystified when they saw the Cowboys defense not swarming to the ball. However, the skeptics were won over when ball carriers invariably ran right into the arms of one of Landry&#x27;s defenders. The Flex Defense worked so well that Landry had to create an offense to score on it, one which disguised an otherwise simple play with multiple formations.

Landry did not always search inside the traditional college football pipeline for talent. For example, he recruited several soccer players from Latin America, such as Efren Herrera and Rafael Septién, to compete for the job of placekicker for the Cowboys. Landry looked to the world of track and field for speedy skill-position players. For example, Bob Hayes, once considered the fastest man in the world, was drafted by and played wide receiver for the Cowboys under Landry.

Landry produced a very large coaching tree. In 1986, five NFL head coaches were former Landry assistants: Mike Ditka, Dan Reeves, John Mackovic, Gene Stallings, and Raymond Berry.

=== Coaching in the Super Bowl ===

While Tom Landry&#x27;s Cowboys are known for their two Super Bowls against Chuck Noll and the Pittsburgh Steelers, Landry also led Dallas to three other Super Bowls, and they were a Bart Starr quarterback sneak away from representing the NFL in the second Super Bowl. Tom Landry was 2–3 in Super Bowls, winning both in New Orleans and losing all three at the Miami Orange Bowl.

Landry coached the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl win, defeating the Miami Dolphins 24–3, holding the Dolphins to a single field goal. The Cowboys won their first Super Bowl a year after losing to the Baltimore Colts. The Cowboys lost the first battle with the Steelers, in a game that is heralded as a classic. The rematch would be just as good, with the Cowboys being a Jackie Smith catch away from tying the Steelers and keeping pace early in the third quarter; instead, Pittsburgh scored twice in succession and put the game away. Before the Super Bowl XIII rematch, Cowboys linebacker Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson famously stated, &quot;Terry Bradshaw couldn&#x27;t spell c-a-t if you spotted him the C and the T.&quot; Landry recalled in his autobiography how he cringed when he heard that, because he did not feel that Bradshaw needed additional motivation in a big game like the Super Bowl.

=== Dismissal and legacy ===
During the 1980s, the Cowboys won two division championships, made five playoff appearances, and reached the NFC Championship Game in three consecutive seasons (1980–1982). However, they failed to reach the Super Bowl during the decade. The team&#x27;s 1982 NFC Championship Game loss was Landry&#x27;s final conference championship game appearance; the preceding week&#x27;s win was his final playoff victory.

In 1984, Dallas businessman Bum Bright bought the team from Murchison. As the Cowboys suffered through progressively poorer seasons (their record falling from 10–6 in 1985 to 7–9 in 1986, 7–8 in 1987, and 3–13 in 1988), Bright became disenchanted with the team. Landry&#x27;s game strategies and single-mindedness during these seasons left him open to public criticism.

Landry signed a three-year contract in the summer of 1987. However, general manager Tex Schramm brought in Paul Hackett as a new offensive coach in 1986, and in 1987, he hired offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck and special-teams coach Mike Solari. Some suggested that Schramm&#x27;s moves divided the coaching staff, a plan to first undermine and then dismiss Landry. Bright, who usually stayed behind the scenes, publicly criticized Landry after a home loss to the Atlanta Falcons in 1987, saying that he was &quot;horrified&quot; at the play-calling and complaining, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t seem like we&#x27;ve got anybody in charge who knows what he&#x27;s doing, other than Tex.&quot; Bright&#x27;s belief that former first-round draft picks Danny Noonan and Herschel Walker were not being used enough further put him at odds with the coaching staff. On the day after the Cowboys lost to the Detroit Lions, a team that had entered the game tied for the worst record in the NFL, Schramm said on his radio show, &quot;There&#x27;s an old saying, &#x27;If the teacher doesn&#x27;t teach, the student doesn&#x27;t learn.&#x27;&quot; Nonetheless, Bright maintained his hands-off approach on the team while Schramm retained his confidence in Landry.

Landry&#x27;s Cowboys finished the 1988 season 3–13, the worst record in the league. His record as head coach fell to 270–178–6. It was the Cowboys&#x27; third consecutive losing season and the fourth time in five years that they had missed the playoffs. Nonetheless, Landry felt confident he could correct the mistakes he had been making in recent years. In February 1989, before the start of the 1989 season, as he dismissed or reassigned his assistants, he remained determined to coach into the 1990s &quot;unless I get fired.&quot; Landry had one year left on his contract, which paid $1 million per season.

Meanwhile, Bright had suffered major losses in his banking, real estate, and oil businesses; during the savings and loan crisis, Bright&#x27;s Savings and Loan was taken over by the FSLIC. With most of the rest of his fortune tied up in the Cowboys, Bright was forced to put the team up for sale. Bright ultimately sold the team to Jerry Jones, who fired Landry on February 25, 1989, one day after closing on the purchase. Jones hired Jimmy Johnson, his former teammate at the University of Arkansas, who had been serving as head coach at the University of Miami. Schramm was in tears at the press conference that announced the coaching change; he was forced out as general manager shortly afterwards. Schramm and Landry had been together for 29 years, each being the only person to serve in their respective position since the Cowboys&#x27; inception in 1960. When Landry met with his players two days later to tell them how much he would miss them, he began to cry, and the players responded with a standing ovation. He had spent 40 consecutive years at field level in the AAFC and NFL: five as a player (1949–53), two as a player-assistant coach (1954–55), four as an assistant coach (1956–59), and 29 as a head coach.

Jones received immediate backlash for his decision to fire Landry, while the former coach received an outpouring of public support. Despite Landry&#x27;s recent poor performance, Cowboys fans felt disillusioned that the only coach in the team&#x27;s history had been removed so unceremoniously. NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle compared the firing to the death of former Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi. President George H.W. Bush, who had previously represented Texas in the House of Representatives, called Landry &quot;an inspiration to all who ever watched or played the game of football.&quot;

Jones stated he never considered retaining Landry and that he would not have purchased the team unless he could hire Johnson as coach. In 1990, Bright said that he regretted the backlash that Jones had faced for firing Landry. Bright recounted that he had been willing to fire Landry himself as early as 1987, but that Schramm had told him that there was no suitable replacement who was ready to assume the job. By 1993, relations between Jones and Landry had improved, and Landry was inducted into the Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium.

Landry&#x27;s last work in professional football was as a limited partner of the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football in 1992.

== Head coaching record ==
== In popular culture ==
* On December 24, 1959, while defensive coach of the Giants, Landry pretended to be Catholic missionary Father William A. Lightning on the panel game &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;.
* The Machiavellian coach in Peter Gent&#x27;s novel &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; is based on Tom Landry. G.D. Spradlin played the role in the film of the same name. 
* In the animated sitcom &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, the middle school in Arlen is named &quot;Tom Landry Middle School&quot;, and Landry is a personal hero of the show&#x27;s main character Hank Hill. He mentions being &quot;mortified&quot; because he went to work on the date of Landry&#x27;s death after his cousin Dusty (guest star Dusty Hill of ZZ Top) had previously tricked him into thinking Landry had died, and he thought it was a repeat of that prank. Hank also has a Tom Landry ceramic plate that he sometimes consults in times of need, on one occasion saying, &quot;Where did I go wrong, Tom?&quot; Landry also occasionally appears to Hank in dream sequences to counsel him in times of need, such as during Hank&#x27;s varnish-induced hallucination in the episode &quot;Hillennium&quot; and in &quot;Trans-Fascism&quot;, when he tells Hank the consequences of breaking the law.
* In an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;You Only Move Twice&quot;), Homer Simpson buys Tom Landry&#x27;s trademark fedora in an effort to improve his leadership qualities, and is shown in several later episodes wearing the hat. Landry is also featured in the season 7 episode &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot; as one of the Christmas carolers introduced by Krusty the Clown early in the episode.
* In a Campbell&#x27;s Chunky Soup commercial, the game takes place in a fictional Reginald H. White Memorial Park, on the corner of Landry Road and Halas Drive.

== Personal life ==
Landry married Alicia Wiggs on January 28, 1949. They had a son and two daughters. He was a Christian. On January 22, 2021, the Dallas Cowboys announced that Alicia had died the previous day at the age of 91.

When coaching on the sidelines Landry always wore a suit and tie with his trademark fedora.

== Death ==

Landry died on February 12, 2000, after battling leukemia. Landry&#x27;s funeral service was held at Highland Park United Methodist Church, where he was an active and committed member for 43 years. He was interred in the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Dallas. A cenotaph dedicated to Landry, complete with a depiction of his fedora, was placed in the official Texas State Cemetery in Austin at the family&#x27;s request.

The Cowboys wore a patch on their uniforms during the 2000 season depicting Landry&#x27;s trademark fedora. A bronze statue of Landry stood outside of Texas Stadium, and now stands in front of AT&amp;T Stadium since the Cowboys relocated in 2009. The section of Interstate 30 between Dallas and Fort Worth was named the Tom Landry Highway by the Texas Legislature in 2001. The football stadium in Landry&#x27;s hometown of Mission, Texas, was named Tom Landry Stadium to honor one of the city&#x27;s most famous former residents. Similarly, Trinity Christian Academy&#x27;s stadium in Addison, Texas, is named Tom Landry Stadium in honor of Landry&#x27;s extensive involvement and support of the school. An elementary school in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School district, very near the Cowboys former training facility in Valley Ranch, is also named in honor of Landry. The Tom Landry Welcome Center at Dallas Baptist University, where he was a frequent chapel speaker and award recipient, was posthumously dedicated to him in 2002.

In 2013, a major new biography of Landry was published, entitled &quot;The Last Cowboy&quot;.

<text>The Queen Is Dead is the third studio album by the English rock band The Smiths, released on 16 June 1986, by Rough Trade Records. The album was produced by the band&#x27;s singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. They worked predominately with engineer Stephen Street, who engineered The Smiths&#x27; previous album, &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot; (1985). Marr wrote several songs while the Smiths toured the United Kingdom in early 1985, working out arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks. The album title is taken from American writer Hubert Selby Jr.&#x27;s 1964 novel, &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;. The cover art features the French actor Alain Delon in the 1964 film &quot;L&#x27;Insoumis&quot;.

&quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; spent 22 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two. It reached number 70 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in late 1990. &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and has since been included in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album 113th on its 2020-updated list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In its 2013 list, &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; the greatest album of all time.

Marr was heavily influenced by the Stooges, the Velvet Underground, and the Detroit garage rock scene while crafting the album.

The album&#x27;s title track was based on a song Marr began writing as a teenager. &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot; was, according to Marr, &quot;an effortless piece of music&quot;, and was written on tour in the spring of 1985. The song&#x27;s lyrics refer allegorically to the band&#x27;s experience of the music industry that failed to appreciate it. In 2003, Morrissey named it his favourite Smiths song.

A demo of the music for &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others&quot; was posted by Marr through Morrissey&#x27;s letterbox in the summer of 1985. Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics. Marr has stated that he &quot;preferred the music to the lyrics&quot;.

&quot;Frankly, Mr. Shankly&quot;, &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; were written by Morrissey and Marr in a &quot;marathon&quot; writing session in the late summer of 1985 at Marr&#x27;s home in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis, head of the Smiths&#x27; record label Rough Trade, however Morrissey denies this. Travis has since described it as &quot;a funny lyric&quot; about &quot;Morrissey&#x27;s desire to be somewhere else&quot;, acknowledging that a line in the song about &quot;bloody awful poetry&quot; was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey.

&quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; features lyrics drawn from &quot;Lonely Planet Boy&quot; by the New York Dolls. According to Marr: &quot;When we first played it, I thought it was the best song I&#x27;d ever heard&quot;. The song&#x27;s guitar part drew on the Rolling Stones&#x27; cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;, whose original version by Gaye himself had acted as an inspiration for the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;There She Goes Again&quot;.

The music for &quot;Never Had No One Ever&quot;, completed in August 1985, was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984, itself based on &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; by the Stooges. According to Marr: &quot;The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it.&quot; The lyric to the song reflects Morrissey&#x27;s feeling unsafe and, being from an immigrant family, not at home on the streets of Manchester.

&quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot;, &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; and &quot;Frankly, Mr. Shankly&quot; were debuted live during a tour of Scotland in September and October 1985, during which &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; and &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; were sound-checked.

The song &quot;Vicar in a Tutu&quot; was considered &quot;throwaway&quot; by Marr, who stated &quot;It made a change from trying to change the fucking world.&quot; &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; was a late addition to the album. Marr had not believed that the guitar part was interesting enough to be developed into a song, but Morrissey disagreed when he heard Marr play it. The &quot;All those people ... I want to cry&quot; section is largely taken from the film &quot;The Man Who Came To Dinner&quot;, which also inspired one of Morrissey&#x27;s aliases, Sheridan Whitehead. The words the song&#x27;s narrator has heard &quot;said a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)&quot; are based on lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. The song evokes Morrissey&#x27;s memories of visiting Southern Cemetery in Manchester with artist Linder Sterling.

==Recording==
The album was produced by Morrissey and Marr, working predominantly with engineer Stephen Street, who had engineered the band&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;. Street recalled: &quot;Morrissey, Johnny and I had a really good working relationship – we were all roughly the same age and into the same kind of things, so everyone felt quite relaxed in the studio&quot;.

At the time the group was having difficulty with its record label Rough Trade. However, according to Street, &quot;this didn&#x27;t get in the way of recording because the atmosphere in the studio was very, very constructive.&quot;

The first song from the album to be recorded, in July 1985, was &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot;. The recording, made with engineer Stephen Street at a small studio in Manchester and initially intended as a demo, was considered by the band to be good enough for release as a single. It went on sale on 16 September 1985 and made number 23 in the UK Singles Chart.

In August 1985, &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; and &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others&quot; were recorded at RAK Studios in London, along with the B-sides to &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot;; &quot;Asleep&quot; and &quot;Rubber Ring&quot;. Kirsty MacColl sang a backing vocal for &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; but it was considered &quot;really weird&quot; by Marr, and was replaced with a sped-up vocal by Morrissey in the final mix, for which he is credited as Ann Coates on the sleeve of &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;. &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others&quot; includes a false fade near the start, intended by Street to give the impression of a door closing and opening again. During the same session, a first version of &quot;Never Had No One Ever&quot; was recorded.

The bulk of the album was recorded in the winter of 1985 at Jacob Studios in Farnham, under the working title &quot;Margaret on the Guillotine&quot;.

&quot;Frankly, Mr. Shankly&quot; was an attempt to recreate the &quot;vibe&quot; of Sandie Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, although &quot;it didn&#x27;t quite work out that way&quot;, according to Marr. Linda McCartney was asked to play piano on the track, but declined, and a first take featuring a trumpeter was scrapped. The version originally intended for inclusion on &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; was ruined by a technical glitch on the tape, and so the song was re-recorded with John Porter at Wessex Studios in London.

&quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; was among the last songs to be recorded. Its distinctive tom-tom loop was created by Mike Joyce and Stephen Street using a sampler. A line of guitar feedback was played by Marr through a wah-wah pedal throughout the song.

==Composition==
The song &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; was a contender for lead single from the album, but was passed over in favour of &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;. (Later in 1986 it was released as a 7&quot;-only single in France). The song received a belated release as a single in 1992 when WEA used it to promote Smiths re-releases and best-of compilations released in the years following the band’s breakup. In 1990 the song was voted no. 1 on a list of the greatest songs of all time by the readers of &quot;SPIN&quot; magazine in the USA.

&quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; was Morrissey&#x27;s direct response to critics who had cried foul over his use of texts written by some of his favourite authors, notably Shelagh Delaney and Elizabeth Smart. Oscar Wilde, who was also accused of plagiarism, figures as a patron saint of Morrissey&#x27;s in the song&#x27;s lyrics. A Wilde quote, &quot;Talent borrows, genius steals&quot;, was etched in the vinyl run-out grooves of the single single off the album, &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;. These etchings appear almost exclusively on the UK releases (denoted by the RT and RTT prefixes on the catalogue number).

&quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;, which leads off the album and notably became an expressionistic music video directed by Derek Jarman, starts with a sampled excerpt from Bryan Forbes&#x27; 1962 British film &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot;. Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola was an associate producer for the film and through working for Rough Trade Records persuaded Jarman to direct a promotional video for the Smiths. Another instance of Morrissey&#x27;s fascination with 1960s British cinema, the film featured performances by Pat Phoenix (who had already appeared as a cover star on the 1985 single &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sister&quot;) and Cicely Courtneidge as an elderly lesbian veteran of the music halls. The soundbite is Courtneidge&#x27;s character nostalgically singing the First World War song &quot;Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty&quot;. The actress had also appeared in a gala performance for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, entitled &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;; she died in 1980.

A few songs, including &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; and &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;, feature pitch-shifted backing vocals by Morrissey. Morrissey liked to experiment with effects on his voice, so Street ran his voice through a harmoniser for the backing tracks. Street recalled, &quot;At that time, apart from the harmoniser, he didn&#x27;t go for much backing vocal or harmony work – he&#x27;s done that more on recent albums – but he did like to experiment&quot;. The backing vocals are attributed to &quot;Ann Coates&quot; on the record sleeve (Ancoats is a district in Manchester, just north-east of the city centre).

==Release==

&quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; was released in 16 June 1986, and was previewed by the release of &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; as a single in 19 May. Many encouraged the band to release &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; as a single, but Johnny Marr is said to have wanted an explosive, searing single, along the lines of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;, to announce that the Smiths had returned from hiatus. It did not fare as well as expected, stalling at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the album became an international success upon release, staying in the European Albums Chart for twenty one weeks, peaking at number 19 in that chart based on the sales from 18 major European countries. It also reached No. 70 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990.

In June 2017, one year after the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the Smiths released the full version of &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; on vinyl with other Smiths songs: &quot;Oscillate Wildly,&quot; &quot;Money Changes Everything,&quot; and &quot;The Draize Train&quot; serving as B-sides. The band also released a 7&quot; single containing &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot; and &quot;I Keep Mine Hidden.&quot; Later that month, Morrissey accused HMV of trying to &quot;freeze sales&quot; on the new re-issues after the store limited the number of records sold to one per person. Later in 2017, the album was re-released on Warner Bros. Records including new studio takes of &quot;There&#x27;s a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; and &quot;Rubber Ring&quot; as well as a previously unheard live album recorded in 1986. In a press release for the re-issue Morrissey said of the album &quot;You progress only when you wonder if an abnormally scientific genius would approve – and this is the leap The Smiths took with &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;.&quot;

==Critical reception==
From contemporary reviews, Mark Coleman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked on Morrissey&#x27;s sense of humour and singled out the singer&#x27;s performance on &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; as a highlight, concluding that &quot;like it or not, this guy&#x27;s going to be around for a while.&quot; Writing in pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Tom Hibbert gave a favourable review, stating that &quot;the guitars are great, some of the words are marvellous, others like scratchings on a Fifth Form desk&quot;, as well as describing Morrissey as &quot;half genius half buffoon&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that despite his dislike of the Smiths&#x27; previous albums, he held an &quot;instant attraction&quot; to &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;, where he found that &quot;Morrissey wears his wit on his sleeve, dishing the queen like Johnny Rotten never did and kissing off a day-job boss who&#x27;s no Mr. Sellack&quot;, which &quot;makes it easier to go along on his moonier escapades&quot;. J. D. Considine found that the group &quot;epitomize all that is admirable and annoying about British new music&quot; finding the groups material &quot;is terrifically tuneful&quot; due to Marr&#x27;s &quot;incisive, visceral guitar work&quot;, but that Morrissey &quot;had a tendency to wander away from conventional notions of pitch often mangling the band&#x27;s melodies in the process&quot;. Considine concluded that Morrissey was &quot;mostly in control of his voice&quot; praising &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot;, &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; and declaring that &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; as &quot;the most affecting performance&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; as the sixth-best album of the 1980s. In 2000 it was voted number 10 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; was ranked number 216 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 218 in a 2012 revised list. In 2006, it was named the second-greatest British album of all time by the &quot;NME&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at number three in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. UK-based magazine &quot;Clash&quot; added &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; to its &quot;Classic Album Hall of Fame&quot; in its June 2011 issue, saying it &quot;is an album to lose yourself in; it has depth, focus and some great tunes. It&#x27;s easy to see why the album is held in such high esteem by Smiths fanatics and why, a decade later, it became a key influence for all things Britpop.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 16 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot; and said: &quot;There may never again be an indie-rock album as good as &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; was ranked the greatest record of all time on the &quot;NME&quot;″s Greatest Albums of All Time list. At &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Gavin Edwards retrospectively viewed the album as &quot;one of the funniest rock albums ever&quot;, noting that Morrissey had &quot;learned to express his self-loathing through mockery&quot; while Johnny Marr &quot;matched his verbal excess with witty, supple music&quot;, and concluded, &quot;If the queen&#x27;s reaction to Morrissey was &#x27;We are not amused,&#x27; then she was the only one.&quot;

<text>Robert Lewis Lilly (born July 26, 1939), nicknamed &quot;Mr. Cowboy&quot;, is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons. He played college football for the TCU Horned Frogs. Lilly was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981.

==Early life==
Born in Olney, Texas, Lilly grew up in Throckmorton, the son of John and Margaret (Redwine) Lilly. Lilly&#x27;s father and grandfather were both involved in farming and ranching, but the severe 1950s Texas drought forced his family to move at the end of his junior year at Throckmorton High School, where he received All-District honors in football. In basketball, he was named All-District and honorable-mention All-state.

In 1956, Lilly and his family relocated to northeastern Oregon to Pendleton—where his mother had family and jobs were available—for his senior year. At Pendleton High School, he was named All-state in football and second-team All-state in basketball for the Buckaroos.

==College career==
Lilly accepted an athletic scholarship from Texas Christian University, where he was nicknamed &quot;Tiger [Lilly]&quot; by his teammates. As a sophomore with the Horned Frogs, he was a part of the team that won the Southwest Conference (SWC) championship, where he was mainly a backup (one start).

He became a starter the next year, playing alongside All-SWC defensive tackle Don Floyd, while helping his team earn a tie for the SWC championship with the University of Texas and the University of Arkansas. He also received All-SWC honors on a defense that allowed only eight points per game.

Lilly was a consensus All-American as a senior in 1960 and was a 2006 inductee to the East-West Shrine Game Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981. He is a notable brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, Texas Gamma chapter.

==Professional career==
The Dallas Cowboys traded their first-round draft choice in the 1961 NFL draft, as part of the deal to get Eddie LeBaron from the Washington Redskins, so the Cowboys had to trade their first-round pick (#4-Gary Collins) in the 1962 NFL draft along with offensive tackle Paul Dickson, in exchange for the Cleveland Browns&#x27; first-round draft choice (13th overall) in 1961, to select Lilly, the first draft choice in franchise history.

Lilly began his career as a defensive end in 1961, but midway through 1963, his third season, Cowboys coach Tom Landry moved him to defensive tackle. Lilly made the adjustment, becoming the main man in Dallas&#x27; vaunted &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot;. As a tackle, Lilly was a first-team All-NFL choice every year from 1964 through 1969, then again in 1971. In 1970, the Cowboys finally made the Super Bowl, against the Baltimore Colts, only to lose the game (V), 16–13, on a field goal in the final nine seconds; after the game, he infamously tossed his helmet in the air, frustrated at the loss. In 1971, he and the Cowboys convincingly won Super Bowl VI over the Miami Dolphins, 24–3. His 29-yard sack of Dolphin quarterback Bob Griese (at the time an NFL record) is regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl defensive history. This was the most famous play of his 14-year hall-of-fame career.

Lilly was named an All-Pro seven times, and was selected to play in 11 Pro Bowl games. He was also drafted in the second round (14th overall) in the 1961 AFL Draft by the Dallas Texans (now Kansas City Chiefs). His greatest assets were his pass-rushing skills and his ability to slice plays open with his agility and instincts. Lilly had a distinct stance, the so-called four-point stance, placing both hands on the field instead of the more usual one, generating greater force when rushing straight ahead. Lilly&#x27;s agility and quickness helped him score four defensive touchdowns in his career. His first was returning an interception 56 yards in 1964, while the other three came on fumble recoveries.

What separated Lilly from other defensive tackles was his combination of agility, conditioning, and strength (although he did not start lifting weights until his sixth season in the NFL), that allowed him to make tackles from sideline to sideline. NFL Films did an eight-minute feature on Lilly and called him the &quot;unblockable, unstoppable, force of the Doomsday Defense&quot;. He was regularly double- and triple-teamed for the majority of his career due to his impact in the games. Although the head slap was legal when he played, he never liked to use it to gain an advantage over opponents. Lilly played in 196 consecutive regular-season games. The only NFL game he missed in his career was the 1973 NFC Championship Game loss (10–27) on December 30 against the Minnesota Vikings due to a leg injury. Lilly injured his hamstring in the Cowboys&#x27; victory (22–10) against the Denver Broncos on December 2. In the first play of the 1973 NFC Divisional playoff game three weeks later, on December 23 versus the Los Angeles Rams (Cowboys 27-Rams 16), he reinjured the same hamstring.

Affectionately known as &quot;Mr. Cowboy,&quot; his name was the first to be inscribed in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor, above Texas Stadium and the current AT&amp;T Stadium. The Cowboys had a Bob Lilly Day on November 23, 1975, to honor him and make Lilly the first inductee into the Ring of Honor. He has attended every ceremony for each Ring of Honor inductee since.

Lilly was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980, his first year of eligibility, and was the first player who spent his entire career with the Cowboys to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He entered the Hall of Fame along with former teammate Herb Adderley (for two seasons), as well as David &quot;Deacon&quot; Jones and Jim Otto. The &quot;Sporting News&quot; named him a member of the All-Century NFL Team and &quot;the greatest defensive tackle in NFL history&quot;. Lilly, Adderley, and Jones were all drafted in 1961. Tom Landry said of Lilly: &quot;As I&#x27;ve said before, another Lilly won&#x27;t come along in my time. We&#x27;re observing a man who will become a legend&quot;. This comment is from the 1972 &quot;Street and Smith&#x27;s Pro Football Yearbook&quot;. He also said that &quot;Nobody is better than Lilly&quot;. He is a member of the National Football League 1960s All-Decade Team and National Football League 1970s All-Decade Team.

In 1999, Lilly was ranked number 10 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking defensive lineman and the highest-ranking Cowboy. The only defensive players ranked ahead of Lilly were Dick Butkus and Lawrence Taylor. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named him one of the 10 most revolutionary defensive players.

Although the Cowboys do not have a practice to retire jersey numbers, Lilly is the only player to wear #74 in team history (with the exception of preseason games).

==Personal life==

When he began traveling with the Cowboys, Lilly regularly had his camera at his side. His interest in photography began when he was named to the College Football All-America Team in 1961, which was sponsored by Kodak. As a part of the honor, he was given a 35 mm camera and a year&#x27;s supply of film by the company. Before and after games, he spent an increasing amount of time studying and photographing old sports stadiums. Lilly co-authored the 1983 book &quot;Bob Lilly Reflections&quot; with sportswriter Sam Blair, featuring scores of his black-and-white photographs of teammates in candid poses. He was also a photographer for the Texas Air National Guard where he was an airman 2nd class. Lilly spent two weeks in 1967 as part of the Texas National Guard at the Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany.

After his retirement from professional football, Lilly moved to Waco, Texas, where he successfully operated a beer distribution business until 1982, when he saw the impact of a traffic accident caused by drunken driving and decided to sell the company and launch his landscape photography career. He lived in Las Cruces, New Mexico, from 1984 to 1989, where he opened a photo art gallery, complete with both color and black-and-white darkrooms. In 1989, he moved back to Texas, settling in Graham. As of 2016, the grandfather of 12 and great-grandfather of three lived with his wife, Ann, whom he married in 1974, in Georgetown, Texas.

<doc id="190041" wikidata="Q32090" url="?curid=190041" title="Lifestyle">
<text>Lifestyle is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture. The term &quot;style of life&quot; () was introduced by Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler in his 1929 book, &quot;The Case of Miss R.&quot;, with the meaning of &quot;a person&#x27;s basic character as established early in childhood&quot;. The broader sense of lifestyle as a &quot;way or style of living&quot; has been documented since 1961. Lifestyle is a combination of determining intangible or tangible factors. Tangible factors relate specifically to demographic variables, i.e. an individual&#x27;s demographic profile, whereas intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such as personal values, preferences, and outlooks.

A rural environment has different lifestyles compared to an urban metropolis. Location is important even within an urban scope. The nature of the neighborhood in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person due to differences between various neighborhoods&#x27; degrees of affluence and proximity to natural and cultural environments. For example, in areas near the sea, a surf culture or lifestyle can often be present.

==Individual identity==
A lifestyle typically reflects an individual&#x27;s attitudes, way of life, values, or world view. Therefore, a lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of self and to create cultural symbols that resonate with personal identity. Not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary. Surrounding social and technical systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the symbols they are able to project to others and themself.

The lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular lifestyle become blurred in modern society. For example, &quot;green lifestyle&quot; means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources and produce less harmful waste (i.e. a smaller ecological footprint), and deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these activities. Some commentators argue that, in modernity, the cornerstone of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior, which offers the possibility to create and further individualize the self with different products or services that signal different ways of life.

Lifestyle may include views on politics, religion, health, intimacy, and more. All of these aspects play a role in shaping someone&#x27;s lifestyle.

In the magazine and television industries, &quot;lifestyle&quot; is used to describe a category of publications or programs.

==History of lifestyles studies==

Three main phases can be identified in the history of lifestyles studies:

===Lifestyles and social position===
Earlier studies on lifestyles focus on the analysis of social structure and of the individuals&#x27; relative positions inside it. Thorstein Veblen, with his &#x27;emulation&#x27; concept, opens this perspective by asserting that people adopt specific &#x27;schemes of life&#x27;, and in particular specific patterns of &#x27;conspicuous consumption&#x27;, depending on a desire for distinction from social strata they identify as inferior and a desire for emulation of the ones identified as superior. Max Weber intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige: the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation, even within the same social class, and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire. Georg Simmel carries out formal analysis of lifestyles, at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation, identification, differentiation, and recognition, understood both as generating processes of, and effects generated by, lifestyles, operating &quot;vertically&quot; as well as &quot;horizontally&quot;. Finally, Pierre Bourdieu renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles, made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes, represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus.

===Lifestyles as styles of thought===
The approach interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought has its roots in the soil of psychological analysis. Initially, starting with Alfred Adler, a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality, in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives. Later, particularly in Milton Rokeach&#x27;s work, Arnold Mitchell&#x27;s VALS research and Lynn R. Kahle&#x27;s LOV research, lifestyles&#x27; analysis developed as profiles of values, reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically, to which different population sectors correspond. Then with Daniel Yankelovich and William Wells we move on to the so-called AIO approach in which attitudes, interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles&#x27; components, being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context (as, for instance, in Bernard Cathelat&#x27;s work). Finally, a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach, at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables, bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action.

===Lifestyles as styles of action===
Analysis of lifestyles as action profiles is characterized by the fact that it no longer considers the action level as a simple derivative of lifestyles, or at least as their collateral component, but rather as a constitutive element. In the beginning, this perspective focussed mainly on consumer behaviour, seeing products acquired as objects expressing on the material plane individuals&#x27; self-image and how they view their position in society. Subsequently, the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life, concentrating – as in authors such as Joffre Dumazedier and Anthony Giddens – on the use of time, especially loisirs, and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action. Finally, some authors, for instance Richard Jenkins and A. J. Veal, suggested an approach to lifestyles in which it is not everyday actions which make up the plane of analysis but those which the actors who adopt them consider particularly meaningful and distinctive.

==Health==

A healthy or unhealthy lifestyle will most likely be transmitted across generations. According to the study done by Case et al. (2002), when a 0-3-year-old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle, this child will be 27% more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle. For instance, high income parents are more likely to eat more fruit and vegetables, have time to exercise, and provide the best living condition to their children. On the other hand, low-income parents are more likely to participate in unhealthy activities such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression. Parents are the first teacher for every child. Everything that parents do will be very likely transferred to their children through the learning process.

Adults may be drawn together by mutual interest that results in a lifestyle. For example, William Dufty described how pursuing a sugar-free diet led to such associations:

==Class==
Lifestyle research can contribute to the question of the relevance of the class concept.

==Media culture==
The term lifestyle was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of style in art:

Theodor W. Adorno noted that there is a &quot;culture industry&quot; in which the mass media is involved, but that the term &quot;mass culture&quot; is inappropriate:
:

The media culture of advanced capitalism typically creates new &quot;life-styles&quot; to drive the consumption of new commodities:

<text>E-card is an electronic postcard or greeting card, with the primary difference being that it is created using digital media instead of paper or other traditional materials. E-cards are available in many different mediums, usually on various Internet sites. They can be sent to a recipient virtually, usually via e-mail or an instant messaging service.

Since e-cards are digital &quot;content&quot;, they are highly editable, allowing them to be extensively personalized by the sender. They are also capable of presenting animated GIFs or videos.

==Technological evolution==
Since its conception in 1994 by Judith Donath, the technology behind the E-card has changed significantly. One technical aspect that remained mostly constant until 2019 was the delivery mechanism: the e-mail received by the recipient contains not the E-card itself, but an individually coded link back to the publisher&#x27;s website that displays the sender&#x27;s card.

==History==
The greeting card metaphor was employed early in the life of the World Wide Web. The first postcard site, &quot;The Electric Postcard&quot; was created in late 1994 by Judith Donath at the MIT Media Lab. It started slowly: 10-20 cards a day were sent in the first weeks, 1000-2000 a day over the first summer, and then it gained momentum rapidly. During the 1995-96 Christmas season, there were days when over 19,000 cards were sent; by late spring of 1996 over 1.7 million cards had been sent in total. The source code for this service was made publicly available, with the stipulation that users share improvements with each other. &quot;The Electric Postcard&quot; won numerous awards, including a 1995 GNN Best of the Net award.

By mid-1996, a number of sites had developed E-cards. By mid-October 1996, directly emailable greeting cards and postcards (&quot;Email Express&quot;) were developed and introduced by Awesome Cards, based on new capabilities introduced in the Netscape 3.0 browser. This is the first time the E-card itself could be emailed directly by the card sender to the recipient rather than having an announcement sent with a link to the card&#x27;s location at the E-card site.

In 2001, Hallmark artists Bob Holt and Mike Adair developed early incarnations of Hoops and Yoyo, which became one of the first recurring e-card characters.

<doc id="190046" wikidata="Q157271" url="?curid=190046" title="Friedrich Schlegel">
<text>Karl Wilhelm Friedrich (after 1814: von) Schlegel ( ; ; 10 March 1772 – 12 January 1829) was a German poet, literary critic, philosopher, philologist, and Indologist. With his older brother, August Wilhelm Schlegel, he was one of the main figures of Jena Romanticism.

Born into a fervently Protestant family, Schlegel rejected religion as a young man in favor of atheism and individualism. He entered university to study law but instead focused on classical literature. He began a career as a writer and lecturer, and founded journals such as &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. In 1808, Schlegel returned to Christianity as a married man with both him and his wife being baptized into the Catholic Church. This conversion ultimately led to his estrangement from family and old friends. He moved to Austria in 1809, where he became a diplomat and journalist in service of Klemens von Metternich, the Foreign Minister of the Austrian Empire. Schlegel died in 1829, at the age of 56.

Schlegel was a promoter of the Romantic movement and inspired Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Adam Mickiewicz and Kazimierz Brodziński. The first to notice what became known as Grimm&#x27;s law, Schlegel was a pioneer in Indo-European studies, comparative linguistics, and morphological typology, publishing in 1819 the first theory linking the Indo-Iranian and German languages under the Aryan group. Some of his works were set to music by Schubert, Mendelssohn and Schumann.

==Life and work==
Karl Friedrich von Schlegel was born on 10 March 1772 at Hanover, where his father, Johann Adolf Schlegel, was the pastor at the Lutheran Market Church. For two years he studied law at Göttingen and Leipzig, and he met with Friedrich Schiller. In 1793 he devoted himself entirely to literary work. In 1796 he moved to Jena, where his brother August Wilhelm lived, and here he collaborated with Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Fichte, and Caroline Schelling, who married August Wilhelm. In 1797 he quarreled with Schiller, who did not like his polemic work.

Schlegel published &quot;Die Griechen und Römer&quot; (The Greeks and Romans), which was followed by &quot;Geschichte der Poesie der Griechen und Römer&quot; (History of the Poesy of the Greeks and Romans) (1798). Then he turned to Dante, Goethe, and Shakespeare. In Jena he and his brother founded the journal &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, contributing fragments, aphorisms, and essays in which the principles of the Romantic school are most definitely stated. They are now generally recognized as the deepest and most significant expressions of the subjective idealism of the early Romanticists.

After a controversy, Friedrich decided to move to Berlin. There he lived with Friedrich Schleiermacher and met Henriette Herz, Rahel Varnhagen, and his future wife, Dorothea Veit, a daughter of Moses Mendelssohn. In 1799 he published Part I of &quot;Lucinde, A Novel&quot;, which was seen as an account of his affair with Dorothea, causing a scandal in German literary circles. The novel, to which no further parts were ever added, attempted to apply the Romantic demand for complete individual freedom to practical ethics. &quot;Lucinde,&quot; which extolled the union of sensual and spiritual love as an allegory of the divine cosmic Eros, contributed to the failure of his academic career in Jena where he completed his studies in 1801 and lectured as a Privatdozent on transcendental philosophy. In September 1800, he met four times with Goethe, who would later stage his tragedy &quot;Alarcos&quot; (1802) in Weimar, albeit with a notable lack of success.

In June 1802 he arrived in Paris, where he lived in the house formerly owned by Baron d&#x27;Holbach and joined a circle including Heinrich Christoph Kolbe. He lectured on philosophy in private courses for Sulpiz Boisserée, and under the tutelage of Antoine-Léonard de Chézy and linguist Alexander Hamilton he continued to study Sanskrit and the Persian language. He edited the journal &quot;Europa&quot; (1803), where he published essays about Gothic architecture and the Old Masters. In April 1804 he married Dorothea Veit in the Swedish embassy in Paris, after she had undergone the requisite conversion from Judaism to Protestantism. In 1806 he and his wife went to visit Aubergenville, where his brother lived with Madame de Staël.

In 1808, he published &quot;Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier&quot; (On the Language and Wisdom of India). Here he advanced his ideas about religion and argued that a people originating from India were the founders of the first European civilizations. Schlegel compared Sanskrit with Latin, Greek, Persian, and German, noting many similarities in vocabulary and grammar. The assertion of the common features of these languages is now generally accepted, albeit with significant revisions. There is less agreement about the geographic region where these precursors settled, although the Out-of-India model has generally become discredited.

In 1808, he and his wife joined the Catholic Church in the Cologne Cathedral. From this time on, he became more and more opposed to the principles of political and religious liberalism. He went to Vienna and in 1809 was appointed imperial court secretary at the military headquarters, editing the army newspaper and issuing fiery proclamations against Napoleon. He accompanied archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen to war and was stationed in Pest during the War of the Fifth Coalition. Here he studied the Hungarian language. Meanwhile, he had published his collected &quot;Geschichte&quot; (Histories) (1809) and two series of lectures, &quot;Über die neuere Geschichte&quot; (On Recent History) (1811) and &quot;Geschichte der alten und neuen Literatur&quot; (On Old and New Literature) (1815). In 1814 he was knighted in the Supreme Order of Christ.

Following the Congress of Vienna (1815), he was councilor of legation in the Austrian embassy at the Frankfurt Diet, but in 1818 he returned to Vienna. In 1819 he and Clemens Brentano made a trip to Rome, in the company of Metternich and Gentz. There he met with his wife and her sons. In 1820 he started a conservative Catholic magazine, &quot;Concordia&quot; (1820–1823), but was criticized by Metternich and by his brother August Wilhelm, then professor of Indology in Bonn and busy publishing the Bhagavad Gita. Schlegel began the issue of his &quot;Sämtliche Werke&quot; (Collected Works). He also delivered lectures, which were republished in his &quot;Philosophie des Lebens&quot; (Philosophy of Life) (1828) and in his &quot;Philosophie der Geschichte&quot; (Philosophy of History) (1829). He died on 12 January 1829 at Dresden, while preparing a series of lectures.

==Dorothea Schlegel==
Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s wife, Dorothea von Schlegel, authored an unfinished romance, &quot;Florentin&quot; (1802), a &quot;Sammlung romantischer Dichtungen des Mittelalters&quot; (Collection of Romantic Poems of the Middle Ages) (2 volumes, 1804), a version of &quot;Lother und Maller&quot; (1805), and a translation of Madame de Staël&#x27;s &quot;Corinne&quot; (1807–1808) — all of which were issued under her husband&#x27;s name. By her first marriage she had two sons, Johannes and Philipp Veit, who became eminent Catholic painters. She was the eldest daughter of Moses Mendelssohn which made the prodigious composers Felix and Fanny her niece and nephew.

<text>USS &quot;Washington&quot; (BB-47), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 42nd state. Her keel was laid down on 30 June 1919, at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 1 September 1921, sponsored by Miss Jean Summers, the daughter of Congressman John W. Summers of Washington.

On 8 February 1922, two days after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armaments, all construction work ceased on the 75.9%-completed superdreadnought. She was sunk as a gunnery target on 26 November 1924, by the battleships and .

== Design ==


In 1916, design work was completed on the next class of battleships to be built for the United States Navy beginning in 1917. These ships were nearly direct copies of the preceding , with the exception of the main battery, which increased from twelve guns to eight guns. The &quot;Colorado&quot; class proved to be the last class of battleships completed of the standard type.

&quot;Washington&quot; was long overall and she had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric turbo-electric drives with steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The ship&#x27;s propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of . She had a normal cruising range of at , but additional fuel space could be used in wartime to increase her range to at that speed. Her crew numbered 64 officers and 1,241 enlisted men.

She was armed with a main battery of eight 16 in /45 caliber Mark 1 guns in four twin-gun turrets on the centerline, two forward and two aft in superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /51 caliber guns, mounted individually in casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. She carried an anti-aircraft battery of eight /50 caliber guns in individual high-angle mounts. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she had a torpedo tube mounted in her hull below the waterline on each broadside. &quot;Washington&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. Her conning tower had thick sides.

== History ==

With fiscal year 1917 appropriations, bids on the four &quot;Colorado&quot;s were opened on 18 October 1916; though &quot;Maryland&quot;″s keel was laid on 24 April 1917. The other three battleships, including &quot;Washington&quot;, were not laid down until 1919–1920. With the cancellation of the first , the &quot;Colorado&quot;s were the last U.S. battleships to enter service for nearly two decades. They were also the final U.S. battleships to use twin gun turrets—the and second es used nine 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns and the s used nine 16-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 guns in three triple turrets. &quot;Washington&quot; was laid down on 30 June 1919.

On 8 February 1922, two days after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty for the Limitation of all Naval Armaments, all construction work was stopped on the 75.9-percent-completed superdreadnought. By that time, she had her underwater armored protection in place.

The ship was towed out in November 1924, to be used as a gunnery target. On the first day of testing, the ship was hit by two torpedoes and three near-miss bombs causing minor damage and a list of three degrees. She then had 400 pounds of TNT detonated on board, but remained afloat. Two days later, the ship was hit by fourteen shells dropped from , but only one penetrated. The ship was finally sunk by &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; with fourteen more 14-inch shells. After the test, it was decided that the existing deck armor on battleships was inadequate, and that future battleships should be fitted with triple bottoms, which was underwater armor with three layers.

<text>Who Am I? (, also known as Jackie Chan&#x27;s Who Am I?) is a 1998 Hong Kong spy action comedy film directed by Benny Chan and Jackie Chan, who also starred in the leading role, and writer with Susan Chan and Lee Reynolds. The film was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 17 January 1998. It is also Chan&#x27;s second film to be scripted and shot in English, the first one being &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot;.

==Plot==
Somewhere in the jungles of South Africa on Thanksgiving 1996, a multinational military unit named &quot;Special Force Unit&quot; ambushes a convoy and kidnaps several scientists working on a highly-volatile compound extracted from a recently discovered meteorite. Among the operatives is a Hong Kong national identified as &quot;Jackie Chan&quot;. The CIA assigns Agent Morgan to investigate the incident, unaware that he and newly retired General Sherman orchestrated the abduction for their personal profit. At the same time, the CIA assigns another operative in South Africa for a more covert operation.

Jackie wakes up in a tribal village somewhere in the African veldt, still recovering from injuries sustained in an accident he cannot remember. When asked for his name by the natives, he does not remember who he is and repeatedly asks himself, &quot;Who Am I?&quot;. He is referred to as &quot;Who Am I?&quot; by the natives, as they think it is his name. The tribesmen show him the remains of a crashed helicopter and graves of those who perished aboard. &quot;Who Am I?&quot; spends weeks recuperating from his wounds and learning about the tribe&#x27;s culture. After spotting rally cars from several miles away, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; bids the village farewell and ventures on a journey back to civilization. He befriends Japanese rally co-driver Yuki after saving her brother from a snake bite and offering to help them finish the race. When they reach Johannesburg, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; meets Christine Stark, a journalist sent to interview him about his rally adventure.

Morgan hears of &quot;Who Am I?&quot; and sends a hitman team to kill him. Morgan also pretends to be his ally, telling him to contact him if he is in danger. After escaping from the hitmen, Christine cracks a secret code written on a matchbook found on one of the dead operatives, which leads them to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. &quot;Who Am I?&quot; and Christine bid Yuki farewell and head for Rotterdam to find more answers to his identity. In Rotterdam, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; discovers that Christine is actually an undercover CIA agent who tapped his calls. Not knowing whom to trust, he battles Sherman&#x27;s hitmen and sneaks into the &quot;Willemswerf&quot; skyscraper alone, where he discovers the masterminds behind the kidnapping of the scientists.

It is revealed that Morgan and General Sherman are about to sell the extraterrestrial compound to an influential arms dealer named Armano. While waiting for the online wire transfer to finish, the three men leave the conference room for a coffee break – giving &quot;Who Am I?&quot; time to sneak in and steal the disc containing the compound information. He also cancels the transaction and transfers the money to Save the Children instead, which infuriates Armano. Sherman and Armano send several men after &quot;Who Am I?&quot; to get the disc back. While in the process of escaping, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; defeats several hitmen and is found by Morgan. Once he discovers Morgan&#x27;s betrayal, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; tries to kill Morgan, but is interrupted by Morgan&#x27;s hitmen, who also try to take back the disc. &quot;Who Am I?&quot; fights them off and recovers the disk, but Morgan flees. &quot;Who Am I?&quot; regroups with Christine, who calls for the execution of a &quot;Plan B&quot;. Several CIA agents join the pursuit of Morgan, cornering him on the Erasmus Bridge in cooperation with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps. Christine takes Morgan into custody and asks &quot;Who Am I?&quot; if he has the disc. He throws the disc off the bridge and tells Christine that he will return to Africa.

==Production notes==

&quot;Who Am I?&quot; was shot on locations in Namibia, South Africa, and Netherlands between February and March 1997. The film features several landmarks such as Sun City in South Africa, Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, the Beurstraverse (which was portrayed by the film makers as being in Johannesburg), the Cube houses and the Willemswerf building (which served as the headquarters of the villains and from the side of which, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; escaped by sliding to the ground). Dutch city Dordrecht was also used as a location on the Voorstraat, de Vleeshouwersstraat as well as the fountains by Hans Petri in front of the former Refaja hospital.

The film also features an elaborate chase scene involving the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV GSR and a pack of chasing BMW 3 series (E36), in which Jackie, Yuki, and Christine (in the Evolution) attempt to escape from their captors. Several memorable stunts in the Evolution IV were featured, including a spin parking manoeuvre, market chase, and flipping the car onto its side and roof. In the making-of documentary, the team outlined the numerous Lancer Evolutions that were used for the entire sequence due to the harsh physical challenges presented by the stunts. The use of the Evolution IV was consistent with the then-ongoing presence and sponsorship of Mitsubishi in Jackie Chan&#x27;s films of that era.

==Box office==
In Hong Kong, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; grossed HK$38,852,845 during its theatrical run. In China, it grossed at the box office. In Taiwan, it sold 155,211 tickets and grossed . In South Korea, film sold 193,293 tickets in Seoul City and 579,879 tickets nationwide, grossing . In Europe, the film sold 157,427 tickets in Germany, and 73,101 tickets in other European countries.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

=== Awards and nominations ===
==Home media==
===United States===
The U.S. DVD release is cut by 9 minutes with the following changes and omissions:
* Unlike the original HK version of the film, the scene where Jackie Chan and his unit are double-crossed in the helicopter is shown immediately after the helicopters take off. This takes away the &quot;big reveal&quot; effect of what actually happened with Jackie and his men.
* &quot;Who Am I?&quot;&#x27;s interaction with the African tribe has been reduced dramatically. Cuts include a scene in which he asks the tribal boy, Baba, how many days it takes to walk to civilization; a scene where he and Baba run away from a lioness after he picks up a lion cub; a scene showing the tribe&#x27;s farewell ceremony for &quot;Who Am I?&quot;&#x27;s journey; and a scene in which he performs an interpretation of the tribal dance.
* The rally race scene has been shortened.
* A scene where &quot;Who Am I?&quot; recovers feeling in his mouth (as he chewed herbal leaves into an anesthetic to cure Yuki&#x27;s brother&#x27;s snake bite) and explains his situation to Yuki has been cut.
* All but two instant replay shots (where Yuki, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; and Christine drive through a fruit stand, and where &quot;Who Am I?&quot; narrowly misses falling furniture in Rotterdam) have been deleted.

Unlike other domestic releases of Jackie Chan&#x27;s films, this version of &quot;Who Am I?&quot; retains the film&#x27;s original musical score. Also, the U.S. release is the only cut which contains Jackie Chan&#x27;s original spoken English during his time with the African tribe. The uncut HK releases have dubbed it in Cantonese.

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Universe Laser DVD (now out of print) contains the film as it was originally intended. The &quot;double-cross&quot; scene is not shown until during the interrogation scene as a &quot;revelation flashback.&quot; It is meant to be a mystery as to what happened until the viewer sees these flashbacks. It also contains &quot;Who Am I?&quot;&#x27;s full interaction with the African tribe. However, his English dialogue during this interaction is dubbed into Cantonese during this part. There are English subtitles provided for the whole film. The presentation is not anamorphic, however.

===Japan===
Warner Bros. Japan has released two DVD editions of the film: the single-disc DVD contains the original Hong Kong cut of the film with an anamorphic presentation, but with no English subtitles, and it retains the Cantonese dub of Chan during the African tribe scenes. The two-disc anamorphic edition contains both versions of the film, with English subtitles for the U.S. cut.

<doc id="190054" wikidata="Q2088390" url="?curid=190054" title="Spelling">
<text>Spelling is a set of conventions for written language regarding how graphemes should correspond to the sounds of spoken language. Spelling is one of the elements of orthography, and highly standardized spelling is a prescriptive element.

Spellings originated as transcriptions of the sounds of speech according to the alphabetic principle. Fully phonemic orthography is usually only approximated, due to factors including changes in pronunciation over time, and the borrowing of vocabulary from other languages without adapting its spelling. Homophones may be spelled differently on purpose in order to disambiguate words that would otherwise have identical spellings.

==Standards and conventions==
Standardization of spelling is connected with the development of writing and the establishment of modern standard dialects. Languages with established orthography are those languages that enjoy an official status and a degree of institutional support in a country. Therefore, normative spelling is a relatively recent development linked to the compiling of dictionaries (in many languages, special spelling dictionaries, also called orthographic dictionaries, are compiled, showing prescribed spelling of words but not their meanings), the founding of national academies and other institutions of language maintenance, including widespread education and literacy, and often does not apply to minority and regional languages.

In countries or regions where there is an authoritative language academy, such as France, the Netherlands, and the German-speaking areas, reforms have occasionally been introduced (not always successfully) so that spelling better matches the changing pronunciation.

Examples are:
* German orthography reform of 1996 
* Portuguese spelling reform of 1990
* French &quot;rectifications orthographiques&quot; of 1990.

There have occasionally been English-language spelling reform proposals, at least since the 16th century, but they have made little impact apart from a few spellings preferred by Noah Webster having contributed to American and British English spelling differences.

==Methodology==
===Learning===
Learning proper spelling by rote is a traditional element of elementary education, and divergence from standard spelling is often perceived as an indicator of low intelligence, illiteracy, or lower class standing.

Spelling tests are commonly used to assess a student&#x27;s mastery of the words in the spelling lessons the student has received so far. They can also be an effective practice method. Spelling bees are competitions to determine the best speller of a group. Prominent spelling bees are sometimes even televised, such as the National Spelling Bee in the United States.

===Deliberate Alteration===

Divergent spelling is a popular advertising technique, used to attract attention or to render a trademark &quot;suggestive&quot; rather than &quot;merely descriptive&quot;, or to evade copyright restrictions. The pastry chains Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Krispy Kreme, for example, employ non-standard spellings.

===Misspellings===


While some words admit multiple spellings, some spellings are not considered standard. These are commonly called &quot;misspellings&quot;. A misspelled word can be a series of letters that represents no correctly spelled word of the same language at all (such as &quot;leik&quot; for &quot;like&quot;) or a correct spelling of another word (such as writing &quot;here&quot; when one means &quot;hear&quot;, or &quot;no&quot; when one means &quot;know&quot;). Misspellings of the latter type are called &quot;atomic typos&quot;, and they can easily make their way into printed material because they are not caught by simple computer spell checkers. Deliberate misspellings that emphasize the pronunciation of a regional dialect are part of eye dialect (such as writing &quot;&#x27;Murica&#x27;&quot; instead of &quot;America&quot;, or &quot;helluva&quot; instead of &quot;hell of a&quot;).

Misspellings may be due to accidental typing errors (e.g. the transposition error &quot;teh&quot; for &quot;the&quot;), lack of knowledge of the normative spelling, or lack of concern over spelling rules at all. Whether or not a word is misspelled may depend on context and the orthographic conventions adopted, as is the case with American/British English distinctions. Misspelling can also be a matter of opinion when variant spellings are accepted by some and not by others. For example, &quot;miniscule&quot; (for &quot;minuscule&quot;) is a misspelling to many, and yet it is listed as an acceptable variant in some dictionaries.

A well-known internet scam involves the registration of domain names that are deliberate misspellings of well-known corporate names to mislead or defraud. The practice is commonly known as &quot;typosquatting&quot;.

===Notable English misspellings in history===

* Arab, Alabama – This town in north Alabama was named Arad, after its founder, Arad Thompson, but the name was misspelled on a US Post Office map as &quot;Arab&quot;, and the misspelled name stuck.
* Google – accidental misspelling of googol. According to Google&#x27;s vice president, as quoted on a BBC &quot;The Money Programme&quot; documentary, January 2006, the founders – noted for their poor spelling – registered Google as a trademark and web address before someone pointed out that it was not correct.
* Grampian Mountains, Scotland: the name arose from a medieval manuscript copyist&#x27;s error in copying &quot;Mons Graupius&quot; in Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Agricola&quot;.
* Ovaltine, a popular bedtime drink in the UK and Australia, came about because someone misspelled the original name &quot;Ovomaltine&quot; on the trademark documentation.
* Referer – common misspelling of the word referrer. It is so common that it made it into the official specification of HTTP – the communication protocol of the World Wide Web – and has, therefore, become the standard industry spelling when discussing HTTP referers.
*Sequim, Washington – &quot;In 1879 the first post office was built and named &#x27;Seguin&#x27; for the surrounding area. [...] In 1907, due to a Postal Official&#x27;s error in reading an official report, the post office was titled &#x27;Seguim&#x27; for approximately a month. With the next report, the Official read the letter &#x27;g&#x27; as a &#x27;q&#x27;, and the post office here became known as &#x27;Sequim.&#x27; The name change did not worry the residents enough to protest. It has been known as Sequim ever since.&quot;
* According to some, the name of Quartzsite, a mining town in Arizona, was spelled wrongly. It should be Quartzite, after the mineral quartzite.
* Zenith – Arabic &quot;zamt&quot; was misread; in Latin letters, at the time, the letter &quot;i&quot; was never dotted, so &quot;m&quot; looked like &quot;ni&quot;.

===English===
English orthography has a broad degree of standardization. However, there are several ways to spell almost every sound, and most letters have several variants of pronunciation depending on their position in the word and context. Therefore, some spelling mistakes are common even among native speakers. This is mainly due to large number of words that were borrowed from other languages with no successful attempts of complete spelling reform. Most spelling rules usually do not reflect phonetic changes that have taken place since the end of the 15th century (for example, the Great Vowel Shift).

===Other languages===
Portuguese spelling is not strictly phonematic. It is associated with an extension of the Portuguese language and the emergence of numerous regional and dialect variants. In 2009 the global reform of the Portuguese language was initiated to eliminate 98% of inconsistencies in spelling between various countries. 
The orthography of the Icelandic language is based on the etymological principle, like English; thus the Icelanders themselves experience difficulties in writing. The modern Icelandic alphabet is based on the standard introduced by the Danish philologist Rasmus Rask.
The fundamental principles of the Spanish orthography are phonological and etymological, that is why there are several letters with identical phonemes. Beginning from the 17th century, various options for orthographic reforms were suggested that would create a one-to-one correspondence between grapheme and phoneme, but all of them were rejected. Most modern proposals to reform spelling are limited to the removal of homophone letters that are preserved for etymological reasons.

In many languages, types of misspelling arise from features of those languages which are not present in English: for example,

* In German, the rules for initial capitalisation, the use of ß, and the splitting of words at line breaks,
* In Japanese, the choice between kanji, hiragana and katakana, and the choice of katakana for the many words borrowed from English and other foreign languages,
* In Welsh (and other Celtic languages), errors in the application of the mutation system for initial consonants (&quot;camdreigladau&quot;).
