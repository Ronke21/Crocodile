<text>In the philosophy of mind, functionalism is the thesis that each and every mental state (for example, the state of having a belief, of having a desire, or of being in pain) is constituted solely by its functional role, which means its causal relation to other mental states, sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs. Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the identity theory of mind and behaviorism.

Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output. Therefore, it is different from its predecessors of Cartesian dualism (advocating independent mental and physical substances) and Skinnerian behaviorism and physicalism (declaring only physical substances) because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain, through its organization or its &quot;software programs&quot;.

Since a mental state is identified by a functional role, it is said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, it is able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions. While a computer&#x27;s program performs the functions via computations on inputs to give outputs, implemented via its electronic substrate, a brain performs the functions via its biological operation and stimulus responses.

==Multiple realizability==
An important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability. According to standard functionalist theories, a mental state corresponds to a functional role. It is like a valve; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other material, as long as it performs the proper function (controlling the flow of a liquid or gas). Similarly, functionalists argue, a mental state can be explained without considering the state of the underlying physical medium (such as the brain) that realizes it; one only needs to consider higher-level functions. Because a mental state is not limited to a particular medium, it can be realized in multiple ways, including, theoretically, with non-biological systems, such as computers. A silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has, provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles.

While most functionalist theories accept the multiple realizability of mental states, some functionalist theories, such as the Functional Specification Theories (FSTs), reject this view. FSTs were most notably developed by David Lewis and David Malet Armstrong. According to FSTs, mental states are the particular &quot;realizers&quot; of the functional role, not the functional role itself. The mental state of belief, for example, just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function. Thus, unlike standard versions of functionalism (often called &quot;Functional State Identity Theories&quot;), FSTs do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states, because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential. What often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans&#x27; (e.g., silicon-based) but performed the same functions as human mental states (for example, they tend to yell &quot;Ouch!&quot; when poked with sharp objects), we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is not the same. For some, this may be a disadvantage to FSTs. Indeed, one of Hilary Putnam&#x27;s arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do, and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind.

==Types==

===Machine-state functionalism===

The broad position of &quot;functionalism&quot; can be articulated in many different varieties. The first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by Hilary Putnam in the 1960s. This formulation, which is now called machine-state functionalism, or just machine functionalism, was inspired by the analogies which Putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical &quot;machines&quot; or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by Alan Turing (called Turing machines). Putnam himself, by the mid-1970s, had begun questioning this position. The beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his Twin Earth thought experiment.

In non-technical terms, a Turing machine is not a physical object, but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model. Typically, a Turing Machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right. The tape itself is infinite in length, and each cell may contain a symbol. The symbols used for any given &quot;machine&quot; can vary. The machine has a &quot;read-write head&quot; that scans cells and moves in left and right directions. The action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine&#x27;s programming. Because of the infinite tape, a traditional Turing Machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions. In the below example, each cell is either blank (&quot;B&quot;) or has a &quot;1&quot; written on it. These are the inputs to the machine. The possible outputs are:

*Halt: Do nothing.
*&quot;R&quot;: move one square to the right.
*&quot;L&quot;: move one square to the left.
*&quot;B&quot;: erase whatever is on the square.
*&quot;1&quot;: erase whatever is on the square and print a &#x27;1&quot;.

An extremely simple example of a Turing machine which
writes out the sequence &#x27;111&#x27; after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table:

This table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square (&quot;B&quot;), it will print a &quot;1&quot; and remain in state one. If it is in state one and reads a &quot;1&quot;, it will move one square to the right and also go into state two. If it is in state two and reads a &quot;B&quot;, it will print a &quot;1&quot; and stay in state two. If it is in state two and reads a &quot;1&quot;, it will move one square to the right and go into state three. If it is in state three and reads a &quot;B&quot;, it prints a &quot;1&quot; and remains in state three. Finally, if it is in state three and reads a &quot;1&quot;, then it will stay in state three.

The essential point to consider here is the &quot;nature of the states&quot; of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs. State one, for example, is simply the state in which the machine, if it reads a &quot;B&quot;, writes a &quot;1&quot; and stays in that state, and in which, if it reads a &quot;1&quot;, it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state. This is the functional definition of state one; it is its causal role in the overall system. The details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. 

The above point is critical to an understanding of machine-state functionalism. Since Turing machines are not required to be physical systems, &quot;anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a Turing machine&quot;. Because biological organisms “go through a succession of states in time”, any such organisms could also be equivalent to Turing machines. 

According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the Turing machine states described above. If one can show the rational functioning and computing skills of these machines to be comparable to the rational functioning and computing skills of human beings, it follows that Turing machine behavior closely resembles that of human beings. Therefore, it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state, it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible. To put it another way, any rational preference is due to the rules being followed, not to the specific material composition of the agent.

===Psycho-functionalism===
A second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of behaviorist theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind. This view is most closely associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn and has been labeled psycho-functionalism.

The fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories cannot be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions, and further, that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable. Psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly teleological or purposive explanations as the biological sciences. Thus, for example, the function or role of the heart is to pump blood, that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy. There may be an infinite variety of physical realizations for all of the mechanisms, but what is important is only their role in the overall biological theory. In an analogous manner, the role of mental states, such as belief and desire, is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best &quot;scientific&quot; psychological theory. If some mental state which is postulated by folk psychology (e.g. hysteria) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation, then that particular state may be considered not to exist.
On the other hand, if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language, then these entities or states exist.

===Analytic functionalism===
A third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general. This view is most closely associated with David Lewis and is often referred to as analytic functionalism or conceptual functionalism. The basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise. In the case of ordinary language terms, such as &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, or &quot;hunger&quot;, the idea is that such terms get their meanings from our common-sense &quot;folk psychological&quot; theories about them, but that such conceptualizations are not sufficient to withstand the rigor imposed by materialistic theories of reality and causality. Such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form:

:Mental state M is the state that is preconceived by P and causes Q.

For example, the state of &quot;pain&quot; is &quot;caused&quot; by sitting on a tack and &quot;causes&quot; loud cries, and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around. These sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be &quot;analytic&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot; truths about the submental states and the (largely fictitious) propositional attitudes they describe. Hence, its proponents are known as &quot;analytic&quot; or &quot;conceptual&quot; functionalists. The essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely contingent and &quot;a posteriori&quot; identities. The former, on the other hand, claims that such identities are necessary and not subject to empirical scientific investigation.

===Homuncular functionalism===
Homuncular functionalism was developed largely by Daniel Dennett and has been advocated by William Lycan. It arose in response to the challenges that Ned Block&#x27;s China Brain (a.k.a. Chinese nation) and John Searle&#x27;s Chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism (see below under &quot;Criticism&quot;). In attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of Chinese people wired together, each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind, many functionalists simply bit the bullet, so to speak, and argued that such a Chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind; i.e. it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics. Whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis, it was immediately objected that it entailed an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience: the &quot;systemic&quot; mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the Chinese nation, to stick to Block&#x27;s formulation. But this would seem to put into serious doubt, if not directly contradict, the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis: there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum. This can be easily seen if we label the set of mental facts that occur at the higher-level &quot;M1&quot; and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level &quot;M2&quot;. Then &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M2&quot; both supervene on the physical facts, but a change of &quot;M1&quot; to &quot;M2&quot; (say) could occur without any change in these facts.

Since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles, it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels (analogous to homunculi) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons. The homunculi at each level, on this view, have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one&#x27;s way down the hierarchy.

===Mechanistic functionalism===

Mechanistic functionalism, originally formulated and defended by Gualtiero Piccinini and Carl Gillett independently, augments previous functionalist accounts of mental states by maintaining that any psychological explanation must be rendered in mechanistic terms. That is, instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states, like those listed above, functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state.
A mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system, in this case a mental system, into its component physical parts, their activities or functions, and their combined organizational relations. On this account the mind remains a functional system, but one that is understood in mechanistic terms. This account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states, but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction. Functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms. If the functions are understood in teleological terms, then they may be characterized either etiologically or non-etiologically. 
Mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience. By providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data, mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works. This is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states (mental states) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms.

==Physicalism==
There is much confusion about the sort of relationship that is claimed to exist (or not exist) between the general thesis of functionalism and physicalism. It has often been claimed that functionalism somehow &quot;disproves&quot; or falsifies physicalism &quot;tout court&quot; (i.e. without further explanation or description). On the other hand, most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed, some of them, such as David Lewis, have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists.

Functionalism is fundamentally what Ned Block has called a broadly metaphysical thesis as opposed to a narrowly ontological one. That is, functionalism is not so much concerned with &quot;what there is&quot; than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state, e.g. pain, as the type of state that it is. Previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering &quot;both&quot; questions: dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states (as in &quot;pain = C-fiber firings&quot;).

On this understanding, type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism, since it claims that what characterizes mental states (e.g. pain) is that they are physical in nature, while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling &quot;ouch&quot;, etc. However, any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism. Moreover, most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties. Hence, they &quot;are&quot; physicalists, even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so.

In the case of David Lewis, there is a distinction in the concepts of &quot;having pain&quot; (a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds) and just &quot;pain&quot; (a non-rigid designator). Pain, for Lewis, stands for something like the definite description &quot;the state with the causal role x&quot;. The referent of the description in humans is a type of brain state to be determined by science. The referent among silicon-based life forms is something else. The referent of the description among angels is some immaterial, non-physical state. For Lewis, therefore, &quot;local&quot; type-physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism. (See also Lewis&#x27;s mad pain and Martian pain.) There seems to be some confusion between types and tokens that needs to be cleared up in the functionalist analysis.

==Criticism==
In a 2020 PhilPapers functionalism emerged as the most popular theory, with 33% of respondents accepting or leaning towards it, followed by dualism at 22%, and identity theory at 13%. Nevertheless, functionalism has counter-intuitive implications, often criticized using thought experiments.

=== China brain ===

Ned Block argues against the functionalist proposal of multiple realizability, where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important. The &quot;China brain&quot; or &quot;Chinese nation&quot; thought experiment involves supposing that the entire nation of China systematically organizes itself to operate just like a brain, with each individual acting as a neuron. (The tremendous difference in speed of operation of each unit is not addressed.). According to functionalism, so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles, with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs, the system will be a real mind, with mental states, consciousness, and so on. Ned Block contends that this scenario is implausible, suggesting that there must be a flaw in the functionalist thesis if it allows such a system to be considered a legitimate mind.

Some functionalists believe China would have qualia but that due to the size it is impossible to imagine China being conscious. Indeed, it may be the case that we are constrained by our theory of mind and will never be able to understand what Chinese-nation consciousness is like. Therefore, if functionalism is true, either qualia will be present in any system that performs the correct functions, regardless of its physical structure, or qualia do not exist at all and are merely illusions.

===The Chinese room===
The Chinese room argument by John Searle is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a person who only speaks English who is in a room with only Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. The person is then ordered by people outside of the room to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further suppose that the people outside of the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside knows Chinese simply based on these syntactic processes. This thought experiment attempts to show that systems which operate merely on syntactic processes (inputs and outputs, based on algorithms) cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness). Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules.

One common response to Searle&#x27;s thought experiment is that there is a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man, and that the whole system needs to be considered. This suggests that the system does understand Chinese, even though the man in the room doesn&#x27;t. The man is analogized to a CPU in a computer system. In response, Searle suggested the man in the room could memorize all the rules and symbol relations. Even if he internalized all the rules and performed the operations in his mind, he would still be manipulating symbols without understanding their meaning, according to Searle. Some critics consider that this symbol-manipulating subsystem of the brain can be viewed as a kind of separate, virtual mind, which would understand Chinese.

Functionalists also argue that it would possible in theory to make a system that emulates on digital hardware each neuron of the brain of someone who understands Chinese, and that such a brain emulation would have the same mental processes, and would thus understand Chinese.

===Inverted spectrum===
Another main criticism of functionalism is the inverted spectrum or inverted qualia scenario, most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by Ned Block. This thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person, call her Jane, that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived. Unlike normal people, Jane sees the color violet as yellow, orange as blue, and so forth. So, suppose, for example, that you and Jane are looking at the same orange. While you perceive the fruit as colored orange, Jane sees it as colored blue. However, when asked what color the piece of fruit is, both you and Jane will report &quot;orange&quot;. In fact, one can see that all of your behavioral as well as functional relations to colors will be the same. Jane will, for example, properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would, even though this involves the color perception. Therefore, the argument goes, since there can be two people who are functionally identical, yet have different mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects), functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia.

According to David Chalmers, all &quot;functionally isomorphic&quot; systems (those with the same &quot;fine-grained functional organization&quot;, i.e., the same information processing) will have qualitatively identical conscious experiences. He calls this the principle of &quot;organizational invariance&quot;. For example, it implies that a silicon chip that is functionally isomorphic to a brain will have the same perception of the color red, given the same sensory inputs. He proposed the thought experiment of the &quot;dancing qualia&quot; to demonstrate it. It is a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; argument that starts by supposing that two such systems have different qualia in the same situation. It involves a switch that alternates between a chunk of brain that causes the perception of red, and a functionally isomorphic system that causes the perception of blue, for example implemented as a silicon chip. Since both perform the same function within the brain, the subject would not notice any change during the switch. Chalmers argues that this would be highly implausible if the qualia were truly switching between red and blue, hence the contradiction. Therefore, he concludes that the dancing qualia is impossible in practice, and the equivalent digital system would not only experience qualia, but it would have conscious experiences that are qualitatively identical to those of the biological system (e.g., seeing the same color). He also proposed a similar thought experiment, named the fading qualia, that argues that it is not possible for the qualia to fade when each biological neuron is replaced by a functional equivalent.

A related critique of the inverted spectrum argument is that it assumes that mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects) can be independent of the functional relations in the brain. Thus, it begs the question of functional mental states: its assumption denies the possibility of functionalism itself, without offering any independent justification for doing so (functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain). This same type of problem—that there is no argument, just an antithetical assumption at their base—can also be said of both the Chinese room and the Chinese nation arguments.

=== Twin Earth ===

The Twin Earth thought experiment, introduced by Hilary Putnam, is responsible for one of the main arguments used against functionalism, although it was originally intended as an argument against semantic internalism. The thought experiment is simple and runs as follows. Imagine a Twin Earth which is identical to Earth in every way but one: water does not have the chemical structure H2O, but rather some other structure, say XYZ. It is critical, however, to note that XYZ on Twin Earth is still called &quot;water&quot; and exhibits all the same macro-level properties that H2O exhibits on Earth (i.e., XYZ is also a clear drinkable liquid that is in lakes, rivers, and so on). Since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water, you and your Twin Earth doppelgänger see exactly the same things, meet exactly the same people, have exactly the same jobs, behave exactly the same way, and so on. In other words, since you share the same inputs, outputs, and relations between other mental states, you are functional duplicates. So, for example, you both believe that water is wet. However, the content of your mental state of believing that water is wet differs from your duplicate&#x27;s because your belief is of H2O, while your duplicate&#x27;s is of XYZ. Therefore, so the argument goes, since two people can be functionally identical, yet have different mental states, functionalism cannot sufficiently account for all mental states.

Most defenders of functionalism initially responded to this argument by attempting to maintain a sharp distinction between internal and external content. The internal contents of propositional attitudes, for example, would consist exclusively in those aspects of them which have no relation with the external world &quot;and&quot; which bear the necessary functional/causal properties that allow for relations with other internal mental states. Since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents, however, this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist &quot;causal theories of mental contents&quot; (also known as informational semantics). Such a position is represented, for example, by Jerry Fodor&#x27;s account of an &quot;asymmetric causal theory&quot; of mental content. This view simply entails the modification of functionalism to include within its scope a very broad interpretation of inputs and outputs to include the objects that are the causes of mental representations in the external world.

The twin earth argument hinges on the assumption that experience with an imitation water would cause a different mental state than experience with natural water. However, since no one would notice the difference between the two waters, this assumption is likely false. Further, this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism; and, thereby, the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument: as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself (which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states, because the functional relationships would remain unchanged).

===Meaning holism===
Another common criticism of functionalism is that it implies a radical form of semantic holism. Block and Fodor referred to this as the &quot;damn/darn problem&quot;. The difference between saying &quot;damn&quot; or &quot;darn&quot; when one smashes one&#x27;s finger with a hammer can be mentally significant. But since these outputs are, according to functionalism, related to many (if not all) internal mental states, two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little (perhaps nothing) in common in any of their mental states. But this is counterintuitive; it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer, whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain.

Another possible solution to this problem is to adopt a moderate (or molecularist) form of holism. But even if this succeeds in the case of pain, in the case of beliefs and meaning, it faces the difficulty of formulating a distinction between relevant and non-relevant contents (which can be difficult to do without invoking an analytic–synthetic distinction, as many seek to avoid).

===Triviality arguments===

According to Ned Block, if functionalism is to avoid the chauvinism of type-physicalism, it becomes overly liberal in &quot;ascribing mental properties to things that do not in fact have them&quot;. As an example, he proposes that the economy of Bolivia might be organized such that the economic states, inputs, and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables.

Hilary Putnam, John Searle, and others have offered further arguments that functionalism is trivial, i.e. that the internal structures functionalism tries to discuss turn out to be present everywhere, so that either functionalism turns out to reduce to behaviorism, or to complete triviality and therefore a form of panpsychism. These arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states, and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system. Given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique, such a mapping will always exist, so any system is a mind. Formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects (external to the functional account, meaning not defined functionally) are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality, because the input-output behavior is still required.

Peter Godfrey-Smith has argued further that such formulations can still be reduced to triviality if they accept a somewhat innocent-seeming additional assumption. The assumption is that adding a &quot;transducer layer&quot;, that is, an input-output system, to an object should not change whether that object has mental states. The transducer layer is restricted to producing behavior according to a simple mapping, such as a lookup table, from inputs to actions on the system, and from the state of the system to outputs. However, since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input, such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired.

Godfrey-Smith believes that these problems can be addressed using causality, but that it may be necessary to posit a continuum between objects being minds and not being minds rather than an absolute distinction. Furthermore, constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism, or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory; and though multiple realizability does not seem to be lost, the functionalist claim of the autonomy of high-level functional description becomes questionable.

<text>USS &quot;Ohio&quot; (BB-12), a pre-dreadnought battleship, was the third ship of her class and the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the 17th state. She was laid down at the Union Iron Works shipyard in San Francisco in April 1899, was launched in May 1901, and was commissioned into the fleet in October 1904. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and could steam at a top speed of .

&quot;Ohio&quot; initially served in the Asiatic Fleet, from 1905 to 1907, when she returned to the United States. In December that year, she joined the Great White Fleet for its world cruise, which lasted until early 1909. She served with the Atlantic Fleet for the next four years conducting a peacetime training routine. In 1914, she was sent to Mexico to protect American interests in the country during the Mexican Revolution. She served as a training ship during America&#x27;s involvement in World War I from 1917 to 1918. Thoroughly obsolete by that time, &quot;Ohio&quot; was decommissioned in July 1919, and was ultimately sold for scrap in March 1923 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Description==
The United States Congress passed a major naval construction program in response to the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898; the program included three new battleships, which were to become the &quot;Maine&quot; class. The class incorporated several significant technological developments, including smaller caliber main guns that used smokeless powder to achieve greater muzzle velocity (and thus penetrating power), Krupp cemented armor that was stronger than Harvey armor used on earlier vessels, and water-tube boilers that provided more power for the engines.

&quot;Ohio&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired Thornycroft boilers, which were vented into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 561 officers and enlisted men, which increased to 779–813.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /40 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /50 caliber Mark 6 guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried six /50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull, eight 3-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Ohio&quot; carried two  torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Ohio&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides. Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Ohio&quot;, the final member of the &quot;Maine&quot; class of pre-dreadnought battleships, was the second ship of the three to be laid down. She was built at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, with her keel being laid on 22 April 1899. She was launched on 18 May 1901 and was commissioned on 4 October 1904. After she entered service, &quot;Ohio&quot; was assigned as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. She left San Francisco on 1 April, bound for Manila in the Philippines. After the new battleship arrived, the party of then-Secretary of War William Howard Taft came aboard for a tour of East Asia, including stops in Japan and China. &quot;Ohio&quot; returned to the United States in 1907 and was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. She and the rest of the Atlantic Fleet battleships held a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Hampton Roads, Virginia to mark the start of the cruise of the Great White Fleet on 16 December 1907. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

The following day, the fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads and cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for Roosevelt.
Following the conclusion of the ceremonies, &quot;Ohio&quot; proceeded to New York, where she was based for the following four years. This time was spent conducting normal peacetime training with the fleet and assisting in the training of the New York Naval Militia. By 1914, the worsening conditions during the Mexican Civil War prompted the United States to begin intervening in the conflict. &quot;Ohio&quot; was sent to Mexican waters early that year to protect American interests in the country. In mid-1914, she returned to the east coast of the United States to conduct a training cruise for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. After completing the cruise, &quot;Ohio&quot; was transferred to the Reserve Fleet based at Philadelphia. She returned to service only to conduct additional midshipmen cruises in the summers of 1915 and 1916.

The United States had initially remained neutral during World War I, but by early 1917, tensions between it and Germany rose as the latter&#x27;s unrestricted submarine warfare campaign began to sink American merchants ships. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, and on the 24th, &quot;Ohio&quot; was recommissioned. She was based in Norfolk and tasked with training crews for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. This service included gunnery training; on 1 June 1918, she was involved in a significant accident during gunnery practice with two other battleships, and . Gunners aboard &quot;New Hampshire&quot; accidentally began firing at a pair of submarine chasers. &quot;Ohio&quot; issued a &quot;cease fire&quot; warning, though it was not immediately received aboard &quot;New Hampshire&quot; before one shell struck &quot;Louisiana&quot;. While the ships stopped to assess the damage, lookouts aboard &quot;Ohio&quot; reported an enemy submarine, prompting several salvos from the secondary batteries of &quot;Ohio&quot; and &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, though the submarine chasers found no evidence of a submarine upon investigating the scene.

Following the German surrender in November 1918, most of the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet were used as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. &quot;Ohio&quot; and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to their short range and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations. Instead, she was sent to Philadelphia on 28 November and remained inactive there until 7 January 1919, when she was placed back in reserve. On 17 July, the ship was reclassified as BB-12. The old battleship (by then renamed as &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot;) was converted into a radio-controlled target ship, and &quot;Ohio&quot; was employed as her first control vessel. &quot;Ohio&quot; controlled the vessel remotely on a voyage from Philadelphia to Hampton Roads for initial tests in August 1920. The two vessels conducted experiments there until 10 September.

In June 1921, the Navy and Army conducted a series of bombing tests off the Virginia Capes to evaluate the effectiveness of aircraft against warships. &quot;Ohio&quot; was again used to control &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; during the experiments, steaming astern of the target ship along with several other vessels to simulate a fleet underway. The ability of the ship to maneuver significantly hindered the aircrews&#x27; ability to locate and attack the vessel. Following the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated significant reductions in naval armaments, &quot;Ohio&quot; was stricken from the naval register on 31 May 1922 and sold for scrap on 24 March 1923.

<doc id="192362" wikidata="Q2146981" url="?curid=192362" title="Nuremberg principles">
<text>The Nuremberg principles are a set of guidelines for determining what constitutes a war crime. The document was created by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to codify the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi party members following World War II.

== The principles ==
=== Principle I ===
=== Principle II ===
=== Principle III ===
=== Principle IV ===

This principle could be paraphrased as follows: &quot;It is not an acceptable excuse to say &#x27;I was just following my superior&#x27;s orders&#x27;&quot;.

Previous to the time of the Nuremberg Trials, this excuse was known in common parlance as &quot;superior orders&quot;. After the prominent, high-profile event of the Nuremberg Trials, that excuse is now referred to by many as the &quot;Nuremberg Defense&quot;. In recent times, a third term, &quot;lawful orders&quot; has become common parlance for some people. All three terms are in use today, and they all have slightly different nuances of meaning, depending on the context in which they are used.

Nuremberg Principle IV is legally supported by the jurisprudence found in certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which deal indirectly with conscientious objection. It is also supported by the principles found in paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status which was issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Those principles deal with the conditions under which conscientious objectors can apply for refugee status in another country if they face persecution in their own country for refusing to participate in an illegal war.

=== Principle V ===
=== Principle VI ===

=== Principle VII ===
==The principles&#x27; power or lack of power==

In the period just prior to the June 26, 1945 signing of the Charter of the United Nations, the governments participating in its drafting were opposed to conferring on the United Nations legislative power to enact binding rules of international law. As a corollary, they also rejected proposals to confer on the General Assembly the power to impose certain general conventions on states by some form of majority vote. There was, however, strong support for conferring on the General Assembly the more limited powers of study and recommendation, which led to the adoption of Article 13 in Chapter IV of the Charter. It obliges the United Nations General Assembly to initiate studies and to make recommendations that encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification. The Nuremberg Principles were developed by UN organs under that limited mandate.

Unlike treaty law, customary international law is not written. To prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the international community that such practice is required as a matter of law. (For example, the Nuremberg Trials were a &quot;practice&quot; of the &quot;international law&quot; of the Nuremberg Principles; and that &quot;practice&quot; was supported by the international community.) In this context, &quot;practice&quot; relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible. If this contrary practice is condemned by other states then the rule is confirmed. (See also: Sources of international law)

In 1947, under UN General Assembly Resolution 177 (II), paragraph (a), the International Law Commission was directed to &quot;formulate the principles of international law recognized in the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and in the judgment of the Tribunal.&quot; In the course of the consideration of this subject, the question arose as to whether or not the commission should ascertain to what extent the principles contained in the Charter and judgment constituted principles of international law. The conclusion was that since the Nuremberg Principles had been affirmed by the General Assembly, the task entrusted to the commission was not to express any appreciation of these principles as principles of international law but merely to formulate them. The text above was adopted by the Commission at its second session. The Report of the commission also contains commentaries on the principles (see Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, Vol. II, pp. 374–378).

==Examples of the principles supported and not supported==

=== The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ===

Concerning Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual&#x27;s responsibility, it could be argued that a version of the Superior Orders defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.) Article 33, titled &quot;Superior Orders and prescription of law,&quot;
states:

2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.

There are two interpretations of this Article:

*This formulation, especially (1)(a), whilst effectively prohibiting the use of the Nuremberg Defense in relation to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, does however, appear to allow the Nuremberg Defense to be used as a protection against charges of war crimes, provided the relevant criteria are met.
*Nevertheless, this interpretation of ICC Article 33 is open to debate: For example, Article 33 (1)(c) protects the defendant only if &quot;the order was not manifestly unlawful.&quot; The &quot;order&quot; could be considered &quot;unlawful&quot; if we consider Nuremberg Principle IV to be the applicable &quot;law&quot; in this case. If so, then the defendant is not protected. Discussion as to whether or not Nuremberg Principle IV is the applicable law in this case is found in a discussion of the Nuremberg Principles&#x27; power or lack of power.

===Canada===
Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual&#x27;s responsibility, was also at issue in Canada in the case of &quot;Hinzman v. Canada.&quot; Jeremy Hinzman was a U.S. Army deserter who claimed refugee status in Canada as a conscientious objector, one of many Iraq War resisters. Hinzman&#x27;s lawyer, Jeffry House, had previously raised the issue of the legality of the Iraq War as having a bearing on their case. The Federal Court ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim. In the decision, Justice Anne L. Mactavish addressed the issue of personal responsibility:

An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her personal war-time conduct is otherwise proper.
On Nov 15, 2007, a quorum of the Supreme Court of Canada consisting of Justices Michel Bastarache, Rosalie Abella, and Louise Charron refused an application to have the Court hear the case on appeal, without giving reasons.

<doc id="192368" wikidata="Q181055" url="?curid=192368" title="Hot dog">
<text>A hot dog is a dish consisting of a grilled, steamed, or boiled sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. The term &quot;hot dog&quot; can refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter Würstchen, also just called frank). The names of these sausages commonly refer to their assembled dish. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide. Common condiments include mustard, ketchup, relish, onions in tomato sauce, and cheese sauce. Other toppings include sauerkraut, diced onions, jalapeños, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog&#x27;s cultural traditions include the Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

These types of sausages were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States. It became a working-class street food in the U.S., sold at stands and carts. The hot dog has become closely associated with baseball and American culture. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century. Its preparation varies regionally in the country, emerging as an important part of other regional cuisines, including Chicago street cuisine.

== History ==
The word &quot;frankfurter&quot; comes from Frankfurt, Germany, where pork sausages similar to hot dogs originated. These sausages, &quot;Frankfurter Würstchen&quot;, were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, as King. &quot;Wiener&quot; refers to Vienna, Austria (), home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef. Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the Franconian city of Coburg, is said to have brought the &quot;Frankfurter Würstchen&quot; to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it &quot;Frankfurter&quot;. Nowadays, in German-speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called &quot;Wiener&quot; or &quot;Wiener Würstchen&quot; (&quot;Würstchen&quot; means &quot;little sausage&quot;), to differentiate them from the original pork-only mixture from Frankfurt. In Swiss German, it is called &quot;Wienerli&quot;, while in Austria the terms &quot;Frankfurter&quot; or &quot;Frankfurter Würstel&quot; are used.

 It is not definitively known who started the practice of serving the sausage in the bun. One of the strongest claims comes from Harry M. Stevens who was a food concessionaire. The claim is that, while working at the New York Polo Grounds in 1901, he came upon the idea of using small French rolls to hold the sausages when the waxed paper they were using ran out.

A German immigrant named Feuchtwanger, from Frankfurt, in Hesse, allegedly pioneered the practice in the American Midwest; there are several versions of the story with varying details. According to one account, Feuchtwanger&#x27;s wife proposed the use of a bun in 1880: Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, and provided gloves to his customers so that they could handle the sausages without burning their hands. Losing money when customers did not return the gloves, Feuchtwanger&#x27;s wife suggested serving the sausages in a roll instead. In another version, Antoine Feuchtwanger, or Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger, served sausages in rolls at the World&#x27;s Fair – either at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, or, earlier, at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, in Chicago – again, allegedly because the white gloves provided to customers to protect their hands were being kept as souvenirs.

Another possible origin for serving the sausages in rolls is the pieman Charles Feltman, at Coney Island in New York City. In 1867 he had a cart made with a stove on which to boil sausages, and a compartment to keep buns in which they were served fresh. In 1871 he leased land to build a permanent restaurant, and the business grew, selling far more than just the &quot;Coney Island Red Hots&quot; as they were known.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;dog&quot; has been used as a synonym for sausage since the 1800s, possibly from accusations that sausage makers used dog meat in their sausages.

In Germany the consumption of dog meat was common in Saxony, Silesia, Anhalt, and Bavaria during the 19th and 20th centuries. Hot dogs occasionally contained it.

An early use of the term &quot;hot dog&quot; in reference to the sausage-meat appears in the &quot;Evansville&quot; (Indiana) &quot;Daily Courier&quot; (September 14, 1884):

even the innocent &#x27;wienerworst&#x27; man will be barred from dispensing hot dog on the street corner.

It was used to mean a sausage in casing in the &quot;Paterson&quot; (New Jersey) &quot;Daily Press&quot; (31 December 1892):

the &#x27;hot dog&#x27; was quickly inserted in a gash in a roll.

Subsequent uses include the &quot;New Brunswick Daily Times&quot; (New Jersey; May 20, 1893), the &quot;New York World&quot; (May 26, 1893), and the &quot;Knoxville Journal&quot; (September 28, 1893).

According to one story, the use of the complete phrase &quot;hot dog&quot; (in reference to sausage) was coined by the newspaper cartoonist Thomas Aloysius &quot;Tad&quot; Dorgan around 1900 in a cartoon recording the sale of hot dogs during a New York Giants baseball game at the Polo Grounds. He may have used the term because he did not know how to spell &quot;dachshund&quot;. No copy of the apocryphal cartoon has ever been found. Dorgan did use the term at other times; the earliest known example was in connection with a bicycle race at Madison Square Garden, appearing in &quot;The New York Evening Journal&quot; of December 12, 1906.

== General description ==


=== Ingredients ===
Common hot dog sausage ingredients include:
*Meat trimmings and fat
*Flavorings, such as salt, garlic, and paprika
*Preservatives (cure) – typically sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite

Pork and beef are the traditional meats used in hot dogs. Less expensive hot dogs are often made from chicken or turkey, using low-cost mechanically separated poultry. Changes in meat technology and dietary preferences have led manufacturers to lower the salt content and use turkey, chicken, and vegetarian meat substitutes.

=== Commercial preparation ===

Hot dogs are prepared commercially by mixing the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers) in vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation. This mixture is forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are &quot;skinless&quot; rather than &quot;natural casing&quot; sausages.

==== Natural casing ====
As with most sausages, hot dogs must be in a casing to be cooked. Traditional casing is made from the small intestines of sheep. The products are known as &quot;natural casing&quot; hot dogs or frankfurters. These hot dogs have firmer texture and a &quot;snap&quot; that releases juices and flavor when the product is bitten.

Kosher casings are expensive in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually skinless or made with reconstituted collagen casings.

==== Skinless ====
&quot;Skinless&quot; hot dogs use a casing for cooking, but the casing may be a long tube of thin cellulose that is removed between cooking and packaging, a process invented in Chicago in 1925 by Erwin O. Freund, founder of Visking.

The first skinless hot dog casings were produced by Freund&#x27;s new company under the name &quot;Nojax&quot;, short for &quot;no jackets&quot; and sold to local Chicago sausage makers.

Skinless hot dogs vary in surface texture, but have a softer &quot;bite&quot; than with natural casing. Skinless hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size and cheaper to make than natural casing hot dogs.

=== Home consumption ===
A hot dog may be prepared and served in various ways. Typically it is served in a hot dog bun with various condiments and toppings. The sausage itself may be sliced and added, without bread, to other dishes.

===Sandwich debate===
There is an ongoing debate about whether a hot dog, fully assembled in its bun with condiments, fits the description of a sandwich. In 2015, the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council (NHDSC) declared that a hot dog is not a sandwich. Hot dog eating champions Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi agree with the NHDSC, as does the host of the contest. Merriam-Webster, on the other hand, has stated that a hot dog is indeed a sandwich.

United States Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also weighed in on the matter, stating that a hot dog &quot;might&quot; be categorized as a sandwich, but ultimately it comes down to the definition of a sandwich. She went on to acknowledge that a hot dog bun is a single roll that is not sliced all the way through, and in that way is similar to a submarine sandwich.

In June 2022, Jon Batiste stated that hot dogs were his favourite kind of sandwiches when he was given the Colbert Questionert by Stephen Colbert.

==Health risks==

Although hot dogs are cooked during manufacture, it is still recommended that packaged hot dogs are heated to an internal temperature of at least 165 °F (75 °C) prior to consumption.

Most hot dogs are high in fat and salt and have preservatives sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate, which are contributors to nitrate-containing chemicals classified as group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization, although this has been disputed. These health concerns have resulted in manufacturers offering alternative product lines made from turkey and chicken, and uncured, low-sodium, and &quot;all-natural&quot; franks.
Hot dogs have relatively low carcinogenic heterocyclic amine (HCA) levels compared to other types of ready-to-eat meat products because they are manufactured at low temperatures.

An American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) report found that consuming one daily 50-gram serving of processed meat—about one hot dog—increases long-term risk of colorectal cancer by 20 percent. Thus, eating a hot dog every day would increase the probability of contracting colorectal cancer from 5.8 percent to 7 percent. The AICR&#x27;s warning campaign has been criticized as being &quot;attack ads&quot;. The Cancer Project group filed a class-action lawsuit demanding warning labels on packages and at sporting events.

Like many foods, hot dogs can cause illness if not cooked properly to kill pathogens. &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, a type of bacteria sometimes found in hot dogs, can cause serious infections in infants and pregnant women, and can be transmitted to an infant &quot;in utero&quot; or after birth. Adults with suppressed immune systems can also be harmed.

Due to their size, shape, and ubiquitous consumption, hot dogs present a significant choking risk, especially for children. A study in the US found that 17% of food-related asphyxiations among children younger than 10 years of age were caused by hot dogs. The risk of choking on a hot dog is greatly reduced by slicing it. It has been suggested that redesign of the size, shape and texture of hot dogs would reduce the choking risk.

==In the United States==
Hot dogs are a traditional element of American food culture, having obtained significant cultural and patriotic status from their association with public events and sports since the 1920s. In the US, the term &quot;hot dog&quot; refers to both the sausage by itself and the combination of sausage and bun. Many nicknames applying to either have emerged over the years, including frankfurter, frank, wiener, weenie, coney, and red hot. Annually, Americans consume 20 billion hot dogs.

===Restaurants===
Stands and trucks sell boiled hot dogs at street and highway locations. Wandering hot dog vendors sell their product in baseball parks. At convenience stores, hot dogs are kept heated on rotating grills. Hot dogs are also common on restaurants&#x27; children&#x27;s menus. Costco, a big-box retail chain, sells a yearly average of 135 million hot dogs at its food courts, at a notably low price. Fast-food restaurant chains typically do not carry hot dogs because of its shorter shelf-life, more complex toppings and cooking, and mismatched consumer expectations. There are also restaurants where hot dogs are a specialty.

===Condiments===
Hot dogs are commonly served with one or more condiments. In 2005, the US-based National Hot Dog &amp; Sausage Council (part of the American Meat Institute) found mustard to be the most popular, preferred by 32% of respondents; 23% favored ketchup; 17% chili; 9% pickle relish, and 7% onions. Other toppings include sauerkraut, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and chili peppers.

Condiment preferences vary across the U.S. Southerners showed the strongest preference for chili, while Midwesterners showed the greatest affinity for ketchup.

===Variations===

American hot dog variations often have misleading names; they are commonly named for the geographical regions that allegedly inspired them instead of the regions in which they are most popular. For example, michigan hot dogs and white hots are popular in upstate New York, whereas Coney Island hot dogs are popular in Michigan. 
Sauteed bell peppers, onions, and potatoes find their way into New Jersey&#x27;s deep-fried Italian hot dog. Hot wieners, or weenies, are a staple in Rhode Island where they are sold at restaurants under the misleading name &quot;New York System.&quot; Texas hot dogs are spicy variants found in upstate New York and Pennsylvania (and as &quot;all the way dogs&quot; in New Jersey), but not Texas. In the Philadelphia metro area, Texas Tommy refers to a hot dog variant in which the frank is topped with melted cheese (often cheddar) and wrapped in bacon. In the Midwest, the Chicago-style hot dog is served on a poppy seed bun and topped with mustard, fresh tomatoes, onions, &quot;sport peppers&quot;, bright green relish, dill pickles, and celery salt.

The &quot;New York dog&quot; or &quot;New York style&quot; hot dog is a natural-casing all-beef frank topped with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard, onions optional, invented and popularized in New York City.

Some baseball parks have signature hot dogs, such as Dodger Dogs at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and Fenway Franks at Fenway Park in Boston.
Washington, D.C. is home to the half-smoke, a half beef, half pork sausage that is both grilled and smoked. A half-smoke is often placed into a hotdog-style bun and topped with chili, cheese, onions, and mustard, similar to a chili dog. Among the famous half-smoke restaurants in the Washington area include Ben&#x27;s Chili Bowl, which is a cultural landmark, and Weenie Beenie in Arlington County, Virginia.

==In Canada==
Skinner&#x27;s Restaurant, in Lockport, Manitoba, is reputed to be Canada&#x27;s oldest hot dog outlet in continuous operation, founded in 1929 by Jim Skinner Sr. Hot dogs served at Skinner&#x27;s are European style foot-long (30.5 cm) hot dogs with natural casings, manufactured by Winnipeg Old Country Sausage in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

==Outside North America==

In most of the world, a &quot;hot dog&quot; is recognized as a sausage in a bun, but the type varies considerably. The name is often applied to something that would not be described as a hot dog in North America. For example, in New Zealand a &quot;hot dog&quot; is a battered sausage, often on a stick, which is known as a corn dog in North America; an &quot;American hot dog&quot; is the version in a bun.

==Records==

The world&#x27;s longest hot dog had been long and rested within a bun. The hot dog was prepared by Shizuoka Meat Producers for the All-Japan Bread Association, which baked the bun and coordinated the event, including official measurement for the world record. The hot dog and bun were the center of a media event in celebration of the Association&#x27;s 50th anniversary on August 4, 2006, at the Akasaka Prince Hotel in Tokyo.

On May 31, 2012, Guinness World Records certified the world record for the most expensive hot dog at USD$145.49. The &quot;California Capitol City Dawg&quot;, served at Capitol Dawg in Sacramento, California, features a grilled all-beef, natural-casing frank from Chicago, served on a fresh-baked herb-and-oil focaccia roll, spread with white truffle butter, then grilled. It is topped with whole-grain mustard from France, garlic and herb mayonnaise, sauteed chopped shallots, organic mixed baby greens, maple syrup-marinated and fruitwood-smoked uncured bacon from New Hampshire, chopped tomato, moose cheese from Sweden, sweetened dried cranberries, basil olive oil and pear-cranberry-coconut balsamic vinaigrette, and ground peppercorn. Proceeds from the sale of each super dog were donated to the Shriners Hospitals for Children.

Hot dogs are a popular food for eating competitions. The record for hot dogs eaten in 10 minutes is 83 by Joey Chestnut at the &quot;Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef&quot; event on September 02, 2024. The last person to hold the record before Chestnut was Takeru Kobayashi. Competitive eater Miki Sudo holds the record for most hot dogs eaten in 10 minutes by a female at 48.5 hot dogs, also setting this record on July 4, 2020. The last person to hold the record before Sudo was Sonya Thomas.

<doc id="192375" wikidata="Q5199418" url="?curid=192375" title="Cymbal making">
<text>Modern [[cymbal]] making comprises many different techniques, from traditional hand methods to completely automated mass-production. 

==The traditional process==

Historically, cymbals were made from individually cast cymbal blanks which were then hot-forged, often with many annealing processes, to form the rough shape of the cymbal.

The finishing stages consisted of cold-hammering to unevenly harden the metal, then turning on a lathe to reduce the thickness, and then often a final cold hammering.

The hot and cold hammering were all performed entirely by a highly skilled hand and was a 
labour-intensive process. The only machine to touch the cymbal was a hand-held lathe.

This lathing step could decrease the weight of the cymbal by two-thirds or more, and resulted in further uneven hardening which produces much of the tone of a traditionally made cymbal. This effect was deliberately enhanced by use of a coarse lathe tool, and sometimes by a very limited final polishing, leaving the lathe tool marks as &quot;tone grooves&quot;. Traditional cymbals are lathed over the entire surface top and bottom.

==Modern developments==

Each stage of this process has been modified by the use of recent technology.

One of the main effects has been that far closer manufacturing tolerances can be achieved, resulting in more consistent sounding cymbals.

This has also provided the opportunity to omit some of the traditional steps completely, and so unlathed, partly lathed, and even unhammered cymbals have entered the catalogs of major makers, and achieved widespread acceptance.

===Modern casting techniques===

====Rotocasting====

The more unusual of these is rotocasting, in which the mold is spun to force metal into the details of the mold by centrifugal force. This allows the hot forging step to be reduced or even omitted, as the resulting casting can be made far closer to the final shape of the cymbal, including its bell and taper. It is an expensive process used for a few top quality bell bronze cymbals.

====Sheet metal cymbals====

Many modern cymbals are stamped or, less commonly, hammered from sheet metal. It is a widely held misconception that only malleable alloys can be cold rolled into sheets. The historical and current production 602 line cymbals and the historical Sound Creation cymbals, both from the major manufacturer Paiste, and the current production M-Series cymbals from Meinl are made from sheet bell bronze with a 20% Tin content. Nevertheless, the term &quot;sheet metal cymbals&quot; tends to refer to cymbals produced from all other common cymbal alloys as opposed to bell bronze.

Some claim that these &quot;sheet&quot; cymbals have a different sound to traditionally made cymbals, owing to their manufacture from sheet metal rather than from individual castings. Others claim that the larger difference is the alloy or the hammering technique. Top quality &quot;cast&quot; cymbals are normally made from bell bronze, while &quot;sheet&quot; cymbals are normally made from malleable alloys.

Paiste even claims that the division into cast and sheet cymbals is misleading, as all alloys are at some stage cast, and refuses to say whether or not particular cymbals are made from sheet metal. Their Sound Alloy patent implies that they have a method for making sheet metal cymbals of this alloy, which would make these a unique third category.

The 2002 Paiste Cymbal Guide even claims that all cymbals are &quot;cast&quot;, not just their own, but here they are not using the word in the established sense. All other manufacturers openly state that all of their malleable alloy cymbals are made from sheet metal, and that all of their bell bronze cymbals are 
individually cast. One possible reason for Paiste&#x27;s claims is that there is still a great deal of prestige associated with traditionally cast cymbals. The first sheet cymbals were brass, and were very
cheaply made. It is only in the last few decades that top-quality sheet cymbals have been produced at all.

But whether this prestige is still deserved is doubtful. The major manufacturer Meinl produces both cast and sheet cymbals, and currently chooses to make their top premium line from sheet bronze. Some top drummers who play Zildjian or Sabian cymbals now choose to play their sheet bronze cymbals, rather than their more expensive cast cymbals, for the sake of their sound.

Louder drummers tend to choose sheet cymbals, while jazz players and major orchestras still tend towards cast cymbals. So it is more a matter of choosing the correct cymbal for the sound required.

===Forging techniques===

Some manufacturers of bell bronze cymbals now use hot-rolling and cold-pressing of individual cymbal blanks rather than traditional forging. These processes are faster and cheaper and appear to have little if any effect on the final sound.

===Hammering techniques===
Many manufacturers claim that their cymbals are &quot;hand hammered&quot;, but again these words may not always mean the same thing.*

Some hand hammered cymbals are hammered using a hammer held in the cymbal maker&#x27;s hand. Others are hammered using a proprietary machine, but are still described as &quot;hand hammered&quot; because the hammering is under the control of an individual craftsman.

In general, truly hand hammered cymbals tend to have darker, lower, richer tones, and there tends to be far more variation in character between cymbals of supposedly identical models. Istanbul Mehmet Cymbals are an example of traditionally hand hammered cymbals.

Cymbals hammered by automated machines tend to be brighter, higher in pitch, and more cutting. Most significantly, the variation between supposedly identical cymbals is noticeably reduced, assuming adequate quality control.

The difference in sound is due mostly to the nature of the hammering: hand hammering is done randomly (that is not in a regular pattern) and thus the cymbal has a darker sound-even if this &quot;random&quot; style is dictated and executed by a computer. Symmetrical hammering- which is almost always done by a machine- gives the cymbal a brighter sound. This fact is reinforced by the example of some cymbals from English independent cymbal maker, Matt Nolan, which are unusual in being truly hand hammered but made from Malleable Bronze. The results are darker sounds from what are normally considered brighter alloys.

Paiste has used the same production processes from at least the mid 50&#x27;s or earlier (they got their first hammering machine in 1952) to the present on all their top of the line Swiss and German produced cymbals.&lt;br&gt; 
An electro pneumatic hammer is operated manually by the cymbal-smith, he wears a mount with a spindle on his left knee that holds the cymbal, he uses his thigh to move the cymbal in and out from the hammer to position the blows, with his right foot he controls the power/depth of the hammer blows, with his hands he rotates the cymbal to evenly distribute the hammer marks.&lt;br&gt; 
Paiste has been using this technique and the same type of machines since at least the mid 50’s or earlier.&lt;br&gt; 
The next step is fine tuning: a different cymbal-smith now hammers the cymbal by hand to fine tune the shape and checks the bow with a ruler and on a steel flat table to make sure the edges are straight, he also checks the cymbal against a “master” for hammer pattern and shape of the bow.
*Paiste is the only company out of the “big four” (Paiste, Zildjian, Sabian and Meinl) that uses manual hammering to shape the curve or “bow” of the cymbal (Meinl used a computer controlled hammering machine to shape one line of their cymbals): Zildjian and Sabian use a 75 ton press to and STAMP their cymbals into shape. With the exception of their Turkish made cymbals, all of Meinl&#x27;s cymbal production is completely computer automated.

== Turning (lathing) ==
During the 20th century, the mechanical lathe underwent major improvements eventually leading to the automated cymbal lathe

Secondly, the closer tolerances have led to far more use of unturned and partly unturned cymbals. The turning which was once essential to form the shape of the cymbal can now be varied to produce new sounds, especially at the top end of the range.

One pioneering example was the Meinl Raker splash, whose top surface has a single spiral cut by a single pass of a very coarse tool. Another is the Zildjian Earth Ride, whose top surface is not turned at all, but very sparingly hammered. Many manufacturers now produce cymbals with one or both surfaces unturned, or with bands of dark unturned metal. Modern coarse turning patterns allow unturned metal and hammering-marks to show through between the tracks of the lathe tool.

Some lower market cymbals are not turned at all and are produced by pressing rather than turning. The effect on the sound is similar to turning, because the parts of the metal that have been most deformed are most hardened. However the effect that can be produced in this way is very limited.

In the extreme it is even possible to produce a cymbal that appears to have been turned then hammered, by a single operation of a press starting with a flat metal sheet. The result is a round cymbal, with a thickened bell, tapered bow, turning marks and hammering marks.

Away from this extreme, the line between hammering and pressing can blur. Some excellent student cymbals have a final hammering pattern produced by a single blow of a press, after genuine turning. The effect on the metal of this pressing operation is very similar to the effect of machine hammering, and the results are very consistent.

===Polishing===

Modern cymbals are available in several polishes or finishes.

Traditional fully lathed cymbals are coated with clear lacquer to protect the bare metal from oxidizing or tarnishing or &quot;browning&quot; from exposure to air and other elements, as well as oil from fingerprints. Because the cymbal retains its shiny look until the lacquer starts wearing off, this finish is still the most common.

The first departure from this was the appearance of &quot;bright&quot; or &quot;brilliant&quot; finishes. These are the result of polishing high speed buffer. Some metal is removed in the process, especially the microscopic ridges in the grooves which produce the high end &quot;zing&quot; sound of a cymbal. The process actually dulls the sound of the cymbals but makes them very visually attractive. These cymbals are usually lacquered as well.

In the case of bands of oxide left on partly lathed cymbals like the Bosphorus Ferrit Antique and Istanbul Custom Sultan it is impossible to decide what the contribution of the oxide pattern is to the sound, as these tend to be complex, top-quality handmade cymbals. But in giving the cymbal designer more options, they allow more precise and focused control, and production of a wide range of sounds.

Finally, on some cymbals the oxide coat is deliberately enhanced to simulate age, or a whole new coating applied. Examples are Meinl Champagne Finish, Masterwork Avanos and Paiste Coloursound. Results depend very much on the actual coating and the cymbal.

<text>Os Mutantes (, &quot;The Mutants&quot;) are an influential Brazilian rock band that were linked with the Tropicália movement, a dissident musical movement during the Brazilian dictatorship of the late 1960s. The band is considered to be one of the main groups of Brazilian rock. Heavily influenced by Anglo-American psychedelic pop, they bridged Brazilian sensibilities together with studio trickery, feedback, distortion, and musique concrète. They released their now-acclaimed self-titled debut album in 1968.

Os Mutantes debuted their work in 1966, as a trio, when they presented themselves in the program &quot;O Pequeno Mundo de Ronnie Von&quot; of TV Record. The group was christened &quot;Mutantes&quot; by Ronnie Von himself, right before their first TV appearance. The group until then called themselves &quot;Os Bruxos&quot; (meaning &quot;The Witches&quot;, in Portuguese) and the suggestion came from the book &quot;Emperor of the Mutants&quot;, by Stefan Wul (the book&#x27;s original title in French is &quot;La Mort Vivante&quot;). The group quickly became one of the main figures of the &quot;new MPB&quot; (popular Brazilian music), influenced by Tropicália, until their breakup in 1978, only with Sérgio Dias as an original member. Throughout these twelve years, nine albums were recorded, although two of them – &quot;O A e o Z&quot; and &quot;Tecnicolor&quot; – were only released in the 1990s. It was during this later decade that the importance of Os Mutantes was recognized, by both national and international rock, as one of the most creative dynamic, radical and talented groups of the psychedelic era.

Although the original line-up (Rita Lee, Arnaldo Baptista and Sérgio Dias; and later with Liminha and Dinho Leme) made the most notable breakthrough for the group, it has gone through numerous personnel changes throughout its existence. After a hiatus from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, the band reunited in 2006, touring and recording new material.

==History==
===Origins===
Os Mutantes were formed in São Paulo in 1966 by two brothers: Arnaldo Baptista (bass, keyboards and vocals) and Sérgio Dias Baptista (guitar and vocals), and lead singer Rita Lee. They were originally named Six Sided Rockers. The Baptistas&#x27; father was a poet and mother a pianist, and the two had previously had an all-male band called The Wooden Faces, while Lee was in an all-female band called The Teenage Singers. Sérgio Dias&#x27;s guitar, the Golden Guitar (Guitarra de Ouro), was created by Arnaldo and Sérgio&#x27;s brother, Cláudio César Dias Baptista, who built many of their instruments and electronic effects. Their current name was settled upon immediately before a performance on a Brazilian television program.

===Tropicália===
Through other TV performances, the band was able to meet Gilberto Gil, an influential musician in the Tropicália movement, who brought them into the movement&#x27;s circle. Os Mutantes released two albums heavily influenced by Tropicália, which blended psychedelic rock with other forms of art. They performed and recorded with many artists of this period, including Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, before Veloso and Gil were arrested and subsequently exiled by the military government of Brazil in early 1969. During this period, Os Mutantes were also threatened by the military government of Brazil of that time.

In 1967, Os Mutantes backed Gilberto Gil when he competed in the third annual Festival of Brazilian Popular Music, making Brazilian music history by being one of the first two rock groups to participate, and Gil won second prize in the song competition with his song &quot;Domingo no Parque&quot; (&quot;Sunday in the Park&quot;). Gil&#x27;s friend Caetano Veloso also performed with a rock group, São Paulo band Beat Boys, and although his unorthodox performance met with some initial resistance, he eventually won over the crowd with his song &quot;Alegria, Alegria&quot;, which was awarded fourth place in the competition. The next year Os Mutantes collaborated with Gilberto Gil on his second solo album, and they also contributed to the manifesto work of the Tropicália movement, the landmark 1968 album &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis&quot; (&quot;Tropicália: or Bread and Circuses&quot;) a collaborative album recorded by all the major figures in the movement, including Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gll, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, with orchestrations by Rogerio Duprat and lyrical contributions from Torquato Neto.

In sharp contrast to their well-received festival appearance in 1967, the group famously met with intense hostility when they backed Caetano Veloso for his two now-legendary performances at the third Festival Internacional da Canção in Rio, which caused a near-riot. In the first round of the festival&#x27;s song competition on 12 September 1968, Veloso and Os Mutantes were loudly jeered, booed and insulted by a large group of students in the audience, who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalists&#x27; musical experiments, and who were further infuriated by Veloso&#x27;s outlandish costume, and his provocatively sexual stage movements. In the second round of the competition on 15 September, Veloso and Os Mutantes performed a wild new psychedelic piece that Veloso had written for the occasion, called &quot;É proibido proibir&quot; (&quot;It Is Forbidden to Forbid&quot;); this was recorded live and an excerpt was later released as the b-side of the studio recording of the single. The students began heckling even before the ensemble took the stage, and throughout the song, the anti-Tropicalist faction in the audience jeered and booed so loudly that the performers could barely be heard. The students also began throwing eggs, fruit, vegetables and paper balls and a section of the audience stood up and turned their backs on the performers, to which Os Mutantes responded by turning their backs to the audience. Os Mutantes continued playing, but Veloso stopped singing and spontaneously launched into an impassioned diatribe, denouncing the student faction for their conservatism, which provoked even louder howls of disapproval from the audience. Although the ensemble was joined on stage by Gilberto Gil, who came out to show his support, the jeering continued unabated, so Veloso angrily declared that he would no longer participate in the competition; he then finished the song deliberately out of tune, and he, Gilberto and Os Mutantes left the stage arm-in-arm.

===Mid-seventies===
In 1971, bassist Arnolpho Lima Filho (&quot;Liminha&quot;) and drummer Ronaldo Leme (&quot;Dinho&quot;) officially joined the band. They released five albums together before Lee departed in 1972 to start a solo career. Rita Lee&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Hoje É o Primeiro Dia do Resto da Sua Vida&quot; was actually recorded with Os Mutantes but credited to Rita Lee due to record company disagreements. Subsequently, the band moved in a progressive rock direction with the album &quot;O A e o Z&quot;, recorded in 1973 but released only in 1992 due to disagreement with the record company. Arnaldo left the band in that year to pursue a solo career due to differences with other band members and problems with the abuse of LSD, followed by Dinho and, a year later, Liminha. Arnaldo subsequently was institutionalized and jumped from the building&#x27;s window, causing a six-week coma. Sérgio Dias, the only remaining original member, led the band until its dissolution in 1978. During this time, they released one more studio album, a live album and an EP. Two unreleased albums were released many years later, the aforementioned &quot;O A e o Z&quot; and &quot;Tecnicolor&quot; recorded in 1970 and released in 2000.

===Reunion===
Os Mutantes (Arnaldo, Sérgio and Dinho, &quot;sans&quot; Rita Lee and Liminha—Lee was replaced with Zélia Duncan on vocals) played live for the first time since 1978 at the Tropicalia exhibition at London&#x27;s Barbican Arts Centre on 22 May 2006. This performance, which was first by drummer Dinho Leme since the end of Os Mutantes, was followed by shows in New York City, Los Angeles (with the Flaming Lips), San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Chicago, and Miami.

They have also collaborated with British DJ JD Twitch, in a Britain/Brazil culture project in 2007, called Trocabrahma. In September 2007, both Arnaldo Baptista and Zélia Duncan left the band. Both expressed wishes to continue with their respective solo projects. Sérgio Dias, however, vowed to keep the reformed band alive, not wanting to let &quot;the giant sleep again&quot;, as he put it.

In November, it was reported that Liminha would return to the fold, while Karina Zeviani was said to replace Duncan as the band&#x27;s female vocalist. Neither is part of the new band lineup. Sérgio Dias announced in late 2007 the recording of a new studio album, with some collaboration by Tom Zé and Devendra Banhart. In April 2008, Os Mutantes released their first song in more than 30 years, called &quot;Mutantes Depois&quot;, with new female vocalist Bia Mendes and male vocalist Fabio Recco, available for digital download and online stream.

In June 2008, &quot;A Minha Menina&quot; was the featured audio track for the McDonald&#x27;s commercial &quot;Victory.&quot;

In 2009, the band announced their first new release in 35 years, &quot;Haih Or Amortecedor&quot;, which was released on 8 September, by ANTI- Records. They did an extensive North American tour in support of the album in the fall of 2009 and played at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2010. The band also toured North America in the fall of 2010.

In 2011, they collaborated with Of Montreal on the song &quot;Bat Macumba&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent charitable album &quot;Red Hot+Rio 2.&quot; The album is a follow-up to the 1996 &quot;Red Hot + Rio,&quot; with proceeds from the sales donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues.

On 30 April 2013, &quot;Fool Metal Jack&quot; was released. Unlike &quot;Haih Or Amortecedor&quot;, the album&#x27;s lyrics are mostly in English. The album features a slightly different lineup than &quot;Haih&quot;, with Ani Cordero replacing Dinho Leme on drums and Amy Crawford replacing Henrique Peters on keyboards. The band toured North America in support of the album.

In 2022–2023, Os Mutantes, fronted by Sérgio Dias, went on a North American tour.

==Legacy==
When Os Mutantes was formed, it combined influences from rock acts from the English-speaking world like The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, the Ventures, and Duane Eddy with bossa nova, tropicália, samba and the cultural legacy of the Brazilian art vanguards from the modernist movement.

Os Mutantes is one of the most well-known and influential rock bands in Brazil. In addition, many contemporary underground or independent bands in the United States and Europe cite Os Mutantes as a major influence. Kurt Cobain publicly requested a reunion tour from the trio in 1993, writing a letter to Arnaldo Baptista. Cobain was introduced to them by Pat Fear from White Flag (whose collaboration with Redd Kross and other friends under the name The Tater Totz was the first American band to cover or even cite Os Mutantes on their 1988 LP &quot;Alien Sleestaks from Brazil&quot;). Beck paid tribute to the group with his single &quot;Tropicália&quot; from the album &quot;Mutations&quot;. The Bees covered &quot;A Minha Menina&quot; on their first album, &quot;Sunshine Hit Me&quot;. Red Hot Chili Peppers bass player Flea has stated on his Twitter account that &quot;Os Mutantes the Brazilian band is so great&quot;. Kevin Barnes Of Montreal cites Os Mutantes as an important influence. Talking Heads frontman David Byrne has worked to publish and promote the group&#x27;s music through his Luaka Bop label.

Their song Ave Lucifer has been sampled on Captain Murphy&#x27;s song &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; (produced by Flying Lotus).

==Discography==
The discography of Os Mutantes consists of ten studio albums, two live albums, ten compilation albums, four extended plays, ten singles and one video album

<text>The Hoover–Minthorn House is a museum in Newberg, Oregon, United States, created from the residence of Herbert Hoover, thirty-first President of the United States. Hoover lived there from 1885 to 1891, with his uncle and aunt John and Laura Minthorn. The Minthorns were administrators of the Quaker school Friends Pacific Academy, now George Fox University, which Hoover and his brother Tad attended.

The house, an Italianate design built in 1881 by Jesse Edwards, a Quaker merchant, is the first residence Edwards built and the oldest house still standing in what is now Newberg, Oregon. Representing vernacular design in the Willamette Valley, it was restored and opened to the public in 1955. It is located on 115 South River Street. Owned and operated as a house museum by the Oregon chapter of The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, it has been furnished with late 19th-century period furnishings, including the bedroom furniture used by Hoover as a boy.

The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places (as the Dr. Henry J. Minthorn House aka Herbert Hoover House) in 2003.

<text>Joseph Peter Pantoliano (born September 12, 1951) is an American actor who has played over 150 roles across film, television, and theater. He is best known for portraying Ralph &quot;Ralphie&quot; Cifaretto on the HBO crime drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999–2007), for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and Cypher in the sci-fi action film &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999).

After early roles in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and the comedy film &quot;Risky Business&quot;, Pantoliano gained recognition for numerous supporting roles in films and television shows such as &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, &quot;La Bamba&quot;, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;Memento&quot;, and &quot;Bad Boys&quot; and its sequels. He also appeared in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and its spin-off &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot;. He began working with the Wachowskis in their directorial debut &quot;Bound&quot;, and later appeared in their film &quot;The Matrix&quot; and their sci-fi series &quot;Sense8&quot;.

Pantoliano has published two memoirs and is active in the field of mental health, having documented his mother&#x27;s issues and his own. He founded the nonprofit No Kidding, Me Too! which is dedicated to removing the stigma from mental illness.

== Early life ==
Joseph Peter Pantoliano was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, on September 12, 1951, the son of parents Mary (née Centrella) and Dominic &quot;Monk&quot; Pantoliano. His mother was a bookmaker and seamstress, while his father was a hearse driver and factory foreman. His family moved to Cliffside Park, New Jersey, where he attended Cliffside Park High School. He attended the HB Studio and studied extensively under actors Herbert Berghof and John Lehne.

== Career ==

Pantoliano first grew to fame as Guido the killer pimp in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Risky Business&quot;. In 1985 he appeared as the villainous Francis Fratelli in teen classic &quot;The Goonies&quot;. He gained fame among a new generation as Cypher in the 1999 landmark sci-fi film &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Ralph Cifaretto in HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. 

Pantoliano is also known for his role as Eddie Moscone, the foul-mouthed, double-crossing bail bondsman, in the Robert De Niro comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, as Captain Conrad Howard in &quot;Bad Boys,&quot; &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot; and &quot;Bad Boys: Ride or Die&quot;, as double-crossed mafioso Caesar in &quot;Bound&quot;, as John &quot;Teddy&quot; Gammell in &quot;Memento&quot;, and as investigative journalist Ben Urich in Mark Steven Johnson&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Daredevil&quot; adaptation. He played Deputy U.S. Marshal Cosmo Renfro in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; along with Tommy Lee Jones and reprised the role in the sequel &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot;.

In 2003 Pantoliano replaced Stanley Tucci in the Broadway play &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;.

In 2012 Pantoliano starred as the eccentric pawn broker Oswald Oswald in the film adaptation of Wendy Mass&#x27;s popular children&#x27;s book &quot;Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life&quot;, written and directed by Tamar Halpern. In 2013, he was cast as Yogi Berra in the Broadway production of &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot;, but dropped out during rehearsals due to &quot;creative differences.&quot; From 2015 to 2018 he played Michael Gorski in the Wachowskis&#x27; Netflix series &quot;Sense8&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Pantoliano was married to Morgan Kester from 1979 until they divorced in 1985. He married his second wife, former model Nancy Sheppard, in 1994; they have four children together, and reside in Connecticut. He was introduced to Sheppard by actress Samantha Phillips.

During his tenure on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Pantoliano struggled to stay anonymous in his native New Jersey; when filming his scenes as Ralph, he prevented the public from recognizing him by wearing a wig based on the hairstyle of filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who had previously directed him in &quot;Memento&quot;. Ralph&#x27;s secret use of a wig later became a minor plot point in one episode of the show.

On October 9, 2007, Pantoliano announced on the National Alliance on Mental Illness blog that he had been suffering from clinical depression for the last decade, although he was only formally diagnosed recently. He also has dyslexia. He said that his 2006 film &quot;Canvas&quot; helped him come to terms with his depression. Rather than hide his illness from the public, he chose to speak out about it to remove some of the stigma commonly associated with mental illness. He founded a nonprofit organization called No Kidding, Me Too! which aims to unite members of the entertainment industry in educating the public about mental illness. The title comes from the response he has frequently heard after revealing how mental illness affected him and his family. He directed, wrote, and starred in the documentary &quot;No Kidding! Me 2!!&quot; (2009).

Pantoliano is the author of two memoirs: &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now: The True Story of a Stand-Up Guy&quot; and &quot;Asylum: Hollywood Tales From My Great Depression: Brain Dis-Ease, Recovery, and Being My Mother&#x27;s Son&quot;. He revealed in the latter that he struggled with alcoholism, food addiction, sex addiction, and addictions to Vicodin and Percocet before being diagnosed with clinical depression.

On May 1, 2020, Pantoliano suffered a concussion and chest trauma when he was hit by a car while walking in his neighborhood.

<text>In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP) (also just access point (AP)) is a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network or wireless network. As a standalone device, the AP may have a wired or wireless connection to a switch or router, but in a wireless router it can also be an integral component of the networking device itself. A WAP and AP is differentiated from a hotspot, which can be a physical location or digital location where Wi-Fi or WAP access is available.

==Connections==
An AP connects directly to a wired local area network, typically Ethernet, and the AP then provides wireless connections using wireless LAN technology, typically Wi-Fi, for other devices to use that wired connection. APs support the connection of multiple wireless devices through their one wired connection.

== Wireless data standards ==
There are many wireless data standards that have been introduced for wireless access point and wireless router technology. New standards have been created to accommodate the increasing need for faster wireless connections. Access points can provide backward compatibility with older Wi-Fi protocols as many devices were manufactured for use with older standards.
* 802.11a
* 802.11b
* 802.11g
* 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
* 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)
* 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E)
* 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)
==Wireless access point vs. ad hoc network==
Some people confuse wireless access points with wireless ad hoc networks. An ad hoc network uses a connection between two or more devices &quot;without&quot; using a wireless access point; the devices communicate directly. Because setup is easy and does not require an access point, an ad hoc network is used in situations such as a quick data exchange or a multiplayer video game. Due to its peer-to-peer layout, ad hoc Wi-Fi connections are similar to connections available using Bluetooth.

Ad hoc connections are generally not recommended for a permanent installation. Internet access via ad hoc networks, using features like Windows&#x27; Internet Connection Sharing or dedicated software such as WiFi Direct Access Point, may work well with a small number of devices that are close to each other, but ad hoc networks do not scale well. Internet traffic will converge to the nodes with direct internet connection, potentially congesting these nodes. For internet-enabled nodes, access points have a clear advantage, with the possibility of having a wired LAN.

==Limitations==
It is generally recommended that one IEEE 802.11 AP should have, at a maximum, 10–25 clients. However, the actual maximum number of clients that can be supported can vary significantly depending on several factors, such as type of APs in use, density of client environment, desired client throughput, etc. The range of communication can also vary significantly, depending on such variables as indoor or outdoor placement, height above ground, nearby obstructions, other electronic devices that might actively interfere with the signal by broadcasting on the same frequency, type of antenna, the current weather, operating radio frequency, and the power output of devices. Network designers can extend the range of APs through the use of repeaters, which amplify a radio signal, and reflectors, which only bounce it. In experimental conditions, wireless networking has operated over distances of several hundred kilometers.

Most jurisdictions have only a limited number of frequencies legally available for use by wireless networks. Usually, adjacent APs will use different frequencies (channels) to communicate with their clients in order to avoid interference between the two nearby systems. Wireless devices can &quot;listen&quot; for data traffic on other frequencies, and can rapidly switch from one frequency to another to achieve better reception. However, the limited number of frequencies becomes problematic in crowded downtown areas with tall buildings using multiple APs. In such an environment, signal overlap becomes an issue causing interference, which results in signal degradation and data errors.

Wireless networking lags wired networking in terms of increasing bandwidth and throughput. While (as of 2013) high-density 256-QAM modulation, 3-antenna wireless devices for the consumer market can reach sustained real-world speeds of some 240 Mbit/s at 13 m behind two standing walls (NLOS) depending on their nature or 360 Mbit/s at 10 m line of sight or 380 Mbit/s at 2 m line of sight (IEEE 802.11ac) or 20 to 25 Mbit/s at 2 m line of sight (IEEE 802.11g), wired hardware of similar cost reaches closer to 1000 Mbit/s up to specified distance of 100 m with twisted-pair cabling in optimal conditions (Category 5 (known as Cat-5) or better cabling with Gigabit Ethernet). One impediment to increasing the speed of wireless communications comes from Wi-Fi&#x27;s use of a shared communications medium: Thus, two stations in infrastructure mode that are communicating with each other even over the same AP must have each and every frame transmitted twice: from the sender to the AP, then from the AP to the receiver. This approximately halves the effective bandwidth, so an AP is only able to use somewhat less than half the actual over-the-air rate for data throughput. Thus a typical 54 Mbit/s wireless connection actually carries TCP/IP data at 20 to 25 Mbit/s. Users of legacy wired networks expect faster speeds, and people using wireless connections keenly want to see the wireless networks catch up.

By 2012, 802.11n based access points and client devices have already taken a fair share of the marketplace and with the finalization of the 802.11n standard in 2009 inherent problems integrating products from different vendors are less prevalent.

==Security==

Wireless access has special security considerations. Many wired networks base the security on physical access control, trusting all the users on the local network, but if wireless access points are connected to the network, anybody within range of the AP (which typically extends farther than the intended area) can attach to the network.

The most common solution is wireless traffic encryption. Modern access points come with built-in encryption. The first generation encryption scheme, WEP, proved easy to crack; the second and third generation schemes, WPA and WPA2, are considered secure if a strong enough password or passphrase is used.

Some APs support hotspot style authentication using RADIUS and other authentication servers.

Opinions about wireless network security vary widely. For example, in a 2008 article for &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Bruce Schneier asserted the net benefits of open Wi-Fi without passwords outweigh the risks, a position supported in 2014 by Peter Eckersley of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The opposite position was taken by Nick Mediati in an article for &quot;PC World&quot;, in which he advocates that every wireless access point should be protected with a password.

<text>The color khaki (, ) is a light shade of tan with a slight yellowish tinge.

Khaki has been used by many armies around the world for uniforms and equipment, particularly in arid or desert regions, where it provides camouflage relative to sandy or dusty terrain. It has been used as a color name in English since 1848 when it was introduced as a military uniform. In Western fashion, it is a standard color for smart casual dress trousers for civilians, which are also often called &quot;khakis&quot;.

In British English and some other Commonwealth usage, &quot;khaki&quot; may also refer to a shade of green known as olive drab.

==Etymology==

&quot;Khaki&quot; is a loanword from Urdu &#x27;soil-colored&#x27;, which in turn comes from Persian &quot;khāk&quot; &#x27;soil&#x27; + (adjectival attributive suffix); it came into English via the British Indian Army.

==Origin==
Khaki was first worn as a uniform in the Corps of Guides that was raised in December 1846 by Henry Lawrence (1806–1857), agent to the Governor-General for the North-West Frontier and stationed in Lahore. Initially the border troops were dressed in their native costume, which consisted of a smock and white pajama trousers made of a coarse home-spun cotton, and a cotton turban, supplemented by a leather or padded cotton jacket for cold weather. In 1848, a khaki uniform was introduced. Subsequently, all regiments serving in the region, whether British or Indian, had adopted khaki uniforms for active service and summer dress. The original khaki fabric was a closely twilled cloth of linen or cotton.

==Military use==

The impracticality of traditional bright colors such as the red coat, especially for skirmishing, was recognised early in the 19th century. A response to improved technologies such as aerial surveillance and smokeless powder, khaki could camouflage soldiers in the field of battle.

Khaki-colored uniforms were used officially by British troops for the first time during the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, when Indian troops traveled to Ethiopia. Subsequently, the British Army adopted khaki for colonial campaign dress and it was used in the Mahdist War (1884–89) and Second Boer War (1899–1902). These uniforms became known as khaki drill, versions of which are still part of the uniforms of the British Army. 

During the Second Boer War, the British forces became known as Khakis because of their uniforms. After victory in the war, the government called an election, which became known as the khaki election, a term used subsequently for elections called to exploit public approval of governments immediately after military victories.

The United States Army adopted khaki during the Spanish–American War (1898), replacing their traditional blue field uniforms. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps followed suit, authorizing khaki field and work uniforms.

When khaki was adopted for the continental British Service Dress in 1902, the shade chosen had a clearly darker and more green hue (see photo). This color was adopted with minor variations by all the British Empire armies. The 1902 US Army uniform regulations also adopted a similar shade for soldiers&#x27; winter service uniforms under the name olive drab. This shade of brown-green remained in use by many countries throughout the two World Wars.

== Use in civilian clothing ==
Following World War II, military-issue khaki-colored chino cloth twill trousers became a common part of civilian clothing. Today, the term &quot;khakis&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the style of trousers, properly called chinos, regardless of their color.

==Tones of khaki==

===Light khaki===
At right is displayed the color light khaki (also called khaki tan or just tan).

===Khaki===
This is the web color called &quot;khaki&quot; in HTML/CSS.

The color shown at right matches the color designated as &quot;khaki&quot; in the 1930 book &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot;, the standard for color nomenclature before the introduction of computers.

===Dark khaki===

At right is displayed the web color dark khaki.

It corresponds to &quot;Dark Khaki&quot; in the X11 color names.

===Khaki green===
At right is displayed the color khaki green, sometimes called simply &quot;khaki&quot; in Commonwealth countries. It is more commonly called olive green or olive drab.

<doc id="192399" wikidata="Q156962" url="?curid=192399" title="German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin">
<text>The German aircraft carrier &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was the lead ship in a class of two carriers of the same name ordered by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; of Nazi Germany. She was the only aircraft carrier launched by Germany and represented part of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;″s attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.

Construction on &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; began on 28 December 1936, when her keel was laid down at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. Named in honor of &quot;Graf&quot; (Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the ship was launched on 8 December 1938, and was 85% complete by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities necessitated by the war. She remained in the Baltic for the duration of the war; with Germany&#x27;s defeat imminent, the ship&#x27;s custodian crew scuttled her just outside Stettin in March 1945. The Soviet Union raised the ship in March 1946, and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of Poland 17 months later. The wreck was discovered by a Polish survey ship in July 2006.

==Design==

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was long overall; she had a beam of and a maximum draft of . At full combat load, she would have displaced . The ship&#x27;s propulsion system consisted of four Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie geared turbines with sixteen oil-fired, ultra-high-pressure LaMont boilers. The power plant was rated at and a top speed of . &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; had a projected cruising radius of at a speed of . She would have had a crew of 1760 officers and enlisted men, plus flight crews.

The ship&#x27;s primary offensive power would have been its aircraft complement. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; would have carried 42 aircraft as designed: 12 navalized Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers, 10 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, and 20 Fieseler Fi 167 torpedo bombers. Later during the construction process, the aerial complement was reworked to consist of thirty Ju 87s and twelve Bf 109s, and the Fi 167s were removed altogether. As designed, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was to be fitted with eight 15 cm SK C/28 guns for defense against surface warships. This number was later increased to sixteen. Her anti-aircraft battery consisted of ten 10.5 cm SK C/33 guns—later increased to twelve—twenty-two 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns, and twenty-eight 2 cm guns. The ship&#x27;s flight deck was protected with up to of &quot;Wotan Weich&quot; steel armor. A armored deck was located under the deck to protect the ship&#x27;s vitals from aerial attacks. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; had a waterline armor belt that was thick in the central area of the ship.

== Construction and cancellation ==

On 16 November 1935, the contract for &quot;Flugzeugträger A&quot; (Aircraft carrier A)—later christened &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;—was awarded to the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. Construction of the ship was delayed since Deutsche Werke was working at capacity, and the slipway needed for &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was occupied by the new battleship , which was launched on 8 December 1936. Work started on &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; on 28 December, when her keel was laid down. She was launched on 8 December 1938, the 24th anniversary of the Battle of the Falkland Islands, and she was christened by Helene von Zeppelin, the daughter of the ship&#x27;s namesake. At the launching ceremony, Hermann Göring gave a speech. By the end of 1939, she was 85% complete, with a projected completion by the middle of 1940. By September 1939, one carrier-borne wing, &quot;Trägergruppe&quot; 186, had been formed by the Luftwaffe at Kiel Holtenau, composed of three squadrons equipped with Bf 109s and Ju 87s.

Meanwhile, the German conquest of Norway in April 1940 eroded any chance of completing &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. Now responsible for defending Norway&#x27;s long coastline and numerous port facilities, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; urgently needed large numbers of coastal guns and anti-aircraft batteries. During a naval conference with Hitler on 28 April 1940, Admiral Erich Raeder proposed halting all work on &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, arguing that even if she was commissioned by the end of 1940, final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more (her original fire-control system had been sold to the Soviet Union under an earlier trade agreement). Hitler consented to the stop work order, allowing Raeder to have &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;″s 15 cm guns removed and transferred to Norway. The carrier&#x27;s heavy flak armament of twelve 10.5 cm guns had already been diverted elsewhere.

In July 1940, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was towed from Kiel to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) and remained there for nearly a year. While there, she was used as a storage depot for Germany&#x27;s hardwood supply. Just before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the carrier was again moved, this time to Stettin, to safeguard her from Soviet air attacks. By November, the German army had pushed deep enough into Russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was returned to Gotenhafen. There, she was used as a store ship for timber.


By the time Raeder met with Hitler for a detailed discussion of naval strategy in April 1942, the usefulness of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare had been amply demonstrated. British carriers had crippled the Italian fleet at Taranto in November 1940, critically damaged the in May 1941 and prevented the battleship from attacking two convoys bound for Russia in March 1942. In addition, a Japanese carrier raid on Pearl Harbor had devastated the American battle fleet in December 1941. Raeder, anxious to secure air protection for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;″s heavier surface units, informed Hitler that &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; could be finished in about a year, with another six months required for sea trials and flight training. On 13 May 1942, with Hitler&#x27;s authorization, the German Naval Supreme Command ordered work resumed on the carrier.

But daunting technical problems remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, specifically designed for carrier use. &quot;Reichsmarshall&quot; Hermann Göring, head of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.

The converted carrier aircraft were heavier versions of their land-based predecessors and this required a host of changes to &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;″s original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter-director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin&#x27;s added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter-director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple &quot;Flakvierling&quot; 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges on either side of the hull to preserve the ship&#x27;s stability under all this added weight.

The German naval staff hoped all these changes could be accomplished by April 1943, with the carrier&#x27;s first sea trials taking place in August that year. Towards that end, Chief Engineer Wilhelm Hadeler was reassigned to oversee &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;″s completion. Hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their respective propulsion systems operational first, giving the ship an initial speed of 25–26 knots, fast enough for sea trials to commence and for conducting air training exercises. By the winter of 1943–1944 she was expected to be combat-ready.

On the night of 27–28 August 1942, while still moored at Gotenhafen, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was the target of the only Allied air attack aimed at her during the war. Three Royal Air Force Avro Lancaster heavy bombers from 106 Squadron were dispatched against the German aircraft carrier, each one carrying a single &quot;Capital Ship&quot; bomb, a device with a shaped charge warhead intended for armored targets. One pilot, who was unable to see the carrier due to haze, dropped his bomb instead on the estimated position of the &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Another believed he had scored a direct hit on &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, but there is no known record of the ship suffering any damage from a bomb strike that night.

On 5 December 1942, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was towed back to Kiel and placed in a floating drydock. It seemed she might well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler had become so disenchanted with the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was relieved of command shortly thereafter and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion, including &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, was halted. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.

In April 1943 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was again towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, then to the roadstead at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3 km) from Stettin, where she had been briefly docked in 1941. There she languished for the next two years with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship&#x27;s Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces and settling her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel&#x27;s interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier&#x27;s funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.

==Fate after the war==
The carrier&#x27;s history and fate after Germany&#x27;s surrender was unknown outside the Soviet Union for decades after the war. The Soviets could not repair the ship in the length of time specified by the terms of the Allied Tripartite Commission, so she was designated a &quot;Category C&quot; ship. This classification required that she would be destroyed or sunk in deep water by 15 August 1946. Instead, the Soviets decided to salvage the damaged ship and it was refloated in March 1946. A number of speculations from Western historians about the ship&#x27;s fate arose in the decades after the end of the war. According to German historian Erich Gröner, after the Soviets raised the scuttled ship, they towed her to Leningrad. While en route, she reportedly struck a mine off Finland during a storm. Gröner claimed that after &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; arrived in Leningrad, she was broken up for scrap in 1948–1949. Naval historians Robert Gardiner and Roger Chesneau state that the ship was towed out of Stettin in September 1947, but she never arrived in Leningrad; they speculated that a mine sank the ship while she was under tow.

According to Soviet records, on 19 March 1947, the Council of Ministers decreed the destruction of former German ships. The first ship to be sunk, &quot;Lützow&quot;, was sunk off Swinemunde on 22 July 1947. On 14 August &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was towed into Swinemunde harbor, and two days later to its final position. It was subjected to five series of controlled explosions of shells and FAB series bombs. The first test imitated a FAB-1000 detonation in the exhaust funnel and lesser bombs below the flight deck. The second in the series was a single FAB-1000 explosion above the flight deck. The third, the fourth and the fifth series imitated penetration of FAB-100, FAB-250 and FAB-500 bombs at flight deck, hangar deck and gun battery deck levels. These bombs were placed in cutouts in their target decks to imitate the effects of dive bombing. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; remained afloat, and Admiral Yury Rall ordered a torpedo strike. A torpedo fired from an Elco PT boat exploded in the anti-torpedo bulge but did not penetrate the belt armor. A torpedo fired by the destroyer &quot;Slavny&quot; penetrated the unprotected hull section below the bow elevator; &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; sank 25 minutes later.

===Discovery in 2006===
The exact position of the wreck was unknown for decades. On 12 July 2006, the research vessel , a ship belonging to the Polish oil company Petrobaltic, found a wreck north of Władysławowo, which they thought was most likely &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. The wreck rests at a depth of more than below the surface. After the wreck was located, the Polish Navy began a two-day survey of the wreckage to confirm its identity. Using remote-controlled underwater robots, they concluded that they were &quot;99% certain&quot; it was &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;.

<doc id="192400" wikidata="Q518295" url="?curid=192400" title="André Delvaux">
<text>André Albert Auguste Delvaux (; 21 March 1926 – 4 October 2002) was a Belgian film director. He co-founded the film school INSAS in 1962 and is regarded as the founder of the Belgian national cinema. Adapting works by writers such as Johan Daisne, Julien Gracq and Marguerite Yourcenar, he received international attention for directing magic realist films.

Delvaux received the Louis Delluc Prize for &quot;Rendezvous at Bray&quot; (1971) and the André Cavens Award for &quot;Woman Between Wolf and Dog&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1988). The king of Belgium made him a baron in 1996. The Académie André Delvaux is named after him and he posthumously received the first Honorary Magritte Award in 2011.

==Early life and education==
André Albert Auguste Delvaux was born in Heverlee, Belgium, on 21 March 1926. He studied piano at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels and worked as a silent film pianist at the Belgian cinématheque in his early 20s. He studied law and took a degree in German philology at the Free University of Brussels, after which he worked as a teacher.

==Filmmaking career==
Delvaux&#x27;s filmmaking career started in 1954 when he began to make television documentaries about film directors for the broadcaster RTB. Notably, he made a four-part series about Federico Fellini in 1960. In 1959 he co-directed a short fiction film with Jean Brismée, &quot;La Planète fauve&quot;. In 1962 he co-founded the film school INSAS in Brussels and became the director of its directing department. From that point cinema was his primary occupation.
Delvaux received international attention for his first feature film, &quot;The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short&quot; (1965), which is based on Johan Daisne&#x27;s novel with the same title. It was followed by another Daisne adaptation, &quot;One Night... A Train&quot;, in 1968. His first colour film, it shares several elements with the previous film: an uncomfortable teacher, a tragic ending and a confrontation between love and death. &quot;Rendezvous at Bray&quot; (1971), loosely based Julien Gracq&#x27;s novella &quot;King Cophetua&quot;, is set during World War I and places great emphasis on atmosphere. The film stars Mathieu Carrière, Roger Van Hool, Bulle Ogier and Anna Karina, and became a turning point in Delvaux&#x27;s career, because its critical success allowed him to choose his subjects more freely.

&quot;Belle&quot; (1973) is about an affair with a mistress who may or may not be imaginary. &quot;Woman Between Wolf and Dog&quot; (1979), set in German-occupied Flanders during World War II, is among Delvaux&#x27;s more realist films. It is about a woman who is torn between the Belgian Resistance and her collaborationist husband. The painterly &quot;Benvenuta&quot; (1983), based on Suzanne Lilar&#x27;s book &quot;La Confession anonyme&quot;, plays with reality and imagination through a story about a screenwriter who adapts a novel for film. Delvaux&#x27;s last feature film was his largest project, &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1988). The film is an episodic drama set in 16th-century Europe and based on a book by Marguerite Yourcenar. Like &quot;Belle&quot; and &quot;Woman Between Wolf and Dog&quot; before it, &quot;The Abyss&quot; played in the main competition of the Cannes Film Festival. Delvaux&#x27;s final short film, &quot;1001 films&quot;, was shown as a special screening at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival.

==Cinematic style==
From the release of &quot;The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short&quot;, Delvaux was associated with magic realism and known for his portrayals of dreams and reality. Aligning himself with a tradition that involved painters such as Hieronymus Bosch, René Magritte and Paul Delvaux, he proclaimed and expressed a &quot;belgitude&quot; connected to magic realism. Delvaux&#x27;s assertion of a distinctive Belgian identity, separate from French cinema, gave him status as the founder of the country&#x27;s national film industry. The visuals in some of his films have tendencies of surrealism, which is distinct from the deliberately constructed magic realism by being based on Freudian fetishism and automatism. In his application of these tendencies, Delvaux was closer to Magritte and Gracq than to André Breton or Luis Buñuel. Two important collaborators were the cinematographer Ghislain Cloquet, who worked on Delvaux&#x27;s first four feature films, and the composer Frédéric Devreese, who provided original music throughout his career.

==Personal life==
Delvaux died from a heart attack on 4 October 2002, while he was in Valencia to speak at the World Arts Meeting. His daughter Catherine Delvaux has been engaged in making his films available on home media.

<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Burnett &quot;Joe&quot; Lumsden (12 November 1821 – 12 August 1896) was a British military officer active in the British Raj.

==Biography==
===Background===
Lumsden was born aboard the East India Company&#x27;s ship &quot;Rose&quot; in the Bay of Bengal. He spent the first six years of his life in Bengal, where his father Colonel Thomas Lumsden was serving as an Artillery officer. His father Thomas entered the Bengal Army in 1808 and served in the Anglo-Nepalese War, Third Anglo-Maratha War and First Anglo-Burmese War achieving distinction. His first cousin once removed was the orientalist Matthew Lumsden. He had six brothers, three of whom emigrated to Canada, whilst his younger brother Peter followed his path to India.

He was sent to Scotland at age six, where he was cared for by his grandmother in Aberdeenshire.

===Early career===
At the age of 16, he was nominated by John Shepherd, a fellow Aberdeenshire man and a Director of the East India Company for a direct cadetship in India. He travelled to India in 1838 commissioned into the 59th Bengal Native Infantry. During the First Anglo-Afghan War he was appointed as interpreter and quartermaster to the 33rd Bengal Native Infantry, marching to Peshawar with the army of George Pollock. He was present at the forcing of the Khyber Pass in 1842. During the war he would become close friends with two fellow officers who would also achieve distinction John Nicholson and Neville Bowles Chamberlain.

Following the war he returned to base in Ferozepur, having earned a campaign medal and six months extra pay. In early 1843, he rejoined the 59th Bengal Native Infantry stationed in Ludhiana, indulging in his passion for shikar with hunting expeditions throughout the Punjab. During this time he explored the region, learning near perfect Punjabi and growing accustomed to local customs and traditions.

===The Punjab===
During the First Anglo-Sikh War, Lumsden served as a commander of a company in his regiment. At the Battle of Sobraon he was part of the storming division on Hugh Gough&#x27;s left flank. During the escape of the Sikh cavalry, Lumsden was shot in the foot which left him with a slight but permanent limp for the rest of his life.

At the conclusion of the war, Lumsden was hand-picked by Sir Henry Lawrence to become one of his assistants, a band of chosen men who would become known as Henry Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Young Men&quot;. A number of these assistants had been brought to Lawrence&#x27;s attention on the battlefield at Sobraon, including John Nicholson, William Hodson and Herbert Edwardes. Lawrence had been a friend of Thomas Lumsden, serving with him as an artillery officers earlier in his career. Lumsden later claimed that what first brought him to the attention of Lawrence was an incident a year or two previously, when he and a subaltern had been held prisoner by a gang of robbers following a shooting expedition on the banks of the Sutlej. A servant smuggled them a pencil and paper allowing them to call for help; help coming in the form of a cavalry led by Lawrence that same evening.

Lumsden&#x27;s first posting was to Kangra in 1846, where he served out the summer. He was thereafter summoned to Lahore. Whilst in Lahore, he became privy to the politics of the Lahore Durbar, at the time dominated by the Maharani Jind Kaur and her lover Lal Singh. Noting how everyone of the Sirdars made no secret of their dislike for Lal Singh, he concluded that they were anxiously awaiting the time when the British would withdraw, and Lal Singh would consolidate power. In response to the political instability, like many fellow offers, but in contrast to his superior, Lawrence, Lumsden favoured the annexation of the Punjab.

The sale of Kashmir to Gulab Singh had created considerable unrest amongst Kashmiri locals. In late 1846, Lumsden accompanied an expedition led by Lawrence to dispose the incumbent governor Imam ud-Din, who had the backing of Lal Singh and support the new rule of Gulab Singh. On his return to Lahore, Lumsden was given a mission to command a force of Sikh infantry to reconnoitre the hills of Hazara. Despite initial concerns of leading men he had formerly seen as the enemy, and noting their fondness for opium, he would remark of his Sikh sepoys that &quot;they were first rate men, ready for any work, always in the best of humours, fond of their officers, and just as obedient to orders as our own troops, and not giving one quarter the trouble as the latter do.&quot; Lumsden&#x27;s mission was a success and he received the thanks of the government, and what he prized more, the approbation of Lawrence.

===Corps of Guides===
In 1847, Lumsden was nominated to raise a Corps of Guides, enthusiastically regarding it as the finest appointment in the country. Lawrence intended the corps as &#x27;trustworthy men who could at a moment&#x27;s notice act as guides to troops in the field, collect intelligence beyond as well as within the border.&#x27; At the same time he was to carry on his duties in the Punjab, and assist John Lawrence, brother of Henry, in Peshawar.

With his subaltern William Hodson, he pioneered the use of a drab-coloured uniform for field service that came to known as khaki. Lord Napier subsequently referred to the Guides as &quot;the only properly dressed light troops in India&quot;. To enhance the regiment&#x27;s prestige, Lumsden adopted selective recruitment, initially recruiting mainly from the local Pathan tribes of the Yusufzai, Khatak and Muhammadzai. So successful was the Corps that within months of its formation, there was a waiting list for enlistment. Lumsden would build up his force into what became the most famous unit of the British Indian Army, inspiring a degree of devotion bordering on idolatry.

In 1848, whilst Lawrence was on leave in Britain, Lumsden and his Guides were summoned to Lahore. They were tasked to unravel a conspiracy believed to have been organised by the Sikhs to sow discontent amongst certain members of the Bengal Native Infantry and Irregular Cavalry stationed in Lahore. Lumsden with the aid of Muhammad Pir Buksh succeeded in obtaining papers proving the conspiracy and linking it with Maharani Jind Kaur, who he was then charged with escorting from Sheikhupura to Ferozepur.

Later that year, the Second Anglo-Sikh War broke out. Lumsden was sent to support Herbert Edwardes in the Siege of Multan, where his Guides would go on to achieve considerable distinction. He would later assist General Hugh Wheeler in operations at the heights of Dullah and see action at the Battle of Gujrat. Following the war, he noted his disappointment that all of Lawrence&#x27;s assistants, despite their achievements in service, were being overlooked for key political postings at the expense of more junior civilians. Nonetheless he was rewarded by Lawrence with a pay rise, the chance to remain in Peshawar and at the head of his beloved Guides, whose strength was now raised to four hundred horse and six hundred foot.

Lumsden initially based his regimental headquarters in a ruin outside of Peshawar, known as the Burj, which had been built in the seventeenth century by a wazir of the Mughal Empire. In 1851, Lumsden relocated the headquarters to Mardan and the Guides became part of the Punjab Irregular Force.

===North West Frontier===
In the years after the annexation of the Punjab, Lumsden was largely concerned with affairs of the border tribes. In 1849, he assisted in an expedition against the Baizai, who had been refusing to pay tribute to the British. The next year, he replaced John Lawrence as the political agent in Peshawar whilst Lawrence recuperated from fever in Shimla. Later that year he was part of a force moving against Afridi tribesmen who had attacked engineers building a road through the Kohat Pass killing twelve and wounding eight. Lumsden had favoured friendly relations with the hill tribes, especially the Afridis, as he feared military occupation would be prohibitively costly in terms of lives and treasure and his views were cordially endorsed by the new military commander in Peshawar, Sir Colin Campbell. Their views however gave way to the orders of the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, who demanded an iron handed response.

Throughout the summer of 1851, Mohmand tribesmen harassed the borders of British control. Lord Dalhousie advised that punishment should be as severe as was consistent with humanity, however such retaliation was opposed by both Lumsden and Campbell. They were able to convince Dalhousie to attempt measures of prevention rather than retaliation, however as the skirmishes continued, Dalhousie grew more incensed, and ordered military intervention. Campbell launched an expedition with Lumsden at his side, noting that &quot;Lumsden&#x27;s views, those of common sense, are the most prudent and best...Punish those of the leading men who have shown emnity or have done injury to those who are bound to protect but leave the cultivators of the soil upon the land unmolested&quot;. As operations became drawn out, criticism grew. On 5 January 1852, Dalhousie sacked Lumsden as Commissioner in Peshawar replacing him with Frederick Mackeson.

===Later life===
In 1852, Lumsden departed Peshawar and took leave in Britain after fifteen years continuous service in India. On 1 March 1853 he was promoted to captain and on 6 February 1854 was made a brevet Major for services in the last Sikh war. He returned to India in 1855 and resumed command of the Guides.

In 1857 he was sent on a mission to Kandahar with his younger brother Peter and Henry Bellew to assess the current military and political situation in Afghanistan. In May 1857, the Indian Mutiny broke out, causing Lumsden to fear for his safety six hundred miles from the nearest British post in Jacobabad and dependent entirely on the caprice of the Amir. Lumsden, relying on regular updates from Herbert Edwardes in Peshawar, requested permission to return to India, but his service in Afghanistan was deemed vital in the interests of the Empire by the Governor General. On 1 September 1857 he received news from his friend John Nicholson that his younger brother William had been killed in Delhi, whilst later that month he was informed Nicholson himself had been killed. On 15 May 1858, Lumsden was instructed to return to India. He was gazetted lieutenant-colonel and resumed life with the Guides. His services were recognised by John Lawrence who remarked of him:
In 1860 he served under his friend Neville Bowles Chamberlain in the Waziri Expedition. On 2 August 1860, whilst attending a regimental ball practice an assassin grabbed his sword and struck his arm. The assassin was subsequently apprehended by a Guide. In 1862, he was offered and accepted the command of the Nizam of Hyderabad&#x27;s army in the Deccan. He pithily summarised his service in the Deccan saying, &quot;ffound the Hyderabad Contingent in debt, and left it clear.&quot;

In 1866, whilst on leave in Britain he married Fanny Myers of Cumberland. He returned to India in November the same year, and resided in Rawalpindi with his wife. In 1869 his commission in Hyderabad expired and with no immediate prospects available in India, he resolved to return to England on leave. Before returning, he rested some months in the Deccan on account of his wife&#x27;s health. In the spring of 1869, on the invitation of Lord Mayo he travelled to Ambala for the Durbar of Sher Ali Khan, affording him the change to re-acquaint with old friends and comrades.

Lumsden left India with his wife on 12 April 1869, never to return. On the death of his father in 1874 he inherited the family estate in Belhelvie and made it their permanent home. He was made a Knight Commander of the Star of India in 1873 and retired in 1875 with the honorary rank of Lieutenant-General. He died on 12 August 1896 in Belhevlie following a short illness and was buried in the local church graveyard.

<doc id="192402" wikidata="Q1030402" url="?curid=192402" title="John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel">
<text>The John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, or Campbell Memorial Award, was an annual award presented to the author of the best science fiction novel published in English in the preceding calendar year. It was given by several organizations from 1973 to 1979 and then by the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas until 2019. It was the novel counterpart of the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short story, awarded at the same conference by the Theodore Sturgeon Literary Trust. The award was named in honor of John W. Campbell (1910–1971), whose science fiction writing and role as editor of &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot; made him one of the most influential editors in the early history of science fiction. The award was established in 1973 by writers and critics Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss &quot;as a way of continuing his efforts to encourage writers to produce their best possible work.&quot; &quot;Locus&quot; magazine listed it as one of the &quot;major awards&quot; of written science fiction.

The winning novel was selected by a panel of science fiction experts, intended to be &quot;small enough to discuss among its members all of the nominated novels&quot;. Among members of the panel have been Gregory Benford, Paul A. Carter, James Gunn, Elizabeth Anne Hull, Christopher McKitterick, Farah Mendlesohn, Pamela Sargent, and Tom Shippey. In 2008 Mendlesohn was replaced with Paul Kincaid, in 2009 Carter left the panel while Paul Di Filippo and Sheila Finch joined, and Lisa Yaszek replaced Di Filippo in 2016. Nominations were submitted by publishers and jurors, and collated by the panel into a list of finalists to be voted on. The minimum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner was selected by May of each year, and was for a number of years presented during the Campbell Conference awards banquet in Lawrence as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Sturgeon Award. The award was given at this conference since 1979; prior to then it was awarded at various locations around the world, starting at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. Winners were invited to attend the ceremony. James Gunn had maintained a trophy which records all of the winners on engraved plaques affixed to the sides, and since 2004 winners received a smaller personalized trophy as well. In 2019, McKitterick (the award&#x27;s chair) announced plans to rename both the conference and the award. Both the conference and the award were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Center for the Study of Science Fiction itself was taken over by the English department of the University of Kansas in 2022, which subsequently ended the conference and award.

During the 47 years the award was active, 183 authors had works nominated; 47 of these authors won. In two years, 1976 and 1994, the panel selected none of the nominees as a winner, while in 1974, 2002, 2009, and 2012 the panel selected two winners rather than one. Frederik Pohl and Joan Slonczewski each won twice, the only authors to do so, out of four and two nominations, respectively. Kim Stanley Robinson and Paul J. McAuley won once out of seven nominations, and Jack McDevitt, Ian McDonald, Adam Roberts, and Robert J. Sawyer won once out of five nominations, while Nancy Kress, Bruce Sterling, and Robert Charles Wilson won once out of four nominations. Greg Bear had the most nominations without winning at nine, followed by Sheri S. Tepper at six, James K. Morrow at five, and William Gibson, Ken MacLeod, Charles Stross, and Peter Watts at four.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist. Entries with a gray background and a plus sign (+) indicate a year where no novel was selected as the winner.

<text>The Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen University of Applied Sciences (German: &quot;Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen&quot;, or THM) is a German Fachhochschule for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s studies in the cities of Giessen, Friedberg, and Wetzlar.

==History==
===Giessen===
The University of Applied Sciences of Central Hesse (Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (THM)) traces back to Giessen. On the 14 January 1838 by the National Trade Association Darmstadt, Giessen &quot;school for technical drawing&quot; was founded (&quot;Schule für technisches Zeichnen&quot;). This led to the founding of this school were widespread complaints that artisans could not read and understand the plans of the architects were fostered. Just four weeks into Darmstadt in December 1837 the trade school was founded, the predecessor of today&#x27;s TU Darmstadt (Technische Universität Darmstadt). Thus, the THM is only a month younger than the TU Darmstadt and thus the second oldest higher technical educational institution in the German state of Hesse.

In Giessen also in 1838, another &quot;trade school&quot; was founded. In 1840 followed the establishment of the &quot;trade association casting&quot;. Whose members included the professors Justus von Liebig and Hugo von Ritgen. The trade school in 1842 expanded into a &quot;computational School for Craftsmen&quot;. In 1846 the school for technical drawing formed together to create the &quot;trade school&quot; (Handwerkerschule).

==The University today==
In the winter semester of 1986/87 the computer science program was first made available. At the same time the &quot;mathematics, science and data processing&quot; was divided into the subject areas &quot;of mathematics, science and computer science&quot; (Giessen) and &quot;mathematics, science and data processing&quot; (Friedberg).

The ZeVA-accredited master&#x27;s program &quot;International Marketing&quot; means that THM is one of the first economics marketing graduate courses in Germany to be taught in English.

Increasingly, the THM is becoming more and more active with its degree programs, continuing to strive into various academic fields. To intensify the work founded the university 2007, the &quot;University Centre for Continuing Education - HZW&quot; and taught in the Old Mountain Monastery in Solms-Oberbiel an educational center, a system which is installed at the Giessen campus in 2011.

The so called &quot;Forschungscampus Mittelhessen&quot; is a lose cooperation of Justus-Liebig-University Gießen, Philipps-University Marburg und der TH Mittelhessen.

<text>Colorado Mountain College (CMC) is a public community college with multiple campuses in western Colorado, and headquartered in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Founded in 1965, the institution offers numerous associate degrees, eight bachelor&#x27;s degrees and a variety of career-technical certificates. Approximately 14,000 students take on-campus or online classes every year.

The CMC district includes six counties in the heart of the Colorado Rocky Mountains: Eagle, Grand, Jackson, Lake, Garfield, Pitkin, Summit, and Routt. The state-designated service area includes: Grand, Jackson, and Chaffee.

Besides eight community campuses, three full-service residential campuses in Leadville, Steamboat Springs, and Spring Valley at Glenwood Springs, provide students with residence halls, cafeterias, recreation facilities, and libraries. Students also have the opportunity to participate in different recreational and educational activities through student clubs, honor societies, a theatre company, and sports teams.

== History ==

On November 2, 1965, voters of five Colorado counties approved the formation of a college district including the Eagle, Garfield, Routt, Lake, Summit and Pitkin counties. The junior college plan was unanimously approved by the State Board of Education and the name &quot;Colorado Mountain College&quot;, suggested by the governing committee member, Harold Koonce, was immediately adopted.

The residential campuses of Leadville and Spring Valley at Glenwood Springs were the first ones built, and the first classes started in the fall of 1967, with Dr. Joe Davenport as the first president of the institution, and an in-district tuition of $6.75 per credit hour. Davenport died shortly after the opening of the two campuses, crashing his single-engine plane while attempting to land in Glenwood Springs.

The first 22 programs offered were Astrogeophysical Technology, Automobile Mechanics, Building Trades, Civil Technology, Commercial Photography, Data Processing, Drafting-Design Technology, Electrical-Electronics Technology, Metals Technology, Industrial Management, Farm and Ranch Management, Food Service Technology, Home Economics, Landscape Technology, Mining Technology, Office Management, Photographic Technology, Recreation Supervision, Resort Management and Secretarial Science.

In 1972, Summit County offered its first courses, followed by expansions in Rifle, Salida and Buena Vista. In 1974, the college received full accreditation by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges.

The Isaacson School for Communication, Arts &amp; Media, opened in 2012 with classes at the Spring Valley campus. That same year, a three-story $18 million Academic Center was opened at CMC Steamboat Springs.

In November 2019, the Salida and Poncha Springs communities voted to join the Colorado Mountain College special taxing district, while simultaneously the existing CMC district also voted to have them join, creating the newest CMC location.

The federal government designated Colorado Mountain College as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) in 2021 after reaching enrollment of 25% or more Latino students.

== Community campuses ==

<doc id="192410" wikidata="Q280943" url="?curid=192410" title="Deprecation">
<text>Deprecation is the discouragement of use of something human-made, such as a term, feature, design, or practice. Typically something is deprecated because it is claimed to be inferior compared to other options available. 

Something may be deprecated when it cannot be controlled, such as a term. Even when it can be controlled, something may be deprecated even when it might be useful for example, to ensure compatibility and it may be removed or discontinued at some time after being deprecated.

==Etymology==
In general English usage, the verb &quot;to &quot; means &quot;to express disapproval of (something)&quot;. It derives from the Latin deponent verb &quot;deprecari&quot;, meaning &quot;to ward off (a disaster) by prayer&quot;.

An early documented usage of &quot;deprecate&quot; in this sense is in Usenet posts in 1984, referring to obsolete features in 4.2BSD and the C programming language. An expanded definition of &quot;deprecate&quot; was cited in the Jargon File in its 1991 revision, and similar definitions are found in commercial software documentation from 2014 and 2023.

==Software==
While a deprecated software feature remains in the software, its use may raise warning messages recommending alternative practices. Deprecated status may also indicate the feature will be removed in the future. Features are deprecated, rather than immediately removed, to provide backward compatibility and to give programmers time to bring affected code into compliance with the new standard.

Notable reasons for deprecation include:

==Other usage==
A building code example is the use of ungrounded (&quot;2-prong&quot;) electrical receptacles (UK English: &quot;unearthed&quot;). Over time, these older devices were widely deprecated in favor of safer grounded (&quot;3-prong&quot;) receptacles. The older, ungrounded receptacles were still permitted in many places by &quot;grandfathering&quot; them in existing electrical wiring, while prohibiting them for new installations. Thus, though ungrounded receptacles may still be available for legal purchase in a location where they are obsolete, they would generally be intended only for repairs to existing older electrical installations.

In writing and editing, usage of a word may be deprecated because it is ambiguous, confusing, or offensive to some readers. For example, the words &quot;sanction&quot; and &quot;inflammable&quot; may be misinterpreted because they have auto-antonymic or self-contradictory meanings; writing style guides often recommend substituting other words that are clearly understood and unambiguous. Some word usages that have acquired different connotations over time, such as &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;colored&quot;, may be deprecated as obsolete in formal writing.

In technical standards, use of a certain clause may be discouraged or superseded by new clauses. As an example, in the Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3-2012, Clause 5 (Layer Management) is &quot;deprecated&quot; by Clause 30 (Management), except for 5.2.4.

Deprecation may also occur when a technical term becomes obsolete, either through change or supersession. An example from paleontology is the previously deprecated term &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;: before being recognized once again as a unique genus, it was considered a popular, yet deprecated, name for the genus &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. Some deprecated terms in medicine are &quot;consumption&quot; (tuberculosis), &quot;grippe&quot; (influenza), and &quot;apoplexy&quot; (stroke). In chemical nomenclature, the international standards organization IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) has deprecated the term &quot;methyl ethyl ketone&quot;, and now recommends using the term &quot;ethyl methyl ketone&quot; instead.

<text>Antonio de Ulloa y de la Torre-Guiral (12 January 1716 – 3 July 1795) was a Spanish Navy officer. He spent much of his career in the Americas, where he carried out important scientific work. He also served the Spanish Empire as an administrator in the Viceroyalty of Peru and in Spanish Louisiana.

At the age of nineteen, Ulloa joined the French Geodesic Mission to the Equator, which established that the shape of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, flattened at the poles, as predicted by Isaac Newton. The mission took more than eight years to complete its work, during which time Ulloa, in close collaboration with his fellow naval officer Jorge Juan, made many astronomical, natural, and social observations in South America. Ulloa and Juan also helped to organize the defense of the Peruvian coast against the English squadron of Commodore Anson, after the outbreak of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1739.

The reports of Ulloa&#x27;s scientific findings during his time in South America earned him an international reputation. Notably, Ulloa published the first detailed observations of the metal platinum, later identified as a new chemical element. Ulloa returned to Europe in 1745. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1746, and as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1751.

From 1758 to 1764, Ulloa served as governor of Huancavelica, in Peru, and as superintendent of the mercury mines of the region. There he fought unsuccessfully against the corruption of the local administration. Following the Seven Years&#x27; War, Ulloa became the first governor of Spanish Louisiana in 1766. His rule was strongly resisted by the French Creoles of New Orleans, who expelled him from the city during the Rebellion of 1768. Ulloa continued to serve in the Spanish Navy, achieving the rank of vice admiral and becoming its chief of operations.

==Life==

=== Family background and education ===

Antonio de Ulloa was born in Seville, Spain, into a socially prominent and intellectually distinguished family. His father, Bernardo de Ulloa y Sousa, was noted for his writings on economics. His brother Fernando would become an engineer and the chief of works of the &quot;Canal de Castilla&quot;. Another brother, Martín, became a jurist, historian, and member of the Royal Spanish Academy.

Destined for a naval career, at the age of thirteen Antonio embarked in Cádiz on the galleon &quot;San Luis&quot;, bound for the port of Cartagena de Indias (in present-day Colombia). After returning to Cádiz, Antonio entered the &quot;Real Compañía de Guardias Marinas&quot; (the Spanish Naval Academy) in 1733.

=== South American expedition ===

At that time the French Academy of Sciences was organizing a major scientific expedition to Quito, in present-day Ecuador, in order to measure the length of a degree of meridian arc (i.e., latitude) at the equator. This was part of an effort to determine in the precise figure of the Earth in order to settle the scientific debate between the defenders of René Descartes&#x27;s physics and those who advocated the newer Newtonian mechanics. In 1735, Ulloa and another young naval officer, Jorge Juan, were appointed by the Spanish Crown to accompany the French Geodesic Mission to Quito. This was a sensitive assignment, both politically and scientifically.

The early work of the French Geodesic Mission, led by Charles Marie de La Condamine, was delayed and hindered by lack of cooperation from the local Spanish authorities. Indeed, in 1737 a personal dispute between Ulloa and the president of the &quot;Real Audiencia de Quito&quot;, Joseph de Araujo y Río, reached such a pitch that Araujo ordered the arrest of Ulloa and Juan, announcing his intention to have them killed. Juan and Ulloa took refuge in a church and Ulloa then escaped through the cordon of Araujo&#x27;s men, reaching Lima and obtaining the protection of the Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Villagarcía. When war between Spain and Great Britain broke out in 1739, Juan and Ulloa, as naval officers, actively participated in the defense of Peru.

Ulloa traveled throughout the territories of the Viceroyalty of Peru from 1736 to 1744, making many astronomic, natural, and social observations. In one of his reports he described, for the first time in the European scientific literature, some of the properties of a metal that he called &quot;platina&quot; (&quot;little silver&quot;) and which he encountered during his inspection the gold panning operations in the Chocó region of what is now Colombia. This metal would later be identified as a new chemical element, now known as platinum. Ulloa is therefore often credited as the discoverer of platinum.

Both Ulloa and another member of the French Geodesic Mission, Pierre Bouguer, reported that while walking near the summit of Mount Pambamarca they saw their shadows projected on a lower-lying cloud, with a circular &quot;halo or glory&quot; around the shadow of the observer&#x27;s head. Ulloa noted that

This has been called &quot;Ulloa&#x27;s halo&quot; or &quot;Bouguer&#x27;s halo&quot;. It is similar to the phenomenon that later came be known as the &quot;Brocken spectre&quot; after the Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz mountains in central Germany. Ulloa reported that the glories were surrounded by a larger ring of white light, which would today be called a fog bow. On other occasions, he observed arches of white light formed by reflected moonlight, whose explanation is unknown but which may have been related to ice-crystal halos.

The final results of French Geodesic Mission, published by La Condamine in 1745, combined with the measurements of meridian arc near the Arctic Circle that had been published in 1738 by Pierre Louis Maupertuis following the French Geodesic Mission to Lapland, decisively vindicated the predictions first made by Isaac Newton in Book III of his &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; of 1687. These results greatly contributed to the triumph of Newtonianism over Cartesianism among Continental European savants. The determination of the precise figure of the Earth was also regarded as being of practical importance for navigation.

=== Return to Spain ===

In 1745, having finished their scientific labours, Ulloa and Jorge Juan prepared to return to Spain, agreeing to travel on different ships in order to minimize the danger of losing their important samples and records. The ship upon which Ulloa was travelling was captured by the British Royal Navy, and he was taken to England as a prisoner of war. There, he was soon befriended by leading British scientists, and was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in December 1746. Thanks in part to the intervention of Martin Folkes, the president of the Royal Society, Ulloa was released from British custody and allowed to return to Spain.

In 1749, Ulloa published his &quot;Relación histórica del viaje a la América Meridional&quot; (Madrid, 1748), which contains a full, accurate, and clear description of the greater part of South America geographically, and of its inhabitants and natural history. It was translated into English and published in 1758 as &quot;A Voyage to South America&quot; (1758).

Shortly after their return to Spain, Juan and Ulloa penned a confidential report to their political patron, the Marquess of Ensenada, on the state of the defenses and administration of the Spanish domains in South America. The document is highly critical of the corruption of both the civil authorities and the Catholic clergy, including their exploitation of the Native American population. That report remained unpublished during the lifetimes of its authors. It only became public in 1826, after the independence of South America from Spain, when it was published in London by an Englishman named David Barry, who had himself returned disillusioned from the newly independent Spanish America.

Ulloa gained an international scientific reputation and was appointed to serve on various important scientific commissions. With Jorge Juan, he is credited with the establishment of the first museum of natural history, the first metallurgical laboratory in Spain, and the astronomical observatory of Cádiz. In 1751, Ulloa was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1757 King Ferdinand VI appointed Ulloa as Commander of Ocaña (&quot;Comendador de Ocaña&quot;) in the Order of Santiago.

=== Imperial administrator ===
Ulloa returned to South America in 1758 as governor of Huancavelica, in Peru, and general manager of the mercury mines in the region. At the time, mercury was of great practical importance because of its use in the extraction of silver and gold (see pan amalgamation). Ulloa fought unsuccessfully against the deep-rooted corruption in the local administration and finally requested to be relieved of his post in 1764.

Following Britain&#x27;s victory of the French and Spanish in the Seven Years&#x27; War, France agreed in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau to cede to Spain its colony of Louisiana. The Spanish Crown then appointed Ulloa as the first governor of Spanish Louisiana. Ulloa reached New Orleans, the major city and port of the region, on 5 March 1766. The French Creole colonists refused to recognize Spanish rule, leading to the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768. On 28 October, as riots broke out in New Orleans, the governor and his pregnant wife were taken to a Spanish vessel. The Superior Council voted that the governor leave within three days. He complied, departing on 1 November. The revolt was ultimately crushed in 1769 by forces under the command of the new Spanish governor, Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly, who succeeded in establishing definitively the control of the region by the Spanish Crown.

In 1768, while serving in New Orleans as governor of Spanish Louisiana, Ulloa married a woman from the high society of Lima, Francisca Melchora Rosa Remírez de Laredo y Encalada, daughter of the Count of San Javier y Casa Laredo. The couple had six children, among them Francisco Javier de Ulloa who became the Spanish Minister of Marine and the 22nd Captain general of the Navy.

After 1776, Ulloa enjoyed the political support of José de Gálvez, the new Minister of the Indies. Between 1776 and 1778, in the context of the Spanish support for the rebellion in North America against British rule, Ulloa helped organize a war fleet in New Spain (present-day Mexico). He also advised the Viceroy Antonio María de Bucareli on the proposed construction of a military shipyard in the Atlantic port of Veracruz.

=== Later years ===
In 1778, Ulloa commanded the last great treasure fleet that sailed between Cádiz and Veracruz. During the return voyage, he observed the total solar eclipse of 1778, a subject on which he corresponded with the French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. Ulloa later published his observations of the eclipse in a book printed in Madrid and, in abbreviated form, in an article in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;. In 1779, King Charles III promoted Ulloa to &quot;teniente general de la Armada&quot; (&quot;lieutenant general of the Navy&quot;, equivalent to the modern rank of vice admiral).

As part of the Spanish campaign against Great Britain during the American Revolution, Ulloa was commanded to sail to the Azores, where he was to protect Spanish vessels and attack British merchant ships passing through the area. Ulloa&#x27;s fleet met with little success in that mission and he left for Spain ten days earlier than instructed, due to lack to supplies and the poor condition of some of his ships. After Ulloa arrived in Cádiz in October of 1779, he was ordered to help prevent the British navy from relieving the British garrison during the Siege of Gibraltar. After judging that the ships under his command could not endure the prevailing weather conditions, he asked to be relieved of responsibility for that mission.

The previous events in the Azores led to formal charges of dereliction of duty against Ulloa and two captains under his command, Pedro de Leyba and Manuel Núñez Gaona. The drawn-out proceedings ended with their definitive acquittal by the &quot;Consejo Supremo de Guerra&quot; (the supreme court of military justice for the Spanish Empire, presided by King Charles III) in February of 1782. Ulloa was later appointed as chief of operations of the Navy, a position that he occupied until his death in 1795.

== Legacy ==
As a scientist, Ulloa is remembered principally for his role in the determination of the figure of the Earth and for his pioneering reports on platinum. Some historians of science consider him as the first discoverer or platinum, even though Ulloa himself did not identify the metal as a new chemical element. He is also credited with for his reports of &quot;Ulloa&#x27;s halo&quot; and other related optical and meteorological phenomena.

The confidential report to the Marquess of Ensenada, signed jointly by Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa and written around 1746, remained unknown to the public until it was published in London in 1826 by an Englishman named David Barry, under the title &quot;Noticias secretas de América&quot; (&quot;Secret News from America&quot;). Barry had spent some time in the newly independent Spanish America seeking opportunities for investment, only to become thoroughly disillusioned about the prospects for the region. The &quot;Noticias secretas&quot; paints a dire picture of the state of the administration of the Spanish dominions in America in the 1730s and 1740s, alleging many instances of official corruption and mismanagement by both the civil and the ecclesiastical authorities, and denouncing the exploitation of the Native American population by unscrupulous governors and priests. As such, it has caused enduring controversy among historians of Spanish America.

<doc id="192413" wikidata="Q371520" url="?curid=192413" title="Polydactyly">
<text>Polydactyly is a birth defect that results in extra fingers or toes. The hands are more commonly involved than the feet. Extra fingers may be painful, affect self-esteem, or result in clumsiness.
It is associated with at least 39 genetic mutations. It may either present alone or with other defects. Cases may run in families. The underlying mechanism involves an error in limb bud formation during early development. Diagnosis may occur before birth via prenatal ultrasound as early as nine weeks. Xrays may be useful after a child is a year old. The opposite is oligodactyly (fewer fingers or toes).
Treatment varies from removal by cautery to more involved surgery. While putting a tight band around the base has been carried out, this is not typically recommended. If surgery is required, this is often done around two years of age. Occasionally multiple surgeries are required.
Polydactyly is present in about 4 to 12 per 10,000 newborns. It is the most common defect of the hands and feet. In the United States, Black people are more commonly affected than white people. The term is from .
==Signs and symptoms==
In humans/animals this condition can present itself on one or both hands or feet. The extra digit is usually a small piece of soft tissue that can be removed. Occasionally it contains bone without joints; rarely it may be a complete functioning digit. The extra digit is most common on the ulnar (little finger) side of the hand, less common on the radial (thumb) side, and very rarely within the middle three digits. These are respectively known as postaxial (little finger), preaxial (thumb), and central (ring, middle, index fingers) polydactyly. The extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit, or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does.
Polydactyly can be divided into three major types, which are discussed below, which depend on the location of the additional digit.

In 2019 it was found that in cases of polydactyly with a fully functional additional digit, muscles to control the extra digit may be duplicated, resulting in increased motor control that allows the patient to carry out certain tasks with one hand that would normally require two.

===Ulnar or postaxial===

This is the most common situation, in which the extra digit is on the ulnar side of the hand, thus the side of the little finger. This can also be called postaxial polydactyly. It can manifest itself very subtly, for instance only as a nubbin on the ulnar side of the little finger, or very distinctly, as a fully developed finger. Most commonly, the extra finger is rudimentary, consisting of an end phalanx with a nail, and connected to the hand with a small skin pedicle. Mostly one neurovascular bundle can be identified, with no tendons present in the extra digit. In case of a fully developed extra finger, the duplication usually presents itself at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint. A triplication of the little finger is very rare. Ulnar polydactyly occurs ten times more often in African populations. The incidence in Caucasians is reported as 1 in 1,339 live births, compared with 1 in 143 live births in Africans. Ulnar polydactyly is also often part of a syndrome. In patients with African ancestry ulnar polydactyly mostly occurs isolated, whereas the presentation in Caucasians is often associated with a syndrome, though in a retrospective review, only 4 of 37 cases of ulnar polydactyly in Caucasians were syndromic.

===Radial or preaxial===

This is a less common situation, in which the affectation is on the side of the hand towards the thumb. Radial polydactyly refers to the presence of an extra digit (or extra digits) on the radial side of the hand. It is most frequent in Indian populations and it is the second most common congenital hand disorder. The incidence of radial polydactyly is reported as 1 in every 3,000 live births. The clinical features of radial polydactyly will depend upon the extent of duplication.
Radial polydactyly varies from a barely visible radial skin tag to complete duplication. Thumb polydactyly varies from barely visible broadening of the distal phalanx to full duplication of the thumb including the first metacarpal.
Radial polydactyly is frequently associated with several syndromes.

===Central===
This is a rare condition, in which the extra digit is on the ring, middle or index finger. Of these fingers, the index finger is most often affected, whereas the ring finger is rarely affected.
This type of polydactyly can be associated with syndactyly, cleft hand, and several other syndromes.
Polysyndactyly presents various degrees of syndactyly affecting fingers three and four.

==Causes==

Polydactyly is associated with different mutations, either mutations in a gene itself or in a cis-regulatory element responsible for the expression of a specific gene. Mutations in Hoxa- or Hoxd clusters are reported leading to polydactyly. Interactions of Hoxd13 and GLI3 induce synpolydactyly, a combination of extra and consolidated digits. Other signal transduction pathways in this context are the Wnt signaling pathway or Notch.

In the specific case of preaxial polydactyly (Hemingway mutant), a cis-acting mutation approximately 1Mb upstream of SHH gene has been implicated. Normally SHH is expressed in an organiser region, called the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) on the posterior limb side. From there it diffuses anteriorly, laterally to the growth direction of the limb. In the mutant, smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the anterior side of the limb. This ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits.

Polydactyly can occur by itself, or more commonly, as one feature of a syndrome of congenital anomalies. When it occurs by itself, it is associated with autosomal dominant mutations in single genes, i.e. it is not a multifactorial trait. But mutation in a variety of genes can give rise to polydactyly. Typically the mutated gene is involved in developmental patterning, and a syndrome of congenital anomalies results, of which polydactyly is one feature or two.

Polydactyly has been linked to the prenatal environment in a 2020 study showing a relationship to maternal PM10 pollution exposure in China.

Types include:

===Syndromes===
Because polydactyly can be part of a syndrome (known genetic defect) or association (genetic defect not known), children with a congenital upper extremity deformity should be examined by a geneticist for other congenital anomalies. This should also be done if a syndrome is suspected, or if more than two or three generations of the family are affected.

As of 2009, 97 genetic syndromes have been associated with different kinds of polydactyly.

Examples of syndromes include Diamond–Blackfan anemia, and the VACTERL association, acrocallosal syndrome, basal cell nevus syndrome, Biemond syndrome, ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasias-cleft lip/palate syndrome, mirror hand deformity, Mohr syndrome, oral-facial-digital syndrome, Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome, short rib polydactyly.

===Ulnar===
Ulnar polydactyly is often bilateral and associated with syndactyly and polydactyly of the feet. This can be a simple or complex polydactyly. Ulnar polydactyly occurs as an isolated congenital condition, but can also be part of a syndrome, such as: Trisomy 13, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Ellis–van Creveld syndrome, McKusick–Kaufman syndrome, Down syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome.

===Radial===
Type VII of radial polydactyly is associated with several syndromes:
Holt–Oram syndrome, Fanconi anemia (aplastic anemia by the age of 6), Townes–Brocks syndrome, and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly (also known to occur with ulnar polydactyly).

===Central===
The syndromes associated with central polydactyly are:
Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Pallister–Hall syndrome, Legius syndrome, Holt–Oram syndrome. Central polydactyly can also be associated with syndactyly and cleft hand.

===Evolution===
From an evo-devo point of view, polydactyly is a phenotypic variation or innovation, as the fingers and toes arise in places where nothing is phenotypically present in the wild type. Although it is initiated by a point mutation, it occurs as a polyphenism with different numbers of toes. The analysis of the additional toe numbers of Maine Coon cats revealed that the number of toes follows a developmental bias: 2 additional toes occur much more frequently than 4, these more frequently than 6 or 8 additional ones. Also, for the evo-devo theory, polydactyly cannot be adequately explained by genetic mutation alone, but only by constructive development, i.e. the ability of development to produce a complex phenotypic output. The corresponding symbolic generation of toes can now be shown in computer models.

==Diagnosis==
Classification is performed by using x-ray imaging to see the bone structures. In 1961, Frantz and O’Rahilly proposed that congenital anomalies of the limb could be classified in seven categories, based on the embryonic failure causing the clinical presentation. These categories are failure of formation of parts, failure of differentiation, duplication, overgrowth, undergrowth, congenital constriction band syndrome, and generalized skeletal abnormalities. In 1976 this was modified by Swanson. Polydactyly belongs to the category of duplication. As of 2009, research has shown that the majority of congenital anomalies occur during the 4-week embryologic period of rapid limb development. 

===Ulnar===
The classification of ulnar polydactyly exists of either two or three types. The two-stage classification, according to Temtamy and McKusick, involves type A and B. In type A there is an extra little finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint, or more proximal including the carpometacarpal joint. The little finger can be hypoplastic or fully developed. Type B varies from a nubbin to an extra, non-functional little finger part on a pedicle. According to the three-type classification, type I includes nubbins or floating little fingers, type II includes duplications at the MCPJ, and type III includes duplications of the entire ray.

===Radial===
The Wassel classification is the most widely used classification of radial polydactyly, based upon the most proximal level of skeletal duplication. The most common type is Wassel 4 (about 50% of such duplications) followed by Wassel 2 (20%) and Wassel 6 (12%).

===Central===
The classification of central polydactyly is based on the extent of duplication and involves the following three types:
Type I is a central duplication, not attached to the adjacent finger by osseous or ligamentous attachments; it frequently does not include bones, joints, cartilage, or tendons.
Type IIA is a nonsyndactylous duplication of a digit or part of a digit with normal components, and articulates with a broad or bifid metacarpal or phalanx.
Type IIB is a syndactylous duplication of a digit or part of a digit with normal components, and articulates with a broad or bifid metacarpal or phalanx.
Type III is a complete digital duplication, which has a well-formed duplicated metacarpal.

==Treatment==
===Ulnar===
Ulnar polydactyly usually does not interfere with hand function, but for social reasons it can be treated operatively.

====Type A====
The treatment of Type A ulnar polydactyly is complex as its goal is to remove the accessory digit while maintaining a stable, functional small finger. When the duplicated proximal phalanx articulates with a common, broad metacarpal head, the ulnar collateral ligament must be considered. In those cases with a common articulation or with a sixth metacarpal the muscle executing the abduction of the little finger (&quot;abductor digiti minimi&quot;) must be preserved.
In patients with a common metacarpal articulation an elliptical incision at the base of the post-axial digit is made. This incision may be extended proximally in order to adequately expose the &quot;abductor digiti minimi&quot;. The ulnar collateral ligament and the insertions of the &quot;abductor digiti minimi&quot; are then elevated with a periosteal sleeve. The duplicated extensor and flexor tendons to the ulnar digit are transected and after that the digit is amputated at its articulation with the metacarpal. If the articular surface is wide the metacarpal may be shaved. At last the collateral ligament and &quot;abductor digiti minimi&quot; are reinserted at the base of the preserved proximal phalanx and a wire is then placed across the reconstructed joint.
In patients with a duplicated metacarpal, the accessory digit is amputated in a standard ray fashion with transfer of the &quot;abductor digiti minimi&quot; to the retained small finger.

====Type B ulnar====
In this situation there is an absence of osseous and ligamentous structures. The surgical technique is analogous to radial polydactyly, in which the level of duplication and anatomical components should guide operative treatment.
The pedicled ulnar extra digit can be removed by suture ligation to devise the skin bridge of the newborn child. This might be easier than an excision of the extra digit when the child is 6 to 12 months old. Ligation occludes the vascular supply to the duplicated digit, resulting in dry gangrene and subsequent autoamputation. This must be done with consideration of the presence of a neurovascular bundle, even in very small skin bridges. When the ligation is done inappropriately it can give a residual nubbin. Also, a neuroma can develop in the area of the scar. An excision can prevent the development of a residual nubbin and the sensitivity due to a neuroma.

For infants with ulnar type B polydactyly the recommended treatment is ligation in the neonatal nursery. 
A 2011 study opined that excision of an extra digit in the neonatal nursery was a safe and simple procedure with a good clinical and cosmetic outcome.

As of 2022, for infants with ulnar type B polydactyly the recommended treatment is surgical excision or suture ligation, when no bony structures exist. Complications of ligation include infection, neuroma or cyst formation.

===Radial===
Because neither of the two thumb components is normal, a decision should be taken on combining which elements to create the best possible composite digit. Instead of amputating the most hypoplastic thumb, preservation of skin, nail, collateral ligaments and tendons is needed to augment the residual thumb. Surgery is recommended in the first year of life, generally between 9 and 15 months of age.
Surgical options depend on type of polydactyly.

====Bilhaut-Cloquet procedure====
This type of procedure is recommended for Wassel types 1 and 2 (in which both thumbs are severely hypoplastic) by some congenital hand surgeons. The technique contains a composite wedge resection of the central bone and soft-tissue. This will be achieved with approach of the lateral tissue of each thumb. The goal is to achieve a normal thumb, what concerns the size, which is possible. If the width of the nail bed is greater than 70% of the contralateral thumb, it may be split.

====Ablation with collateral ligament reconstruction====
This type of procedure is used for all Wassel types of polydactyly and is the most commonly used technique. It is recommended in all cases of thumb duplication with a hypoplastic, less-functional thumb. Otherwise, one could consider the Bilhaut-Cloquet. The ulnar thumb is preferably preserved as it is the more developed one in most cases.

By detaching the radial collateral ligament from distal to proximal, a periosteal sleeve can be preserved.
In this way, the radial collateral band of the radial digit will function as the absent radial collateral ligament of the preserved ulnar thumb.

Elevation of the APB and FPB is performed in Wassel type 4 duplication; this can be accomplished via the periosteum or separately. As the tendons insert proximally, the elevation is performed proximally too to potentially rebalance the ulnar thumb. After the radial thumb is amputated, the ulnar elements are centralized and fixed with a Kirschner wire. In most cases, a longitudinal and sagittal osteotomy is needed to centralize the bony parts of the ulnar thumb. While the soft-tissue of the radial thumb was preserved, it is now attached to the radial side of the ulnar thumb together with the periosteal sleeve. The APB and FPB of the ablated radial thumb are attached to the distal phalanx for more stability. If necessary, the extensor pollicis longus and the flexor pollicis longus are reattached to centralize their course.

In Wassel type 5 and 6 the opponens pollicis muscle must be transferred to the ulnar metacarpal. Soft tissue with collateral ligament reconstruction is used to avoid any angular deformity in the preserved thumb. Tendon centralization is also often used for correction. Still, cases with osseous deformities may happen. To provide alignment, osteotomies are necessary to be done. This operation may need bone grafting, which is obtained from the amputated thumb.

====On top plasty procedure====
This type is indicated when one thumb is larger proximally and the other thumb has a larger distal component. (The procedure is initially described as a way to lengthen amputated digits.) The goal is to create a functional thumb by combining less-hypoplastic components. On top plasty procedure is rarely employed in the treatment of congenital thumb duplication. It might be necessary for Wassel types 4, 5, 6.

At the level of the mid-proximal phalanx or mid-metacarpal, the distal component is transferred to the proximal component. The tendons of the distal component are preserved as the rest of the distal component is amputated. The neurovascular bundle which supplies the distal component is reserved and transferred proximally.

===Central===
Early osteotomy and ligament reconstructions should be done to prevent deformities, such as angular growth deformities.

The surgical treatment of central polydactyly is highly variable. After the surgery the hand must be functional and stable, but also aesthetically pleasing. This requires intraoperative creativity and flexibility. The surgeon must also consider whether retention of a fully functional supranumerary digit is preferable to surgical intervention. In contrast, a functional, four-fingered hand achieved via ray amputation may be preferable to a five-fingered hand with a deformed or stiff reconstructed finger.

Cases of polysyndactyly are approached through a standard opposing zig-zag incision. The incision is favored toward the accessory digit, preserving extra skin for subsequent closure. Depending on the level and extent of duplication, the flexor and extensor tendons may require centralization or rebalancing. Also, the collateral ligaments must be preserved or reconstructed. Wide articular surfaces should be narrowed and phalangeal wedge osteotomies may be required to provide an axial alignment. Attention must also be given to reconstruct the intermetacarpal ligament. Furthermore, one should take in mind the provision for adequate web-space soft tissue.
===Complications===
Complications include: painful scarring, infection, joint instability, residual deformity, angulated growth, growth arrest, joint stiffness, and nail bed deformities. A 2014 study reported a 19% revision rate for preaxial polydactyly for pain or instability.

==Prognosis==
===Ulnar===
====Type A====
There are no substantive outcome studies regarding the function of these hands following surgical intervention. This is mainly caused by the fact that there is a generally normal function of these patients’ hands following ablation with collateral ligament reconstruction. In a study on 27 patients undergoing surgical excision for Type A ulnar polydactyly, only one complication was noted in the form of an infection. However, no investigators have objectively reviewed functional range of motion or articular stability.

====Type B====
In a study on 21 patients with Type B ulnar polydactyly treated with suture ligation it was found that the duplicated digit was typically amputated at an average of 10 days and no complications of infection or bleeding were reported.
In a large study on 105 patients treated with suture ligation an overall complication rate of 23.5% was reported, citing a residual tender or unacceptable bump in 16%, infection in 6%, and bleeding in 1% of patients.
In general, suture ligation is safe and effective when applied to appropriate cases of Type B polydactyly in which no substantial ligamentous or osseous structures are present within the pedicle. Parents should be educated as to the progression of necrosis, and that revision of residual tissue or scar may be necessary when the child is six months of age or older.

===Radial===
====Bilhaut procedure====
Advantages:
By combining two hypoplastic thumbs a sufficient thumb size is acquired. Furthermore, the IP and MCP joints are very stable as the collateral ligaments are not violated during reconstruction.
Disadvantages:
Violation during reconstruction can lead to growth arrest or asymmetric growth. Nail deformity could also occur after reconstruction. Although the joints are stable, restriction of flexion may be possible.
The average IP flexion in a reconstructed thumb is 55 degrees less than the contralateral thumb. MCP flexion averaged 55 degrees in reconstructed thumbs, compared to 75 degrees in the contralateral thumb.

====Ablation with collateral ligament reconstruction====
Advantages:
The reconstructed joints tend to remain flexible. Also, it preserves the nail bed and physis, this increases the prevention of nail deformities over time.
Disadvantages:
Although surgeons try to obtain a stable thumb of appropriate size, instability of the IP and MCP joint may occur, as well as a size mismatch. Thumbs are defined as unacceptable if IP joint deviation exceeds 15 degrees, MCP joint deviation exceeds 30 degrees, and thumb size is inappropriate based on the examiner&#x27;s assessment. Also, thumb size one-third greater or less than the contralateral thumb is defined as unacceptable.

====On-top plasty procedure====
No surgical outcomes studies exist for evaluating the function of the thumbs after an on-top plasty reconstruction.

===Central===
Few clinical outcome studies exist regarding the treatment of central polydactyly. Tada and colleagues note that satisfactory surgical correction of central polydactyly is difficult to achieve and that outcomes are generally poor. In Tada&#x27;s study, 12 patients were reviewed. All patients required secondary surgical procedures to address flexion contractures and angular deviation at the IP joint level.
However, several primary factors contribute to the complexity of central polydactyly reconstruction. Hypoplastic joints and soft tissues that predispose the reconstructed finger to joint contracture, and angular deformities as well as complex tendon anomalies, are often difficult to address. Therefore, treatment is wholly dependent on the anatomic components present, the degree of syndactyly, and the function of the duplicated finger.

==Epidemiology==
The condition has an estimated occurrence of 0.3–3.6 per 1000 live births. Postaxial hand polydactyly is most frequent in the United States in Black males. Preaxial polydactyly occurs in 0.08 to 1.4 in 1,000 live births. In the United States, it is more common in White people and also relatively frequent in Native American and Asian people. A 1994 study by Finley et al. combined data from Jefferson County, Alabama, United States, and Uppsala County, Sweden. This study found incidence of all types of polydactyly at rates of 2.3 per 1000 live births of White males, 0.6 per 1000 live births of White females, 13.5 per 1000 live births of Black males, and 11.1 per 1000 live births of Black females.

* In the cartoon series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, Stanford Pines (&quot;Grunkle Ford&quot;) has six fingers on both of his hands, a trait which also identifies him in the show&#x27;s mythology. He uses a tracing of his right hand to create the iconic gold detail on the covers of each of his journals.
* Tyrone Rugen, a Count in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, is described many times as &quot;the six-fingered man.&quot;
* Void, an antagonist of the manga series &quot;Berserk&quot;, has six fingers on each hand.
* Zigzag, an antagonist from &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;, had six fingers on each hand.
* Billy, a character from &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, had six fingers on each hand.
* Kinzo Ushiromiya, the head of the Ushiromiya household from the visual novel &quot;Umineko When They Cry&quot;, had six toes on each foot. Among the many previous Ushiromiya family heads, those with polydactyly were known for their wisdom.
* In &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;, Leah Nichols was born with 6 fingers on each hand.
* In &quot;Gattaca&quot;, Ryan Dorin plays a pianist with six fingers on each hand who throws his gloves to the audience at the concert&#x27;s end.

==Other animals==

Polydactyly occurs in numerous types of animals. The condition is sporadically seen in livestock, where it affects cattle, sheep, pigs, and occasionally horses. Conversely, it is a common trait in several heritage chicken breeds. Chickens normally have 4 toes on each foot. The chicken breeds known for being polydactyl are the Dorking, Faverolle, Houdan, Lincolnshire Buff, Meusienne, Sultan, and non-bearded Silkie Bantams. The breed standard of these varieties of chickens calls for five toes on each foot, although sometimes more than five toes will occur. The extra digit in these breeds presents as an extra &quot;thumb&quot; that does not touch the ground. Mixed-breed chickens may also have extra digits if the aforementioned breeds are part of their genetic makeup.

Polydactyly also occurs in dogs, cats, and small mammals such as guinea pigs and mice. Cats normally have five digits on the front paws and four on the rear. Polydactyl cats have more, and this is a moderately common condition, especially in certain cat populations. Dogs, like other canids, normally have four claws on their rear paws; a fifth is often called a dewclaw and is especially found in certain dog breeds, including the Norwegian Lundehund and Great Pyrenees.

A number of mutations of the LMBR1 gene, in dogs, humans, and mice, can cause polydactyly. A 2014 report indicated that mice could also exhibit polydactyly arising from mutation in the VPS25 gene. In cattle, it appears to be polygenic with a dominant gene at one locus and a homozygous recessive at another.

Polydactyly is believed to have been common in early tetrapods, the extinct amphibians that represented the earliest landliving vertebrates. Their number of toes fluctuated until the early Carboniferous period when they finally began developing a uniform number of toes. Amniotes settled on five toes per limb, while amphibians developed four toes on each front limb and five toes on each back limb. (For more information, see Polydactyly in early tetrapods). Polydactyly also occurs in modern extant reptiles
and amphibians. Polydactyly was a non-pathological, reacquired condition in extinct marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and hupehsuchians, some of which containing upwards of ten digits within their flippers.

<text>The or , is the first of the two elements that identify years in the Japanese era calendar scheme. The second element is a number which indicates the year number within the era (with the first year being &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;origin, basis&quot;), followed by the literal &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;year&quot;.

Era names originated in 140 BCE in Imperial China, during the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han. As elsewhere in the Sinosphere, the use of era names was originally derived from Chinese imperial practice, although the Japanese system is independent of the Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese era name systems. Unlike its other Sinosphere counterparts, Japanese era names are still in official use. Government offices usually require era names and years for official papers.

The five era names used since the end of the Edo period in 1868 can be abbreviated by taking the first letter of their romanized names. For example, S55 means Shōwa 55 (i.e. 1980), and H22 stands for Heisei 22 (2010). At 62 years and 2 weeks, Shōwa is the longest era to date.

The era began on 1 May 2019, the day of accession of Naruhito to the throne as the 126th Emperor of Japan, following the day of the planned and voluntary abdication of his father, the 125th Emperor, Akihito. Emperor Akihito had received special permission to abdicate, rather than serving in his role until his death, as is the rule. The Reiwa era follows the 31st and final year of the , which had started on the day after the death of Emperor Hirohito on 8 January 1989.

==Overview==


The system on which the Japanese era names are based originated in China in 140 BCE, and was adopted by Japan in 645 CE, during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku.

The first era name to be assigned was , celebrating the political and organizational changes which were to flow from the great of 645. Although the regular practice of proclaiming successive era names was interrupted in the late seventh century, it was permanently re-adopted in 701 during the reign of Emperor Monmu (697–707). Since then, era names have been used continuously up through the present day.

===Historical &quot;nengō&quot;===
Prior to the Meiji period, era names were decided by court officials and were subjected to frequent change. A new era name was usually proclaimed within a year or two after the ascension of a new emperor. A new era name was also often designated on the first, fifth and 58th years of the sexagenary cycle, because they were inauspicious years in Onmyōdō. These three years are respectively known as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, and collectively known as &quot;&quot;. Era names were also changed due to other felicitous events or natural disasters.

In historical practice, starts whenever the emperor chooses; and the first year continues until the next lunar new year, which is understood to be the start of the nengō&#x27;s second year.

Era names indicate the various reasons for their adoption. For instance, the nengō , during the Nara period, was declared due to the discovery of copper deposits in Chichibu. Most nengō are composed of two kanji, except for a short time during the Nara period when four-kanji names were sometimes adopted to follow the Chinese trend. , , and are some famous nengō names that use four characters. Since the Heian period, Confucian thoughts and ideas have been reflected in era names, such as , and . Although there currently exist a total of 248 Japanese era names, only 73 kanji have been used in composing them. Out of these 73 kanji, 31 of them have been used only once, while the rest have been used repeatedly in different combinations.

The vast majority of Japanese Era Names were used for less than 10 years, with two being used for less than a year. Only 28 have been used for more than 10 years and less than 30 years. Only Heisei, Ōei, Meiji, and Showa have been used for more than 30 years.

===&quot;Nengō&quot; in modern Japan===
Mutsuhito assumed the throne in 1867, during the third year of the era. On 23 October 1868, the era name was changed to , and a system was adopted, wherein era names would change only upon immediate imperial succession. This system is similar to the now-defunct Chinese system used since the days of the Ming dynasty, in which the era name was not updated until the year following the emperor&#x27;s death.

In modern practice, starts immediately upon the emperor&#x27;s accession and ends on 31 December. Subsequent years follow the Gregorian calendar. For example, the Meiji era lasted until 30 July 1912, when the Emperor died and the era was proclaimed. 1912 is therefore known as both &quot;Meiji 45&quot; and , although Meiji technically ended on 30 July with Mutsuhito&#x27;s death.

This practice, implemented successfully since the days of Meiji but never formalized, became law in 1979 with the passage of the . Thus, since 1868, there have only been five era names assigned: Meiji, Taishō, Shōwa, Heisei, and Reiwa, each corresponding with the rule of only one emperor. Upon death, the emperor is thereafter referred to by the era of his reign. For example, Mutsuhito is posthumously known as .
It is protocol in Japan that the reigning emperor be referred to as or . To call the current emperor by the current era name, i.e. &quot;Reiwa&quot;, even in English, is a faux pas, as this is – and will be – his posthumous name. Use of the emperor&#x27;s given name (i.e., &quot;Naruhito&quot;) is rare, and is considered vulgar behaviour in Japanese.

The Emperor Akihito abdicated on 30 April 2019, necessitating a change in nengō. The new name, made public on the morning of 1 April of the same year, is .

==Periods without era names==
The era name system that was introduced by Emperor Kōtoku was abandoned after his death; no era names were designated between 654 and 686. The system was briefly reinstated by Emperor Tenmu in 686, but was again abandoned upon his death about two months later. In 701, Emperor Monmu once again reinstated the era name system, and it has continued uninterrupted through today.

Although use of the Gregorian calendar for historical dates became increasingly common in Japan, the traditional Japanese system demands that dates be written in reference to era names. The apparent problem introduced by the lack of era names was resolved by identifying the years of an imperial reign as a period.

Although in modern Japan posthumous imperial names correspond with the eras of their reign, this is a relatively recent practice, introduced during the Meiji period and instituted by law in 1979. Therefore, the posthumous names of the emperors and empresses who reigned prior to 1868 may not be taken as era names by themselves. For example, the year 572—the year in which Emperor Bidatsu assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne – is properly written as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Bidatsu-Tennō Gannen&quot;, &quot;the first year of Emperor Bidatsu&quot;), and not &quot;&quot; (&quot;Bidatsu Gannen&quot;, &quot;the first year of Bidatsu&quot;), although it may be abbreviated as such. By incorporating both proper era names and posthumous imperial names in this manner, it is possible to extend the nengō system to cover all dates from 660 BCE through today.

==Unofficial era name system==
In addition to the official era name system, in which the era names are selected by the imperial court, one also observes—primarily in the ancient documents and epigraphs of shrines and temples—unofficial era names called , also known as or . Currently, there are over 40 confirmed shinengō, most of them dating from the middle ages. &quot;Shinengō&quot; used prior to the reestablishment of the era name system in 701 are usually called .

Because official records of &quot;shinengō&quot; are lacking, the range of dates to which they apply is often unclear. For example, the well-known itsunengō is normally said to refer to 650–654 CE; a poetic synonym for the Hakuchi era. However, alternate interpretations exist. For example, in the Nichūreki, Hakuhō refers to 661–683 CE, and in some medieval temple documents, Hakuhō refers to 672–685 CE. Thus, shinengō may be used as an alternative way of dating periods for which there is no official era name.

Other well-known &quot;itsunengō&quot; and &quot;shinengō&quot; include (591–621+ CE), (686), (1460), (1506–1507 or 1507–1509) and (1540–1543).

The most recent &quot;shinengō&quot; is (1904–1905), named for the Russo-Japanese War.

===&quot;Kyūshū nengō&quot;===
Edo period scholar Tsurumine Shigenobu proposed that , said to have been used in ancient Kumaso, should also be considered a form of &quot;shinengō&quot;. This claim is not generally recognized by the academic community. Lists of the proposed &quot;Kyūshū nengō&quot; can be seen in the Japanese language entries and .

==Software support==
===Character sets===
Certain era names have specific characters assigned to them, for instance ㋿ for the Reiwa period, which can also be written as . These are included in Unicode: Code points U+32FF (㋿), U+337B (㍻), U+337C (㍼), U+337D (㍽) and U+337E (㍾) are used for the Reiwa, Heisei, Shōwa, Taishō and Meiji eras, respectively.

===Calendar libraries===
Certain calendar libraries support the conversion from and to the era system, as well as rendering of dates using it.

Since the release of Java 8, the Japanese calendar is supported in the new Date and time API for the year Meiji 6 (1873) onwards.

===Support for the new era in Japanese imperial transition of 2019===

Computers and software manufacturers needed to test their systems in preparation for the new era which began on 1 May 2019. &quot;Windows&quot; provided a test mechanism to simulate a new era ahead of time. Java Development Kit 11 supported this era using the placeholders &quot;&quot; for Japanese, &quot;NewEra&quot; for other languages. The final name was added in JDK 12.0.1, after it was announced by the Japanese government.

Unicode code point U+32FF (㋿) was reserved for representing the new era name, Reiwa.

==List of Japanese era names==
The list of Japanese era names is the result of a periodization system which was established by Emperor Kōtoku in 645. The system of was irregular until the beginning of the 8th century. After 701, sequential era names developed without interruption across a span of centuries. As of 1 April 2019, there have been 239 era names.

To convert a Japanese year to a Gregorian calendar year, find the first year of the Japanese era name (also called &quot;nengō&quot;). When found, add the number of the Japanese year, then subtract 1.

<text>A railway air brake is a railway brake power braking system with compressed air as the operating medium. Modern trains rely upon a fail-safe air brake system that is based upon a design patented by George Westinghouse on April 13, 1869. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse&#x27;s invention. In various forms, it has been nearly universally adopted.

The Westinghouse system uses air pressure to charge air reservoirs (tanks) on each car. Full air pressure causes each car to release the brakes. A subsequent reduction or loss of air pressure causes each car to apply its brakes, using the compressed air stored in its reservoirs.

== Overview ==

===Straight air brake===
 In the air brake&#x27;s simplest form, called the &quot;straight air system&quot;, compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder. The piston is connected through mechanical linkage to brake shoes that can rub on the train wheels, using the resulting friction to slow the train. The mechanical linkage can become quite elaborate, as it evenly distributes force from one pressurized air cylinder to 8 or 12 wheels.

The pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a &quot;train line&quot; made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars. The principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes. This could easily cause a runaway train. Straight air brakes are still used on locomotives, although as a dual circuit system, usually with each bogie (truck) having its own circuit.

===Westinghouse air brake===
In order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system, Westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an air reservoir and a &quot;triple valve&quot;, also known as a &quot;control valve&quot;.
 Unlike the straight air system, the Westinghouse system uses a &quot;reduction&quot; in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes. 

The triple valve is so named because it performs three functions: It allows air into an air tank ready to be used, it applies the brakes, and it releases them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it &#x27;holds&#x27; or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his &#x27;triple-valve device&#x27; because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. Westinghouse soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action. These three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.

* If the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir, the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car&#x27;s reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder. Pressure increases in the cylinder, applying the brakes, while decreasing in the reservoir. This action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the brake cylinder is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.
* If the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir, the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed, causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase. The triple valve also causes the brake cylinder to be exhausted to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes.
* As the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize, the triple valve closes, causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in, and the brake cylinder is not pressurized.

When the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive brake valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.

The Westinghouse system is thus fail-safe—any failure in the train line, including a separation (&quot;break-in-two&quot;) of the train, will cause a loss of train line pressure, causing the brakes to be applied and bringing the train to a stop, thus preventing a runaway train.

===Modern systems===
Modern air brake systems serve two functions:
*Service braking applies and releases the brakes during normal operations.
*Emergency braking rapidly applies the brakes in the event of a brake pipe failure or an emergency application by the engine operator or passenger emergency alarm/cord/handle.

When the train brakes are applied during normal operation, the engine operator makes a &quot;service application&quot; or a &quot;service rate reduction”, which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate. It takes several seconds for the brake pipe pressure to reduce and consequently takes several seconds for the brakes to apply throughout the train. The speed of pressure changes during a service reduction is limited by the compressed air&#x27;s ability to overcome the flow resistance of the relatively-small-diameter pipe and numerous elbows throughout the length of the train, and the relatively-small exhaust port on the head-end locomotive, which means the brakes of the rear-most cars will apply sometime after those of the forward-most cars apply, so some slack run-in can be expected. The gradual reduction in brake pipe pressure will mitigate this effect.

Modern locomotives employ two air brake systems. The system which controls the brake pipe is called the &quot;automatic brake&quot; and provides service and emergency braking control for the entire train. The locomotive(s) at the head of the train (the &quot;lead consist&quot;) have a secondary system called the &quot;independent brake.&quot; The independent brake is a &quot;straight air&quot; system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake, providing for more nuanced train control. The two braking systems may interact differently as a matter of preference by the locomotive builder or the railroad. In some systems, the automatic and independent applications will be additive; in some systems the greater of the two will apply to the locomotive consist. The independent system also provides a &quot;bail off&quot; mechanism, which releases the brakes on the lead locomotives without affecting the brake application on the rest of the train.

In the event the train needs to make an emergency stop, the engine operator can make an &quot;emergency application,&quot; which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere, resulting in a faster application of the train&#x27;s brakes. An emergency application also results when the integrity of the brake pipe is lost, as all air will also be immediately vented to atmosphere.

An emergency brake application brings in an additional component of each car&#x27;s air brake system. The triple valve is divided into two portions: the service section, which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions, and the emergency section, which senses the faster emergency reduction of train line pressure. In addition, each car&#x27;s air brake reservoir is divided into two sections—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the &quot;dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder, while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder, resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application.

The emergency portion of each triple valve is activated by the higher rate of reduction of brake pipe pressure. Due to the length of trains and the small diameter of the brake pipe, the rate of reduction is highest near the front of the train (in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application) or near the break in the brake pipe (in the case of loss of brake pipe integrity). Farther away from the source of the emergency application, the rate of reduction can be reduced to the point where triple valves will not detect the application as an emergency reduction. To prevent this, each triple valve&#x27;s emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port, which, when activated by an emergency application, also locally vents the brake pipe&#x27;s pressure directly to atmosphere. This serves to more rapidly vent the brake pipe and hasten the propagation of the emergency reduction rate along the entire length of the train.

Use of distributed power (i.e., remotely controlled locomotive units mid-train and/or at the rear end) somewhat mitigates the time-lag problem with long trains, because a telemetered radio signal from the engine operator in the front locomotive commands the distant units to initiate brake pressure reductions that propagate quickly through nearby cars.

===Distributors===
Many modern air brake systems use distributors instead of triple valves. These serve the same function as triple valves, but have additional functionality such as the ability to partially release the brakes.

===Working pressures===
The locomotive&#x27;s air compressor typically charges the main reservoir with air at . The train brakes are released by admitting reduced and regulated main reservoir air pressure to the brake pipe through the engineer&#x27;s automatic brake valve. In America, a fully charged brake pipe typically operates at for freight trains and for passenger trains. The brakes are applied when the engineer moves the automatic brake handle to a &quot;service&quot; position, which causes a reduction in brake pipe pressure.

During normal service, the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact, the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure. A sudden and substantial pressure reduction caused by a loss of brake pipe integrity (e.g., a blown hose), the train breaking in two and uncoupling air hoses, or the engineer moving the automatic brake valve to the emergency position, will cause an emergency brake application. On the other hand, a slow leak that gradually reduces brake pipe pressure to zero, something that might happen if the air compressor is inoperative and therefore not maintaining main reservoir pressure, will not cause an emergency brake application.

== Enhancements ==
Electro-pneumatic or EP brakes are a type of air brake that allows for immediate application of brakes throughout the train instead of the sequential application. EP brakes have been in British practice since 1949 and also used in German high-speed trains (most notably the ICE) since the late 1980s; they are fully described in Electro-pneumatic brake system on British railway trains. , electro-pneumatic brakes were in testing in North America and South Africa on captive service ore and coal trains.

Passenger trains have had for a long time a three-wire version of the electro-pneumatic brake, which gives up to seven levels of braking force.

In North America, the Westinghouse Air Brake Company supplied high-speed control brake equipment for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. On the conventional side, the control valve set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This &quot;straight air&quot; trainline was charged and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a three-wire trainline, in turn controlled by an &quot;electro-pneumatic master controller&quot; in the controlling locomotive. This controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self-lapping portion of the engineers valve, signaling all of the &quot;apply&quot; or &quot;release&quot; magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously, changing the pressure in the straight-air trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive. The relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms, magnet valves, electric control equipment, and an axle-mounted speed sensor, so that at speeds over full braking force was applied, and reduced in steps at , bringing the train to a gentle stop. Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The straight-air &quot;(electro-pneumatic trainline)&quot;, anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and any or all of these options could be supplied separately.

Later systems replace the automatic air brake with an electrical wire which runs in a circle round the whole train and has to be kept energized to keep the brakes off. In the UK it is known as a &quot;train wire&quot;. It is routed through various &quot;governors&quot; (switches operated by air pressure) which monitor critical components such as compressors, brake pipes and air reservoirs. If the train divides, the wire will be broken, ensuring that all motors are switched off and both portions of the train have an immediate emergency brake application.

More recent innovations are electronically controlled pneumatic brakes where the brakes of all the wagons (cars) and locomotives are connected by a kind of &quot;local area network&quot;, which allows individual control of the brakes on each wagon, and the reporting back of performance of each wagon&#x27;s brakes.

== Limitations ==

The Westinghouse air brake system is very reliable but not infallible. The car reservoirs recharge only when the brake pipe pressure is higher than the reservoir pressure. Fully recharging the reservoirs on a long train can require considerable time (8 to 10 minutes in some cases), during which the brake pipe pressure will be lower than locomotive reservoir pressure.

If the brakes must be applied before recharging has been completed, a larger brake pipe reduction will be required in order to achieve the desired amount of braking effort, as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium (lower overall pressure). If many brake pipe reductions are made in short succession (&quot;fanning the brake&quot; in railroad slang), a point may be reached where car reservoir pressure will be severely depleted, resulting in substantially reduced brake cylinder piston force, causing the brakes to fail. On a descending grade, the result will be a runaway.

In the event of a loss of braking due to reservoir depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application, as the emergency portion of each car&#x27;s dual-compartment reservoir should be fully charged—it is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the &quot;rate&quot; of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car&#x27;s triple valve will cause an emergency brake application. However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications, an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.

To prevent a runaway due to loss of brake pressure, dynamic (rheostatic) braking can be utilized so the locomotive(s) will assist in retarding the train. Often, blended braking, the simultaneous application of dynamic and train brakes, will be used to maintain a safe speed and keep the slack bunched on descending grades. Care would then be given when releasing the service and dynamic brakes to prevent draw-gear damage caused by a sudden run out of the train&#x27;s slack.

Another solution to loss of brake pressure is the two-pipe system, fitted on most locomotive-hauled passenger stock and many freight wagons. In addition to the traditional brake pipe, this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe, which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive&#x27;s main reservoir. The main reservoir is where the locomotive&#x27;s air compressor output is stored and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all connected systems.

Since the main reservoir pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the brake pipe, this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above-described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself.

Main reservoir pipe pressure can also be used to supply air for auxiliary systems such as pneumatic door operators or air suspension. Nearly all passenger trains (all in the UK and USA), and many freights, now have the two-pipe system.
== Accidents ==
At both ends of each car, there are &quot;angle cocks&quot; fitted. These valves cut off the air from the train line and vent the coupling hoses for uncoupling cars. The air brake only operates if the angle cocks are open except the ones at the front of the locomotive and at the end of the train. 

The air brake can fail if one of the angle cocks is accidentally closed. In this case, the brakes on the wagons behind the closed cock will fail to respond to the driver&#x27;s command. This happened in the 1953 Pennsylvania Railroad train wreck involving the &quot;Federal Express&quot;, a Pennsylvania Railroad passenger train which became a runaway while heading into Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C., causing the train to crash into the passenger concourse and fall through the floor. Similarly, in the Gare de Lyon rail accident, a valve was accidentally closed by the crew, reducing braking power.

There are a number of safeguards that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident from happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air brake systems when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air brake hoses, charging up the brake system, setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars&#x27; triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.

A different kind of accident can occur if a malfunction in the air brake system (such as a broken air brake hose) causes the air brakes to engage unexpectedly. An example of this problem can be seen in the accident that caused the death of John Luther &quot;Casey&quot; Jones on 30 April 1900 on the Illinois Central Railroad main line at Vaughan, Mississippi.

==European systems==
European brake systems vary between countries, but the working principle is the same as for the Westinghouse air brake. European passenger cars used on national railway networks must comply with TSI LOC&amp;PAS regulation, which specifies in section 4.2.4.3 that all brake systems must adhere to the EN 14198:2004 standard. This standard is based on and aligned with UIC Leaflet 540, a document ratified by many train-operating companies. UIC Leaflet 540 explicitly approves the following brake systems:

* Oerlikon ESG 121, ESH 100/200
* SAB-WABCO SW 4, C3WR, WU-C, GF4 SS1, GF4 SS2, GF6 SS1, GF6 SS2
* Knorr KKL II, KE and similar
*Dako CV1nD
*MZT HEPOS MH3f/HBG310 and similar
*Bumar-Fablok MBF-01A, MBF-01B, MBF-02
*Faiveley Transport SW4S and similar, FT SS1 / FT SS2 and similar
*Keschwari Electronic Systems EDS 300
Historically, and according to UIC 540, we distinguish systems technically approved since 1927-1932 such as: Westinghouse W, Knorr K, Kunze-Knorr, Drolshammer, Bozic, Hildebrand-Knorr.

In the steam era, Britain&#x27;s railways were divided–some using vacuum brakes and some using air brakes–but there was a gradual standardization on the vacuum brake. Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that they could work with either vacuum- or air-braked trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to air-braked rolling stock in the 1960s.
== Vacuum brakes ==

The main competitor to the air brake is the vacuum brake, which operates on negative pressure. The vacuum brake is a little simpler than the air brake. Instead of an air compressor, steam engines have an ejector with no moving parts, and diesel or electric locomotives have a mechanical or electrical &quot;exhauster&quot;. Disconnection taps at the ends of cars are not required because the loose hoses are sucked onto a mounting block.

However, the maximum pressure in a vacuum system is limited to atmospheric pressure, so all the equipment has to be much larger and heavier to compensate. That disadvantage is made worse at high altitude. The vacuum brake is also considerably slower to both apply and release the brake, which requires a greater level of skill and anticipation from the driver. Conversely, the vacuum brake originally had the advantage of allowing gradual release, whereas the Westinghouse automatic air brake was originally available in only the direct-release form still common in freight service.

A primary fault of vacuum brakes is the inability to find leaks easily. In a positive air system, a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air. Discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult, although it is easier to repair, because a piece of rubber (for example) can just be tied around the leak and will be firmly held in place by the vacuum.

Electro-vacuum brakes have been used with considerable success on South African electric multiple unit trains. Despite requiring larger and heavier equipment, as stated above, the performance of the electro-vacuum brake approached that of contemporary electro-pneumatic brakes. However, their use has not been repeated.

<text>Kalmyks (Kalmyk: , ; ; ; archaically anglicised as &quot;Calmucks&quot;) are the only Mongolic ethnic group living in Europe, residing in the easternmost part of the European Plain.

This dry steppe area, west of the lower Volga River, known among the nomads as Itil/Idjil, a basin on the northwest shore of the Caspian Sea, was the most suitable land for nomadic pastures. Itil or Idjil, the ancient name of the Volga River, written in the archaic Oirat script, means exactly that: the &quot;pastures&quot;.

The ancestors of Kalmyks were nomadic groups of Oirat-speaking Mongols, who migrated from Western Mongolia to Eastern Europe three times: in early medieval times, establishing in the 6th–8th centuries the Avar Khanate; in medieval times, establishing the Ulus of Juchi and Il-Kanate as Khuda-in-laws of Genghis Khan; and finally, in early modern times, establishing the Kalmyk Khanate in the 17th century.

The Oirat language belongs to the western branch of the Mongolic language family, whose speakers include numerous sub-ethnic groups (Derbet, Torgut, Khoshut, Olot, Dzungar (Zunghar), Bayad, Zakhchin, Khoton, Myangad, Buzava) across a wide geographical area of Uvs and Khovd provinces (aimags) of Western Mongolia (&quot;N&quot; = 209,412), and in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China (&quot;N&quot; = 194,891). Ethnic groups of Oirat speakers in the Republic of Kalmykia, Russia (&quot;N&quot; = 162,740) include Torguts, Derbets and Buzavas, together with a smaller group called Khoshuts, who live in just two villages of Kalmykia. Up until today the Kalmyks have retained their distinguished sub-ethnic groups, being quite separated from their geographical neighbours in Russia and northeast Caucasus.

The Kalmyks are the only traditionally Buddhist ethnic group who are located inside Europe. Through emigration, small Kalmyk communities have been established in the United States, France, Germany, and the Czech Republic.

==Origins and history==
===Early history of the Oirats===
The contemporary Kalmyks are a branch of the Mongolian Oirats, whose ancient grazing-lands spanned present-day parts of Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia and China. After the fall of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China in 1368, the Oirats emerged as a formidable foe against the Khalkha Mongols, the Han-led Ming dynasty and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. For 400 years, the Oirats conducted a military struggle for domination and control over both Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia. The struggle ended in 1757 with the defeat of the Oirats of the Dzungar Khanate against the Qing Empire, in the Dzungar–Qing Wars; they were the last of the Mongol groups to resist vassalage to Qing.

At the start of this 400-year era, the Western Mongols designated themselves as the Four Oirat. The alliance comprised four major Western Mongol tribes: Khoshut, Choros, Torghut and Dörbet. Collectively, the Four Oirat sought power as an alternative to the Mongols, who were the patrilineal heirs to Genghis Khan. The Four Oirat incorporated neighboring tribes or splinter groups at times, so there was a great deal of fluctuation in the composition of the alliance, with larger tribes dominating or absorbing the smaller ones. Smaller tribes belonging to the confederation included the Khoits, Zakhchin, Bayids and Khangal.

Together, these nomadic tribes roamed the grassy plains of western Inner Asia, between Lake Balkhash in present-day eastern Kazakhstan and Lake Baikal in present-day Russia north of central Mongolia. They pitched their yurts and kept herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, horses, donkeys and camels.

Paul Pelliot translated the name &quot;Torghut&quot; as &quot;garde de jour&quot;. He wrote that the Torghuts owed their name either to the memory of the guard of Genghis Khan or, as descendants of the Keraites, to the old &quot;garde de jour&quot;. This was documented among the Keraites in &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot; before Genghis Khan took over the region.

===Period of open conflict===
The &quot;Four Oirat&quot; was a political entity formed by the four major Oirat tribes. During the 15–17th centuries, they established under the name &quot;10 tumen Mongols&quot;, a cavalry unit of 10,000 horsemen, including four Oirat tumen and six tumen composed of other Mongols. They reestablished their traditional pastoral nomadic lifestyle during the end of the Yuan dynasty. The Oirats formed this alliance to defend themselves against the Khalkha Mongols and to pursue the greater objective of reunifying Mongolia.

Until the mid-17th century, when bestowal of the title of Khan was transferred to the Dalai Lama, all Mongol tribes recognized this claim and the political prestige attached to it. Although the Oirats could not assert this claim prior to the mid-17th century, they did in fact have a close connection to Genghis Khan by virtue of the fact that Genghis Khan&#x27;s brother, Qasar, was in command of the Khoshut tribe.

In response to the Western Mongols&#x27; self-designation as the Four Oirat, the Eastern Mongols began to refer to themselves as the &quot;Forty Mongols&quot;, or the &quot;Forty and Four&quot;. This means that the Khalkha Mongols claimed to have forty tümen to the four tümen maintained by the Four Oirat.

The Oirat alliance was decentralized, informal and unstable. For instance, the Four Oirat did not have a central location from which it was governed, and it was not governed by a central figure for most of its existence. The four Oirats did not establish a single military or a unified monastic system. Lastly, it was not until 1640 that the Four Oirat adopted uniform customary laws.

As pastoralist nomads, the Oirats were organized at the tribal level, where each tribe was ruled by a &quot;noyon&quot; or prince who also functioned as the chief &quot;taishi&quot; &quot;chieftain&quot;. The chief taishi governed with the support of lesser noyons, who were also called taishi. These minor noyons controlled divisions of the tribe (&quot;ulus&quot;) and were politically and economically independent of the chief tayishi. Chief taishis sought to influence and dominate the chief taishis of the other tribes, causing intertribal rivalry, dissension and periodic skirmishes.

Under the leadership of Esen, Chief Taishi of the Choros, the Four Oirat unified Mongolia for a short period. After Esen&#x27;s death in 1455, the political union of the Dörben Oirat dissolved quickly, resulting in two decades of Oirat-Eastern Mongol conflict. The deadlock ended during the reign of Batmunkh Dayan Khan, a five-year-old boy in whose name the loyal Eastern Mongol forces rallied. Mandukhai Khatun and Dayan Khan took advantage of Oirat disunity and weakness and brought Oirats back under Mongolian rule. In doing so, he regained control of the Mongol homeland and restored the hegemony of the Eastern Mongols.

After the death of Dayan in 1543, the Oirats and the Khalkhas resumed their conflict. The Oirat forces thrust eastward, but Dayan&#x27;s youngest son, Geresenz, was given command of the Khalkha forces and drove the Oirats to Uvs Lake in northwest Mongolia. In 1552, after the Oirats once again challenged the Khalkha, Altan Khan swept up from Inner Mongolia with Tümed and Ordos cavalry units, pushing elements of various Oirat tribes from Karakorum to the Khovd region in northwest Mongolia, reuniting most of Mongolia in the process .

The Oirats would later regroup south of the Altai Mountains in Dzungaria. But Geresenz&#x27;s grandson, Sholoi Ubashi Khuntaiji, pushed the Oirats further northwest, along the steppes of the Ob and Irtysh Rivers. Afterwards, he established a Khalkha Khanate under the name, Altan Khan, in the Oirat heartland of Dzungaria.

In spite of the setbacks, the Oirats would continue their campaigns against the Altan Khanate, trying to unseat Sholoi Ubashi Khuntaiji from Dzungaria. The continuous, back-and-forth nature of the struggle, which defined this period, is captured in the Oirat epic song &quot;The Rout of Mongolian Sholoi Ubashi Khuntaiji&quot;, recounting the Oirat victory over the Altan Khan of the Khalkha in 1587.

===Resurgence of Oirat power===


At the beginning of the 17th century, the First Altan Khan drove the Oirats westward to present-day eastern Kazakhstan. The Torghuts became the westernmost Oirat tribe, encamped in the Tarbagatai Mountains region and along the northern stretches of the Irtysh, Ishim and Tobol Rivers.

Further west, the Kazakhs – a Turco-Mongol people – prevented the Torghuts from sending its trading caravans to the Muslim towns and villages located along the Syr Darya river. As a result, the Torghuts established a trading relationship with the newly established outposts of the Tsarist government whose expansion into and exploration of Siberia was motivated mostly by the desire to profit from trade with Asia.

The Khoshut, by contrast, were the easternmost Oirat, encamped near the Lake Zaysan area and the Semey region along the lower portions of the Irtysh River, where they built several steppe monasteries. The Khoshut were adjacent to the Khalkha khanates of Altan Khan and Dzasagtu Khan. Both khanates prevented the Khoshut and the other Oirat from trading with Chinese border towns. The Khoshut were ruled by Baibagas Khan and then Güshi Khan, who were the first Oirat leaders to convert to the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.

Locked in between both tribes were the Choros, Dörbet Oirat and Khoid, collectively known as the &quot;Dzungar people&quot;, who were slowly rebuilding the base of power they enjoyed under the Four Oirat. The Choros were the dominant Oirat tribe of that era. Their leader, Erdeni Batur, attempted to follow Esen Khan in unifying the Oirats to challenge the Khalkha.

Under the dynamic leadership of Erdeni Batur, the Dzungars stopped the expansion of the first Altan Khan and began planning the resurrection of the Four Oirat under the Dzungar banner. In furtherance of such plans, Erdeni Batur designed and built a capital city called Kubak-sari on the Emil River near the modern city of Tacheng. During his attempt to build a nation, Erdeni Batur encouraged diplomacy, commerce and farming. He also sought to acquire modern weaponry and build small industry, such as metal works, to supply his military with weapons.

The attempted unification of the Oirat caused dissension among the tribes and their Chief Tayishis who were independent minded but also highly regarded leaders themselves. This dissension reputedly caused Kho Orluk to move the Torghut tribe and elements of the Dörbet tribe westward to the Volga region where his descendants formed the Kalmyk Khanate. In the east, Güshi Khan took part of the Khoshut to the Tsaidam and Qinghai regions in the Tibetan Plateau, where he formed the Khoshut Khanate to protect Tibet and the Gelug from both internal and external enemies. Erdeni Batur and his descendants, by contrast, formed the Dzungar Khanate and came to dominate Central Eurasia.

===Torghut migration===
In 1618, the Torghut and a small contingent of Dörbet Oirats (200,000–250,000 people) chose to migrate from the upper Irtysh River region to the grazing pastures of the lower Volga region south of Saratov and north of the Caspian Sea on both banks of the Volga River. The Torghut were led by their taishi, Kho Orluk. They were the largest Oirat tribe to migrate, bringing along nearly the entire tribe. The second-largest group was the Dörbet Oirats under their taishi, Dalai Batur. Together they moved west through southern Siberia and the southern Ural Mountains, avoiding the more direct route that would have taken them through the heart of the territory of their enemy, the Kazakhs. En route, they raided Russian settlements and Kazakh and Bashkir encampments.

Many theories have been advanced to explain the reasons for the migration. One generally accepted theory is that there may have been discontent among the Oirat tribes, which arose from the attempt by Kharkhul, taishi of the Dzungars, to centralize political and military control over the tribes under his leadership. Some scholars, however, believe that the Torghuts sought uncontested pastures as their territory was being encroached upon by the Russians from the north, the Kazakhs from the south and the Dzungars from the east. The encroachments resulted in overcrowding of people and livestock, thereby diminishing the food supply. Lastly, a third theory suggests that the Torghuts grew weary of the militant struggle between the Oirats and the Altan Khanate.

===Kalmyk Khanate===

====Period of self rule, 1630–1724====
Upon arrival to the lower Volga region in 1630, the Oirats encamped on land that was once part of the Astrakhan Khanate but was now claimed by the Tsardom of Russia. The region was lightly populated, from south of Saratov to the Russian garrison at Astrakhan and on both the east and the west banks of the Volga River. The Tsardom of Russia was not ready to colonize the area and was in no position to prevent the Oirats from encamping in the region, but it had a direct political interest in ensuring that the Oirats would not become allied with its Turkic-speaking neighbors. The Kalmyks became Russian allies and a treaty to protect the southern Russian border was signed between the Kalmyk Khanate and Russia.

The Oirats quickly consolidated their position by expelling the majority of the native inhabitants, the Nogai Horde. Large groups of Nogais fled southeast to the northern Caucasian plain and west to the Black Sea steppe, lands claimed by the Crimean Khanate, itself a vassal or ally of the Ottoman Empire. Smaller groups of Nogais sought the protection of the Russian garrison at Astrakhan. The remaining nomadic tribes became vassals of the Oirats.

The Kalmyks battled the Karakalpaks. The Mangyshlak Peninsula was overtaken in 1639 by Kalmyks.

At first, an uneasy relationship existed between the Russians and the Oirats. Mutual raiding by the Oirats of Russian settlements and by the Cossacks and the Bashkirs, Muslim vassals of the Russians, of Oirat encampments was commonplace. Numerous oaths and treaties were signed to ensure Oirat loyalty and military assistance. Although the Oirats became subjects of the Tsar, such allegiance by the Oirats was deemed to be nominal.

In reality, the Oirats governed themselves pursuant to a document known as the &quot;Great Code of the Nomads&quot; (&quot;Iki Tsaadzhin Bichig&quot;). The Code was promulgated in 1640 by them, their brethren in Dzungaria and some of the Khalkha who all gathered near the Tarbagatai Mountains in Dzungaria to resolve their differences and to unite under the banner of the Gelug school. Although the goal of unification was not met, the summit leaders did ratify the Code, which regulated all aspects of nomadic life.

In securing their position, the Oirats became a borderland power, often allying themselves with the Russian Empire against the neighboring Muslim population. During the era of Ayuka Khan, the Oirats rose to political and military prominence as the Russian Empire sought the increased use of Oirat cavalry in support of its military campaigns against the Muslim powers in the south, such as Safavid Iran, the Ottoman Empire, the Nogais, the Tatars of Kuban and the Crimean Khanate. Ayuka Khan also waged wars against the Kazakhs, subjugated the Turkmens of the Mangyshlak Peninsula, and made multiple expeditions against the highlanders of the North Caucasus. These campaigns highlighted the strategic importance of the Kalmyk Khanate which functioned as a buffer zone, separating Russia and the Muslim world, as Russia fought wars in Europe to establish itself as a European power.

To encourage the release of Oirat cavalrymen in support of its military campaigns, the Russian Empire increasingly relied on the provision of monetary payments and dry goods to the Oirat Khan and the Oirat nobility. In that respect, the Russian Empire treated the Oirats as it did the Cossacks. The provision of monetary payments and dry goods, however, did not stop the mutual raiding, and, in some instances, both sides failed to fulfill its promises .

Another significant incentive the Russian Empire provided to the Oirats was tariff-free access to the markets of Russian border towns, where the Oirats were permitted to barter their herds and the items they obtained from Asia and their Muslim neighbors in exchange for Russian goods. Trade also occurred with neighboring Turkic tribes under Russian control, such as the Tatars and the Bashkirs. Intermarriage became common with such tribes. This trading arrangement provided substantial benefits, monetary and otherwise, to the Oirat tayishis, noyons and zaisangs.

Fred Adelman described this era as the &quot;Frontier Period&quot;, lasting from the advent of the Torghut under Kho Orluk in 1630 to the end of the great khanate of Kho Orluk&#x27;s descendant, Ayuka Khan, in 1724, a phase accompanied by little discernible acculturative change:

During the era of Ayuka Khan, the Kalmyk Khanate reached its peak of military and political power. The Khanate experienced economic prosperity from free trade with Russian border towns, China, Tibet and with their Muslim neighbors. During this era, Ayuka Khan also kept close contacts with his Oirat kinsmen in Dzungaria, as well as the Dalai Lama in Tibet.

====From Oirat to Kalmyk====
Historically, Oirat identified themselves by their respective sub-group names. In the 15th century, the three major groups of Oirat formed an alliance, adopting &quot;Dörben Oirat&quot; as their collective name. In the early 17th century, a second great Oirat Confederation emerged, which later became the Dzungar Empire. While the Dzungars (initially Choros, Dörbet and Khoit tribes) were establishing their empire in Central Eurasia, the Khoshuts were establishing the Khoshut Khanate in Tibet, protecting the Gelugpa sect from its enemies, and the Torghuts formed the Kalmyk Khanate in the lower Volga region.

After encamping, the Oirats began to identify themselves as &quot;Kalmyk.&quot; This named was supposedly given to them by their Muslim neighbors and later used by the Russians to describe them. The Oirats used this name in their dealings with outsiders, viz., their Russian and Muslim neighbors. But they continued to refer to themselves by their tribal, clan, or other internal affiliations.

The name Kalmyk, however, wasn&#x27;t immediately accepted by all of the Oirat tribes in the lower Volga region. As late as 1761, the Khoshut and Dzungars (refugees from the Manchu Empire) referred to themselves and the Torghuts exclusively as Oirats. The Torghuts, by contrast, used the name Kalmyk for themselves as well as the Khoshut and Dzungars. 

Generally, European scholars have identified all western Mongolians collectively as Kalmyks, regardless of their location (Ramstedt, 1935: v–vi). Such scholars (e.g. Sebastian Muenster) have relied on Muslim sources who traditionally used the word &quot;Kalmyk&quot; to describe western Mongolians in a derogatory manner and the western Mongols of China and Mongolia have regarded that name as a term of abuse . Instead, they use the name Oirat or they go by their respective tribal names, e.g., Khoshut, Dörbet, Choros, Torghut, Khoit, Bayid, Mingat, etc. .

Over time, the descendants of the Oirat migrants in the lower Volga region embraced the name &quot;Kalmyk&quot; irrespective of their locations, viz., Astrakhan, the Don Cossack region, Orenburg, Stavropol, the Terek and the Ural Mountains. Another generally accepted name is &quot;Ulan Zalata&quot; or the &quot;red-buttoned ones&quot; .

====Reduction in autonomy, 1724–1771====
In January 1771 the oppression of Tsarist administration forced the larger part of Kalmyks (33 thousand households, or approximately 170,000–200,000 people) to migrate to Dzungaria.

Ubashi Khan, the great-grandson of Ayuka Khan and the last Kalmyk Khan, decided to return his people to their ancestral homeland, Dzungaria, and restore the Dzungar Khanate and Mongolian independence. As C.D Barkman notes, &quot;It is quite clear that the Torghuts had not intended to surrender the Chinese, but had hoped to lead an independent existence in Dzungaria.&quot;

Ubashi sent 30,000 cavalry in the first year of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) to gain weaponry before the migration. The 8th Dalai Lama was contacted to request his blessing and to set the date of departure. After consulting the astrological chart, he set a return date, but at the moment of departure, the weakening of the ice on the Volga River permitted only those Kalmyks (about 200,000 people) on the eastern bank to leave. Those 100,000–150,000 people on the western bank were forced to stay behind and Catherine the Great executed influential nobles from among them.

Approximately five-sixths of the Torghut followed Ubashi Khan. Most of the Khoshut, Choros, and Khoid also accompanied the Torghut on their journey to Dzungaria. The Dörbet Oirat, in contrast, elected not to go at all.

Catherine the Great asked the Russian army, Bashkirs, and Kazakh Khanate to stop all migrants. Beset by Kazakh raids, thirst and starvation, approximately 85,000 Kalmyks died on their way to Dzungaria. After failing to stop the flight, Catherine abolished the Kalmyk Khanate, transferring all governmental powers to the governor of Astrakhan. The title of Khan was abolished. The highest native governing office remaining was the Vice-Khan, who also was recognized by the government as the highest ranking Kalmyk prince. By appointing the Vice-Khan, the Russian Empire was now permanently the decisive force in Kalmyk government and affairs.

After seven months of travel, only one-third (66,073) of the original group reached Balkhash Lake, the western border of Qing China. This migration became the topic of &quot;The Revolt of the Tartars&quot;, by Thomas De Quincey.

The Qing shifted the Kalmyks to five different areas to prevent their revolt and influential leaders of the Kalmyks soon died. The migrant Kalmyks became known as Torghut in Qing China. The Torghut were coerced by the Qing into giving up their nomadic lifestyle and to take up sedentary agriculture instead as part of a deliberate policy by the Qing to enfeeble them.

===Life in the Russian Empire===
After the 1771 exodus, the Kalmyks that remained part of the Russian Empire continued their nomadic pastoral lifestyle, ranging the pastures between the Don and the Volga Rivers, wintering in the lowlands along the shores of the Caspian Sea as far as Sarpa Lake to the northwest and Lake Manych-Gudilo to the west. In the spring, they moved along the Don River and the Sarpa lake system, attaining the higher grounds along the Don in the summer, passing the autumn in the Sarpa and Volga lowlands. In October and November they returned to their winter camps and pastures .

Despite their great loss in population, the Torghut still remained numerically superior, dominating the Kalmyks. The other Kalmyks in Russia included Dörbet Oirats and Khoshut. Elements of the Choros and Khoit also were present but were too few in number to retain their &quot;ulus&quot; (tribal division) as independent administrative units. As a result, they were absorbed by the ulus of the larger tribes.

The factors that caused the 1771 exodus continued to trouble the remaining Kalmyks. In the wake of the exodus, the Torghuts joined the Cossack rebellion of Yemelyan Pugachev in hopes that he would restore the independence of the Kalmyks. After Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion was defeated, Catherine the Great transferred the office of the Vice-Khan from the Torghut tribe to the Dörbet, whose princes supposedly remained loyal to the government during the rebellion. Thus, the Torghut were removed from their role as the hereditary leaders of the Kalmyk people. The Khoshut could not challenge this political arrangement due to their smaller population size.
The disruptions to Kalmyk society caused by the exodus and the Torghut participation in the Pugachev Rebellion precipitated a major realignment in Kalmyk tribal structure. The government divided the Kalmyks into three administrative units attached, according to their respective locations, to the district governments of Astrakhan, Stavropol and the Don and appointed a special Russian official bearing the title of &quot;Guardian of the Kalmyk People&quot; for purposes of administration. The government also resettled some small groups of Kalmyks along the Ural, Terek and Kuma rivers and in Siberia.

The redistricting divided the now dominant Dörbet tribe into three separate administrative units. Those in the western Kalmyk Steppe were attached to the Astrakhan district government. They were called Baga (Lesser) Dörbet. By contrast, the Dörbets who moved to the northern part of the Stavropol province were called Ike (Greater) Dörbet even though their population was smaller. Finally, the Kalmyks of the Don became known as Buzava. Although they were composed of elements of all the Kalmyk tribes, the Buzava claimed descent from the Torghut tribe. Their name is derived from two tributaries of the Don River: Busgai and Busuluk. In 1798, Tsar Paul I recognized the Don Kalmyks as Don Cossacks. As such, they received the same rights and benefits as their Russian counterparts in exchange for providing national military services . At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Kalmyk cavalry units in Russian service entered Paris.

Over time, the Kalmyks gradually created fixed settlements with houses and temples, in place of transportable round felt yurts. In 1865, Elista, the future capital of the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was founded. This process lasted until well after the October Revolution of 1917.

===Russian Revolution and Civil War===

In the aftermath of the February Revolution, Kalmyk leaders believed that the Russian Provisional Government, which replaced the Tsarist government, would allow greater autonomy and freedom with respect to their culture, religion and economy. This enthusiasm, however, would soon dissolve after the Bolsheviks took control of the national government during the second revolution in November 1917.

After the Bolsheviks took control, various political and ethnic groups opposed to Communism organized in a loose political and military coalition known as the White movement. A volunteer &quot;White Army&quot; was raised to fight the Red Army, the military arm of the Bolshevik government. Initially, this army was composed primarily of volunteers and Tsarist supporters but were later joined by the Cossacks, including Don Kalmyks, many of whom resisted the Bolshevik policy of decossackization.

The second revolution split the Kalmyk people into opposing camps. Many were dissatisfied with the Tsarist government for its historic role in promoting the colonization of the Kalmyk steppe and in encouraging the russification of the Kalmyk people. But others also felt hostility towards Bolshevism for two reasons: (1) the loyalty of the Kalmyk people to their traditional leaders (i.e., nobility and clergy) – sources of anti-Communism – was deeply ingrained; and (2) the Bolshevik exploitation of the conflict between the Kalmyks and the local Russian peasants who seized Kalmyk land and livestock .

The Astrakhan Kalmyk nobility, led by Prince Danzan Tundutov of the Baga Dörbets and Prince Sereb-Djab Tiumen of the Khoshuts, expressed their anti-Bolshevik sentiments by seeking to integrate the Astrakhan Kalmyks into the military units of the Astrakhan Cossacks. But before a general mobilization of Kalmyk horsemen could occur, the Red Army seized power in Astrakhan and in the Kalmyk steppe thereby preventing the mobilization from occurring.

After the capture of Astrakhan, the Bolsheviks engaged in savage reprisals against the Kalmyk people, especially against Buddhist temples and the Buddhist clergy . Eventually the Bolsheviks would draft as many as 18,000 Kalmyk horsemen in the Red Army to prevent them from joining the White Army . This objective, however, failed to prevent many Red Army Kalmyk horsemen from defecting to the White side.

The majority of the Don Kalmyks also sided with the White Movement to preserve their Cossack lifestyle and proud traditions. As Don Cossacks, the Don Kalmyks first fought under White army General Anton Denikin and then under his successor, General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel. Because the Don Cossack Host to which they belonged was the main center of the White Movement and of Cossack resistance, the battles were fought on Cossack lands and were disastrous for the Don Cossacks as villages and entire regions changed hands repeatedly in a fratricidal conflict in which both sides committed terrible atrocities. The Don Cossacks, including the Don Kalmyks, experienced heavy military and civilian losses, either from the fighting itself or from starvation and disease induced by the war. Some argue that the Bolsheviks were guilty of the mass extermination of the Don Cossack people, killing an estimated 70 percent (or 700,000 persons) of the Don Cossack population .

By October 1920, the Red Army smashed General Wrangel&#x27;s resistance in the Crimea, forcing the evacuation of some 150,000 White army soldiers and their families to Constantinople, Turkey. A small group of Don Kalmyks managed to escape on the British and French vessels. The chaos at the Russian port city of Novorossiysk was described by Major H.N.H. Williamson of the British Military Mission to the Don Cossacks as follows:
From there, this group resettled in Europe, primarily in Belgrade (where they established the fourth Buddhist temple in Europe), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and France where its leaders remained active in the White movement. In 1922, several hundred Don Kalmyks returned home under a general amnesty. Some returnees, including Prince Dmitri Tundutov, were imprisoned and then executed soon after their return.

=== Formation of the Kalmyk Soviet Republic ===
The Soviet government established the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast in November 1920. It was formed by merging the Stavropol Kalmyk settlements with a majority of the Astrakhan Kalmyks. A small number of Don Kalmyks (Buzava) from the Don Host migrated to this Oblast. The administrative center was Elista, a small village in the western part of the Oblast that was expanded in the 1920s to reflect its status as the capital of the Oblast.

In October 1935, the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast was reorganized into the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The chief occupations of the Republic were cattle breeding, agriculture, including the growing of cotton and fishing. There was no industry.

=== Collectivization and revolts ===
On 22 January 1922, Mongolia proposed to migrate the Kalmyks during famine in Kalmykia but Russia refused; 71–72,000 Kalmyks died during the famine. The Kalmyks revolted against Russia in 1926, 1930 and 1942–1943. In March 1927, Soviet deported 20,000 Kalmyks to Siberia, tundra and Karelia. Soviet scientists attempted to convince the Kalmyks and Buryats that they were not Mongols during the 20th century under the demongolization policy.

In 1929, Joseph Stalin ordered the forced collectivization of agriculture, forcing the Astrakhan Kalmyks to abandon their traditional nomadic pastoralist lifestyle and to settle in villages. All Kalmyk herdsmen owning more than 500 sheep were deported to labor camps in Siberia.

===World War II and exile===
In June 1941 the German army invaded the Soviet Union, ultimately taking (some) control of the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In December 1942, however, the Red Army in their turn re-invaded the Republic. On 28 December 1943, the Soviet government accused the Kalmyks of collaborating with the Germans and deported the entire population, including Kalmyk Red Army soldiers, to various locations in Central Asia and Siberia. Within 24 hours the population transfer occurred at night during winter without notice in unheated cattle cars.

According to N. F. Bugai, the leading Russian expert on deportations, 4.9% of the Kalmyk population died during the first three months of 1944; 1.5% in the first three months of 1945; and 0.7% in the same period of 1946. From 1945 to 1950, 15,206 Kalmyks died and 7843 were born.

The Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was quickly dissolved. Its territory was divided and transferred to the adjacent regions, viz., the Astrakhan and Stalingrad Oblasts and Stavropol Krai. Since no Kalmyks lived there any longer the Soviet authorities changed the names of towns and villages from Kalmyk names to Russian names. For example, Elista became Stepnoi.

===Return from Siberian exile===


Around half of (97–98,000) Kalmyk people deported to Siberia died before being allowed to return home in 1957. The government of the Soviet Union forbade teaching Kalmyk Oirat during the deportation. The Kalmyks&#x27; main purpose was to migrate to Mongolia. Under the Law of the Russian Federation of April 26, 1991, &quot;On Rehabilitation of Exiled Peoples&quot;, repressions against Kalmyks and other peoples were qualified as an act of genocide.

In 1957, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev permitted the Kalmyk people to return to their home. Upon return, however, the Kalmyks found their homeland had become settled by Russians and Ukrainians, many of whom chose to remain. On January 9, 1957, Kalmykia once again became an autonomous oblast, and on 29 July 1958, an autonomous republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

In the following years bad planning of agricultural and irrigation projects resulted in widespread desertification. In addition, industrial plants were constructed without an analysis of the economic viability of such plants.

In 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kalmykia chose to remain an autonomous republic of the successor government, the Russian Federation. The dissolution, however, facilitated the collapse of the economy at both the national and the local level, causing widespread economic and social hardship. The resulting upheaval caused many young Kalmyks to leave Kalmykia, especially in the rural areas, for economic opportunities in and outside the Russian Federation.

The local Supreme Soviet decided in 1992 to change the name of the republic to Khalmg Tangch. In June 1993, the Kalmyk authorities laid claim to the of the Volga delta that were not returned to Kalmyks when the Kalmyk ASSR was recreated in 1957. The Kalmyk authorities claimed that under the terms of the 1991 law On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples, the lands, currently in the Astrakhan Oblast and Dagestan, would formally belong to Kalmykia with effect from July 1, 1993. The long-standing dispute over the delineation of Kalmykia&#x27;s borders with Astrakhan oblast and Dagestan resurfaced in 2005, but no border changes were made.

The Kalmyks&#x27; ability to maintain a mostly homogeneous existence contrasts with the Russian admixture with other similar people, &quot;as there is evidence for Russian admixture with Yakuts,&quot; for example. Thus far, genetic analysis of the Kalmyks supports their Mongol roots that also shows that entire families of Kalmyks moved to the Volga region and not simply males as is generally the case with most nomadic tribal groups:
In modern times, Kalmykia has friendly diplomatic and cultural ties with Mongolia. In the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine since 2022, the Kalmyks have been reported as one of Russia&#x27;s ethnic minority groups suffering from a disproportionally large casualty rate among Russian forces.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Kalmyk&quot; is a word of Turkic origin that means &quot;remnant&quot; or &quot;to remain&quot;. Turkic tribes may have used this name as early as the thirteenth century. Arab geographer Ibn al-Wardi is documented as the first person to use the term in referring to the Oirats in the fourteenth century . The khojas of Kashgaria applied the name to Oirats in the fifteenth century . Russian written sources mentioned the name &quot;Kolmak Tatars&quot; as early as 1530, and cartographer Sebastian Muenster (1488–1552) circumscribed the territory of the &quot;Kalmuchi&quot; on a map in his &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, which was published in 1544. The Oirats themselves, however, did not accept the name as their own.

==Subgroups==
There are these main ethnic subgroups of Kalmyks: Baatud, Dörbet, Khoid, Khoshut, Olot, Torghut and Buzava. The Torghuts and Dörbets are numerically dominant. The Buzavs are a small minority and are considered to be the most russified Kalmyks.

==Demographics==


== Location ==
The Kalmyks live primarily in the Republic of Kalmykia, a federal subject of Russia. Kalmykia is located in the southeast European part of Russia, between the Volga and the Don rivers. It has borders with the Republic of Dagestan in the south; the Stavropol Krai in the southwest; and the Rostov Oblast and the Volgograd Oblast in the west and the northwest, respectively. Its eastern border is the Astrakhan Oblast. The southeast border is the Caspian Sea.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, a large number of Kalmyks, primarily the young, moved from Kalmykia to larger cities in Russia, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, and to the United States. The move was precipitated by the desire of these Kalmyks to pursue better educational and economic opportunities and continues today.

Currently, Kalmyks form a majority of the population in Kalmykia. According to the 2021 Russian census, there was a total of 159,138 Kalmyks who resided within Kalmykia. This represented 62.5% of the total population of the republic in 2021. In addition, Kalmyks have a much higher fertility rate than Russians and the other Slavic peoples, while the median age of the Kalmyk population is much lower than Russians. This ensures that the Kalmyk population will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.

== Religion ==


The Kalmyks are the only European ethnic group whose primary religion is Buddhism. They embraced Tibetan Buddhism in the early part of the 17th century and belong to the Tibetan Buddhist sect known as the Gelugpa (Virtuous Way). The Gelugpa are commonly referred to as the Yellow Hat sect. This religion is derived from the Indian Mahayana Buddhism. In the West, it was formerly referred to as Lamaism, from the name of the Tibetan monks, the lamas.

Historically, Kalmyk clergy received their training either on the steppe or in Tibet. The pupils who received their religious training on the steppe joined Kalmyk monasteries, which were active centers of learning. Many of these monasteries operated out of felt tents, which accompanied the Kalmyk tribes as they migrated. The Oirats maintained tent monasteries throughout present-day eastern Kazakhstan and along the migratory route they took across southern Siberia to the Volga. They also maintained tent monasteries around Lake Issyk Kul in present-day Kyrgyzstan.

The Oirats also built stone monasteries in the regions of eastern Kazakhstan. For instance, the remains of stone Buddhist monasteries have been found at Almalik and at Kyzyl-Kent (See image to the right). In addition, there was a great Buddhist monastery in Semipalatinsk (seven palaces), which derives its name from that seven-halled Buddhist temple. Further, remains of Buddhist monasteries have been found at Ablaiket near Ust Kamenogorsk and at Talgar, near Almaty, and at Sumbe in the Narynkol region, bordering China.

Upon completion of training, Kalmyk clergy dispensed not only spiritual guidance but also medical advice. As clergymen, the Kalmyk lamas enjoyed great political influence among the nobility and held a strong influence over the general tribal population. For many commoners, the only path to literacy and prestige was to join the Kalmyk monastic system.

As a matter of policy, the Tsarist government and the Russian Orthodox Church sought to gradually absorb and convert any subject of another creed or nationality. The aim of the policy was to eliminate foreign influence and to entrench newly annexed areas. The baptized indigenous population would then become loyal to the Russian empire and would agree to be governed by Russian officials.

In the 1700s, some Kalmyks converted to Roman Catholicism, however their numbers were insignificant compared to Kalmyk converts to Islam who were more numerous. One group of Kalmyk Muslims were known as the Tomuts who were formed as the offspring of mixed marriages between Kalmyk women and Kazakh and Bashkir communities who lived among the Kalmyks and by the end of the 1730s they numbered around 600 tents. Another group of Kalmyk Muslims was known as the Sherets, they consisted of 120 tents and in 1733 they fled from the Derbet tayishi Cheter and settled near Azov. Later they were transferred to Crimea where they converted to Islam. In 1744, 233 Kalmyk men and 413 Kalmyk women were converted to Islam by the Astrakhan Tatars. Today, Sart Kalmyks living in Kyrgyzstan are predominantly Sunni Muslims.

A small percentage of Kalmyk-Cossack families in Belarus converted to Judaism in the early 19th century.

The Kalmyks migrated to territory annexed by the Tsarist government and were subject to this policy of conversion as long as they remained in this territory, but the efforts of the Tsarist government remained unsuccessful for the most part. However, the policy did contribute to the conversion of some of the Kalmyk nobility. One of the earliest converts were the children of Donduk-Ombo, the sixth Khan of the Kalmyks who reigned between 1737 and 1741, and his Circassian-born wife (See Dondukov family). Another important convert was Baksaday-Dorji, the grandson of Ayuka Khan who adopted the Christian name, Peter Taishin. Each conversion was motivated by political ambition to become the Kalmyk Khan. Kalmyk Tayishis, by contrast, were given salaries and towns and settlements were established for them and their ulus. Kalmyk converts, however, often continued to follow Buddhist law instead of Christian law.

Later on, the Tsarist government policy of encouraging Russian and German settlements along the Volga indirectly pressured Kalmyks to convert for economic reasons. The settlers took the most fertile land along the river, leaving barren lands for the Kalmyks to graze their herds. The resulting reduction of herds led to impoverishment for Kalmyk Tayishis, some of whom led their ulus to Christianity to obtain economic benefits.

To discourage the monastic lifestyle, the government required the building of permanent structures at government determined construction sites while imposing Russian architects . This policy resulted in the suspension of Lamaist canonical regulations governing monastery construction and in Kalmyk temples resembling Russian Orthodox churches. For example, the Khosheutovsky khurul is modeled after the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Other policies the Tsarist government implemented after the abolition of the Kalmyk Khanate in 1771, sought to gradually weaken the influence of the lamas. For instance, the government limited Kalmyk contact with Tibet. In addition, the Tsar began appointing the Šajin Lama (title of the High Lama of the Kalmyks). Further, the economic crises that resulted from settler encroachment forced many monasteries and temples to close and lamas to adopt a secularized lifestyle. The success of this policy is borne out by the decrease in the number of Kalmyk monasteries in the Volga region during the 19th century .

Like the Tsarist government, the Communist regime was aware of the influence the Kalmyk clergy held over the general population. In the 1920s and the 1930s, the Soviet government implemented policies to eliminate religion through control and suppression. Towards that end, Kalmyk khuruls (temples) and monasteries were destroyed and property confiscated; the clergy and many believers were harassed, killed, or sent to labor camps; religious artifacts and books were destroyed; and young men were prohibited from religious training.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Buddhist temples and monasteries were destroyed and almost all of the spiritual leaders were arrested. By 1940 all Kalmyk Buddhist temples were either closed or destroyed and the clergy systematically oppressed. Dr. Loewenthal writes that the policies were so enforced that the Kalmyk clergy and Buddhism were not mentioned in the work by B. Dzhimbinov, &quot;Sovetskaya Kalmykiya,&quot; published in 1940. In 1944, the Soviet government exiled all Kalmyks not fighting in the Soviet army to Central Asia and Siberia, accusing them of collaborating with Nazi Germany. Upon rehabilitation in 1957, the Kalmyks were permitted to return home from exile, but all attempts by them to restore their religion and to build a temple failed.

By the 1980s, the Soviet campaign against religion was so successful that a majority of the Kalmyks had never received any formal spiritual guidance. By the late 1980s, however, the Soviet government reversed course and implemented policies favoring the liberalization of religion. As a result, the first Buddhist community was organized in 1988. By 1995, there were 21 Buddhist temples, 17 places of worship for various Christian denominations, and 1 mosque in the Republic of Kalmykia .

On December 27, 2005, a new khurul opened in Elista, the capital of the Republic of Kalmykia. The khurul was named &quot;Burkhan Bakshin Altan Sume&quot;. It is the largest Buddhist temple in Europe. The government of the Republic of Kalmykia sought to build a magnificent temple of a monumental scale in hopes of creating an international learning center for Buddhist scholars and students from all over the world. More significantly, the temple is a monument to the Kalmyk people who died in exile between 1944 and 1957.

The Kalmyks of Kyrgyzstan live primarily in the Karakol region of eastern Kyrgyzstan. They are referred to as &quot;Sart Kalmyks.&quot; The origin of this name is unknown. Likewise, it is not known when, why and from where this small group of Kalmyks migrated to eastern Kyrgyzstan. Due to their minority status, the Sart Kalmyks have adopted the Turkic language and culture of the majority Kyrgyz population. As a result, nearly all now belong to the Muslim faith.

Although Sart Kalmyks are Muslims, Kalmyks elsewhere by and large remain faithful to the Gelugpa Order of Tibetan Buddhism. In Kalmykia, for example, the Gelugpa Order with the assistance of the government has constructed numerous Buddhist temples. In addition, the Kalmyk people recognize Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and Erdne Ombadykow, a Kalmyk American, as the supreme lama of the Kalmyk people. The Dalai Lama has visited Elista on a number of occasions. Buddhism and Christianity have been given the status of state religions. In November 2004 the 14th Dalai Lama visited Kalmykia. In October 2022, Erdne Ombadykow, the Supreme Lama of Kalmykia, condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and fled Russia to Mongolia. In January 2023, he was recognized in Russia as a foreign agent.

== Language ==

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; classifies Kalmyk Oirat as a member of the Eastern branch of the Mongolic languages: &quot;Mongolic, Eastern, Oirat-Khalkha, Oirat-Kalmyk-Darkhat&quot;. This places Standard Mongolian – which is essentially Khalkha Mongolian – and Kalmyk Oirat fairly close together.

Other linguists, such as Nicholas Poppe, have classified Kalmyk Oirat as belonging to the Western branch of the Mongolian language division and thus more distant from Khalkha and Standard Mongolian as spoken in modern Mongolia, since the language group developed separately and is distinct. Poppe also contends that Kalmyk and Oirat are two distinct languages in spite of little phonetic and morphological difference between them, and that the major distinction is in their lexicons. The Kalmyk language, for example, has adopted many words of Russian origin. Consequently, mainly on lexical grounds, Kalmyk is classified as a distinct language .

By population, the major dialects of Kalmyk are Torghut, Dörbet and Buzava . Minor dialects include Khoshut and Olöt. The Kalmyk dialects vary somewhat, but their differences are insignificant. Generally, the Russian language less influenced the dialects of the pastoral nomadic Kalmyk tribes of the Volga region.

In contrast, the Dörbets (and later on, Torghuts) who migrated from the Volga region to the of the Don Host Oblast took the name Buzava (or Don Kalmyks). The Buzava dialect developed from their close interaction with Russians. In 1798 the Tsarist government recognized the Buzava as Don Cossacks, both militarily and administratively. As a result of their integration into the Don Host, the Buzava dialect incorporated many words of Russian origin. 

In 1938, the Kalmyk literary language started using Cyrillic script.
During World War II, all Kalmyks not fighting in the Soviet Army were forcibly exiled to Siberia and Central Asia, where they were dispersed and not permitted to speak Kalmyk in public places. As a result, the Kalmyk language was not formally taught to the younger generation of Kalmyks.
Upon return from exile in 1957, the Kalmyks spoke and published primarily in Russian. Consequently, the younger generation of Kalmyks primarily speak Russian and not their own native language. This is a subject of popular concern. In recent years, the Kalmyk government has made attempts to revive the Kalmyk language. Some laws have been passed regarding the usage of Kalmyk on shop signs; for example, on entrance doors, the words &#x27;Entrance&#x27; and &#x27;Push-Pull&#x27; appear in Kalmyk.

According to UNESCO&#x27;s 2010 edition of the &quot;Red Book of Endangered Languages&quot;, the Kalmyk language classified as definitely endangered.

== Writing system ==

In the 17th century, Zaya Pandita, a Khoshut Buddhist monk, devised a writing system, Clear Script, based on the classical vertical Mongol script in order to phonetically capture the Oirat language. In the later part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries, Clear Script fell into disuse until the Kalmyks abandoned it in 1923 and introduced the Cyrillic script. In 1930, Kalmyk language scholars introduced a modified Latin alphabet, but it was not used for long.

The mean annual temperature is 16 degrees Celsius, and the coldest months perennially are January and February, the hottest are July and August. The mean annual precipitation is around 1,300 millimeters and changes greatly from year to year. The hyetal distribution is also uneven during a year, and the rainfall centers on East Asian rainy season (梅雨) (aka bai-u rainy period) from April to June and typhoon period from July to December.

Yuyao offers a wide variety of landscape from wide open ocean in Hangzhou Bay, rice fields in fertile plains to high spires in Siming Mountains. Yaojiang River originates in Siming Mountains in the south where the Ninth Fantasy world of Taoism is located. Yaojiang River goes through the county and extends eastward into East China Sea as well as Pacific Ocean.

In 2021, Typhoon In-fa caused 951.0 mm of rainfall to fall in Yuyao.

==History==
Yuyao is well known for its rich heritage of civilization. The Neolithic Hemudu culture formed in Yuyao about 5,000 B.C. is one of the earliest sites of human civilization on earth. The material and ethical relics revealed large-scale rice plantation and other agricultural activities, hurdle style architecture, paddling and boating and respecting birds and sun.

Yuyao also produced many famous scholars in history—for example, Yan Zi-Ling during the Han dynasty; Yu Fan during the Three Kingdoms period; Yu Xi during the Jin dynasty; Yu Shinan during the Sui and Tang dynasties; and Wang Yangming, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Zongxi during the Ming dynasty. Wang Yangming and Huang Zongxi were ranked among China&#x27;s top 10 ideologists. Yuyao was then named as &quot;the Most Famous County&quot; and &quot;the Famous State on Literature&quot;. During the Anti-Japanese War, Yuyao was one of China&#x27;s 19 bases against Japanese invaders and was the center of anti-Japanese bases of eastern Zhejiang province.

==Administrative divisions==

The only township is Luting Township (鹿亭乡)

==Economy==
Yuyao is known as a place for rice and fish. Its economy has been booming as private enterprises dominate after the economic reform began in late 1970s. In 2007, GDP will reach RMB 34 billions, with double digit annual growth rates over the past 20 years. It ranked as one of the top-20 counties in terms of comprehensive economic strength out of all the 2100 counties in China. The industry products are mainly electric appliances, plastic moulding, machinery and textiles. High-tech industries such as materials, optical, electro-mechanical integration and fine chemical industry are developing rapidly. The main agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry products of Yuyao are tea, fruits like waxberry and mandarin orange, bamboo, silkworm, fowl, livestock and fish. Fresh produce is available in all seasons.

==Transport==
The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway and China National Highway 329 and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway go through Yuyao. The world&#x27;s longest trans-oceanic bridge – the Hangzhou Bay Bridge – was recently completed construction near the northern border of Yuyao. It reduced the cross bay traffic to only from the current section of Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway around Hangzhou Bay.

<text>Liu Huaqing (; 1 October 1916 – 14 January 2011) was a Chinese revolutionary and an admiral of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy, who served as the third Commander-in-Chief of the Navy from 1982 through 1988. He is considered to have greatly contributed to the modernization of the Chinese Navy, and is hailed as the &quot;father of the modern Chinese Navy&quot; and &quot;father of Chinese aircraft carriers&quot;.

== Biography ==
Taking over the role of Navy Commander-in-Chief from his predecessor Ye Fei (who retired due to health problems), Liu had outlined a three-step process by which China would have a navy of global reach by the second half of the 21st century. In step one, from 2000 to 2010, China would develop a naval force that could operate up to the first island chain. In step two, from 2010 to 2020, China&#x27;s navy would become a regional force capable of projecting force to the second island chain. In step three, to be achieved by 2040, China would possess a blue-water navy centered around aircraft carriers. From 1954 to 1958, Liu studied under the Admiral Sergei Gorshkov at the Voroshilov Naval Academy in Leningrad. He was a strong advocate of the Chinese aircraft carrier programme. 

Liu encouraged technological innovation within China that would increase naval capabilities, but he also advocated large foreign purchases. During the 1960s and 1970s, Liu was responsible for naval research and development before heading national military research. He was also the top commander of the troops enforcing martial law to suppress the Tiananmen Square protests on 3–4 June 1989.

In 1990, Liu became the Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC). 

In 1992, Liu became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. He was the last Standing Committee member of an active military personnel. Since he left the Standing Committee in 1997, no other military leader has sat on the committee. Liu officially retired after stepping down as Vice Chairman of the CMC in March 1998.

Liu remained active through the mid-1990s and appeared in uniform at 2007 commemorations of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in Beijing. He also appeared in Beijing during the 60th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 2009.

Liu died on 14 January 2011 in Beijing. His son Liu Zhuoming is a vice admiral of the PLA Navy. His daughter Liu Chaoying, a former lieutenant colonel in the PLA, was a major figure in the 1996 United States campaign finance controversy.

<doc id="192437" wikidata="Q16909442" url="?curid=192437" title="Hui pan-nationalism">
<text>Hui pan-nationalism refers to the common identity among diverse communities of Chinese-speaking Muslims (typically members of the Hui ethnic-cultural group). Hui pan-nationalism should be distinguished from nationalist sentiments by minority groups who are also Muslim such as those of the Uyghurs. These sentiments are grounded upon the Hui &quot;zealously preserving and protecting their identity as enclaves ensconced in the dominant Han society.&quot; In exchange for support during the Cultural Revolution, the Hui were granted high political participation. Hui pan-nationalism was one of the first sources of modern Chinese nationalism, influenced by Western, Japanese and Soviet influences.

Some of the various Chinese Muslim groups included under the Hui are the Hui, Dungans, and Panthays. Because the Uyghurs are not of Sinitic origin, but rather Turkic, they are not included.

== History ==
Throughout history, the Hui have endured significant difficulties in maintaining pan-nationalistic identity. This includes maintaining the territorial boundary of their group, whilst attempting to integrate into larger society. This has posed significant challenges to the survival of the Hui, resulting in a need for Hui pan-nationalism. Some Muslims however, instead have assimilated their Hui identity into the traditional Han as a response to this challenge. This forced integration has led to Muslim-led rebellions (which were later suppressed), along with the complete alienation of the Hui identity.

=== Tang dynasty ===
Muslims arrived into China in the late 7th century as merchants. As an emerging, nascent identity in China, spreading Islam and the implementation of Shari’a law, and thus Hui pan-nationalism was of low priority. Instead, the early settlers mode of existence was founded upon secularity, naturalisation and assimilation. This identification of the Hui as ‘foreign merchants’ remained pervasive until the fall of the Song dynasty and establishment of the Yaun dynasty. The state remained responsible for managing the naturalisation of new populations into society.

=== Yuan dynasty ===
The fall of the Song dynasty ended fanfang (蕃坊) settlements of Muslims and Muslims were moved from commercial city enclaves to dispersed communities across China. Though fanfang settlements consolidated Hui identity, there was no real autonomy.

=== Ming dynasty ===
The fall of the Yuan dynasty and subsequent dissolution of the Mongol racial class system, was met with state-sanction program of Sinicization (cultural integration). This in culmination with the state imposing a monopoly on trade during agrarian distress, resulted in some Hui physically rebelling against government forces in the late Ming and Early Qing period. This was one of the first overt, physical manifestations of Hui pan-nationalism.

=== Qing dynasty ===
The Qing dynasty was marked by collective violence and anti-Hui political, social and literary discourse, known as Hui-phobia.

Nationalism became introduced into Chinese politics as a system of defence and regeneration in response to emerging western imperialism and the weakening of the Qing Dynasty. However, tensions rose between group rights and the need for national unity. These late-Qing revolutionists led by Sun Yat-Sen aspired to establish a Chinese state based on a single minzu model, the minzu being predominately Han. In response, the book the Muslim Awakening, written by Chinese students, published in 1908, was an early literary attempt of pan-nationalism; forming a group identity and rejecting the single minzu formation.

The defeat of China in the First Opium War and the First Sino-Japanese war was a major catalyst to fuelling Chinese nationalism.

During this time, theorist Liang Qichao developed two Chinese terms to describe these emerging themes of nationalism; minzuzhuyi, big or state nationalism and xiao minzuzhuyi, small or ethnic nationalism. Big nationalism encouraged the Hui to consider the positions as Chinese citizens; which takes precedence over their ethnic identities. Their ‘small’ nationalism however, conversely awards them a limited amount of freedom to identify as ethnically different from the Han majority.

==== Dungan Revolt ====
The Dungan Revolt by the Hui in the 1860s and 1870s was a “bloodbath.&quot; This rebellion was led by Ma Hualong, and cut off the Qing state from the northwest of China.

==== Panthay Rebellion ====
The Panthay Rebellion was a Hui rebellion against the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty in southwestern Yunnan Province.

After the failure of many rebellions, many Hui fled to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, in Soviet Central Asia.

=== Republic of China ===

The establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 promoted the idea of nationality unity among all ethnic groups in China. President Sun Yat-Sen called for the “unification of China” and emphasised the equality among ethnic groups. This led to the establishment of the ‘Five Races under One Union’ or Five Official Nationalities, which encompassed the Hui&#x27;s among other ethnic groups. This initially encompassed all Chinese Muslims and ethnic Hui (Turks) in the Xinjiang province. This document stated that China was composite of different yet politically equal groups. This state recognition of the Hui was a success to the efforts of Hui pan-nationalism. However, whilst Sun&#x27;s recognition of the five Chinese nationalities, his ultimate goal was assimilationist; &quot;Foreign observers say that Chinese are a sheet of loose sand. Why is this? It’s because the people as a whole care about the doctrines of the family and clan but not the state-nation. For Chinese, the unifying force of family and clan is very great indeed and many have been willing to sacrifice their families and lives to defend the clan. But there has never been a case of such a supreme sacrifice for the sake of the country. So the unifying force of the Chinese extends only to the clan, not as far as to the nation-state.”By involving the collective population, the Nationalists thought they could prevent the total dismemberment of the Chinese state.

Within the national government, Chiang Kai-shek nationalist party were vehement in their denial of other Chinese nationalities; arguing that groups such as the Hui were merely a subvariety of the same minzu. The communists, which later established the People&#x27;s Republic of China, would later regard Hui as a distinct nationality rather than a religious sub-division.

However, following the successive victories in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, Japan planned psychological warfare to mobilise the people of Huijiao (Hui religion), which continued until the end of World War II. The Japanese capitalised on Hui pan-nationalism ideals to project their agenda on the Hui populace. This mobilisation by the Japanese aided in fostering declining attitudes of nationalism, as many Hui were satisfied with the state&#x27;s recognition of the Hui in the ‘Five Official Nationalities.’

By the 1920s in China, propaganda efforts such as the founding of the magazine Huiguang 回光 (Light of Islam) within the Society of Light (International Moslem Association) were common. In an article entitled “Political Situation of China and Muslims” (1925), the author, Teijirō Sakuma, called on Muslims in China to strive for independence. Sakuma reasons that the Hui was a zu (“race” or “nationality”) with state recognition, that should be able to claim political rights and resort to political actions when necessary. According to Sakuma, Huizu (“Hui nationality”) was built on a religious basis and this independent nationhood of Huizu was consistent with ideals of Pan-Islamism.

In 1933, the separatist state, the First East Turkestan Republic was established by the Uyghur nationality in the western Xinjiang province. In 1934, the Guomindang government, the Chinese National Party led by Chiang Kai-shek, allied with the Hui warlord Ma Zhongying to overthrow the separatist state. The Hui cooperation with the Han government in defending the territorial integrity of the Chinese nation shows how the Hui successfully consolidated their own ethnic ‘Hui’ identity, whilst working with the Han in defence of their common Chinese national identity.

The Association of Research on the National Question in the North West Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party edited a comprehensive document investigating the Hui minority, published in 1941. It strongly criticised the Japanese narrative which promoted the ‘self determination of Hui’ to establish a Hui nation-state through secession. The CCP also recognised that the Hui people were oppressed by international imperialism represented by the Japanese invasion and the domestic ‘national oppression’ the Han.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The nationality policy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was formulated in the 1930s. This was in order to enlist support against the Chiang Kai-shek nationality policy which de-emphasised ethnic differences in favour of unity of all peoples as member of the Chinese race. This was encapsulated during the Long March, as communist leaders were faced with extermination unless promised affordances were granted to the minorities. As a show of good will, first Hui autonomous county was set up in the 1930s in Tongxin, southern Ningxia. Mao Zedong issued appeals to the northwest Hui to support the Communists&#x27; cause, one slogan of the Communist 15th Army Corps was: &quot;Build our own antiJapanese Mohammedan Red Army.&quot; Later party documents revealed that Chairman Mao promised self-determination to minorities until 1937. Despite having the right to secede, this was withdrawn in 1940, a much more limited sense of autonomy.

Confucianism, an influential Chinese philosophy promoted assimilation and acculturation of minority people in Han society. The PRC used this as the basis for the Ronghe policy. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) subsequently argued that minorities would only be able to achieve socialist transformation and modernity by establishing a social system under the CCP. A minor approach was first taken, exemplified in 1957 by the PRC Premier, Zhou Enlai, who stated that &quot;assimilation would not be welcome if achieved by force.&quot; However, this was later replaced by political extremism and forced assimilation imposed by the Cultural Revolution. Despite governance shift in 1978, ronghe ideology lives on.

The question if the Hui are a nationality (minzu) was the basis of several Communist Party documents dating from the 1940s, published for the first time publicly in 1980 as Huihui minzu wenti (The question of the Hui hui nationality). 

Following Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, the Hui and Han have reached a mutual tolerance, with the CCP attempting to rectify Mao&#x27;s intolerant policies on religion that he exhibited during the cultural revolution and instead focus on acceptance and reformation, achieved by restoring the moderate approach to ethnic policies it had taken pre-1957.

As a result, the Hui are allowed to practice Shari’a law to a limited extent across China and are responsible for Ningixa Hui Autonomous Region. Legislatively, political rights are enshrined. In Article 4 of the PRC Constitution of 1982, it declares that all nationalities have the right to preserve or change their own ways and customs and develop their own languages. Religious freedom of minorities is also protected by the Chinese State under Article 36 of the PRC Constitution.

Compared to the status of other Muslim groups, these successes are attributed to the Hui&#x27;s “skill of negotiating around the grey areas of China’s political system and the pan-nationalist movement.&quot; This is prevalent in the autonomous region, Xinjiang assigned to the Hui governance, along with 2 autonomous prefectures, 9 autonomous counties and a number of autonomous townships.

Despite legal assurances, Muslim minority groups are facing an increasing &#x27;crackdown&#x27; on their religious practices under the guise of the Global War on Terror, whereby their international connections and links to Islam are seen as a threat to Chinese nationalism, as is evident in the CCP&#x27;s actions in Xinjiang in regards to the East Turkestan independence movement. This is in response to a number of terrorist incidents carried out by local Uyghur jihadists with links to ETIM. ETIM is declared a terrorist organization by UN.

Historian Jin Jitang 金吉堂, argues that Huijiao minzu 回教民族 (“Huireligion nationality”) or Huimin/zu (“Hui people/nationality”) is a Sinophone Muslim ethnicity. This argument for a seperae Sinophone Muslim identity became popular among the Hui elites in the later years of the Republic. Communist theorists used his argument to justify their early treatment of the Hui as an ethnic minority or ‘minority nationality’, resulting on the Chinese Communist Party identifying Chinese Muslims as a historically oppressed minzu rather than a religious group.

==== Shadian incident ====
The Shadian incident in Yunnan in 1975, left over 1600 Hui dead.

==== 1989 protests ====
In March 1989, a book ‘Sexual Customs’ (Xingfengsu 性风俗) was published in Shanghai; in May, Hui student-led protests ensued over the book&#x27;s contents. Protestors claimed that the book “denigrated Islam.” Over 3000 Muslims in Beijing attended, with over 20,000 in Lanzhou, 100,000 in Xining and smaller protests in Ürümqi, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Wuhan and Yunnan during April and May. In response, the state met the demands of the protestors, banning the book entirely. Reportedly, 13 million copies were confiscated. 95,240 copies were burnt publicly in Lanzhou, the Shanghai editors were fired with the publication houses shortly closed for “reorganisation”.

===== 1989 Iranian presidential visit =====
This visit sparked a &quot;fourth tide&quot; in Muslim identity in China. This is due to the subsequent state sponsored tourism and private Islamic investment opportunities that were encouraged following this visit.

== Significant contributors ==
=== Ya’wub Wang Jingzhai ===
Ya’wub Wang Jingzhai (1879–1949) was an early theorist and religious scholar, also known as one of the “Four Great Akhonds”. Wang Jingzhai promoted the compatibility of pan-Islamic identity with Hui nationalism, and Hui nationalism with Chinese nationalism. These concepts stimulated traction among the Hui community, but were also threatened by increasing Japanese mobilisation of the Hui, and later invasion during WWII.

One of his articles published in the widely read Chinese Muslim article Yuehua 月華 interpreted the hadith, “the love of one’s homeland [springs forth] from the faith,&quot; specific to homeland, and therefore, the Hui should defend and build their homeland (China). This among with other direct scriptural justifications for nationalism were disseminated for Chinese Muslim audiences.

=== Xue Wenbo ===
Xue Wenbo (薛文波; 1909–1984), using a Leninist framework, constructed a “unified consciousness of the Pan-Islamic nation.&quot; He argued that the ‘Huizu’ are the oppressed proletarians of the world, with most wishing to unite under the banner of Islam. (Huijiao).

=== Ma Jian ===
In 1950, Ma Jian published an article in &#x27;The People&#x27;s Daily.&#x27; His article criticised imperialism in his justification for religious freedom in China.

=== Ma Shouqian ===
The nationalist fervor that embodied Hui intellectuals in the first half of the century, Ma Shouqian has recently termed &quot;the New Awakening of the Hui at the end of f9th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&quot;

=== Islamic discourse ===
Many religious Chinese imams and students were influenced by various anti-imperialist Islamic texts from authors such as Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905) and Muhib al-Din al-Khatib (1886–1969) which reinforced their national Chinese identity with religious justification. Many of these nationalists were educated under the Qadim (قديم Old) jiaopai 教派 or “teaching school” of Islam, which drew upon imperial Han kitab political theory that the source of power and legitimacy of a political entity comes from a personal sovereign who embodies the Mandate of Heaven. However, the translation of works was highly selective, with ideals normally in line with Chinese nationalism and of benefit in the face of imperialist aggression and indigenous modernism.

== Present day ==
Maintaining the identity of the Hui was critical during the nascent state of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Scholars such as Claude Lefort, attribute the fundamental nature of authoritarianism and totalitarianism, is to concentrate nationality in order to maintain power, and have a united enemy against the interference of foreign powers. Thus, citizenship was imposed rather than sought onto minorities. The ultimate policy that governs the Hui&#x27;s promotes both assimilation and autonomy, an “irony that continues to plague China’s nationality policy.” Yet, much of the Hui identity is blurred due to the mixture of their own unique, cultural practices, coupled with their almost complete assimilation into Han society. Some scholars believe that the Hui will eventually revolt, and attempt to violently secede from the Chinese state, whilst others believe they are too assimilated to dominant Han culture, known as Sinicization.

In recent years, there have been sporadic clashes between Hui and Han. In 2004, scores were reportedly killed during ethnic bloodletting in Henan Province, and in 2012, dozens of people were injured by the police during protests over the demolition of a mosque in Ningxia that the government had declared illegal.

=== State-sponsored activities ===
The Islamic Association of China, the Nationalities Institute, and the State Nationalities Commission are bodies which aid in increasing the governance of the Hui, attributed to the efforts of Hui pan-nationalism. Whilst the Islamic Association of China is a notable attempt to unify Chinese Muslims, it in recent years has been overwhelmed in perpetuating sectarian divisions among Chinese Muslims. The association has been accused of abetting state ideologies, by the propagation of patriotism and emphasis on Hui-centrism.

Hui people can also subscribe to the state-sponsored periodicals; China&#x27;s Muslims (Zhongguo Musilin) and Muslim World (Musilin shijie), which help to promote maintaining Hui identity and unity across China.

<text>A shovel is a tool used for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials, such as soil, coal, gravel, snow, sand, or ore. Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle. Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong. Shovel handles are usually made of wood (especially specific varieties such as ash or maple) or glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass).

Hand shovel blades made of sheet steel usually have a folded seam or hem at the back to make a socket for the handle. This fold also commonly provides extra rigidity to the blade. The handles are usually riveted in place. A T-piece is commonly fitted to the end of the handle to aid grip and control where the shovel is designed for moving soil and heavy materials. These designs can all be easily mass-produced.

The term &quot;shovel&quot; also applies to larger excavating machines called power shovels, which serve the same purpose—digging, lifting, and moving material. Although such modern power shovels as front-end loaders and excavators (including tractors that feature a loading bucket on one end and a backhoe for digging and placing material on the other) descend from steam shovels and perform similar work, they are not classified as shovels.

Hand shovels have been adapted for many different tasks and environments. They can be optimized for a single task or designed as cross-over or compromise multitaskers. They are commonly used in agriculture.

It is also utilized in archaeology to locate and excavate all subsurface dirt.

==History==

In the Neolithic age and earlier, a large animal&#x27;s scapula (shoulder blade) was often used as a crude shovel or spade. Shovels at this time were often used for farming.

The later invention of purpose-built shovels was a ground-breaking development. Manual shoveling, often in combination with picking, was the chief means of excavation in construction until mechanization via steam shovels and later hydraulic equipment (excavators such as backhoes and loaders) gradually replaced most manual shoveling. The same is also true of the history of mining and quarrying and of bulk materials handling in industries such as steelmaking and stevedoring. Railroad cars and cargo holds containing ore, coal, gravel, sand, or grains were often loaded and unloaded this way. These industries did not always rely &quot;exclusively&quot; on such work, but such work was a part of them. Until the 1950s, manual shoveling employed large numbers of workers. Groups of workers called &#x27;labor gangs&#x27; were assigned to whatever digging or bulk materials handling was needed in any given week, and dozens or hundreds of workers with hand shovels would do the kind of rapid excavating or materials handling that today is usually accomplished with powered excavators and loaders operated by a few skilled operators. Thus the cost of labor, even when each individual worker was poorly paid, was a tremendous expense of operations. Productivity of the business was tied mostly to labor productivity. It still often is even today; but in the past it was even more so. In industrial and commercial materials handling, hand shoveling was later replaced with loaders and backhoes.

Given the central importance and cost of manual labour in industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the &quot;science of shoveling&quot; was something of great interest to developers of scientific management such as Frederick Winslow Taylor. Taylor, with his focus on time and motion study, took an interest in differentiating the many motions of manual labor to a far greater degree than others tended to. Managers might not care to analyze it (possibly motivated by the assumption that manual labor is intellectually simple work), and workers might not care to analyze it in any way that encouraged management to take away the in craft work for the craftsman to decide the details of his methods. Taylor realized that failing to analyze shoveling practice represented a missed opportunity to discover or synthesize best practices for shoveling, which could achieve highest productivity (value for dollar spent). It was Taylor and colleagues in the 1890s through 1910s that greatly expanded the existing idea of varied shovel designs with different-sized scoops, one for each material, based on the material&#x27;s density. Under scientific management, it was no longer acceptable to use the same shovel for shoveling brown coal one day and gravel the next. Taylor said the increased worker productivity, and corresponding savings in wages paid, would offset the capital cost of maintaining two shovels.

During the Second Industrial Revolution around 1900, heavy equipment such as crawler excavators became available.

Shovels known as entrenching tools were made by the British in 1908. They were used by the Germans in World War I and World War II.

<text>The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), formerly and still commonly known as the Metropolitan Police, or simply the Met, is the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement and crime prevention within Greater London. In addition, it is responsible for specialised tasks throughout the United Kingdom, such as dealing with counter-terrorism throughout the UK, and the protection of certain individuals, including the monarch, royal family, governmental officials, and other designated figures. It is also referred to as an eponym as Scotland Yard or the Yard, after the location of its original headquarters in Great Scotland Yard, Whitehall, in the 19th century. The Met is presently headquartered at New Scotland Yard, on the Victoria Embankment.

The main geographical area covered by the Met, the Metropolitan Police District, consists of the 32 London boroughs, and excludes the square mile of the City of London – a largely non-residential and financial district, overseen by the City of London Police. As the force responsible for the majority of the UK&#x27;s capital, the Met has significant responsibilities and unique challenges, such as protecting 164 foreign embassies and High Commissions, policing London City and Heathrow airports, protecting the Palace of Westminster, and managing a higher volume of protests and events than any other British police force, with 3,500 such events in 2016. 

The force, by officer numbers, ranks as the largest police force within the United Kingdom. Excluding its national roles, the Met oversees the eighth-smallest primary geographic area (police area) compared to other territorial police forces in the UK.

The force operates under the leadership of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, directly accountable to the Mayor of London, through the Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime and the Home Office. The post of commissioner was first held jointly by Sir Charles Rowan and Sir Richard Mayne, with Sir Mark Rowley currently holding the position since July 2022.

==History==

The Metropolitan Police Service was founded in 1829 by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel under the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and on 29 September of that year, the first constables of the service appeared on the streets of London. Ten years later, Metropolitan Police Act 1839 consolidated policing within London by expanding the Metropolitan Police District and either abolishing or amalgamating the various other law enforcement entities within London into the Metropolitan Police such as the Thames River Police and the Bow Street Runners.

==Governance==
Since January 2012, the Mayor of London is responsible for the governance of the Metropolitan Police through the Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC). The mayor is able to appoint someone to act on his behalf. , the office-holder is the deputy mayor for policing and crime, Kaya Comer-Schwartz. The work of MOPAC is scrutinised by the Police and Crime Committee (also known as a police and crime panel) of the London Assembly. These structures were created by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and replaced the Metropolitan Police Authority-appointed board created in 2000 by Greater London Authority Act 1999.

Before 2000, the Metropolitan Police was under the authority of the Home Secretary, the only British territorial police force to be administered by central government. The Metropolitan Police Office (MPO), although based at Scotland Yard, was a department of the Home Office created in 1829 and was responsible for the force&#x27;s day-to-day administration. Under the authority of the receiver, a civilian official who was equivalent in rank to the deputy commissioner and served as the force&#x27;s chief financial officer, it was headed by a civilian secretary, who was equivalent in rank to the assistant commissioners.

==Police area and other forces==
The area policed by the Metropolitan Police Service is known as the Metropolitan Police District (MPD). The Met was divided into 32 Borough Operational Command Units that directly aligned with the 32 London boroughs covered. This situation has changed since 2017, as the Met has attempted to save money due to cuts in funding. The MPD is now divided into 12 Basic Command Units (BCUs) made up of two, three or four boroughs. There is criticism of these changes. The City of London (which is not a London borough) is a separate police area and is the responsibility of the separate City of London Police.
The Ministry of Defence Police is responsible for policing of Ministry of Defence property throughout the United Kingdom, including its headquarters in Whitehall and other MoD establishments across the MPD.

The British Transport Police (BTP) are responsible for policing of the rail network in Great Britain, including London. Within London, they are also responsible for the policing of the London Underground, London Trams, the London Cable Car and the Docklands Light Railway.

The English part of the Royal Parks Constabulary, which patrolled a number of Greater London&#x27;s major parks, was merged with the Metropolitan Police in 2004, and those parks are now policed by the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit. There is also a small park police force, the Kew Constabulary, responsible for the Royal Botanic Gardens, whose officers have full police powers within the park. A few local authorities maintain their own borough park constabularies, including Wandsworth Parks and Events Police, Kensington and Chelsea Parks Police, Havering Parks Constabulary and the Hampstead Heath Constabulary. All of these enjoy powers of arrest without warrant as constables; however, the officers of the last mentioned have full police powers, much like officers of the Metropolitan Police, on the heath, whereas the other parks&#x27; police primarily focus on by-law enforcement.

Metropolitan Police officers have legal jurisdiction throughout all of England and Wales, including areas that have their own special police forces, such as the Ministry of Defence, as do all police officers of territorial police forces. Officers also have limited powers in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Within the MPD, the Met will take over the investigation of any serious crime from the Ministry of Defence Police and to a lesser degree BTP, if it is deemed appropriate. Terrorist incidents and complex murder enquiries will almost always be investigated by the Met, with the assistance of any relevant specialist force, even if they are committed on Ministry of Defence or railway property. A minor incursion into the normal jurisdiction of territorial police officers in England and Wales is that Met officers involved in the protection duties of the Royal Family and other VIPs have full police powers in Scotland and Northern Ireland in connection with those duties.

==Organisation and structure==
The Metropolitan Police Service is organised into the following directorates:

* Frontline Policing
* Met Operations
* Specialist Operations
* Professionalism
* Shared Support Services (part of Met headquarters)

Each is overseen by an assistant commissioner or, in the case of administrative departments, a director of police staff, which is the equivalent civilian staff grade. The management board is made up of the commissioner, deputy commissioner, assistant commissioners and directors.

==Ranks==

The Metropolitan Police Service uses the standard British police ranks, indicated by epaulettes, up to chief superintendent, but uniquely has five ranks above that level instead of the standard three: commander, deputy assistant commissioner, assistant commissioner, deputy commissioner and commissioner. All senior officers of the rank of Commander and above are chief police officers of NPCC (previously ACPO) rank.

The Met approved the use of name badges in October 2003, with new recruits wearing the Velcro badges from September 2004. The badge consists of the wearer&#x27;s rank, followed by their surname. All officers are assigned a unique identification number which includes a two-letter BCU (Basic Command Unit) code. 

Following controversy over assaults by uniformed officers with concealed shoulder identification numbers during the G20 summit, Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said, &quot;the public has a right to be able to identify any uniformed officer whilst performing their duty&quot; by their shoulder identification numbers.

===Insignia===
The Met uniformed officer rank structure, with epaulette design, is as follows (from highest to lowest):

The Met also has several active Volunteer Police Cadet units, which maintain their own internal rank structure. The Metropolitan Special Constabulary is a contingent of part-time volunteer police officers and is attached to most Borough Operational Command Units. The Metropolitan Special Constabulary Ranks are as follows (from lowest to highest):

The prefix &quot;woman&quot; in front of female officers&#x27; ranks has been obsolete since 1999. Members of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) up to and including the rank of chief superintendent prefix their ranks with &quot;detective&quot;. Detective ranks are equivalent in rank to their uniform counterparts. Other departments, such as Special Branch and Child Protection, award non-detectives &quot;branch detective&quot; status, allowing them to use the &quot;Detective&quot; prefix. None of these detective ranks confer on the holder any extra pay or supervisory authority compared to their uniformed colleagues.

===Workforce===
The following is the current released workforce data for the ranks. The chief officers rank covers all senior ranks as well as special constables covering all special constable ranks.
==Arms==

==Police officers==


The Metropolitan Police Service includes full-time, paid officers known as &#x27;regulars&#x27;, and part-time, voluntary officers from the Metropolitan Special Constabulary. Both regulars and specials enjoy full police powers, wear the same uniform, and carry the same kit. As elsewhere in the UK, &#x27;regulars&#x27; are not employees, but rather Crown servants, and holders of the Office of Constable.

===Present numbers===

* Police officers (regular – of all ranks): 33,972
* Specially Trained Officers (STO): 7,615
*Police officers (special – of all ranks): 1,445

==Staff and PCSOs==
The Met&#x27;s Police Staff are non-warranted civilians. When the Met was formed in 1829 there were only six of them (the Receiver, his two clerks and the three Commissioners&#x27; clerks, although the Commissioners were also non-warranted right up until 2011), but they now include police community support officers (PCSOs), designated detention officers (DDOs), and many other non-officer roles. Their numbers are currently:
*Police staff (designated detention officers): 614
*Police staff (other): 9,814

==Resources==
===Fleet===
, the Met operates and maintains a fleet of around 5,200 vehicles. In 2018, the fleet covered . The fleet comprises numerous vehicles, including:
* Incident response vehicles (IRV): attached to the various Basic Command Units (BCU) of the Metropolitan Police area, used for frontline policing duties such as patrol and emergency response. 
* Q-cars: covert unmarked vehicles, belonging to a variety of departments.
* Armed response vehicle (ARV): Transports authorised firearms officers trained to use firearms to deal with incidents involving deadly weapons. 
* Traffic units: respond to traffic accidents on major roads, enforce traffic laws and encourage road safety. 
*Motorcycles: utilised by the Roads and Transport Policing Command and Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection for more agile patrol and response.
*Scrambler bikes: used by Operation Venice officers to combat moped gangs.
* Collision investigation units (CIU): respond to and appropriately investigate all major road traffic collisions.
* Protected carriers: used for public order duties.
*Personnel carriers: used to transport numerous officers on patrol and to incidents, as well as non-violent public order situations.
* Station vans: used to transport both officers and suspects in a cage in the rear of the van. 
* Commercial vehicle units: used to respond to incidents involving commercial vehicles. 
* CBRN units: used to mitigate chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents. These are identified by a large amount of equipment lockers on newer vans and a large array of detecting equipment on the top of older vans.
* Control units: used for incident command and control purposes.
* Armoured multi-role vehicles: used for public order duties, airport and counter-terrorism duties, or as required.
* General purpose vehicles: used for general support and transportation duties of officers or equipment.
* Training vehicles: used to train police drivers.
* Miscellaneous vehicles: such as horseboxes and trailers.
* The Metropolitan Police Historic Vehicle Collection

The majority of vehicles have a service life of three to five years; the Met replaces or upgrades between 800 and 1,000 vehicles each year. Vehicles were initially maintained and repaired on contract by Babcock International; from November 2023, the contract for 3,700 of the Met&#x27;s 5,200 vehicles was undertaken by Rivus Fleet Solutions for a ten-year period. Rivus fell into administration on 21 June 2024, with a deal being agreed by the Metropolitan Police to buy back its maintenance operations, saving 165 jobs.

By 2012, the Met was marking all new marked vehicles with Battenburg markings, a highly reflective material on the side of the vehicles, chequered blue and yellow green for the police, and in other colours for other services. The old livery was an orange stripe through the vehicle, with the force&#x27;s logo, known colloquially as the &#x27;jam sandwich&#x27;, which was first introduced in 1978 with the delivery of high-performance Rover SD1 traffic cars. Originally, marked vehicles were finished in base white paint; this was changed to silver from 2002 to help improve a vehicle&#x27;s resale value when it was retired from police use.

The National Police Air Service provides helicopter support to the Met.

A marine policing unit operates 22 vessels from its base in Wapping.

===Budget===
Funding for the Metropolitan Police has been cut due to austerity. Changes in the way the government pays for police pensions will lead to further cuts. Its expenditure for single years, not adjusted for inflation, has been:
===Specialist units===
* Protection Command – This command is split into two branches: Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) and Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP). RaSP provides personal armed protection for the Royal family, Prime Minister and other ministers, ambassadors and visiting heads of state. PaDP is responsible for providing armed officers to protect the Palace of Westminster, important residences such as Downing Street and the many embassies found located in London. Royal Palaces are the responsibility of RaSP. The Special Escort Group (SEG) are responsible for escorting the Royal Family, Prime Minister and other ministers, ambassadors and visiting heads of state, and occasionally prisoner transport.
* Aviation Policing Command – Responsible for providing policing (with the majority being armed officers) at Heathrow Airport and London City Airport.
* Flying Squad – A unit which investigates and intercepts armed robberies. The name comes from the fact its members travelled across divisional and borough boundaries.
* Trident Gang Crime Command – Investigates and works to prevent gang crime.
* Roads and Transport Policing Command – Provides policing for the transport network in London, comprising numerous divisions: the Traffic Division, patrols the road, pursuing fleeing suspects and enforcing speed, safety, and drink driving; the Road Crime Team focuses on dangerous drivers, priority roads, uninsured vehicles and &#x27;fatal four&#x27; offences; the Safer Transport Team (STT) provide a policing presence on Transport for London&#x27;s buses and investigates most crimes committed on them. 
* Specialist Firearms Command – (MO19) Responsible for providing armed response and support across the whole of London with Authorised Firearms Officers (AFO) travelling in ARVs (Armed Response Vehicles) responding to calls involving firearms and weapons. MO19 employs a number of CTSFOs (Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officers), who have additional training, specifically at lengths in order to combat terrorism. 
* Dog Support Unit – (DSU) Provides highly trained dogs and police handlers, under MO7 Taskforce. They are trained to detect drugs and firearms, respond to searches, missing people, and fleeing suspects. Bomb-detection dogs are also used for specific duties. As of 2015 the unit had around 250 police dogs.
* Marine Policing Unit – (MPU) Provides policing on the waterways of London, responding to situations in the River Thames and tracking and stopping illegal vessels entering and exiting London.
* Mounted Branch – Provides policing on horseback in London, under MO7 Taskforce. One of their duties is escorting the Royal Guard down The Mall, into and out of Buckingham Palace every morning from April to July, then occasionally through the remainder of the year. They also provide public order support and are commonly called to police football matches in the event of any unrest. All officers are trained in public order tactics on horseback. As of 2010 the Branch had 120 police horses.

* Police Support Unit (PSU) – Trained to deal with a variety of public order situations outside the remit or capability of regular divisional officers. These are often regular Emergency Response and Patrol Team Carriers, as such of both Borough Support Units (BSU) and Public Order Borough Support Units (POBSU), the latter of which carrying officers often trained in Public Order Level 2 (POL2)
*Territorial Support Group (TSG) – Highly trained officers, specialised in public order and large-scale riots responding around London in marked Public Order Carriers (POC) with 6 constables and a sergeant in each POC. The TSG are specifically trained in Public Order Level 1 (POL1), handling the most violent of riots or protests. They also hold Method of Entry (MOE) qualifications as an aid to local response officers. They aim to secure the capital against terrorism, respond to any disorder in London, and reduce priority crime through borough support. They respond in highly protective uniform during riots or large disorder, protecting themselves from any thrown objects or hazards.
*Violent Crime Task Force (VCTF) – Formed in April 2018, the VCTF is a pan-London proactive response team to knife and serious violent crime, made up of 300 ring-fenced and dedicated police officers who solely focus on violent crime, weapon-enabled crime and serious criminality. This however has since been disbanded and created into both Borough Based Violence Suppression Units (VSU) and MO7 Taskforce Surge Team. (TST)
*Operation Venice – Formed in 2017 to deal with record-breaking moped crime in London, but also tackles different types of robbery trends; the Scorpion Team consists of highly skilled drivers and riders who were given a green light to instigate tactical contact against moped and motorbikes involved in criminality. This however, has since been disbanded and replaced with the likes of Interceptor and Surge teams under MO7 Taskforce

===Stations===
In addition to the headquarters at New Scotland Yard, there are many police stations in London. These range from large borough headquarters staffed around the clock every day to smaller stations, which may be open to the public only during normal business hours, or on certain days of the week. In 2017, there were 73 working front counters open to the public in London. Most police stations can easily be identified from one or more blue lamps located outside the entrance, which were introduced in 1861.

The oldest Metropolitan police station, which opened in Bow Street in 1881, closed in 1992 and the adjoining Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court heard its last case on 14 July 2006. One of the oldest operational police stations in London is in Wapping, which opened in 1908. It is the headquarters of the marine policing unit (formerly known as Thames Division), which is responsible for policing the River Thames. It also houses a mortuary and the River Police Museum. Paddington Green Police Station, which is no longer operational, received much publicity for its housing of terrorism suspects in an underground complex prior to its closure in 2017.

In 2004, there was a call from the Institute for Public Policy Research for more imaginative planning of police stations to aid in improving relations between police forces and the wider community.

The following table shows the percentage detection rates for the Metropolitan Police by offence group for 2010/2011:

The Metropolitan Police Service &quot;screened out&quot; 34,164 crimes the day they were reported in 2017 and did not investigate them further. This compares to 13,019 the previous year. 18,093 crimes were closed in 24 hours during the first 5 months of 2018 making it likely that the 2017 total will be exceeded. Crimes not being investigated include sexual assaults and arson, burglaries, thefts and assaults. Some critics believe this shows the effect of austerity on the force&#x27;s ability to carry out its responsibilities.

In 2024, it was reported that there was a zero-detection rate for crimes within a 166 neighborhood areas under the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police Service.

==Controversies==
The Met was controversial even before its formation in 1829. Since the 1970s, such controversies have often centred on institutional racism and institutional sexism within the organisation, along with the right to protest, failures in investigations, and officers belonging to proscribed organisations.

In 2023, a report on the Metropolitan Police found that the organisation was rife with racism, misogyny, and homophobia, and was corrupt. A 363-page report written by Louise Casey, Baroness Casey of Blackstock was commissioned after the abduction of Sarah Everard by Wayne Couzens, a police constable. The report stated that 12% of female Met employees had been harassed or attacked, with 33% experiencing sexism. Other incidents include a Muslim officer who had bacon stuffed into his boots and a Sikh officer whose beard was cut. The report also found that officers of minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to be disciplined and leave the force. The report was criticised by the charity Galop for not investigating transphobia. Five former officers admitted in court in 2023 to sending racist messages, the targets of which included the Duchess of Sussex, and a sixth was convicted after a trial. All six were given suspended jail sentences. 

On 1 January 2024 the Metropolitan Police were criticised by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson for allegedly demonstrating political bias and double standards in their handling of pro-Hamas demonstrations, and their efforts to support an investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes following Israel&#x27;s response to terror attacks committed by Hamas on 7 October. The Met released a statement in response stating, &quot;As the UK&#x27;s investigative authority for war crimes, counter-terrorism policing – through the Met&#x27;s war crimes team – has a responsibility to support ICC investigations. The ICC opened an investigation in 2019 into alleged war crimes in Israel and Palestine.&quot; The spokesman added that &quot;under the terms of the 1998 Rome Statute, our war crimes team is obliged to support any investigations opened by the ICC that could involve British subjects&quot; and said the posters were put up to meet that obligation.

In April 2024, the Met settled a claim for misfeasance in a public office and false imprisonment by agreeing to pay a five-figure sum as damages to a French publisher who had been arrested and detained under anti-terrorism laws while he was on his way to a book fair in London.

In August 2024, a report by His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services said that the Met was rated inadequate or failing regarding crime investigations and managing offenders. It was rated as requiring improvement in five other areas, and as adequate in one.

In September 2024, His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services issued a report regarding the Met’s handling of the pro-Palestinian protests, saying that the Met had been largely impartial. The report criticised the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the then Home Secretary Suella Braverman for suggesting otherwise.

In November 2024, it was found that the Metropolitan Police were told about allegations of sexual assault against Mohamed Al-Fayed, the late businessman and owner of Harrods, ten years earlier than it had acknowledged. The Met had claimed that it first received such allegations in 2005. However, in 1995, the Met had received such allegations from Samantha Ramsay, who is now deceased. The BBC reported that &quot;Samantha’s family say the Met dismissed her claims. They believe that multiple women could have been saved from sexual abuse if the force had acted.&quot; The Met claimed that there was no history of Samantha&#x27;s allegations on their computer system, &quot;but that in 1995 some reports were paper-based and might not have been transferred.&quot; Ramsay&#x27;s sister, Emma, recalled the police as having said at the time: Emma recalls that the police told Samantha: “We’ve added it to a pile of other female names that we’ve got that have made the same complaint against Mohamed Al Fayed.” On 8 November, the Independent Office for Police Conduct announced that they would be investigating the Met over their handling of allegations of sexual misconduct related to the case.

<text>A motorjet is a rudimentary type of jet engine which is sometimes referred to as &quot;thermojet&quot;, a term now commonly used to describe a particular and completely unrelated pulsejet design.

== Design ==

At the heart the motorjet is an ordinary piston engine (hence, the term &quot;motor&quot;), but instead of (or sometimes, as well as) driving a propeller, it drives a compressor. The compressed air is channeled into a combustion chamber, where fuel is injected and ignited. The high temperatures generated by the combustion cause the gases in the chamber to expand and escape at high velocity from the exhaust, creating a thermal reactive force that provides useful thrust.

Motorjet engines provide greater thrust than a propeller alone mounted on a piston engine; this has been successfully demonstrated in a number of different aircraft. A jet engine also can provide thrust at higher speeds where a propeller becomes less efficient or even ineffective; in fact, a jet engine gains efficiency as speed rises, while a propeller loses it (outside of a certain design range). This gives better efficiency in either operating range than an aircraft powered by just a propeller or a jet. The same is true of the dual-powerplant aircraft experimented with after the turbojet became practicable, which were equipped with both a piston-driven propeller and a turbojet engine.

== History ==
* In 1908 French inventor René Lorin proposed using a piston engine to compress air that would then be mixed with fuel and burned to produce pulses of hot gas that would be expelled through a nozzle to generate a propelling force.
* In 1917, O. Morize of Châteaudun, France, proposed the Morize ejector scheme in which a reciprocating engine drove a compressor supplying air to a liquid-fueled combustion chamber which discharged into a convergent-divergent tube and ultimately out into the atmosphere.
* The term &quot;motor jet&quot; was established in a patent filed in Britain by J.H. Harris of Esher, U.K., in 1917.
* It was next explored by Secondo Campini in the early 1930s, although it was not until 1940 that an aircraft, the Caproni Campini N.1 (sometimes referred to as C.C.2), would fly powered by his engine. Campini used the term thermojet at this time to describe his motorjet.
* NACA engineer Eastman Jacobs was actively pursuing thermojet research in the early 1940s for a project that came to be known as &quot;Jake&#x27;s jeep&quot;, which was never completed, as turbojet technology overtook it.
* Japanese engineers developed the Ishikawajima Tsu-11 motorjet engine to power Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka aircraft as an alternative to the solid-propellant rocket engines that these aircraft were then using.
* The Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250, designed in 1944, used a piston engine to drive both a propeller at the nose of the plane, and a Kholshchevnikov VRDK motorjet leading to a jet exhaust at the tail. Between 10 and 50 I-250 (a.k.a. MiG-13) aircraft were produced, serviced, and flown by the Soviet Navy through 1950. The similarly designed Sukhoi Su-5 was also produced as a prototype during the same period.

Motorjet research was nearly abandoned at the end of World War II, as the turbojet was a more practical solution to jet power, using the jet exhaust to drive a gas turbine and providing the power to drive the compressor without the additional weight and complexity of a piston engine that generated no thrust. One of the primary advantages of the motorjet layout was that the reciprocating engine provided power for the compressor and no turbine power section was needed. However, metallurgy and understanding of the design of turbines had advanced to a point after World War II where it was feasible to create a turbine to operate reliably in the high-velocity hot-gas environment downstream of the combustor, and the motorjet idea lost favor.

<doc id="192455" wikidata="Q188951" url="?curid=192455" title="XMPP">
<text>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (abbreviation XMPP, originally named Jabber) is an open communication protocol designed for instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Based on XML (Extensible Markup Language), it enables the near-real-time exchange of structured data between two or more network entities. Designed to be extensible, the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional IM in the broader realm of message-oriented middleware, including signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming and other uses.

Unlike most commercial instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard in the application layer. The architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email; anyone can run their own XMPP server and there is no central master server. This federated open system approach allows users to interoperate with others on any server using a &#x27;JID&#x27; user account, similar to an email address. XMPP implementations can be developed using any software license and many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software. Numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist.

Originally developed by the open-source community, the protocols were formalized as an approved instant messaging standard in 2004 and have been continuously developed with new extensions and features. Various XMPP client software are available on both desktop and mobile platforms and devices - by 2003 the protocol was used by over ten million people worldwide on the network, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation.

== Federated Instant Messaging ==

Although the protocol has other uses, the primary application is Federated Instant Messaging, to deliver a standard Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol, outlined below.

A client Alice (&quot;alice@example.com&quot;) has a message for some other user, Beth (&quot;beth@example.com&quot;), and uses XMPP to convey this to the example.com server. If Beth is online, the server delivers the message instantly, otherwise it will be held for delivery later. If Beth is offline, this status is visible to Alice.

If the message is for a user on another server, Charles (&quot;charles@example.net&quot;), then the example.com server connects using XMPP to pass the message to the example.net server. The message is then similarly delivered or held, and Alice is informed of the status.

Following the initial message delivery, the end clients are in a &quot;chat&quot; and each party is subsequently informed of changes to the other&#x27;s status.

=== Client-to-Server XMPP and Server-to-Server XMPP ===

The XMPP client communicates with the server over an SSL-encrypted TCP stream on port 5222. XMPP servers communicate with each other over an SSL-encrypted TCP stream on port 5269.

== Protocol characteristics ==
=== Decentralization ===

The XMPP network architecture is reminiscent of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), a client–server model; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server. By design, there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as AIM, WLM, WhatsApp or Telegram. Some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public XMPP server being run at codice_1, to which many users subscribe. However, anyone may run their own XMPP server on their own domain.

=== Addressing ===

Every user on the network has a unique XMPP address, called &quot;Jabber ID&quot;. The JID is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name (or IP address) for the server where that user resides, separated by an at sign (codice_2) - for example, “codice_3“: here codice_4 is the username and codice_5 the server with which the user is registered.

Since a user may wish to log in from multiple locations, they may specify a resource. A resource identifies a particular client belonging to the user (for example home, work, or mobile). This may be included in the JID by appending a slash followed by the name of the resource. For example, the full JID of a user&#x27;s mobile account could be codice_6.

Each resource may have specified a numerical value called priority. Messages simply sent to codice_7 will go to the client with highest priority, but those sent to codice_6 will go &quot;only&quot; to the mobile client. The highest priority is the one with largest numerical value.

JIDs without a username part are also valid, and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server. A resource remains optional for these JIDs as well.

The means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier - the JID, instead of by an explicit IP Address present opportunities to use XMPP as an Overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks.

=== XMPP via HTTP ===
The original and &quot;native&quot; transport protocol for XMPP is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), using open-ended XML streams over long-lived TCP connections. As an alternative to the TCP transport, the XMPP community has also developed an HTTP transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls. In the original specification, XMPP could use HTTP in two ways: &quot;polling&quot; and &quot;binding&quot;. The polling method, now deprecated, essentially implies messages stored on a server-side database are being fetched (and posted) regularly by an XMPP client by way of HTTP &#x27;GET&#x27; and &#x27;POST&#x27; requests. The binding method, implemented using &quot;Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP&quot; (BOSH), allows servers to push messages to clients as soon as they are sent. This push model of notification is more efficient than polling, where many of the polls return no new data.

Because the client uses HTTP, most firewalls allow clients to fetch and post messages without any hindrances. Thus, in scenarios where the TCP port used by XMPP is blocked, a server can listen on the normal HTTP port and the traffic should pass without problems. Various websites let people sign into XMPP via a browser. Furthermore, there are open public servers that listen on standard http (port 80) and https (port 443) ports, and hence allow connections from behind most firewalls. However, the IANA-registered port for BOSH is actually 5280, not 80.

===Extensibility===
The XMPP Standards Foundation or XSF (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions, so called &quot;XEP&quot;. However, extensions can also be defined by any individual, software project, or organization. To maintain interoperability, common extensions are managed by the XSF. XMPP applications beyond IM include: chat rooms, network management, content syndication, collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, remote systems control and monitoring, geolocation, middleware and cloud computing, VoIP, and identity services.

Building on its capability to support discovery across local network domains, XMPP is well-suited for cloud computing where virtual machines, networks, and firewalls would otherwise present obstacles to alternative service discovery and presence-based solutions. Cloud computing and storage systems rely on various forms of communication over multiple levels, including not only messaging between systems to relay state but also the migration or distribution of larger objects, such as storage or virtual machines. Along with authentication and in-transit data protection, XMPP can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or Message-oriented middleware (MOM) protocol.

===Current limitations===
At the moment, XMPP does not support Quality of Service (QoS); assured delivery of messages has to be built on top of the XMPP layer. There are two XEPs proposed to deal with this issue. The first is XEP-0184 Message delivery receipts, which has been stable since 2018 and is supported by Prosody ,Conversations, and most other XMPP software. The second is XEP-0333 Chat Markers, also stable and supported by Prosody, Conversations and many other XMPP implementations.

Since XML is text based, normal XMPP has a higher network overhead compared to purely binary solutions. This issue was being addressed by the experimental XEP-0322 Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format, where XML is serialized in an efficient binary manner, especially in schema-informed mode. This XEP is currently deferred.

In-band binary data transfer is limited. Binary data must be first base64 encoded before it can be transmitted in-band. Therefore, any significant amount of binary data (e.g., file transfers) is best transmitted out-of-band, using in-band messages to coordinate. In most cases this is dealt with by using an attachment to a message and the widely implemented XEP-0363 HTTP File Upload mechanism. Voice and Video chat can be done via the Jingle XMPP Extension Protocol, XEP-0166.

== Features ==
===Peer-to-peer sessions===
Using the extension called Jingle, XMPP can provide an open means to support machine-to-machine or peer-to-peer communications across a diverse set of networks. This feature is mainly used for IP telephony (VoIP).

===Multi-user chat===
XMPP supports conferences with multiple users, using the specification Multi-User Chat (MUC) (XEP-0045). From the point of view of a normal user, it is comparable to Internet Relay Chat (IRC).

===Security and encryption===
XMPP servers can be isolated (e.g., on a company intranet), and secure authentication (SASL) and point-to-point encryption (TLS) have been built into the core XMPP specifications.

Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) is an extension of XMPP enabling encryption of messages and data. It has since been replaced by a better extension, multi-end-to-multi-end encryption (OMEMO, XEP-0384) end-to-end encryption between users. This gives a higher level of security, by encrypting all data from the source client and decrypting again at the target client; the server operator cannot decrypt the data they are forwarding.

Messages can also be encrypted with OpenPGP, for example with the software Gajim.

===Service discovery===
While several service discovery protocols exist today (such as zeroconf or the Service Location Protocol), XMPP provides a solid base for the discovery of services residing locally or across a network, and the availability of these services (via presence information), as specified by XEP-0030 DISCO.

=== Connecting to other protocols ===

One of the original design goals of the early Jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems (especially non-XMPP systems) through a single client application. This was done through entities called &quot;transports&quot; or &quot;gateways&quot; to other instant messaging protocols like ICQ, AIM or Yahoo Messenger, but also to protocols such as SMS, IRC or email. Unlike multi-protocol clients, XMPP provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an XMPP server. Any user can &quot;register&quot; with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network, and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were XMPP users. Thus, such gateways function as client proxies (the gateway authenticates on the user&#x27;s behalf on the non-XMPP service). As a result, any client that fully supports XMPP can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client, and without the need for the client to have direct access to the Internet. However, the client proxy model may violate terms of service on the protocol used (although such terms of service are not legally enforceable in several countries) and also requires the user to send their IM username and password to the third-party site that operates the transport (which may raise privacy and security concerns).

Another type of gateway is a server-to-server gateway, which enables a non-XMPP server deployment to connect to native XMPP servers using the built in interdomain federation features of XMPP. Such server-to-server gateways are offered by several enterprise IM software products, including:

* HCL Sametime Premium
* Skype for Business Server (formerly named Microsoft Lync Server and Microsoft Office Communications Server – OCS)

==Software==
XMPP is implemented by many clients, servers, and code libraries. These implementations are provided under a variety of software licenses.

===Servers===
Numerous XMPP server software exist, some well known ones include ejabberd and Prosody.

===Modern clients===

A large number of XMPP client software exist on various modern and legacy platforms, including both graphical and command line based clients. According to the XMPP website, some of the most popular software include Conversations, Cheogram, Monocles and Quicksy (Android), Dino (BSD, Windows, Unix, Linux), Converse.js (web browser, Linux, Windows, macOS), Gajim (Windows, Linux), Monal (macOS, iOS), and Swift.IM (macOS, Windows, Linux). Lately, Monal has been forked as a Quicksy release for iOS.

Other clients include: Bombus, ChatSecure, Coccinella, Miranda NG, Pidgin, Psi, Tkabber, Trillian, and Xabber.

== Deployment and distribution ==
There are thousands of XMPP servers worldwide, many public ones as well as private individuals or organizations running their own servers without commercial intent. Numerous websites show a list of public XMPP servers where users may register at (for example on the XMPP.net website).

Several large public IM services natively use or used XMPP, including LiveJournal&#x27;s &quot;LJ Talk&quot;, Nimbuzz, and HipChat. Various hosting services, such as DreamHost, enable hosting customers to choose XMPP services alongside more traditional web and email services. Specialized XMPP hosting services also exist in form of cloud so that domain owners need not directly run their own XMPP servers, including Cisco Webex Connect, Chrome.pl, Flosoft.biz, i-pobox.net, and hosted.im.

The majority of these services are Federated - so that users of one service can communicate with users of another service.

XMPP is also used in deployments of non-IM services, including smart grid systems such as demand response applications, message-oriented middleware, and as a replacement for SMS to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients.

===Non-native deployments===
Some of the largest messaging providers use, or have been using, various forms of XMPP based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users. One example is Google, which in August 2005 introduced Google Talk, a combination VoIP and IM system that uses XMPP for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called Jingle. The initial launch did not include server-to-server communications; Google enabled that feature on January 17, 2006. Google later added video functionality to Google Talk, also using the Jingle protocol for signaling. In May 2013, Google announced XMPP compatibility would be dropped from Google Talk for server-to-server federation, although it would retain client-to-server support. Google Talk has since been dropped from Google&#x27;s line of products. 

In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental XMPP support for its AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) service, allowing AIM users to communicate using XMPP. However, in March 2008, this service was discontinued. As of May 2011, AOL offers limited XMPP support. 

In February 2010, the social-networking site Facebook opened up its chat feature to third-party applications via XMPP. Some functionality was unavailable through XMPP, and support was dropped in April 2014. Similarly, in December 2011, Microsoft released an XMPP interface to its Microsoft Messenger service. Skype, its de facto successor, also provided limited XMPP support. Apache Wave is another example.

XMPP is the de facto standard for private chat in gaming related platforms such as Origin, and PlayStation, as well as the now discontinued Xfire and Raptr. Two notable exceptions are Steam and Xbox LIVE; both use their own proprietary messaging protocols.

== History and development ==

Jeremie Miller began working on the Jabber technology in 1998 and released the first version of the codice_9 server on January 4, 1999. The early Jabber community focused on open-source software, mainly the jabberd server, but its major outcome proved to be the development of the XMPP protocol.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The early Jabber protocol, as developed in 1999 and 2000, formed the basis for XMPP as published in RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 in October 2004 (the primary changes during formalization by the IETF&#x27;s XMPP Working Group were the addition of TLS for channel encryption and SASL for authentication). The XMPP Working group also produced specifications RFC 3922 and RFC 3923. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In 2015, RFC 6122 was superseded by RFC 7622. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.

The first IM service based on XMPP was Jabber.org, which has operated continuously and offered free accounts since 1999. From 1999 until February 2006, the service used jabberd as its server software, at which time it migrated to ejabberd (both of which are free software application servers). In January 2010, the service migrated to the proprietary M-Link server software produced by Isode Ltd.

In September 2008, Cisco Systems acquired Jabber, Inc., the creators of the commercial product Jabber XCP.

The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) develops and publishes extensions to XMPP through a standards process centered on &quot;XMPP Extension Protocols&quot; (XEPs, previously known as Jabber Enhancement Proposals - JEPs). The following extensions are in especially wide use:

* Data Forms
* Service Discovery
* Multi-User Chat
* Publish-Subscribe and Personal Eventing Protocol
* XHTML-IM
* File Transfer
* Entity Capabilities
* HTTP Binding
* Jingle for voice and video

=== Internet of Things ===
XMPP features such as federation across domains, publish/subscribe, authentication and its security even for mobile endpoints are being used to implement the Internet of Things. Several XMPP extensions are part of the experimental implementation: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format; Sensor Data; Provisioning; Control; Concentrators; Discovery.

These efforts are documented on a page in the XMPP wiki dedicated to Internet of Things and the XMPP IoT mailing list.

== Specifications and standards ==
The IETF XMPP working group has produced a series of Request for Comments (RFC) documents:

* RFC 3920 (superseded by RFC 6120)
* RFC 3921 (superseded by RFC 6121)
* RFC 3922
* RFC 3923
* RFC 4622 (superseded by RFC 5122)
* RFC 4854
* RFC 4979
* RFC 6122 (superseded by RFC 7622)

The most important and most widely implemented of these specifications are:

* RFC 6120, &quot;Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core&quot;, which describes client–server messaging using two open-ended XML streams. XML streams consist of &lt;presence/&gt;, &lt;message/&gt; and &lt;iq/&gt; (info/query). A connection is authenticated with Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) and encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
* RFC 6121&quot;, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence&quot; describes instant messaging (IM), the most common application of XMPP.
* RFC 7622, &quot;Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format&quot; describes the rules for XMPP addresses, also called JabberIDs or JIDs. Currently JIDs use PRECIS (as defined in RFC 7564) for handling of Unicode characters outside the ASCII range.

=== Competing standards ===
XMPP has often been regarded as a competitor to SIMPLE, based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification.

The XMPP extension for multi-user chat can be seen as a competitor to IRC, although IRC is far simpler, has far fewer features, and is far more widely used.

The XMPP extensions for publish–subscribe provide many of the same features as the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

<text>Luis Alberto Estaba (August 13, 1938 – February 16, 2025) was a Venezuelan boxer. Born in Güiria, he was nicknamed &quot;Lumumba&quot;, most commonly said to be because of his resemblance to Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba.

==Biography==
A late starter into boxing, Estaba became a professional in 1967, at the relatively old (for boxing) age of 29. He beat Pedro Garcia by a knockout in one on February 28 of that year.

He kept his winning streak until losing a ten round decision to Natalio Jimenez in Caracas in 1968. He avenged that loss immediately by beating Jimenez in his next fight, by decision. After two more wins, he had his first fight abroad, when he lost to Jimenez, again by decision, at Santo Domingo.

On September 13, 1975, Estaba became boxing&#x27;s second world champion ever in the Jr. Flyweight division, when he obtained the vacant WBC title by knocking out Rafael Lovera in the fourth round, who was making his professional debut during this world title bout. He defended the title 12 times, including victories over former or future world champions Franco Udella, Rafael Pedroza, and Netrnoi Sor Vorasingh. In 1977, he was named &quot;Venezuelan Athlete of the Year&quot;.

His luck ran out on February 19, 1978, when he lost the title to Mexico&#x27;s Freddie Castillo by a knockout in round 14. After beating Ricardo Estupinan by a decision in 15 to win the &quot;Central American&quot; title in his division, he challenged Vorasingh (who had beaten Castillo) for the world title. Estaba lost by a knockout in five rounds on July 29, in what he knew would be his last fight as a professional, because local Venezuelan boxing laws ban anyone over 40 years old to box professionally, and Estaba turned 40 only two weeks after that fight.

Being forced into retirement, he left the sport of boxing with 41 wins, 9 losses and 2 draws, 27 wins having been by knockout.

Estaba died on February 16, 2025, at the age of 86.

<text>A motorcycle helmet is a type of helmet used by motorcycle riders. Motorcycle helmets contribute to motorcycle safety by protecting the rider&#x27;s head in the event of an impact. They reduce the risk of head injury by 69% and the risk of death by 42%. Their use is required by law in many countries. However, only 10.4% of all motorcyclists wear helmets, according to the World Health Organization in 2016.

Motorcycle helmets consist of a polystyrene foam inner shell that absorbs the shock of an impact, and a protective plastic outer layer. Several variations exist, notably helmets that cover the chin area and helmets that do not. Some helmets provide additional conveniences, such as ventilation, face shields, sun visors, ear protection, or a wireless microphone.

==Origins==
The origins of the crash helmet date back to the Brooklands race track in early 1914, when a medical officer, Dr. Eric Gardner, noticed he was seeing a motor cyclist with head injuries about every two weeks. He got a Mr. Moss of Bethnal Green to make canvas and shellac helmets stiff enough to stand a heavy blow and smooth enough to glance off any projections it encountered. He presented the design to the Auto-Cycle Union where it was initially condemned, but later converted to the idea and made them compulsory for the 1914 Isle of Man TT races, although there was resistance from riders. Gardner took 94 of these helmets with him to the Isle of Man, and one rider who hit a gate with a glancing blow was saved by the helmet. Dr. Gardner received a letter later from the Isle of Man medical officer stating that after the TT they normally had &quot;several interesting concussion cases&quot; but that in 1914 there were none.

In May 1935, T. E. Lawrence (known as Lawrence of Arabia) had a crash on a Brough Superior SS100 on a narrow road near his cottage near Wareham. The accident occurred because a dip in the road obstructed his view of two boys on bicycles. Swerving to avoid them, Lawrence lost control and was thrown over the handlebars. He was not wearing a helmet, and suffered serious head injuries which left him in a coma; he died after six days in the hospital. One of the doctors attending him was Hugh Cairns, a neurosurgeon, who after Lawrence&#x27;s death began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle despatch riders through head injuries. Cairns&#x27; research led to the increased use of crash helmets by military and civilian motorcyclists and the British Army making helmets compulsory for its riders in November 1941.

In the Soviet Union, helmets for motorcyclists became mandatory in November 1967. Protective helmets for all motorcyclists and passengers became mandatory in January 1973.

== Safety effects ==
A 2008 systematic study showed that helmets reduce the risk of head injury by around 69% and the risk of death by around 42%.

Although it was once speculated that wearing a motorcycle helmet increased neck and spinal injuries in a crash, recent evidence has shown the opposite to be the case: helmets protect against cervical spine injury. A study that is often cited when advancing the argument that helmets might increase the incidence of neck and spinal injuries dates back to the mid-1980s and &quot;used flawed statistical reasoning&quot;.

== Types ==
There are five basic types of helmets intended for motorcycling, and others not intended for motorcycling but which are used by some riders. All of these types of helmets are secured by a chin strap, and their protective benefits are greatly reduced, if not eliminated, if the chin strap is not securely fastened so as to maintain a snug fit.

From most to least protective, as generally accepted by riders and manufacturers, the helmet types are:

=== Full face helmet ===

A &quot;full face helmet&quot; covers the entire head, with a rear that covers the base of the skull, and a protective section over the front of the chin. Such helmets have an open cutout in a band across the eyes and nose, and often include a clear or tinted transparent plastic face shield, known as a visor, that generally swivels up and down to allow access to the face. Many full face helmets include vents to increase the airflow to the rider. The significant attraction of these helmets is their protectiveness. Some wearers dislike the increased heat, sense of isolation, lack of wind, and reduced hearing of such helmets. Full face helmets intended for off-road or motocross use sometimes omit the face shield, but extend the visor and chin portions to increase ventilation, since riding off-road is a very strenuous activity. Studies have shown that full face helmets offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35% of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area. Wearing a helmet with less coverage eliminates that protection — the less coverage the helmet offers, the less protection for the rider.

=== Off-road helmet ===
A &quot;off-road helmet&quot; or &quot;motocross helmet&quot; is a full face helmet designed specifically for motocross and off-roading. It has clearly elongated chin and visor portions, a chin bar, and partially open face to give the rider extra protection while wearing goggles and to allow the unhindered flow of air during the physical exertion typical of this type of riding. The visor allows the rider to dip their head and provide further protection from flying debris during off-road riding, while also shielding the wearer&#x27;s eyes from the sun.

Originally, off-road helmets did not include a chin bar, with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets, and using a face mask to fend off dirt and debris from the nose and mouth. Modern off-road helmets include a (typically angular, rather than round) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris. When properly combined with goggles, the result provides most of the same protective features of full face street helmets.

=== Modular helmet ===
A &quot;modular helmet&quot;, also called a &quot;flip-up helmet&quot;, &quot;convertible helmet&quot;, or &quot;flip face helmet&quot;, is a hybrid between a full face and open face helmet for street use. When fully assembled and closed, they resemble full face helmets by bearing a chin bar for absorbing face impacts. Its chin bar serves as a visor that may be pivoted upwards (or, in some cases, may be removed) by a special lever to allow access to most of the face, as in an open face helmet. The rider may thus eat, drink, or have a conversation without unfastening the chinstrap and removing the helmet, making them increasingly popular among police motorcycle officers who need full head protection while riding and an unobstructed view while dismounted. It is also popular with riders who wear eyeglasses, as it allows them to fit a helmet without removing their glasses.

Many modular helmets are designed to be worn only in the closed position for riding, as the movable chin bar is designed as a convenience feature, useful while not actively riding. The curved shape of an open chin bar and face shield section can cause increased wind drag during riding, as air will not flow around an open modular helmet in the same way as a three-quarters helmet. Since the chin bar section also protrudes further from the forehead than a three-quarters visor, riding with the helmet in the open position may pose increased risk of neck injury in a crash. Some modular helmets are dual certified as full face and open face helmet. The chin bar of those helmets offer real protection and they can be used in the &quot;open&quot; position while riding. An example of such a helmet would be the BMW Motorrad System 6.

As of 2008, there have not been wide scientific studies of modular helmets to assess how protective the pivoting or removable chin bars are. Observation and unofficial testing suggest that significantly greater protection exists beyond that for an open face helmet, and may be enough to pass full-face helmet standardized tests, but the extent of protection is not fully established by all standards bodies.

The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) standard does not require chin bar testing. The Snell Memorial Foundation certified a flip-up helmet for the first time in 2009. ECE 22.05 allows certification of modular helmets with or without chin bar tests, distinguished by -P (protective lower face cover) and -NP (non-protective) suffixes to the certification number, and additional warning text for non-certified chin bars.

=== Open face or 3/4 helmet ===
An &quot;open face helmet&quot; or &quot;&quot;three-quarters&quot; helmet&quot; covers the ears, cheeks, and back of the head, but lacks the lower chin bar of the full face helmet. Many offer snap-on visors that may be used by the rider to reduce sunlight glare. An open face helmet provides the same rear protection as a full face helmet, but little protection to the face, even from non-crash events.

Bugs, dust, or even wind to the face and eyes can cause rider discomfort or injury. As a result, it is not uncommon (and in some U.S. states, is required by law) for riders to wear wrap-around sunglasses or goggles to supplement eye protection with these helmets. Alternatively, many open face helmets include, or can be fitted with, a face shield, which is more effective in stopping flying insects from entering the helmet.

=== Half helmet ===
A &quot;half helmet&quot;, also called a &quot;&quot;shorty&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;pudding basin&quot;&quot; or &quot;TT helmet&quot; in the UK, is a type of open face helmet. It has essentially the same front design as a regular open face helmet but without a lowered rear (hence covering roughly &quot;half&quot; of the head), giving it a shape that roughly evokes a bowl or older combat helmet designs such as the M1 helmet. The half helmet provides the minimum coverage generally allowed by law in the U.S., and British Standards 2001:1956.

Half helmets were particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s with rockers and road racers in the British Isles, as well as police officers in the U.S. around the same period, who often also wore them as riot helmets or as crash protection in police cars.

As with the open face, it is not uncommon to augment this helmet&#x27;s eye protection through other means such as goggles. Because of their inferiority compared to other helmet styles, some Motorcycle Safety Foundations prohibit the use of half helmets.

=== Novelty helmet ===
A &quot;novelty helmet&quot;, colloquially called a &quot;beanie&quot; or &quot;brain bucket&quot;, is an uncertified helmet that cannot legally be called motorcycle helmets in some jurisdictions. Such helmets are often smaller and lighter than those made to DOT standards, and are unsuitable for crash protection because they lack the energy-absorbing foam that protects the brain by allowing it to come to a gradual stop during an impact. A novelty helmet can protect the scalp against sunburn while riding and—if it stays on during a crash—might protect the scalp against abrasion, but it has no capability to protect the skull or brain from an impact. In the US, 5% of riders wore non-DOT compliant helmets in 2013, a decrease from 7% the previous year.

== Color visibility ==
Although black helmets are popular among motorcyclists, one study determined they offer the least visibility to motorists. Riders wearing a plain white helmet rather than a black one were associated with a 24% lower risk of suffering a motorcycle accident injury or death. This study also notes &quot;Riders wearing high visibility clothing and white helmets are likely to be more safety conscious than other riders.&quot;

Conversely, another study, the MAIDS report, did not back up the claims that helmet color makes any difference in accident frequency, and that in fact motorcycles painted white were actually over-represented in the accident sample compared to the exposure data. While recognizing how much riders need to be seen, the MAIDS report documented that riders&#x27; clothing usually fails to do so, saying that &quot;in 65.3% of all cases, the clothing made no contribution to the conspicuity of the rider or the PTW [powered two-wheeler, i.e. motorcycle]. There were very few cases found in which the bright clothing of the PTW rider enhanced the PTW’s overall conspicuity (46 cases). There were more cases in which the use of dark clothing decreased the conspicuity of the rider and the PTW (120 cases).&quot; The MAIDS report was unable to recommend specific items of clothing or colors to make riders better seen.

Subsequently, however, research by Wali &quot;et al.&quot; (2019) found that: “Helmet color is also one of the factors that can increase or decrease rider conspicuity (Wells et al., 2004; Gershonetal., 2012 ). Usually, dark colored helmets (such as black) can decrease rider conspicuity whereas light colored helmets can increase conspicuity at times when the level of rider conspicuity can influence injury outcomes (as observed above in our findings and in relevant literature (Wells et al., 2004 )). Our analysis shows that black colored helmets are associated with a significant increase in the injury severity score (an increase of 4.25 units – see Table 5), whereas light colored helmets (such as silver or grey) are found associated with a significant decrease in the injury severity score (a decrease of 7.56units). These findings are in agreement with those of Wells et al. (2004) and are important and intuitive as usually dark colored helmets (such as black) can decrease rider conspicuity (especially at night) thus increasing the risk of injury (Wells et al., 2004). Interestingly, our analysis shows that white colored helmets are also associated with a significant increase in the injury severity score, given a crash (see Table 3). This finding may seem apparently unintuitive as white colored helmets are usually believed to increase rider conspicuity and thus lower risk of injury. However, note that a white outfit (such as a white helmet) may increase conspicuity in a more complex and multi-colored urban environment, whereas, it can, in fact, decrease rider’s conspicuity where a background is solely a bright sky (such as on inter-urban roads) (Gershonetal., 2012 ).”

== Construction ==
Modern helmets are constructed from plastics. Premium price helmets are made with fiberglass reinforced with Kevlar or carbon fiber. They generally have fabric and foam interiors for both comfort and protection. Motorcycle helmets are generally designed to distort in a crash (thus expending the energy otherwise destined for the wearer&#x27;s skull), so they provide little protection at the site of their first impact, but continued protection over the remainder of the helmet.

Helmets are made with an inner EPS (expanded polystyrene foam) shell and an outer shell to protect the EPS. The density and the thickness of the EPS is designed to cushion or crush on impact to help prevent head injuries. Some manufacturers even offer different densities to offer better protection. The outer shell can be made of plastics or fiber materials. Some of the plastics offer very good protection from penetration as in Lexan (bullet-resistant glass) but will not crush on impact, so the outer shell will look undamaged but the inner EPS will be crushed. Fiberglass is less expensive than Lexan but is heavy and very labor-intensive. Fiberglass or fiber shells will crush on impact offering better protection. Some manufacturers will use Kevlar or carbon fiber to help reduce the amount of fiberglass but in the process it will make the helmet lighter and offer more protection from penetration but still crushing on impact. However, using these materials can be very expensive, and manufacturers will balance factors such as protection, comfort, weight, and additional features to meet target price points.

== Function ==
The conventional motorcycle helmet has two principal protective components: a thin, hard, outer shell typically made from polycarbonate plastic, fiberglass, or Kevlar and a soft, thick, inner liner usually made of expanded polystyrene or polypropylene &quot;EPS&quot; foam. The purpose of the hard outer shell is:
# to prevent penetration of the helmet by a pointed object that might otherwise puncture the skull, and
# to provide structure to the inner liner so it does not disintegrate upon abrasive contact with pavement. This is important because the foams used have very little resistance to penetration and abrasion.

The purpose of the foam liner is to crush during an impact, thereby increasing the distance and period of time over which the head stops and reducing its deceleration.

To understand the action of a helmet, it is first necessary to understand the mechanism of head injury. The common perception that a helmet&#x27;s purpose is to save the rider&#x27;s head from splitting open is misleading. Skull fractures are usually not life-threatening unless the fracture is depressed and impinges on the brain beneath and bone fractures usually heal over a relatively short period. Brain injuries are much more serious. They frequently result in death, permanent disability or personality change and, unlike bone, neurological tissue has very limited ability to recover after an injury. Therefore, the primary purpose of a helmet is to prevent traumatic brain injury while skull and face injuries are a significant secondary concern.

== Laws and standards ==
Motorcycle helmets greatly reduce injuries and fatalities in motorcycle accidents, thus many countries have laws requiring acceptable helmets to be worn by motorcycle riders. These laws vary considerably, often exempting mopeds and other small-displacement bikes. In some countries, most notably the United States and India, there is opposition to compulsory helmet use (see Helmet Law Defense League); not all US states have a compulsory helmet law.
Many countries have set standards for the effectiveness of a motorcycle helmet, including the following.

=== Europe ===
European countries apply the United Nations standard ECE 22.06, and some countries apply additional standards and testing:

* SHARP (UK)
* GOST R 41.22-2001 (ГОСТ Р 41.22-2001, based on ECE 22.05, Russia)

In the United Kingdom, many riders choose helmets bearing an Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) Gold sticker. There used to be both Gold and Silver stickers, where the Gold stickers met the BSI Type A standards and the Silver stickers met the BSI Type B. The Silver stickers are no longer in use though, as the introduction of the Economic Communities of Europe (ECE) standard provided a clearer, more stringent testing system which made the Silver standards redundant.

Helmets with an ACU Gold sticker are the only ones allowed to be worn in competition or at track days. However, Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) homologation is superseding the outdated ACU Gold in motorcycle racing. The requirements for FIM homologation are more up-to-date (2019) than the much older ACU Gold standard.

=== North America ===
Helmets are required in Canada and Mexico. In the US, see map: helmets are required in most states of the west and east coasts as well as the southeast, while most states in the center of the country require helmets only for new or young riders, if at all.

North American standards include:

* CMVSS (Canada)
* United States Department of Transportation (DOT) FMVSS 218
* Snell M2005 &amp; M2010 (United States)

The Snell Memorial Foundation has developed stricter requirements and testing procedures for motorcycle helmets with racing in mind, as well as helmets for other activities (such as drag racing, bicycling, horseback riding), and many riders in North America consider Snell certification a benefit when considering buying a helmet while others note that its standards allow for more force (g&#x27;s) to be transferred to a rider&#x27;s head than the US Department of Transportation (DOT) standard. However, the DOT standard does not test the chin bar of helmets with them, while the Snell (and ECE) standards do for full-face type only.

=== South America ===
One South American standard is NBR 7471 (&quot;Norma Brasileira&quot; by Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas, Brazil).

=== Asia and Oceania ===
Standards in Asia and Oceania include:
*AS/NZS 1698, (Australia and New Zealand)
* CRASH (Consumer Rating and Assessment of Safety Helmets, Australia)
* GB 811-2010 (China)
* ICC (Import Commodity Clearance, Philippines)
* IS 4151 (Indian Standard, Bureau of Indian Standards, India)
* JIS T 8133:2000 (Japanese Industrial Standards, Japan)
* MS 1:2011 (Previously MS 1:1996. Revised standard based on ECE 22 but with added penetration test. Department of Standards Malaysia, Malaysia)
* SNI ( Nasional Indonesia)
*TCVN 5756:2001 (test and certify by QUATEST 3) (Vietnam)

=== Worldwide: ECE 22.05 ===
The United Nations&#x27; ECE regulation no. 22.05 contains &quot;uniform provisions concerning the approval of protective helmets and their visors for drivers and passengers of motor cycles and mopeds&quot;. It is an addendum to the 1958 UN agreement &quot;concerning the Adoption of Harmonized Technical United Nations Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts&quot;. The number indicates that it is regulation no. 22, incorporating the 05 series of amendments to the standard.

As first issued in 1972, Regulation No. 22 contained requirements concerning coverage of the head, field of vision, hearing for the user, projections from the helmet, and durability of materials, as well as a series of tests regarding cold, heat and moisture treatments, shock absorption, penetration, rigidity, chinstraps and flammability. It stipulated a maximum helmet mass of 1 kg. Subsequent changes have improved the stringency of the testing procedures, among other issues.

The standard also describes how helmets must be labeled, including with such information as how to wear and clean the helmet, its size and mass, and warnings to replace the helmet after a violent impact. Helmets must also carry a type approval mark of the form &quot;Eaa 05bbbb/c-dddd&quot;. This mark encodes the following information:

* Eaa (within a circle): The number of the country whose authorities approved the helmet (some are no longer parties to the regulation):

* E1: Germany
* E2: France
* E3: Italy
* E4: the Netherlands
* E5: Sweden
* E6: Belgium
* E7: Hungary
* E8: Czech Republic
* E9: Spain
* E10: Yugoslavia
* E11: United Kingdom
* E12: Austria
* E13: Luxembourg
* E14: Switzerland
* E16: Norway
* E17: Finland
* E18: Denmark
* E19: Romania
* E20: Poland
* E21: Portugal
* E22: Russia
* E23: Greece
* E24: Ireland
* E25: Croatia
* E26: Slovenia
* E27: Slovakia
* E28: Belarus
* E29: Estonia
* E31: Bosnia and Herzegovina
* E32: Latvia
* E34: Bulgaria
* E36: Lithuania
* E37: Turkey
* E39: Azerbaijan
* E40: Macedonia (now North Macedonia)
* E42: European Community (unused, as approvals are made by the member states)
* E43: Japan
* E45: Australia
* E46: Ukraine
* E47: South Africa 
* E48: New Zealand
* 05: The series of amendments (effectively, the version number) of the standard tested (at present, normally 05)
* : The approval number issued by the approving authority
* c: The type of helmet:
** &quot;J&quot; if the helmet does not have a lower face cover (&quot;jet-style helmet&quot;)
** &quot;P&quot; if the helmet has a protective lower face cover
** &quot;NP&quot; if the helmet has a non-protective lower face cover
* : The continuous production serial number of the individual helmet

As of December 2017, ECE 22.05 was in force in the European Union, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Egypt, Malaysia, Montenegro, New Zealand, Moldova, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, North Macedonia and Turkey. Other countries have national standards that are based on or reference ECE 22.05.

== Standards testing ==
Most motorcycle helmet standards use impacts at speeds between 4–7 m/s (9–16 mph). While motorcyclists frequently ride at speeds higher than 20 m/s (45 mph), the perpendicular impact speed of the helmet is usually not the same as the road speed of the motorcycle, and the severity of the impact is determined not only by the speed of the head but also by the surface it hits and the angle of impact.

Since the surface of the road is almost parallel to the direction a motorcyclist moves while driving, only a small component of their velocity is directed perpendicularly (though other surfaces may be perpendicular to the motorcyclist&#x27;s velocity, such as trees, walls, and the sides of other vehicles). The severity of an impact is also influenced by the nature of the surface struck. The sheet metal wall of a car door may bend inwards to a depth of during a helmeted-head impact, allowing more stopping distance for the rider&#x27;s head than the helmet itself. A perpendicular impact against a flat steel anvil at 5 m/s (11 mph) may be of approximate severity to an oblique impact against a concrete surface at 30 m/s (67 mph) or a perpendicular impact against a sheet metal car door or windscreen at 30 m/s.

Since there is a wide range of severity in the impacts that could happen in a motorcycle accident, some will be more severe than the impacts used in the standard tests and some will be less.

<doc id="192461" wikidata="Q1357016" url="?curid=192461" title="Three Kings (1999 film)">
<text>Three Kings is a 1999 American black comedy war film written and directed by David O. Russell from a story by John Ridley. It stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze as four American soldiers on a gold heist that takes place during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq against Saddam Hussein following the end of the First Gulf War.

The film was released on October 1, 1999, in the United States. It received critical acclaim.

==Plot==
Following the end of the Gulf War, U.S. soldiers are sent to tie loose ends. The soldiers are bored from the lack of action and throw parties at night. Major Archie Gates, a U.S. Army Special Forces soldier, is trading sex for stories with a journalist, Cathy Daitch, when he is interrupted by Adriana Cruz, the television reporter he is assigned to escort.

While disarming and searching an Iraqi officer, U.S. Army Reserve Sergeant First Class Troy Barlow, his best friend Private First Class Conrad Vig, and their unit find a map in the officer&#x27;s anus. Troy goes to Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin to help translate the map. Major Gates appears after tracking down a lead from Adriana. Archie convinces them that the document is a map of bunkers near Karbala containing gold bullion stolen from Kuwait, which they decide to steal in turn. To keep Adriana off his back, Gates sends Specialist Walter Wogeman to aid her on a false lead.

They set off the next day and, among other goods plundered from Kuwait, find the gold, and stumble on the interrogation of Amir Abdullah. As they leave, Amir&#x27;s wife pleads with them not to abandon the anti-Saddam dissidents. Still, she is executed by the Iraqi Republican Guard. The group decides to free the Iraqi prisoners, triggering a firefight. They pull out just as Iraqi reinforcements arrive, and as they try to evade a CS gas attack, they blunder into a minefield and get separated. Iraqi soldiers capture Troy while a group of rebels rescue the other Americans and take them to their underground hideout. There, Conrad, Chief, and Archie agree to help the rebels and their families reach the Iranian border after they rescue Troy.

Troy is taken back to the bunker and thrown into a room full of Kuwaiti cell phones. He calls his wife on a MicroTAC and tells her to report his location to his local Army Reserve unit. His call is cut short when he is dragged to an interrogation room where he is interrogated by Iraqi Captain Saïd.

The Americans and the rebels go to a band of Iraqi Army deserters, who are persuaded to sell them luxury cars stolen from Kuwait. The vehicles are outfitted as Saddam&#x27;s entourage in a ruse to scare away the bunker&#x27;s defenders. After storming the bunker, they free Troy, who spares Saïd, and find more Shi&#x27;ite dissidents held in a dungeon. A few of the soldiers who ran away return, and shoot Conrad and Troy. Conrad dies; Troy&#x27;s lung is punctured, but he survives.

Archie radios Walter and Adriana and arranges transport while the hapless officers in the camp try to locate the trio after getting the message from Troy&#x27;s wife. Each of the rebels is given a bar of gold, and the rest is buried as they wait for the transport to arrive. The convoy goes to the Iranian border, where the three Americans intend to escort the rebels across to protect them from the Iraqi soldiers guarding the crossing; American officers arrive and stop the group, however, arresting the trio while the rebels are recaptured. Archie offers the buried gold to the American officers in exchange for letting the refugees through. The commanding officer acquiesces to assisting the rebels get into Iran, but still states that charges (of being absent without leave and disobeying orders by contradicting American post-war policy) and courts-martial will be convened against Archie, Troy, and Chief Elgin.

As an epilogue, the film states that the three surviving soldiers (Archie, Troy, and Chief Elgin) are cleared of the charges and honorably discharged, thanks to Adriana&#x27;s reporting. The epilogue goes on to show that Archie goes to work as a military adviser for Hollywood action films, Chief leaves his airport job to work with Archie, and Troy returns to his wife and baby to run his own carpet store. The stolen gold was returned to Kuwait, which claimed that some was missing, implying that the rebels managed to keep the gold they had been given.

==Production==
&quot;Three Kings&quot; was filmed in the deserts of Casa Grande, Arizona, California and Mexico, with many of the extras played by actual Iraqi refugees. According to Russell, two of the cast members had &quot;personally defaced 300 murals of Saddam.&quot; After one of the military advisers to the film died during production, Russell said the death was &quot;perhaps due to chemicals he was exposed to in the Gulf.&quot;

===Script controversy===
Former stand-up comic John Ridley had originally written the screenplay, then titled &quot;Spoils of War&quot;, as an experiment to see how fast he could write and sell a film. The writing took him seven days, and Warner Bros. bought the script 18 days later. When the studio showed a list of their purchased scripts to Russell, the one-sentence description of &quot;Spoils of War&quot;, &quot;heist set in the Gulf War&quot;, appealed to him. Although Russell claimed he never read Ridley&#x27;s script, so as not &quot;to pollute my own idea&quot;, he admits that &quot;John gets credit where it&#x27;s due. The germ of the idea that I took was his.&quot; Ridley maintains that Russell shut him out of the process, saying: &quot;I never heard a word while he was shooting the movie. Never saw any of the script changes. And then finally, a year later, I get a copy of the script, and my name isn&#x27;t even on it.&quot; Although Warner Bros. worked out a deal to give Ridley a &quot;story by&quot; credit, Ridley remains unhappy with the experience, and has blocked Russell&#x27;s efforts to publish the &quot;Three Kings&quot; screenplay in book form.

===Casting===
Russell penned the script with several actors in mind. Although Spike Jonze had never acted in a film before, Russell wrote the part of Conrad Vig specifically for him, and the two practised Conrad&#x27;s Southern accent over the phone while Jonze directed his first feature film, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. Although Russell had to convince a wary Warner Bros. to cast an inexperienced actor in such a large role, he eventually won out. Russell said Jonze&#x27;s lack of previous acting work was beneficial to the film, citing the &quot;chaos that a nonactor brings to the set...he really shakes things up.&quot;

Co-star George Clooney also expressed initial reservations about the choice of Jonze. &quot;It&#x27;s always worrisome when somebody says, &#x27;I got a friend,&#x27; and you&#x27;ve never heard of them. But within five minutes of meeting Spike, you just go, &#x27;Oh, he&#x27;s perfect for the part.&#x27;&quot;

The part of Archie Gates was originally planned for Clint Eastwood, but Russell decided to rewrite it as a younger character. George Clooney eventually saw a copy of the script and was &quot;blown away&quot; by it. When he heard the part was being re-written, he jumped at the chance to get involved. At this point in Clooney&#x27;s career, he was best-known for his role as the handsome Dr. Doug Ross on the popular television drama &quot;ER&quot;. Clooney was ready to pursue a role in film. Unfortunately, Russell seemed unwilling to cast Clooney in the role. Persistent, Clooney sent a humorously self-deprecating letter signed &quot;George Clooney, TV actor&quot; to Russell asking for the part, and showed up at Russell&#x27;s New York City apartment to plead his case. Russell still wasn&#x27;t satisfied that Clooney could portray the character. He instead convinced Nicolas Cage to play the role. However, when Cage became unavailable after being cast in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot;, Russell gave the part to Clooney. Russell later stated that Clooney &quot;was meant to play the part.&quot;

Many of the Iraqi roles were played by actual Iraqi refugees in the United States.

===Film techniques===
Much to the chagrin of Warner Bros., Russell decided to use a number of experimental cinematic techniques in the film. Handheld cameras and Steadicam shots were used to give the film a journalistic feel. Russell shot a majority of the film on Ektachrome transparency stock that was cross-processed in colour negative chemicals, to reproduce &quot;the odd colour of the newspaper images [of the Gulf War].&quot; Though the process produced a unique quality and look to the film, it was exceedingly unreliable to develop, and many film labs would not provide insurance for the transparency stock if it did not develop properly. Russell feared that the scenes would need to be reshot until finally a lab was found that would develop the transparency stock in the negative chemicals. The opening was shot on conventional negative stock and bleach bypassed to give a deep black and high contrast look. Some interior shots were also filmed on conventional negative stock and processed normally. Russell also credited the realism of the firefights to the film&#x27;s cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, who had shot several documentaries on South American civil wars, saying &quot;he knew what it was like to be in that kind of world.&quot;

All of the explosions in the movie were filmed in one shot, as opposed to a typical film where each would have been covered by multiple cameras. Russell explained, &quot;to me that&#x27;s more real. The car&#x27;s blowing up on this guy, and we just park the camera. Of course the producer says, &#x27;we gotta run three cameras!&#x27; But if I cut three ways, then it just looks like an action picture.&quot; Russell also had the sound post-production team tone down the sounds of gunfire, saying he didn&#x27;t want to &quot;Bruce Willis-ize&quot; the film.&quot; One frequently noted shot in the film is an image of a bullet piercing a number of internal organs, releasing bile into the abdominal cavity, used when Gates is describing sepsis as the effect of a gunshot wound. This internal camera is again used when SFC Barlow is shot in the torso and his chest begins to fill with air, crushing his lung. Both of these scenes were inspired by Russell asking an emergency room doctor friend &quot;What&#x27;s the weirdest wound you&#x27;ve ever seen?&quot; It also erupted a minor controversy, when Russell began to joke around that the gunshots were fired into a real corpse; a statement everyone vehemently denied later.

===Conflicts===
The film&#x27;s production process was particularly difficult for Russell, who was taking a variety of risks with what was a $42 million studio film. At the time it was made, Warner Bros. had not financed an auteur film in many years, and executives were hesitant to put such money in the hands of filmmakers who were used to working independently. The film&#x27;s political overtones also worried the studio, especially with conflict still occurring in the Middle East. As a result, Warner Bros. gave Russell a number of limitations. The shooting schedule was reduced to only 68 days instead of the 80 Russell had initially asked for. The studio wanted the budget lowered to $35 million. Executives were also asking for the removal of more violent scenes, such as the exploding cow and the shooting of an Iraqi woman. Russell was also forced to sign a legal document requiring that scenes containing pedophilia accusations against Michael Jackson be removed from the film.

The shoot took place in Arizona during October. The crew were unused to the improvisational, on-the-fly directing style that Russell implemented. Rather than preparing organized shot lists, Russell preferred to use ideas as they came to him, often asking for longer hours. Early on, some of the crew began to feel a dislike for these methods and Russell along with them. Clooney noted that &quot;there&#x27;s an element of David that was in way over his head... he was vulnerable and selfish, and it would manifest itself in a lot of yelling.&quot; When Russell&#x27;s frustration led to outbursts, Clooney took it upon himself to defend crew members and extras, leading to increased tensions. When an extra had an epileptic seizure on set, Clooney ran to his aid while Russell apparently remained indifferent. Afterward, Clooney criticized Russell for ignoring the incident, though Russell later stated that he was busy setting up a shot some yards away from the extra and was not aware that the extra had suffered a seizure. Another on-set conflict between the two arose while shooting footage on a Humvee with a camera mounted to it. Clooney recalls Russell yelling at the driver to drive faster. Clooney then approached the director, telling him to &quot;knock it off&quot;. Russell remembers the incident differently: &quot;The camera broke, we were losing the day and I was upset about that. So I jumped off the truck and I was like, &#x27;Fuck!&#x27; I was just kicking the dirt and everything like that. And then George had this big thing about defending the driver, whom I hadn&#x27;t really said anything to.&quot; During the shoot, Clooney was exhausted as he was still shooting &quot;ER&quot; in Los Angeles three days a week, while working on &quot;Three Kings&quot; the other four.

Clooney was determined to stay with the role and remained loyal to the script. He helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell&#x27;s behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight broke out during the filming of the movie&#x27;s finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements such as helicopters flying overhead and landing in the center of the location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube&#x27;s character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: &quot;We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra.&quot; Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra&#x27;s defense. The two began shouting at one another before getting into a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes: &quot;Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he&#x27;s tremendously talented and do I think he should be nominated for Oscars? Yeah.&quot; Russell offered a different view, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set,&quot; and maintained that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying, &quot;It kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies.&quot;

Though the fight was initially kept under wraps, both Russell and Clooney eventually gave official statements saying that the argument had blown over and neither harbored any ill will towards the other. Clooney continued to describe the event in later interviews, as well as in the cover story of the October 2003 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, in which he states: &quot;I would not stand for him humiliating and yelling and screaming at crew members, who weren&#x27;t allowed to defend themselves. I don&#x27;t believe in it and it makes me crazy. So my job was then to humiliate the people who were doing the humiliating.&quot; Executive producer and production manager Gregory Goodman later stated of Clooney&#x27;s comments in the media, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t reflect well on [Clooney]. It&#x27;s like some stupid sandbox quarrel.&quot; In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying, &quot;We made a really, really great film, and we had a really rough time together, but it&#x27;s a case of both of us getting older. I really do appreciate the work he continues to do, and I think he appreciates what I&#x27;m trying to do.&quot;

==Release==
The film was released in the United States and Canada on October 1, 1999, on 2,942 screens.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Three Kings&quot; received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% rating, based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Three Kings&quot; successfully blends elements of action, drama, and comedy into a thoughtful, exciting movie on the Gulf War.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 34 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Peter Bradshaw says, &quot;A strange flavour, but this is an enjoyable and intelligent action film.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four, writing &quot;&quot;Three Kings&quot; is some kind weird masterpiece, a screw-loose war picture that sends action and humor crashing head-on into each other and spinning off into political anger&quot;. He placed it third on his list of the best films of 1999. David Edelstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;It remains the most caustic anti-war movie of this generation.&quot;

The director&#x27;s commentary of the film reveals that then-incumbent President Bill Clinton liked the film so much that he had it screened for his staff, friends and advisors at the White House.

In &quot;Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy&quot; Matthew Alford called &quot;Three Kings&quot; &quot;an unusual ideological product on Hollywood terms, which begins to break down the official history of the Gulf War [...but nevertheless...] suggests that the problems of Iraq can be solved, and only solved, by the application of US force&quot;. He observes that Russell &quot;sheepishly indicated &quot;Three Kings&quot;&#x27; ideological consistency with the 2003 Iraq War&quot; when Russell met George W. Bush in 1999(?) and said he was making a film that would question his father&#x27;s legacy in Iraq. Alford quotes Bush as responding to Russell: &quot;Then I guess I&#x27;m going to have to finish the job, aren&#x27;t I?&quot;

A. O. Scott described 1999 as a magic year for movies, &quot;up there with 1939 and 1962 and 1974&quot;, highlighting &quot;Three Kings&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot;. He chose the movie one of his &quot;Critics&#x27; Picks&quot;.

===Box office===
The film opened at number two at the United States box office for the weekend with a gross of $15,847,636, behind &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; second weekend gross of $17 million. Exit polls suggested the film played to an older audience than anticipated. The film grossed $60,652,036 in the United States and Canada and $47.1 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $107.8 million.

==Re-release==
In 2004, Warner Bros., feeling the film had become relevant again due to the Iraq War, decided to re-release it in theaters and on DVD. Having no additional footage to add, Russell instead shot &quot;Soldiers Pay&quot;, a short documentary about the Iraq War, to accompany the film. Taking its name from William Faulkner&#x27;s first novel of the same name about an airman&#x27;s return home in World War I&#x27;s aftermath, Russell said the documentary examined &quot;both sides of the war, people who feel good about the war, who believe in the mission, people who feel bad.&quot;

While making the documentary, Russell spoke with both Iraqis and U.S. troops. Asked how the Iraqis he had interviewed felt about the war, Russell said:
 Although Russell had planned to release the film before November 2004, hoping to &quot;perhaps make a difference before the election,&quot; Warner Bros. abandoned the project at the last minute, citing &quot;controversy surrounding the documentary, combined with a later-than-expected arrival of the bonus footage&quot;. Russell disputed the time-crunch excuse, saying: &quot;I think if they really wanted to, they could make it happen.&quot; Eventually, the documentary was purchased by the Independent Film Channel, where it was aired in its entirety the night before the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

<doc id="192463" wikidata="Q1419403" url="?curid=192463" title="Privy Council of Sweden">
<text>The Council of the Realm, or simply The Council ( or : sometimes in ), was a cabinet of medieval origin, consisting of magnates () which advised, and at times co-ruled with, the King of Sweden.

The 1634 Instrument of Government, Sweden&#x27;s first written constitution in the modern sense, stipulated that the King must have a council, but he was free to choose whomever he might find suitable for the job, as long as they were of Swedish birth. At the introduction of absolutism, Charles XI had the equivalent organ named as Royal Council (). In the Age of Liberty, the medieval name was reused. After the bloodless revolution of Gustav III, the Council was abolished in 1789 by the Union and Security Act.

The 1809 Instrument of Government, created a Council of State, also known as the King in Council () which became the constitutionally mandated cabinet where the King had to make all state decisions in the presence of his cabinet ministers (). Throughout the 19th century and reaching its culmination with the enactment of the 1974 Instrument of Government, this new Council gradually transformed into an executive cabinet of ministers known as The Government (), chaired and formed by the Prime Minister who since 1975 is elected by the Riksdag, and which governs the Realm independently of a purely ceremonial monarch.

==Middle Ages==
During the reign of Magnus Ladulås between 1275 and 1290 the meetings of the council became a permanent institution having the offices of Steward (), Constable () and Chancellor (). Particularly from the reign of King Gustav Vasa, with his efforts of creating a centralised State, the members of the Council () gradually became more of courtiers and state officials rather than the semi-autonomous warlords they once were.
==Early modern Sweden==
Following the change of policies upon the death of Gustav II Adolf in action at Lützen in 1632, the 1634 Instrument of Government written by Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna laid the foundation for the administration of modern Sweden. For instance, the roots of the present-day administrative subdivision into counties () is a legacy from this time.

The Instrument established that the council was to be headed by the five Great Officers of the Realm, each leading a branch of the state administration:
* Lord High Steward (or Lord High Justiciar) (Swedish: &quot;riksdrots&quot;)
* Lord High Constable (Swedish: &quot;riksmarsk&quot;)
* Lord High Admiral (Swedish: &quot;riksamiral&quot;)
* Lord High Chancellor (Swedish: &quot;rikskansler&quot;)
* Lord High Treasurer (Swedish: &quot;riksskattmästare&quot;)
Initially, three of the positions were occupied by the members of the Oxenstierna family, with Axel Oxenstierna&#x27;s brother Gabriel Oxenstierna as the High Justiciar and his cousin Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna as the High Treasurer. These positions were later abolished under Charles XI.

==Parliamentarism vs. absolute monarchy==
The councillors had the highest position in the kingdom after the royal family and were styled &quot;the King&#x27;s cousins&quot;. From around 1672, the year of the coming of age of Charles XI, the council was assembled less and less frequently and eventually the king ruled autocratically, using an ad hoc group of trusted relations and advisors to discuss a particular matter or group of matters. The Scanian War (1674–1679) gave the king the opportunity to establish – with the approval of the Estates – an absolute Monarchy along the lines of Renaissance Absolutism. Council, Parliament, local government, legal system, Church of Sweden, all were brought within the power of the King and his secretaries.

This was the culmination of a long power-struggle between the kings and the aristocracy. The first of the Riksdag Acts ratifying the change of system was a declaration that the king was not bound by the 1634 constitution, which no king or queen had ever consented to freely. The councillors were now titles Royal Councillors, being appointed and dismissed at the king&#x27;s pleasure.

In 1713, the son and successor of Charles XI, Charles XII, issued a new working order for the Chancellery to enable him to conduct government from the battle-field, but his sudden death at the siege of Fredricshald in Norway in 1718 provided the opportunity for the parliament (Riksdag of the Estates) to write a new constitution in 1719 and 1721, that gave Sweden half a century of first renewed conciliatory, and then parliamentary government.

The first Estate, the nobility, dominated both the parliament and the council. The council now had 16 members and was chaired by the King. Each councillor had one vote, while the king, as chairman, had two. The council was the government of the country, but also the supreme judicial authority.

From 1738 the Estates could remove councillors to create a majority corresponding to that of the Estates, the Estates also appointing the President of the Chancellery (the prime minister), along party lines.
The Freedom of the Press Act (1766) was also passed during this period.

This Age of Liberty lasted until the bloodless coup d&#x27;état of king Gustav III in 1772, which restored royal sovereignty under the guise of the 1634 Instrument of Government.

In 1789, by the Union and Security Act (), an amendment charter to the constitution, the exclusive right of the nobility to high offices was abolished and the Estates of the Burghers and the Peasants also received these privileges - a step towards modern democracy. Aristocratic control of state organs ceased, and the Privy Council was abolished, although the councillors retained their titles for life. The council&#x27;s judicial function devolved on the King&#x27;s Supreme Court () composed of an equal number of noble and non-noble members. In the 1789 constitutional amendment Gustav III, having desired to abolish the constitutional power of the Council (a pesky limitation to royal rule of the executive branch, in his view), had instead received the right to determine the number of councillors. He decided to have zero of them, instead he created the office of Rikets allmänna ärendens beredning, which was a predecessor to the Council of State.

==Developments in 1809 and beyond==

The loss of the Finnish War in 1809 prompted a military coup which removed Gustav IV Adolf, replacing the Gustavian era with a new dynasty and a new constitution restoring initiative to the Estates.

On 6 June 1809, a new constitution was adopted, and while the King still appointed the members of the Council, once again called the Council of State, the legislative powers were once again shared with the Riksdag of the Estates.

The new Council had nine members; the leading members being the Minister of State for Justice () and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (). The departmental reform of 1840 created seven ministries headed by a minister, and in 1866 the four Estates were abolished and the new bicameral Riksdag was constituted.

In 1917, as the outcome of the 1914 Courtyard Crisis (), the parliamentary system was firmly established in Sweden, and the King could no longer independently appoint cabinet members without taking the will of the Riksdag into account.

<doc id="192464" wikidata="Q234436" url="?curid=192464" title="Ninette de Valois">
<text>Dame Ninette de Valois (born Edris Stannus; 6 June 1898 – 8 March 2001) was an Irish-born British dancer, teacher, choreographer, and director of classical ballet. Most notably, she danced professionally with Serge Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, later establishing the Royal Ballet, one of the foremost ballet companies of the 20th century and one of the leading ballet companies in the world. She also established the Royal Ballet School and the touring company which became the Birmingham Royal Ballet. She is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of ballet and as the &quot;godmother&quot; of English and Irish ballet.

==Life==
===Early life and family===
Ninette de Valois was born as Edris Stannus on 6 June 1898 at Baltyboys House, an 18th-century manor house near the town of Blessington, County Wicklow, Ireland, then still part of the United Kingdom. A member of a gentry family, she was the second daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stannus DSO, a British Army officer, and Elizabeth Graydon Smith, a glassmaker known as &quot;Lilith Stannus&quot;. She was the maternal great-granddaughter of the diarist Elizabeth Grant Smith and the maternal great-great-granddaughter of Scottish politician John Peter Grant. Through her mother she was also the great-grandniece of Sir John Peter Grant and a first cousin twice removed of Lady Strachey. In 1905 she moved to England, to live with her grandmother in Kent. She started attending ballet lessons in 1908, at the age of ten.

===Early dancing career===
At the age of thirteen Stannus began her professional training at the Lila Field Academy for Children. It was at this time that she changed her name to Ninette de Valois and made her professional debut as a principal dancer in pantomime at the Lyceum Theatre in the West End.

In 1919, at the age of 21, she was appointed principal dancer of the Beecham Opera, which was then the resident opera company at the Royal Opera House. She continued to study ballet with notable teachers, including Edouard Espinosa, Enrico Cecchetti and Nicholas Legat.

===Ballets Russes===
In 1923, de Valois joined the Ballets Russes, a renowned ballet company founded by the Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev. She remained with the company for three years, performing around Europe and being promoted to the rank of &quot;Soloist&quot;, and creating roles in some of the company&#x27;s most famous ballets, including &quot;Les biches&quot; and &quot;Le Train Bleu&quot;. During this time, she was also mentor to Alicia Markova who was only a child at the time, but would eventually be recognized as a Prima Ballerina Assoluta and one of the most famous English dancers of all time. Later in her life, Valois said that everything she knew about how to run a ballet company she learned from working with Diaghilev. She stepped back from regular intense dancing in 1924, after doctors detected damage from a previously undiagnosed case of childhood polio.

===London and Dublin dance schools===
After leaving the Ballets Russes, in 1927, de Valois established the Academy of Choreographic Art, a dance school for girls in London and the Abbey Theatre School of Ballet, Dublin. In London, her ultimate goal was to form a repertory ballet company, with dancers drawn from the school and trained in a uniquely British style of ballet. Students of the school were given professional stage experience performing in opera and plays staged at The Old Vic, with de Valois choreographing several short ballets for the theatre. Lilian Baylis was the owner of the Old Vic at that time, and in 1928 she also acquired and refurbished the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, with the intention of creating a sister theatre to the Old Vic. She employed de Valois to stage full-scale dance productions at both theatres and when the Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre re-opened in 1931, de Valois moved her school into studios there, under the new name, the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet School. A ballet company was also formed, known as the Vic-Wells Ballet. The Vic-Wells ballet company and school would be the predecessors of today&#x27;s Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and Royal Ballet School.

Also in 1927, in May, W. B. Yeats, poet and co-founder of the Abbey Theatre, suggested to de Valois while she was visiting Dublin the establishment of a ballet school in the city, and from around November, she took responsibility for the setting up and the programming of the Abbey Theatre School of Ballet in Dublin. This, the first of perhaps five Irish national ballet school projects during the 20th century, ran until June 1933, and 7 of the 16 final students continued in active dancing, with 2 founding the next national ballet project, the &quot;Abbey School of Ballet&quot;.

===Choreography===
During these years de Valois produced a number of ballets each year, mostly to her own choreography. She also worked with music specially commissioned from Irish contemporary composers such as Harold R. White&#x27;s &quot;The Faun&quot; (April 1928), Arthur Duff&#x27;s &quot;The Drinking Horn&quot; and John F. Larchet&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (both in July 1933).

===Vic-Wells Ballet===

At its formation, the Vic-Wells Ballet had only six female dancers, with de Valois working as lead dancer and choreographer. The company performed its first full ballet production on 5 May 1931 at the Old Vic, with Anton Dolin as guest star. Its first performance at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre came a few days later, on 15 May 1931. As a result of the success of the company, de Valois hired new dancers and choreographers. She retired fully from the stage herself in 1933, after Alicia Markova joined the company and was appointed as Prima Ballerina.

Under de Valois&#x27;s direction, the company flourished in the 1930s, becoming one of the first Western dance companies to perform the classical ballet repertoire made famous by the Imperial Russian Ballet. She also set about establishing a British repertory, engaging Frederick Ashton as Principal Choreographer and Constant Lambert as musical director in 1935. She also choreographed a number of her own ballets, including her most notable works, &quot;Job&quot; (1931), &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1935) and &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1937).

Eventually, the company included many of the most famous ballet dancers in the world, including Margot Fonteyn, Robert Helpmann, Moira Shearer, Beryl Grey, and Michael Somes. In 1949 the Sadler Wells Ballet was a sensation when they toured the United States. Fonteyn instantly became an international celebrity.

In 1947, de Valois established the first ballet school in Turkey. Formed as the ballet school of the Turkish State Opera and Ballet in Istanbul, the school was later absorbed into and became the School of Music &amp; Ballet at Ankara State Conservatory, a department of the Hacettepe University.

===The Royal Ballet===
In 1956, the ballet company and school were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth II, and formally linked. De Valois made sure that her company had a constant supply of talent, and in later years it had such stars as Svetlana Beriosova, Antoinette Sibley, Nadia Nerina, Lynn Seymour, and, most sensationally, Rudolf Nureyev. She also invited choreographers such as Sir Kenneth MacMillan and George Balanchine to work with her company. She formally retired from the Royal Ballet directorship in 1963, but her presence continued to loom large in the company, and the same was true with the School, from which she formally retired in 1970.

De Valois acted as patron or supporter to a number of other projects, including the Cork Ballet Company and the Irish National Ballet Company in Ireland.

===Turkish State Ballet===
As with ballet in Britain and Ireland, de Valois exerted a great deal of influence on the development of ballet in Turkey, which had no prior history with the art form. The Turkish Government invited her to research the possibility of establishing a ballet school in the country, and she subsequently visited the country in the 1940s, going on to open a school following the same model as her Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet School in London. Initially, very few people took the project seriously, but the school did become firmly established under the direction of Molly Lake and Travis Kemp, who in 1954 had undertaken to run it at de Valois&#x27; request; this ultimately led to the development of the Turkish State Ballet.

After training the first set of pupils at the new school, de Valois produced a number of early performances by the state ballet company, permitting guest appearances by Royal Ballet dancers including Margot Fonteyn, Nadia Nerina, Anya Linden, Michael Somes and David Blair. She mounted productions of the traditional classical repertoire including &quot;Coppélia&quot;, &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, as well as the contemporary ballets &quot;Les Patineurs&quot;, &quot;Les Rendezvous&quot; and &#x27; by Frederick Ashton, and her own ballets &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot; and &quot;Orpheus&quot;.

In 1965, de Valois produced and choreographed the first full-length work created for the new Turkish State Ballet. Titled &quot;Çeşmebaşı&quot; (&quot;At the Fountain&quot;), the ballet was the first to feature music composed by a Turkish composer, Ferit Tuzun, and its choreography incorporated elements of Turkish folk dance. Further ballets followed, and the company continued to develop. Today, ballet continues to be a thriving art form in Turkey, with the ballet school that de Valois established now forming part of the State Conservatory for Music and Drama at the Ankara State Conservatory.

===Personal life===

In 1935, at Windsor, she married Dr Arthur Blackall Connell (1902–1987), a physician and surgeon from Wandsworth, who worked as a general practitioner in Barnes, London, where they lived, and later Sunningdale, Berkshire. She was his second wife; the union was childless, but de Valois had two step-sons, including Dr David Blackall Connell (born 1930), who, in 1955, married Susan Jean Carnegie, a daughter of John Carnegie, 12th Earl of Northesk; they had two sons and a daughter.

De Valois kept her private life very distinct from her professional, making only the briefest of references to her marriage in her autobiographical writings. In April 1964 she was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the home of the dancer Frederick Ashton in London. She continued to make public appearances until her death in London at the age of 102.

In 1991, de Valois appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her chosen book was a collection of poems and her luxury item was an everlasting bottle of sleeping pills.

==Choreographic works==

Among her earliest choreography was a production of the Greek tragedy &quot;Oresteia&quot;, which opened Terence Gray&#x27;s Cambridge Festival Theatre in November 1926. De Valois first established herself as a choreographer producing several short ballets for The Old Vic, London. She also provided choreography for plays and operas at the theatre, all of which were performed by her own pupils. After forming the Vic-Wells Ballet, her first major production, &quot;Job&quot; (1931), was the first ballet to define the future of the British ballet repertoire.

Later, after employing Frederick Ashton as the company&#x27;s first Principal Choreographer in 1935, de Valois collaborated with him to produce a series of signature ballets, which are recognized as cornerstones of British ballet. These included &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1935) and &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1937).

===&quot;Job&quot; (1931)===

The oldest ballet in the Royal Ballet repertoire, &quot;Job&quot; is regarded as a crucial work in the development of British ballet and was the first ballet to be produced by an entirely British creative team. The ballet was produced and choreographed by de Valois, with a commissioned score entitled &quot;Job, a Masque for Dancing&quot;, written by Ralph Vaughan Williams, with orchestrations by Constant Lambert and designs by Gwendolen Raverat. The libretto for the ballet was written by Geoffrey Keynes and is based on William Blake&#x27;s engraved edition of the Book of Job from the Hebrew Bible. Consisting of eight scenes, the ballet is inspired by Blake&#x27;s engravings and so de Valois choreographed the ballet using predominantly mimed actions to create a simple decorative effect.

&quot;Job&quot; features a number of well-known dances, which continue to be performed regularly. The most recognised extracts are &quot;Satan&#x27;s Dance&quot;, an acrobatic solo for a male dancer, the dance of Job&#x27;s comforters, and the satirical expressionist dances representing &quot;War&quot;, &quot;Pestilence&quot; and &quot;Famine&quot;. &quot;Job&quot; had its world premiere on 5 July 1931, and was performed for members of the Camargo Society at the Cambridge Theatre, London. The first public performance of the ballet took place on 22 September 1931 at the Old Vic Theatre.

<text>Odvar Nordli (; 3 November 1926 – 9 January 2018) was a Norwegian politician from the Labour Party. He was the prime minister of Norway from 1976 to 1981 during the Cold War.
Before serving as prime minister, Nordli served as the minister of local government from 1971 to 1972.

After serving as prime minister, Nordli served as the vice president of the Storting from 1981 until 1985, and was also a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1985 until 1996.

== Early life ==
The son of a railroad worker, Eugen Nordli (1904–1992) and housewife Marie (1902–1984), (née Jørgensen), Nordli grew up in Tangen in Stange, Hedmark. After World War II he served in the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany, part of the Allied forces occupying post-war Germany.

By education he became a certified accountant before entering politics, and worked in this field until 1961. He served as deputy mayor of Stange municipality from 1951 to 1963.

== Early political career ==
He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Hedmark in 1961, and was re-elected on five occasions. He had previously served in the position of deputy representative during the terms 1954–1957 and 1958–1961.

Nordli became a cabinet member in 1971, serving as Minister of Local Government in the first cabinet Bratteli.

At the Labour Party Congress in 1975 both Nordli and Reiulf Steen candidated to replace Trygve Bratteli as new leader. A compromise was worked out that made Steen the new party leader while Nordli was designated as the party&#x27;s new prime minister. This became a strained arrangement and they never cooperated well.

Nordli became Prime Minister in 1976, heading the cabinet Nordli which succeeded the second cabinet Bratteli. He had to govern through several tough cases like the so-called double-resolution over NATO and the national controversy over the damming of the Alta-Kautokeino river.

In social policy, Nordli&#x27;s premiership in 1978 saw improved sickness benefits to 100% wage compensation from day one of sickness for up to 52 weeks. The previous law had not had any compensation for ordinary workers for the first 3 days and 90% compensation after that time. The same year the Abortion Act of 1975 was liberalized and women were granted the right to decide on their own to have an abortion until the end of week 12 after gestation. In the original act approval of a committee of doctors had been required in order to have an abortion.

The Nordli cabinet under Minister of Finance Per Kleppe continued a Keynesian fiscal policy with deficit spending where Norway loaned abroad against future oil income. Wages increased more than in other countries, leading to Norwegian businesses becoming less competitive. In September 1978 the government through a provisional law made a general ban against increases in wages and prices. The law was in effect through 1979. The cabinet also partly reversed the expansive fiscal policy.

As for foreign relations during the Nordli premiership, Norway established a 200 nautical miles exclusive economic zone in 1977 where Norway claimed exclusive rights to marine resources. This caused complications with Russia that also had a 200 nm fishery zone. In 1978, Maritime law minister, Jens Evensen stated that Norway and Russia agreed on a one year Grey Zone Agreement which was subsequently renewed until it was replaced with a permanent agreement in 2010.

The 1977 Norwegian parliamentary election less than a year into Nordli&#x27;s premiership was a success for Nordli and the Labour Party which continued in position, but the 1979 Norwegian local elections was a set-back, partly due to the economic situation and it weakened Nordli&#x27;s position.

Nordli got health problems about two years into his premiership and in 1981 his doctor advised him to take a sick leave. This leaked to the media before Nordli had made any decision and as a result he was soon after replaced by Gro Harlem Brundtland and another Labour cabinet, Brundtland&#x27;s First Cabinet.

==Post-Prime Minister career==

After retiring as prime minister in 1981, he was elected vice president of the Storting. He served as vice president until 1985.

His career ended with the post of County Governor of Hedmark, which he held from 1981 until his retirement in 1993. He was also a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1985 to 1993.

After retiring, Nordli had a number of books published which included autobiographical writings and lighter stories about politics, daily life and nature.

== Personal life ==
Nordli met his wife Marit Haraseth (27 April 1932–3 October 2010) during a Hedmark divisional committee Labour Party youth wing meet. They married in 1953, had two daughters and lived in Stange until their respective deaths in 2010 and 2018.

Nordli died on 9 January 2018 of prostate cancer in Oslo at the age of 90. His state funeral was held on 19 January 2018.

<doc id="192467" wikidata="Q164346" url="?curid=192467" title="Einar Gerhardsen">
<text>Einar Henry Gerhardsen (; 10 May 1897 – 19 September 1987) was a Norwegian politician who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1945 to 1951, 1955 to 1963 and 1963 to 1965. With a total of 16 years in office, he is the longest serving Prime Minister in Norway since the introduction of parliamentarism. He was the leader of the Labour Party from 1945 to 1965.

Many Norwegians often refer to him as &quot;Landsfaderen&quot; (Father of the Nation); he is generally considered one of the main architects of the post-war rebuilding of Norway after World War II. He also served as the second President of the Nordic Council in 1954.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Einar Gerhardsen was born in the municipality of Asker, in the county of Akershus. His parents were Gerhard Olsen (1867–1949) and Emma Hansen (1872–1949). His father was rodemester&#x27; roadworker &#x27; in Public Roads Administration and was foreman of a trade union committee, fanekomiteen for Veivesenets arbeiderforening, and during Gerhardsen&#x27;s childhood the trade union&#x27;s leader, Carl Jørgensen, frequently visited their home, and sometimes they would sing The Internationale and Seieren følger våre faner (&quot;victory follows our banners&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

In 1932, he married Werna Julie Koren Christie (1912–1970), daughter of agent Johan Werner Koren Christie and Klara Rønning. The couple had two sons, Truls and Rune and a daughter Torgunn. His brother was Rolf Gerhardsen and the pair also had a lifelong working relationship. From the age of seventeen, Gerhardsen attended meetings with the Labour Party&#x27;s youth movement. In 1918, during the Finnish Civil War, Gerhardsen resigned his membership of the Church of Norway after the church sided with the &quot;Whites&quot; against the &quot;Reds&quot;.

=== Political work, imprisonment ===
Originally a road worker, Gerhardsen became politically active in the socialist labour movement during the 1920s. He was convicted several times of taking part in subversive activities until he, along with the rest of the Labour Party, gradually moved from communism to democratic socialism. He participated in the Left Communist Youth League&#x27;s military strike action of 1924. He was convicted for assisting in this crime and sentenced to 75 days in prison.

By the mid-1930s, Labour was a major force on the national political scene, becoming the party of government under Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold from 1935 until the Nazi invasion in 1940. Gerhardsen was elected to Oslo city council in 1932 and became deputy mayor in 1938. He was deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1939.

After the German occupation of Norway in 1940, Gerhardsen became acting Chairman of the Labour Party, as the chairman, Oscar Torp had gone into exile. Gerhardsen became Mayor of Oslo on 15 August 1940, but was forced to resign by the Germans on 26 August the same year. In September, the Nazi occupation government banned all parliamentary political parties, including the Labour Party.

During World War II, Gerhardsen took part in the organised resistance against the German occupation of Norway, and was arrested on 11 September 1941. Having already been under suspicion for a long time, Gerhardsen had been detained and subjected to interrogations on 31 previous occasions since the summer of 1940. Initially he was sent to Grini concentration camp in Norway. In February 1942, he was accused of leading resistance work from his imprisonment, and removed from the camp for interrogation. Initially interrogated at the police station at Møllergata 19, he was soon transferred to the Gestapo headquarters at Victoria Terrasse. At Victoria Terrasse, he was tortured to reveal information on the resistance, but did not give in. In April 1942, he was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. In September 1944, he was transferred back to Grini, where he spent the rest of the war.

After the war, Gerhardsen formed the interim government which sat from the end of the occupation in May 1945 until the general election held in October the same year. The election gave Labour an absolute majority in Parliament, the Storting, which it retained until 1961. Gerhardsen served as President of the Storting from 10 January 1954 to 22 January 1955.

=== Domestic and foreign policy from 1945 ===
During and after his periods in office, he was greatly respected by the people; even those not sharing his social democratic views. The administrations he led forged an eclectic economic policy in which government regulation of commerce, industry and banking. Abject poverty and unemployment were sharply reduced by his government&#x27;s policies of industrialisation and redistribution of wealth through progressive taxation, together with the creation of a comprehensive social security system.

The Norwegian State Housing Bank Law of March 1946 introduced relatively cheap loans for co-operative housing societies and individual private builders. The Child Allowances Law of October 1946 introduced allowances for second and subsequent children under the age of sixteen years, while also providing allowances for single-parent families for the birth of their first child. Under a July 1947 law, unemployment insurance coverage was extended to agricultural workers and certain other groups. In 1947, a loan fund for students was introduced. That same year, housing allowances were introduced for families with two or more children below the age of sixteen years, “who live in dwellings financed through Housing Bank and in municipalities which pay one-third of the allowance.” The Comprehensive Schooling Law of July 1954 established nine-year comprehensive schooling on a trial basis, while the Sickness Insurance Law of March 1956 introduced compulsory insurance for all residents. A law in January 1960 introduced an invalidity pension scheme and a law of June 1961 extended accident coverage to military personnel and conscripts. In 1957, universal basic pensions were introduced. In 1957 an orphans’ pension scheme was established, and in 1958 university occupational injury insurance was introduced. In 1957, housing allowances were made available for single-parent families with children, and that same year, and income and property means test was introduced while the Housing Allowances Law was made compulsory for all municipalities. In 1964, a national widow’s benefit was introduced.

In foreign policy, Gerhardsen aligned Norway with the Western powers at the end of the 1940s after some initial hesitation within the governing party. He denounced Norwegian communists in the Kråkerøy speech in 1948, and had Norway become a founding member of NATO in 1949. Documents from 1958 reveal that the Gerhardsen&#x27;s government knew that Israel was going to use heavy water supplied by Noratom for plutonium production, making it possible for Israel to produce nuclear weapons.

In November 1962, an accident in which 21 miners died occurred in the Kings Bay coal mine on Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago. In the aftermath, the Gerhardsen government was accused of not complying with laws enacted by parliament. In the summer of 1963 a vote of no confidence passed with the support of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party and a centre-right minority coalition government was formed, under John Lyng. Although this new government lasted only three weeks, until the Socialist People&#x27;s Party realigned itself with Labour, it formed the basis for an opposition victory under the leadership of Per Borten at the 1965 general election. Gerhardsen retired from national politics in 1969 but continued to influence public opinion through writing and speeches.

Gerhardsen&#x27;s political legacy is still an important force in Norwegian politics, especially within his own party, although some of the social policies of his government have been revised. (See also Economy of Norway)

=== Soviet intelligence claim ===
According to Vassili Mitrokhin, Gerhardsen became a Soviet intelligence operative during his visit to the USSR.

=== Later life and death ===
Gerhardsen spent the last years of his life in Oslo, where he died on 19 September 1987, at the age of 90, he was buried in the Vestre Gravlund.

<doc id="192469" wikidata="Q196936" url="?curid=192469" title="The Parallax View">
<text>The Parallax View is a 1974 American political thriller film starring Warren Beatty, with Hume Cronyn, William Daniels and Paula Prentiss in support. Produced and directed by Alan J. Pakula, its screenplay is by David Giler and Lorenzo Semple Jr., based on the 1970 novel by Loren Singer. The story concerns a reporter&#x27;s investigation into a secretive organization, the Parallax Corporation, whose business is political assassination.

==Plot==
TV journalist Lee Carter witnesses the assassination of U.S. senator and presidential aspirant Charles Carroll atop the Seattle Space Needle. The suspected killer, a waiter, is killed during the pursuit. The real killer, disguised as a waiter, escapes. The assassination is officially determined to have been the work of a single man acting alone. Six witnesses die over the next three years. Carter fears she will be next, and goes to ex-boyfriend Joe Frady, an investigative newspaper reporter in Oregon, for protection; he turns her away. Shortly afterwards Carter is found dead; the death is ruled to be suicide from alcohol and barbiturate overdosing.

Feeling guilty about disregarding Carter&#x27;s pleas and suspicious about her death, Frady investigates the drowning death of Judge Arthur Bridges - another witness - in the nearby small town of Salmontail. Wicker, the local sheriff, takes Frady to a place below a dam where Bridges died. Wicker holds Frady at gunpoint as the floodgates open, but it is Wicker who drowns. At Wicker&#x27;s home, Frady discovers documents from the &quot;Parallax Corporation&quot;, an organization recruiting &quot;security&quot; operatives. Frady takes a Parallax personality test document from Wicker&#x27;s home to a local psychology professor, Nelson Schwartzkopf. Schwartzkopf determines the test is used to identify homicidal psychopaths and gives it to a known psychopath to learn the &quot;correct&quot; answers.

Frady meets with Austin Tucker, an aide to Carroll and another witness, on Tucker&#x27;s yacht; Tucker has survived two murder attempts since the assassination. Tucker saw the real assassin and gives Frady an image of the assassin in disguise. A bomb destroys the yacht. Tucker is killed, and Frady - sitting at the bow - is thrown into the water and presumed killed. Frady tells his editor, Bill Rintels, that he will use his official death and a pseudonym to infiltrate Parallax. A few days later, Frady is recruited for training by Parallax official Jack Younger.

Frady visits Parallax&#x27;s Los Angeles headquarters where he is observed for reactions to montages of disturbingly edited and subliminal still photographs and images that juxtapose pro- and anti-American attitudes. Frady spots Carroll&#x27;s assassin while leaving and follows the assassin, who puts a bomb aboard an airliner in checked baggage at Hollywood Burbank Airport. Frady boards the flight, mistakenly believing the assassin to be on board, and sees another U.S. senator who is also considering running for president. Frady surreptitiously warns a flight attendant. The jet returns to the airport and is evacuated before it explodes.

Younger confronts Frady about the latter&#x27;s alias. Frady&#x27;s cover story and a second alias mollifies Younger. Later, at the newspaper office, Rintels listens to a recording of this conversation and stores it with other evidence. That evening, Rintels is killed by poisoned food delivered by the assassin, disguised as a deli delivery boy. The evidence is gone by the time Rintels&#x27; body is discovered.

Frady goes to Parallax&#x27;s office in Atlanta, where he has been assigned a security position. There, he follows the assassin to a rehearsal for a political rally for another presidential aspirant, Senator George Hammond. Frady chases the assassin. Hammond is killed by an unseen sniper. Frady finds the rifle on the catwalks and then spotted by security. Frady flees, realizing he is being framed as a scapegoat, and is killed by security.

Six months later, another official investigation reports that Frady was a paranoid lone gunman who killed Hammond out of a misguided sense of patriotism.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
The film is based on a novel by Loren Singer. The novel followed witnesses of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination who were subsequently killed, but in the screenplay they see an assassination more like that of Robert F. Kennedy. Robert Towne did an uncredited rewrite of the screenplay.

===Cinematography===
Frady is often filmed from great distances, suggesting that he is being watched.

===Montage===
Most of the images used in the assassin training montage were of anonymous figures or important historical figures, featuring among others Richard Nixon, Adolf Hitler, Pope John XXIII, and Lee Harvey Oswald (the photograph that captures the moment Oswald is shot). The montage also uses drawings by Jack Kirby from Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Thor&quot;. They are juxtaposed with caption cards showing the words &#x27;LOVE&#x27;, &#x27;MOTHER&#x27;, &#x27;FATHER&#x27;, &#x27;HOME&#x27;, &#x27;ENEMY&#x27;, &#x27;HAPPINESS&#x27;, and &#x27;ME&#x27;. The montage &quot;captures the confusion of post-Kennedy America&quot; by demonstrating the decay of values and longstanding traditions. It has been compared to the brainwashing scene in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

==Critical reception==
At the time of its release, &quot;The Parallax View&quot; received mixed reactions from critics, but the film&#x27;s reception has been more positive in recent years. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus says, &quot;&quot;The Parallax View&quot; blends deft direction from Alan J. Pakula and a charismatic Warren Beatty performance to create a paranoid political thriller that stands with the genre&#x27;s best.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars upon its release. While Beatty offered a good performance in an effective if predictable thriller, Ebert said the actor was not called upon to exercise his full talents. Ebert also noted similarities to the 1973 film &quot;Executive Action&quot;, but said &quot;Parallax&quot; was &quot;a better use of similar material, however, because it tries to entertain instead of staying behind to argue.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;Neither Mr. Pakula nor his screenwriters, David Giler and Lorenzo Semple, Jr., display the wit that Alfred Hitchcock might have used to give the tale importance transcending immediate plausibility. The moviemakers have, instead, treated their central idea so soberly that they sabotage credulity.&quot; Joseph Kanon of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; found the film&#x27;s subject pertinent: &quot;what gives the movie its real force is the way its menace keeps absorbing material from contemporary life.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel wrote, &quot;We would probably be better off rethinking—or better yet, not thinking about—the whole dismal business, if only to put an end to ugly and dramatically unsatisfying products like &quot;The Parallax View&quot;.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Chris Nashawaty wrote, &quot;&quot;The Parallax View&quot; is a mother of a thriller... and Beatty, always an underrated actor thanks (or no thanks) to his off-screen rep as a Hollywood lothario, gives a hell of a performance in a career that&#x27;s been full of them.&quot;

Alexander Kaplan at Film Score Monthly wrote, &quot;Beatty brought his relaxed, low-key charm[,] making his character’s fate even more shocking, while the supporting cast provided ... memorable performances, including Paula Prentiss’s heartbreakingly terrified reporter[.] ... Pakula observed that Frady &#x27;imagines the most bizarre kind of plots, (but) is destroyed by a truth worse than anything he could have imagined.&#x27; The film’s ending ... suggests that Parallax may have been onto Frady the whole time, another subversion of his heroic status. Even the hero’s name is unheroic, &#x27;Joe Frady&#x27; suggesting a mocking mixture of &quot;Dragnet&quot;’s Joe Friday and the schoolyard taunt [&#x27;]fraidy cat.&#x27;&quot;

The motion picture won the Critics Award at the Avoriaz Film Festival (France) and was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture. Gordon Willis won the Award for Best Cinematography from the National Society of Film Critics (USA).

Reviewing films depicting political assassination conspiracies for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, director Alex Cox called the film the &quot;best JFK conspiracy movie&quot;. Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz has called it &quot;a damn near perfect movie&quot;.

<text>Trier was one of the three &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, located in the west of the state.

== History ==
The region was created in 1815 as part of the Prussian Rhineland. Until 1920 the bulk of what then became the Territory of Saar Basin was part of the Trier Region. Only the east of the Saar Territory, today&#x27;s Saar-Palatinate district, formerly the western fringes of the then Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate, was previously no part of the Trier Region. In April 1937 the St. Wendel-Baumholder district, formed in 1920 from those parts of the St. Wendel district that had not been seceded to the Saar Territory, was dissected from the Trier Region and merged in the new Birkenfeld district within the Koblenz Region.

After the Second World War the French military government several times extended the Saar area before forming the Saar Protectorate, also including additional 109 municipalities belonging until July 1946 to the Trier Region and some to the Koblenz Region. Koblenz Region&#x27;s former areas make up part of today&#x27;s St. Wendel district in the Saarland. In December 1946, when a new customs boundary dissected the Saar Protectorate (later becoming the Saarland) from the area under the Allied Control Council over Allied-occupied Germany, the Trier Region with its then remaining territory had become one of the then five regions forming the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate, founded in August 1946. Later, the French occupation government again redeployed some municipalities – some returned to Allied-occupied Germany, some newly annexed to the protectorate – between the Saar area and the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1947 and 1949, before the border was finally fixed.

Since 2000, the employees and assets of the Bezirksregierungen (i.e. regional administrations) form the &quot;Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion Trier&quot; (ADD; Supervisory and Service Directorate Trier) and the &quot;Struktur- und Genehmigungsdirektionen&quot; (SGD; Structural and Approval Directorates) &quot;Nord&quot; in Koblenz and &quot;Süd&quot; in Neustadt (Weinstraße). These administrations execute their authority over the whole state, i. e. the &quot;ADD Trier&quot; oversees all schools.

<text>Koblenz was one of the - at last - three of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, located in the north-east of the state.

The region was created in 1815 as part of the Prussian Rhineland, becoming part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1946. In 1968 the neighbouring Montabaur Region was dissolved and its territory annexed to Koblenz Region.

Since 2000, the employees and assets of the Bezirksregierungen form the &quot;Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion Trier&quot; (Supervisory and Service Directorate Trier) and the &quot;Struktur- und Genehmigungsdirektionen&quot; (Structural and Approval Directorates) &quot;Nord&quot; in Koblenz and &quot;Süd&quot; in Neustadt (Weinstraße).

<doc id="192479" wikidata="Q384768" url="?curid=192479" title="Battle of the Beams">
<text>The Battle of the Beams was a period early in the Second World War when bombers of the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) used a number of increasingly accurate systems of radio navigation for night bombing in the United Kingdom. British scientific intelligence at the Air Ministry fought back with a variety of their own increasingly effective means, involving jamming and deception signals. The period ended when the Wehrmacht moved their forces to the East in May 1941, in preparation for the attack on the Soviet Union.

The idea of beam radio navigation was developed during the 1930s, initially as a blind landing aid. The basic concept is to produce two directional radio signals that are aimed slightly to the left and right of a runway&#x27;s midline. Radio operators in the aircraft listen for these signals and determine which of the two beams they are flying in. This is normally accomplished by sending Morse code signals into the two beams, to identify right and left.

For bombing, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; built huge versions of the antennas to provide much greater accuracy at long range, named &quot;Knickebein&quot; and &quot;X-Gerät&quot;. These were used during the early stages of the Blitz with great effect, in one case laying a strip of bombs down the centerline of a factory deep in England. Tipped off about the system&#x27;s operation by pre-war military intelligence, the British responded by sending their own Morse code signals so that the aircraft crew believed they were always properly centred in the beam while they flew wildly off course. The Germans became convinced the British had somehow learned to bend radio signals.

When the problem became widespread, the Germans introduced a new system that worked on different principles, the &quot;Y-Gerät&quot;. Having guessed the nature of this system from a passing mention, the British had already deployed countermeasures that rendered the system useless almost as soon as it was used. The Germans eventually abandoned the entire concept of radio navigation over the UK, concluding the British would continue to successfully jam it.

== Background ==
Before the start of the war on 1 September 1939, &quot;Lufthansa&quot; and the German aircraft industry invested heavily in the development of commercial aviation, and in systems and methods that would improve safety and reliability. Considerable effort went into blind-landing aids which allowed aircraft to approach an airport at night or in foul weather. The primary system developed for this was the Lorenz system, developed by Johannes Plendl, which was in the process of being widely deployed on large civilian and military aircraft.

The Lorenz system worked by feeding a special three-element antenna system with a modulated radio signal. The signal was fed to the centre dipole, which had a slightly longer reflector element on either side set slightly back. A switch rapidly alternated the opened midpoint connection of each reflector in turn, sending the beam slightly to the left and then slightly to the right of the centreline of the runway. The beams widened as they spread from the antennas, so there was an area directly off the runway approach where the two signals overlapped. The switch was timed so it spent longer on the right side of the antenna than the left.

An aircraft approaching the airport would tune one of their radios to the Lorenz frequency. If the crew was on the left side of the centreline, they would hear a series of short tones followed by long pauses, meaning the aircraft was on the &quot;dot&quot; side of the antenna. Hearing the &quot;dots&quot;, they would know that they had to veer to the right to fly down the centreline. If the crew was on the right side of the centerline, they would hear a series of long tones followed by short pauses, meaning the aircraft was on the &quot;dash&quot; side of the antenna. Hearing the &quot;dashes&quot;, they would know that they had to veer to the left to fly down the centreline. In the centre, the radio would receive both signals, where the dots filled in the gaps in the dashes and produced a continual signal, the so-called &quot;equisignal&quot;. Flying in the known direction of the runway and keeping the equisignal on the radio, Lorenz-equipped crews could guide an aircraft down a straight line with a relatively high degree of accuracy, so much so that pilots could then find the runway visually except in the worst conditions.

==Night bombing==
During the early 1930s, the concept of a night bombing strategic campaign began to become paramount in military aviation circles. This was due to the ever-increasing performance of bombers, which were beginning to have the capability to strike across Europe with useful bomb loads. These aircraft were slow and lumbering, easy prey for interceptors, but this threat could be essentially eliminated by flying at night. A bomber, painted black, could be spotted only at very short ranges. As the bomber&#x27;s altitude and speed increased, the threat from ground-based defences was greatly reduced. Planners believed that &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;.

The problem with night bombing is that the same limitations in visibility meant the bomb crew would have a difficult time finding their targets, especially a blacked-out target at night. Only the largest targets, cities, could be attacked with any probability of success.

To support this mission, the RAF invested heavily in navigation training, equipping their aircraft with various devices, including an astrodome for taking a star fix and giving the navigator room to do his calculations in an illuminated workspace. This system was put to use as soon as the war began and was initially regarded as successful. In reality, the early bombing effort was a complete failure, with the majority of bombs landing miles from their intended targets.

The Luftwaffe continued to research accurate night bombing against smaller targets. Not depending on celestial navigation, they invested their efforts in radio navigation systems. The Luftwaffe concentrated on developing a bombing direction system based on the Lorenz concept through the 1930s, as it made night navigation relatively easy by simply listening for signals on a radio set, and the necessary radios were already being installed on many aircraft.

==German systems==

===&quot;Knickebein&quot;===
For bombing use, the modifications to Lorenz were fairly minor. Much larger antennas were needed to provide the required accuracy. This was achieved by using aerials with many more elements, but it retained the simple switching of two of the reflector elements to alter the beam directions very marginally. The beam angles were so dramatically reduced that it was only a few tens of yards wide over the target. It was the shape of the aerials that gave the system its code name, &quot;Knickebein&quot;, which means &quot;crooked leg&quot;. The word is also the name of a magical raven in Germanic mythology. For the required range, transmitted power was increased considerably. The &quot;Knickebein&quot; receivers were disguised as a standard blind landing receiver system, consisting apparently of the EBL-1 and the EBL-2 receivers.

The beam from a single transmitter would guide the bombers towards the target, but could not tell them when they were over it. To add this ranging feature, a second transmitter similar to the first was set up so its beam crossed the guidance beam at the point where the bombs should be dropped. The aerials could be rotated to make the beams from two transmitters cross over the target. The bombers would fly into the beam of one and ride it until they started hearing the tones from the other (on a second receiver). When the steady &quot;on course&quot; sound was heard from the second beam, they dropped their bombs.
The first of these new &quot;Knickebein&quot; transmitters was set up in 1939 on Stollberg hill in Nordfriesland near the border with Denmark; at Kleve (Cleves) near the Dutch border, almost the most westerly point in Germany, and at Lörrach near the border with France and Switzerland in south-western Germany. Following the fall of France in June 1940, additional transmitters were installed on the French coast. Stations were also constructed in Norway and the Netherlands.

Knickebein was used in the early stages of the German night-bombing offensive and proved to be fairly effective, but the tactics for using the system in a widespread bombing effort were not yet developed, so much of the early German night bombing offensive was limited to area bombing.

====The search for the beams====

Efforts in Britain to block the &quot;Knickebein&quot; system required time to implement. British intelligence at the Air Ministry, led by R. V. Jones, became aware of the system when the Royal Aircraft Establishment analysed a downed German bomber&#x27;s Lorenz system and observed it was far more sensitive than required for a mere landing aid. Secretly recorded transcripts from German prisoner of war pilots indicated this may have been a bomb aiming aid. Winston Churchill had also been given Ultra intelligence from decrypted Enigma messages that mentioned &#x27;bombing beams&#x27;.

When Jones mentioned the possibility of bombing beams to Churchill, he ordered further investigation. The British codenamed the system Headache. Many in the Air Ministry did not believe that the system was in use. Frederick Lindemann, leading scientific adviser to the government, argued that any such system would not be able to follow the curvature of the Earth, although T. S. Eckersley of the Marconi company had said it could.

Eckersley&#x27;s assertion was eventually demonstrated after Churchill ordered a flight to try to detect the beams. The RAF lacked equipment capable of detecting 30–33 MHz Lorenz signals, so they purchased an American Hallicrafters S-27 amateur radio receiver from a shop in Lisle Street, London. The receiver was fitted into an Avro Anson and operated by a member of the Y Service. The flight was nearly cancelled when Eckersley withdrew his assertion that the beams would bend around the Earth. Jones saved the flight by pointing out that Churchill himself had ordered it, and he would make sure that the Prime Minister would learn who cancelled it.

The crew were not told specifics, and were simply ordered to search for radio signals around 30 MHz having Lorenz characteristics and, if they found any, to determine their bearing. The flight took off and eventually flew into the beam from Kleve, on 31.5 MHz. It subsequently located the cross beam from Stollberg (its origin was unknown prior to this flight). The radio operator and navigator were able to plot the path of the beams and discovered that they intersected above the Rolls-Royce engine factory at Derby, at that time the only factory producing the Merlin engine. It was subsequently realised that the argument over whether the beams would bend around the Earth was entirely academic, as the transmitters were more or less in line-of-sight to high altitude bombers.

British sceptics started regarding the system as proof that the German pilots were not as good as their own, who they believed could do without such systems. The Butt Report proved this to be wrong: aerial reconnaissance returned photographs of the RAF bombing raids, showing that they were rarely, if ever, anywhere near their targets.

====Countermeasure====

Efforts to block the &quot;Knickebein&quot; headache were codenamed &quot;Aspirin&quot;. Initially, modified medical diathermy sets transmitted interference. Later, local radio transmitters broadcast an extra &quot;dot signal&quot; at low power on nights where raids were expected. The German practice of turning on the beams long before the bombers reached the target area aided the British efforts. Avro Ansons fitted with receivers would be flown around the country to find the beams&#x27; location to be reported to nearby broadcasters.

The low-power &quot;dot signal&quot; was initially transmitted essentially at random, so German navigators would hear two dots. This meant there were many equisignal areas, and no easy way to distinguish them except by comparing them with a known location. The British transmitters were later modified to send their dots at the same time as the German transmitters, making it impossible to tell which signal was which. In this case the navigators would receive the equisignal over a wide area, and navigation along the bomb line became impossible, with the aircraft drifting into the &quot;dash area&quot; and no way to correct for it.

Thus the beam was seemingly &quot;bent&quot; away from the target. Eventually, the beams could be inclined by a controlled amount which enabled the British to fool the Germans into dropping their bombs where they wanted them. A side effect was that as the German crews had been trained to navigate solely by the beams, many crews failed to find either the true equisignal or Germany again. Some Luftwaffe bombers even landed at RAF bases, believing they were back at base.

===&quot;X-Gerät&quot;===
As good as &quot;Knickebein&quot; was, it was never intended to be used in the long-range role. Plendl had been working for some time to produce a much more accurate version of the same basic concept, which was eventually delivered as &quot;X-Gerät&quot; (X-Apparatus). &quot;X-Gerät&quot; used a series of beams to locate the target, each beam named after a river. The main beam, &quot;Weser&quot;, was similar in concept to the one used in &quot;Knickebein&quot; but operated at a much higher frequency. Due to the nature of radio propagation, this allowed its two beams to be pointed much more accurately than &quot;Knickebein&quot; from a similarly sized antenna; the equi-signal area was only about wide at a distance of from the antenna. The beams were so narrow that bombers could not find them without help, so a low-power wide-beam version of &quot;Knickebein&quot; was set up at the same station to act as a guide. The main &quot;Weser&quot; antenna was set up just to the west of Cherbourg in France.

The &quot;cross&quot; signal in &quot;X-Gerät&quot; used a series of three very narrow single beams, &quot;Rhine&quot;, &quot;Oder&quot; and &quot;Elbe&quot;. They were carefully aimed to define a precise bomb release trajectory. First a bomb release point along &quot;Weser&quot; was determined, by calculating the &quot;range&quot; or distance the bombs would travel between release and impact, and picking a point at that range to target. The &quot;Elbe&quot; beam intersected &quot;Weser&quot; before the release point. The &quot;Oder&quot; beam intersected &quot;Weser&quot; before the release point, or before &quot;Elbe&quot;. &quot;Rhine&quot; did not require the same precision and was approximately before the release point. The beams&#x27; width added a small error to the intersection coordinates, on the order of tens to hundreds of meters.

As the bomber followed the &quot;Weser&quot; beam and reached &quot;Rhine&quot;, the radio operator heard a brief signal and set up his equipment. This consisted of a special stop-clock with two hands. When the &quot;Oder&quot; signal was received the clock automatically started and the two hands simultaneously swept up from zero. When the &quot;Elbe&quot; signal was received, one hand stopped and the other reversed, sweeping back towards zero. The stopped hand indicated an accurate measurement of travel time from &quot;Oder&quot; to &quot;Elbe&quot;. Since the &quot;Oder&quot; to &quot;Elbe&quot; distance equalled the &quot;Elbe&quot; to release point distance, a bomber flying at constant speed arrived at the release point as the moving hand reached zero, when the bombs were automatically released.

&quot;X-Gerät&quot; operated at a much higher frequency than &quot;Knickebein&quot; (around 60 MHz) and thus required the use of new radio equipment. There was not enough equipment to fit all bombers, so the experimental unit &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; 100 (&quot;KGr&quot; 100) was given the task of using their &quot;X-Gerät&quot; equipment to guide other aircraft to the target. To do this, &quot;KGr&quot; 100 aircraft would attack as a small group first, dropping flares which other aircraft would then see and bomb visually. This is the first use of the pathfinder concept that the RAF improved to great effect against the Germans some three years later.

The system was first tested on 20 December 1939 when a bomber from KGr 100 flown by Oberleutnant Hermann Schmidt flew over London at 7,000m (23,000 ft).

&quot;X-Gerät&quot; was used effectively in a series of raids known to the Germans as Moonlight Sonata, against Coventry, Wolverhampton and Birmingham. In the raid on Birmingham only &quot;KGr&quot; 100 was used and British post-raid analysis showed that the vast majority of the bombs dropped were placed within of the mid-line of the &quot;Weser&quot; beam, spread along it for a few hundred yards. This was the sort of accuracy that even daytime bombing could rarely achieve. The raid on Coventry with full support from other units dropping on their flares almost destroyed the city centre.

====Countermeasure====
&quot;X-Gerät&quot; proved more difficult to stop than &quot;Knickebein&quot;. Initial defences against the system were deployed in a similar fashion to &quot;Knickebein&quot; in an attempt to disrupt the Coventry raid but proved to be a failure. Although Jones had correctly guessed the beam layout (and acknowledges it was only a guess), the modulation frequency had been measured incorrectly as 1,500 Hz, but was in fact 2,000 Hz. At the time it was believed that this would not make any difference, as the tones were close enough that an operator would have a hard time distinguishing them in a noisy aircraft.

The mystery was eventually revealed after an &quot;X-Gerät&quot;-equipped Heinkel He 111 crashed on 6 November 1940 on the English coast at West Bay, Bridport. Although the aircraft sank during the recovery operation, the waterlogged &quot;X-Gerät&quot; equipment was recovered. On examination, it was learned that a new instrument was being used that automatically decoded the dots and dashes and moved a pointer on a display in the cockpit in front of the pilot. This device was fitted with a very sharp filter which was sensitive only at 2,000 Hz, and not to the early British 1,500 Hz counter-signals. While the jammers were modified accordingly, this came too late for the raid on Coventry on 14 November; but the modified jammers were able to successfully disrupt a raid on Birmingham on 19 November.

&quot;X-Gerät&quot; was eventually defeated in another manner, by way of a &quot;false &quot;Elbe&quot;&quot; which was set up to cross the &#x27;Weser&#x27; guide beam at a mere after the &quot;Oder&quot; beam — much earlier than the expected . Since the final stages of the release were automatic, the clock would reverse prematurely and drop the bombs kilometres short of the target. Setting up this false beam proved very difficult as the Germans, learning from their mistakes with &quot;Knickebein&quot;, did not switch the &quot;X-Gerät&quot; beams on until as late as possible, making it much more difficult to arrange the &quot;false &quot;Elbe&quot;&quot; in time.

===&quot;Y-Gerät&quot;===

As the British slowly gained the upper hand in the Battle of the Beams, they started considering what the next German system would entail. Since Germany&#x27;s current approaches had been rendered useless, an entirely new system would have to be developed. Jones believed that if they could defeat this system quickly, the Germans might give up on the entire concept.

British monitors soon started receiving intelligence from Enigma decrypts referring to a new device known as &quot;Y-Gerät&quot;, which was also sometimes referred to as &quot;Wotan&quot;. Jones had already concluded the Germans used code names that were too descriptive, so he asked a specialist in the German language and literature at Bletchley Park about the word &quot;Wotan&quot;. The specialist realised &quot;Wotan&quot; referred to Wōden, a one-eyed god, and might refer to a single-beam navigation system. Jones agreed, and knew that a system with one beam would have to include a distance-measurement system. He concluded that it might work on the basis described by the anti-Nazi German mathematician and physicist Hans Mayer, who while visiting Norway had provided a large amount of information in what is now known as the Oslo Report.

&quot;Y-Gerät&quot; used a single narrow beam pointed over the target, similar to earlier beam systems, transmitting a modulated radio signal. The system used a transponder (FuG 28a) that received the signal from the beam and immediately re-transmitted it to the ground station. The ground station listened for the return signal and compared the phase of its modulation to the transmitted signal, which accurately determined the transit time of the signal, and hence the distance to the aircraft. Coupled with the direction of the beam (adjusted for a maximum return signal), the bomber&#x27;s position could be established with considerable accuracy. The bombers did not have to track the beam, instead the ground controllers could calculate it and then give radio instructions to the pilot to correct the flight path.

Jones later learned that his guess on the operating principle based on the name Wotan was entirely by luck. Later documents showed that the original X-Gerät was known as Wotan I, and the Y-Gerät as Wotan II. Had he known the name was also associated with X-Gerät it was unlikely he would have concluded the system used a single beam.

====Countermeasure====

The British were ready for this system even before it was used. By chance, the Germans had chosen the operating frequency of the &quot;Wotan&quot; system badly. It operated at 45 MHz, which happened to be the frequency of the powerful-but-dormant BBC television transmitter at Alexandra Palace. All Jones had to do was arrange for the return signal to be received from the aircraft and then sent to Alexandra Palace for re-transmission. The combination of the two signals modified the phase shift, and thus the apparent transit delay. Initially, the signal was re-transmitted at low power, not powerful enough for the Germans to realise what was happening, but enough to spoil the accuracy of the system. Over subsequent nights, the transmitter power was gradually increased.

As &quot;Y-Gerät&quot;″s use went on, the aircrew accused the ground station of sending bad signals and the ground station alleged the aircraft had loose connections. The whole scheme appealed to Jones as he was a natural practical joker, and remarked that he was able to play one of the largest practical jokes with virtually any national resource that he required. The gradually increasing power conditioned the Germans such they did not realise that the system was being interfered with, but believed that it suffered several inherent defects. Eventually, as the power was increased enough, the whole &quot;Y-Gerät&quot; system started to ring with all the feedback.

The Luftwaffe, finally realising that the British had been deploying countermeasures from the very first day that the system was used operationally, completely lost faith in electronic navigation aids as the British had predicted, and did not deploy any further system against Great Britain, although by this time Hitler&#x27;s attention was turning towards Eastern Europe.

<text>The Somerset Levels are a coastal plain and wetland area of Somerset, England, running south from the Mendips to the Blackdown Hills.

The Somerset Levels have an area of about and are bisected by the Polden Hills; the areas to the south are drained by the River Parrett, and the areas to the north by the rivers Axe and Brue. The Mendip Hills separate the Somerset Levels from the North Somerset Levels. The Somerset Levels consist of marine clay &quot;levels&quot; along the coast and inland peat-based &quot;moors&quot;; agriculturally, about 70 per cent is used as grassland and the rest is arable. Willow and teazel are grown commercially and peat is extracted.

A Palaeolithic flint tool found in West Sedgemoor is the earliest indication of human presence in the area. The Neolithic people exploited the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways, including the world&#x27;s oldest known timber trackway, the Post Track, dating from about 3800 BC. The Levels were the location of the Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two Lake villages at Meare Lake. Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural &quot;islands&quot; of slightly raised land, including Brent Knoll and Glastonbury. In the Roman period sea salt was extracted and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills. The discovery at Shapwick of 9,238 silver Roman coins, known as the Shapwick Hoard, was the second-largest ever found from the time of the Roman Empire. A number of Saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates. In 1685, the Battle of Sedgemoor was fought in the Bussex area of Westonzoyland at the conclusion of the Monmouth Rebellion.

As a result of the wetland nature of the Levels, the area contains a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant and bird species and is an important feeding ground for birds and includes 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest, of which 12 are also Special Protection Areas. The area has been extensively studied for its biodiversity and heritage, and has a growing tourism industry.

People have been draining the area since before Domesday Book. In the Middle Ages, the monasteries of Glastonbury, Athelney and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage. The artificial Huntspill River was constructed during the Second World War as a reservoir, although it also serves as a drainage channel. The Sowy River between the River Parrett and King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain was completed in 1972; water levels are managed by the Levels internal drainage boards. During 2009 and 2010 proposals to build a series of electricity pylons by one of two routes between Hinkley Point and Avonmouth, to transmit electricity from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, attracted local opposition. Discussions have taken place concerning the possibility of obtaining World Heritage Site status for the Somerset Levels as a &quot;cultural landscape&quot;. It was suggested that if this bid were successful it could improve flood control, but only if wetland fens were created again; the plans were abandoned in 2010.

==Natural character area==
The Somerset Levels form a natural region that has been designated as a national character area – No. 142 – by Natural England, the public body responsible for England&#x27;s natural environment. Neighbouring natural regions are: the Vale of Taunton and Quantock Fringes to the west, the Blackdowns to the southwest, the Mid Somerset Hills and Yeovil Scarplands to the southeast, the Mendip Hills to the east and the Bristol, Avon Valleys and Ridges to the northeast.

==Geography==

The Levels are mainly flat areas of inland plains and a coastal sand and clay barrier, east and west of the M5 motorway. There are some slightly raised parts, called &quot;burtles&quot;, as well as higher ridges and hills. The Levels are about above mean sea level (O.D.). The general elevation inland is O.D. with peak tides of O.D. recorded at Bridgwater and Burnham-on-Sea. Large areas of peat were laid down in the Brue Valley during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted. The area&#x27;s topography consists of two basins mainly surrounded by hills, the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and clyses (the local name for a sluice). The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations. The worst in recorded history was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 or more people, houses and villages swept away, an estimated of farmland inundated, and livestock killed. Another severe flood occurred in 1872–1873, when over were under water from October to March.

Although underlain by much older Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would once have been islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor—the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000 years, following the end of the last ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000 years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.

It is a mainly agricultural region, typically with open fields of permanent grass surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to individual areas, especially for cattle, was provided by means of &quot;droves&quot;, i.e. green lanes, leading off the public highways. Some of the old roads, in contrast to the old hollow ways found in other areas of England, are causeways raised above the level of the surrounding land, with a drainage ditch running along each side.

===Settlements===
Most of the settlements on the Levels are small villages. In the south, Aller, which has a population of 374, includes the hamlet of Beer (sometimes &quot;Bere&quot;) and the deserted medieval village of Oath on the opposite bank of the River Parrett. The area known as the Isle of Athelney was once a very low isolated island linked by a causeway to East Lyng, each end of which was protected by a semi-circular stockade and ditch. The ditch on the island is now known to date from the Iron Age, and was used by Alfred the Great as a fort before the Battle of Ethandun in May 878; in gratitude for his victory Alfred founded a monastery, Athelney Abbey, on the Isle in 888, which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1539. Bawdrip is a small village which has a population of 498. Brent Knoll is a large village at the foot of Brent Knoll Camp that dominates the surrounding landscape; the name means &quot;Beacon Hill&quot; in Old English. Brent Knoll has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age. Before the Somerset Levels were drained, Brent Knoll was an island known as the Isle (or Mount) of Frogs.

Glastonbury (population 8,784) and Street (11,066) lie on opposite sides of the River Brue, and provide a central point for trade and commerce. Larger centres are generally on slightly higher ground around the edges of the Levels. Bridgwater is a market town, the administrative centre of the Sedgemoor district, and a major industrial centre. With a population of 33,698, it straddles the major communication routes through South West England. Situated on the edge of the Somerset Levels, along both banks of the River Parrett and from its mouth, it was at one time a major port and trading centre. The hamlet of Dunball forms part of the port on the river. Burrowbridge lies on the River Parrett further inland. The name probably comes from the Old English (fortified hill) and (bridge). In the village is Burrow Mump, an ancient earthwork now owned by the National Trust. Burrow Mump is also known as St Michael&#x27;s Borough or Tutteyate. It is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl. Excavations showed evidence of a medieval masonry building on the top of the hill.

Along the coast, settlements such as Berrow are built on the line of sand dunes separating the low-lying marshes from the Bristol Channel. At the northern end Bleadon lies on the River Axe; and there was for many years a small harbour, sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf. The arrival of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1841, which crossed the Axe on a bridge, obstructed river traffic beyond the wharf, making it the limit of navigation for coastal vessels. An Act of 1915 authorised the drainage of the river and installation of a flood gate at Bleadon, although attempts to control the water had occurred on Bleadon Level since medieval times, including an early windmill, in 1613, to pump water into the sea from behind a sea wall. Burnham-on-Sea (population 18,401) is at the mouth of the River Parrett where it enters Bridgwater Bay. The position of the town on the edge of the Somerset Levels has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times. Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, and various flood defences have been installed since then. A concrete sea wall was built in 1911, and after the Second World War further additions to the defences were made, using the remains of a Mulberry harbour; the present curved concrete wall was completed in 1988. Highbridge, which neighbours Burnham, is near the mouth of the River Brue and the villages of East and West Huntspill.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England the Somerset Levels have a temperate climate, which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter, mean minimum temperatures of are common. The Azores high pressure area influences the southwest of England&#x27;s summer weather, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998, there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most rainfall in the southwest is caused by convection or Atlantic depressions, which are most active in autumn and winter, when they are the chief cause of rain. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the Sun heating the land, leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around , and about 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest. It was devastated by the UK storms of January–February 2014.
==Water management==
The Moors and Levels, formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape, consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level, with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it.

Early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the Romans (although records only date from the 13th century), but were not widespread.

There was a port at Bleadney on the River Axe in the 8th century which allowed goods to be brought to within of Wells. In 1200, a wharf was constructed at Rackley near Axbridge. The Parrett was navigable up as far as Langport in 1600, with 15 to 20 ton barges. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; recorded that drainage of the higher grounds was under way, although the moors at Wedmoor were said to be useless.

In the Middle Ages, the monasteries of Glastonbury, Athelney, and Muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage. In 1129, the Abbot of Glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at Lympsham. Efforts to control flooding on the Parrett were recorded around the same date. In 1234, were reclaimed near Westonzoyland and, from the accounts in the abbey&#x27;s rent books, this had increased to by 1240.

===Drains===

Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. They included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall, and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence.

The main drainage outlets flowing through the Moors and Levels are the rivers Axe, Brue, Huntspill, Parrett, Tone, and Yeo, together with the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain, an artificial channel into which the River Cary now runs. Previously, the Cary ran into the Tone while the Brue ran through Meare Pool (now drained) and the Panborough Gap, and then into the Axe. Another accomplishment in the Middle Ages was the construction of the tidal Pillrow Cut, joining the Brue and Axe.

In 1500, there was said to be of floodable land of which only had been reclaimed. In 1597, of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later, near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; and three further reclamations, totalling , had been undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660.

In the early 17th century, during the time of King James I, abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor, which the local Lords supported but opposed by the Commoners who would have lost grazing rights. In 1632, Charles I sold the Crown&#x27;s interest in the scheme, and it was taken over by a consortium that included Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch drainage engineer. However, the work was delayed by the English Civil War and later defeated in parliament after local opposition. In 1638, it was reported that nearly of Tealham and Tadham Moors were not reclaimed, with a total of being undrained. Between 1785 and 1791, much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed. In 1795, John Billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes (a local name for drainage channels, pronounced &quot;reens&quot; in the east and rhyne to the west) between plots, and wrote in his &quot;Agriculture of the County of Somerset&quot; that had been enclosed in the last 20 years in Wedmore and Meare, at Nyland, at Blackford, at Mark, in Shapwick, and at Westhay.

At Westhay Moor in the early 19th century, it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding, creating a very rich soil. The character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain.

===Pumps===

Little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, possibly because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as they were on the Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon at the mouth of the River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private act of Parliament in 1721, the Glastonbury Inclosure Act 1721 (8 Geo. 1. c. &quot;16&quot; ). The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic electric pumps are used today.

The human-made Huntspill River was constructed during World War II with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of &quot;process water&quot;. It was intended that in the summer, when water supply was lower, it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors; and in winter serve as a drainage channel, via gravity drainage. Geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible: thus, water is pumped up into the river throughout the year.

The Sowy River between the River Parrett and King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain was completed in 1972. The Levels and Moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into &quot;drains&quot;. Water levels are managed by the Levels internal drainage boards (IDBs); the Levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the East Anglian fens, historically a similar area of low marsh. They are still liable to widespread fresh water flooding in winter. One of the approaches to reducing the risk of flooding within the catchment area of the Parrett is the planting of new woodlands.

Controversy about the management of the drainage and flood protection has previously involved the activities of IDBs. However, IDBs have been actively participating with the Parrett Catchment Partnership, a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed, in particular, looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders.

During 2009 and 2010, work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates, watercourses, and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor during the winter diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor. It has the capacity to hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset. In spring, the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer. The scheme is also used to encourage water birds.

===Sea defences===

The Levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides, a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th century. In addition, the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the Parrett, which is the only river in the Levels and Moors that does not have a clyse on it. Discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the Parrett and whether it should be sited at Bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939, at the start of World War II, and have not been resolved.

On 13 December 1981, a large Atlantic storm hit the North Somerset coast. Meteorological conditions caused a large storm surge which coincided with high astronomical tides in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. Wind speeds were measured at . Overtopping of the sea defences along a stretch of the Somerset coast at 22 locations from Clevedon to Porlock began after 19:30. Although there was no loss of life, the resultant flooding covered of land, affecting 1,072 houses and commercial properties, with £150,000 worth of livestock killed and £50,000 of feed and grain destroyed. Wessex Water Authority estimated the total cost of the damage caused at £6M. This resulted in a three-year programme of sea defence assessment, repair and improvement. With 400 properties affected in Burnham-on-Sea, after emergency repairs, Wessex Water Authority began planning new sea defences. Construction work started in 1983 on a £7M scheme, creating what was then Britain&#x27;s biggest wave return wall.

The Environment Agency&#x27;s current &quot;Parrett Catchment Flood Management Plan&quot;, published in December 2009, divides the Parrett catchment area into eight sub-areas, with the Somerset Levels and Moors falling into sub-area 6 and Bridgwater falling into sub-area 7. As part of the published flood risk assessments for both these sub-areas, it is recognised that: at a future date a tidal clyse may be needed on the Parrett; this causes a funding dilemma; and, geomorphology studies of the Parrett and the Tone are needed to help address many of the uncertainties associated with a tidal exclusion project.

===Flooding===

The Levels are at risk from both tidal and land-based flood waters.

During the great storm of 1703, waves came four feet (1.2 m) over the sea walls. The sea wall was again breached in 1799, filling the Axe valley with sea water. In 1872, another flood covered and in 1919, were inundated with sea water, poisoning the land for up to 7 years.

Since 1990, the drainage boards have been charged with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear, under the overall responsibility of the Environment Agency. With rising sea levels, the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive, and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created. Other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options.

Although the Environment Agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding, still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages — including Muchelney and Westonzoyland — being cut off. In November 2012, during the 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods, after six days Somerset County Council-funded BARB rescue boats reached Muchelney on 29 November, rescuing nearly 100 people.

Rescue boats were again required during the rain and storms from Cyclone Dirk in the turn of the year 2014, and subsequently during the Winter flooding of 2013–14 on the Somerset Levels. On 24 January 2014, in light of the continued flooded extent of the Somerset Moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the Winter storms of 2013–14 in the United Kingdom, both Somerset County Council and Sedgemoor District Council declared a major incident. At this time, with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month, the village of Thorney had been abandoned and Muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month. Environment Minister Owen Paterson visited the area on 27 January 2014, and after meeting local MPs, the Environment Agency and various community representatives the night before in Taunton, promised at a media-only press conference at North Moor pumping station that if a local water management plan could be developed over the next six weeks, he would approve it. Such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers Tone and Parrett, and possibly a later sluice near Bridgwater. There have been public protests about the river Parrett not being dredged in recent years. In mid-February 2014 the Environment Agency began installing giant pumps imported from the Netherlands to alleviate the continuing flooding.
==Human habitation==
A Palaeolithic flint tool found in Westbury is the earliest indication of human presence in the area, dating from approximately 500,000 years ago. Later during the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys, forcing the Mesolithic people to occupy seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. Subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man&#x27;s using the Levels only in the summer, hence the county of Somerset may derive its name from &quot;Sumorsaete&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the summer people&quot;. An alternative suggestion is that the name derives from &quot;Seo-mere-saetan&quot; meaning &quot;settlers by the sea lakes&quot;. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the Sweet and Post Tracks. The Sweet Track, named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s BC, is the world&#x27;s oldest timber trackway, once thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest engineered roadway. The track was built between what was in the early 4th millennium BC an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, close to the River Brue. The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the peat bog including the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay and Nidons trackways.

The Levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the UK, Glastonbury Lake Village, as well as two others at Meare Lake Village. Discovered in 1892 by Arthur Bulleid, it was inhabited by about 200 people living in 14 roundhouses, and was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of raised peat bogs, particularly during the Subatlantic climatic period (1st millennium BC), and core sampling demonstrates that it is filled with at least of detritus mud.

The two villages within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone.

The area continued to be inhabited during the Bronze Age, when the population supported itself largely by hunting and fishing in the surrounding marshes, living on artificial islands connected by wooden causeways on wooden piles. There have been many finds of metalwork during peat cutting, which may have been devotional offerings. Brent Knoll has been settled by people since at least the Bronze Age. It is the site of an Iron Age hillfort known as Brent Knoll Camp, with multiple ramparts (&quot;multivallate&quot;) following the contours of the hill. Several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural &quot;islands&quot; of slightly raised land, including Brent Knoll, Glastonbury, and the low range of the Polden Hills. According to legend Ider son of Nuth, who was one of King Arthur&#x27;s knights, went to the Mount of Frogs on a quest to slay three giants who lived there. The fort has been claimed as the site of the Battle of Mons Badonicus.
Sea salt was extracted during the Roman period, and a string of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills. Some possible settlement sites are also known in the Draycott and Cheddar Moors and around Highbridge. The discovery at Shapwick of 9,238 silver Roman coins, the second largest hoard ever found from the Roman Empire included coins dated from as early as 31–30 BC up until 224 AD. The hoard also contained two rare coins which had not been discovered in Britain before, and the largest number of silver denarii ever found in Britain.

A number of Anglo-Saxon charters document the incorporation of areas of moor in estates, suggesting that the area continued to be exploited. It is easy to see why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the Battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.

In 1685, the Monmouth Rebellion ended at the Battle of Sedgemoor, which was fought in the Bussex area of Westonzoyland.

==Land use==
The Levels have few wooded areas, just occasional willow trees. The landscape is dominated by grassland, mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70 per cent of the area being grassland and 30 per cent arable. From January until May, the River Parrett provides a source of European eels (&quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play &quot;Glass Eels&quot; by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.

The Levels, as part of the West Country, traditionally produced cider, with individual farms having orchards and their own cider, known as scrumpy. However, over 60% of Somerset&#x27;s orchards have been lost in the last fifty years; and apple production occupies less than 0.4% of the land. Cider is still produced in Somerset by Thatchers Cider, Gaymer Cider Company and numerous small independent producers. Other local industries that once thrived on the Levels, such as thatching (using reeds) and basket making (using willow), have been in decline since the second half of the 20th century. Combined with the recent drop in farm incomes, this poses a potential threat to the &quot;traditional&quot; nature of the area as a whole. Subsidies are paid to farmers who manage their land in the traditional way.

===Electricity generation===
In 2009, National Grid began public consultations over plans to build a line of electricity pylons, by one of two routes between Hinkley Point and Avonmouth. The plans attracted local opposition. The first consultation process ended in January 2010. They had proposed that each pylon would be high: the consultation was only in respect of preferences between two alternate routes, not the size nor the use of large pylons. The proposed line, which is due to open by September 2017, will transmit electricity at 400 kilovolts from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Hinkley Point C is a project to construct a 3,200 MWe nuclear power station with two EPR reactors. The site is one of eight announced by the British government in 2010, and in November 2012 a nuclear site licence was granted. On 28 July 2016 the EDF board approved the project, and on 15 September 2016 the UK government approved the project with some safeguards for the investment. In March 2017, EDF, after the Office for Nuclear Regulation gave approval to start building a network of tunnels to carry cabling and piping, started work also under way on a jetty, seawall and accommodation blocks. The concrete pour for the first reactor is planned only at earliest in 2019.

In 2010 and 2011, two proposals to build a total of 14 wind turbines, with Ecotricity to build five or four adjacent to the M5 Motorway near Brent Knoll and Électricité de France to build nine at East Huntspill, are opposed by local groups on the grounds of their effect on the local environment and potential damage to the bird population.

===Willow===
Willow has been cut and used on the Levels since mankind moved into the area. Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways. The willow was harvested using traditional methods of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. New shoots of willow, called &quot;withies&quot;, would grow out of the trunk and these would be cut periodically for use.

During the 1930s, over of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely because of the replacement of baskets by plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By the end of the 20th century only about were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland, and North Curry. The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially. For weaving, the species &quot;Salix triandra&quot; (almond willow, &quot;black maul&quot;) is grown, while &quot;Salix viminalis&quot; (common osier) is ideal for handles, bases, and the structural members in furniture and hurdles. Historically willow was used to make salmon traps or &quot;putchers&quot;. Products including baskets, eel traps (kypes), lobster pots, and furniture were widely made from willow throughout the area in the recent past. Among the more unusual products still made are passenger baskets for hot air balloons, the frames inside the Bearskins worn by the regiments of the Grenadier Guards, and an increasing number of willow coffins.

Another use of willow has been found by the Coate family, who make artists&#x27; charcoals in Stoke St Gregory. It has become in 30 years the leading artists&#x27; charcoal manufacturer in Europe, producing most of the natural charcoals sold under different art-material brands.

The industry is celebrated in the form of the &quot;Willow Man&quot; (sometimes known as the &quot;Angel of the South&quot;), a willow sculpture, 40 feet (12.2 m) tall, produced by artist Serena de la Hey in September 2000 that can be seen from the railway and the M5 motorway to the north of Bridgwater. At Stoke St Gregory there is also a Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre.

===Teazel growing===
An unusual crop was the growing of teazels around the River Isle near Chard on the heavy clay soils around Fivehead, although this industry died out by the 1980s-90s. These are still sometimes used to provide a fine finish on worsteds and snooker table cloths, but were previously much more widely used in the processing of wool for the textiles industry.

===Peat extraction===

The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The resulting reduction in water levels put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3 feet (0.3–0.8 m) over 100 years. Peat extraction continues today, although much reduced.

==Biodiversity and conservation==
As a result of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick&#x27;s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, Eurasian skylark, common snipe, Eurasian teal, wigeon, and Eurasian whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, &quot;Bagous nodulosus&quot;, &quot;Hydrophilus piceus&quot;, &quot;Odontomyia angulata&quot;, &quot;Oulema erichsoni&quot;, and &quot;Valvata macrostoma&quot;. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (&quot;Arvicola amphibius&quot;) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10 years, by the capture of mink (&quot;Mustela vison&quot;).

In 2010, a project was started to reintroduce the common crane to the Levels, after an absence of 400 years. The birds&#x27; eggs were flown from Germany to the Slimbridge wetland reserve managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (a UK charity) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, and reared to the age of five months before being released onto the Levels. The &quot;Great Crane Project&quot; aims to introduce around 20 of the birds each year until 2015. The work, which included collaboration with Pensthorpe Nature Reserve and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, was supported by a grant of £700k from Viridor Credits.

The Levels contain 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (12 of them also Special Protection Areas), the River Huntspill and Bridgwater Bay national nature reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, Ham Wall National Nature Reserve and numerous Scheduled monuments. The Brue Valley Living Landscape conservation project commenced in 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitat. It aims to ensure that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK. About of the Levels are recognised as an Environmentally Sensitive Area, and other areas are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential, but there is currently no single conservation designation covering the Levels and Moors.

A survey in 2005 discovered that 11 of the known wooden Bronze Age causeways on the Levels had been destroyed or vanished and others were seriously damaged, caused by the reduction in water levels and subsequent exposure of the timber to oxygen and aerobic bacteria. Part of the Sweet Track is being actively conserved. Following purchase of land by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and installation of a water pumping and distribution system along a section, several hundred metres of the track&#x27;s length are now being actively conserved. This method of preserving wetland archaeological remains (i.e. maintaining a high water table and saturating the site) is rare. A section, which lies within the land owned by the Nature Conservancy Council, has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields, and water levels are regularly monitored. The viability of this method is demonstrated by comparing it with the nearby Abbot&#x27;s Way, which has not had similar treatment, and which in 1996 was found to have become dewatered and desiccated. Evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the Shapwick Heath Nature Reserve involves the Nature Conservancy Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Somerset Levels Project.

==Somerset Levels Project==
In 1964, archaeologist John Coles from the University of Cambridge began a research project that resulted in the publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic and geographic significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project&#x27;s most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.

The work of John Coles and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1998 when they won the ICI Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge, and in 2006 with the award of the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.

==Shapwick Project==
This project, based on the village of Shapwick, was begun by Mick Aston of Bristol University to investigate the evolution of a typical English village. A preliminary study of the village&#x27;s history was carried out using maps and documents, then surveys of the buildings were made together with botanical surveys. Field walking was carried out and key sites excavated. A report on the project, which ran from 1989 to 1999, was published in eight volumes.

==Tourism==

Being largely flat, the Levels are well suited to bicycles, and a number of cycle routes exist including the Withy Way Cycle Route (), Avalon Marshes Cycle Route (), Peat Moors Cycle Route () and the Isle Valley Cycle Route (). The River Parrett Trail () and Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpaths are also within the area.

Visitors&#x27; centres aim to convey various aspects of the Levels. The Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre near Stoke St Gregory offers tours of the willow yards and basket workshops and explains the place of willow in the history of the Levels. The Somerset Willow Company also allows visitors into its workshops.

The Avalon Marshes Centre (formerly known as the Peat Moors Centre) between Westhay and Shapwick, is dedicated to the natural history, biodiversity, archaeology, history, and geology of the area. It also includes reconstructions of some archaeological discoveries of the area, such as a Roman Villa and a Saxon Longhall. The site offers much information on Iron Age finds, round houses, and ancient highways, the Post Track and Sweet Track. From time to time the centre offers events and courses in a number of ancient technologies in subjects including textiles, clothing and basket-making, as well as staging various open days, displays, demonstrations and guided nature excursions. The centre also contains the offices and workshops for the RSPB, Somerset Wildlife Trust, Natural England and The Hawk and Owl Trust for which all have reserves close by. In February 2009 Somerset County Council, the owner of the Peat Moors Centre, announced its intention of closing the centre and it finally shut on 31 October 2009, but it was reopened as the Avalon Marshes Centre and is in the process of being modernized and improved from the previous set of buildings.

The Tribunal in Glastonbury, a medieval merchant&#x27;s house, contains possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village, which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned. It also houses the tourist information centre. Also in Glastonbury, the Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used as a tithe barn for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey&#x27;s home farm of approximately . Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn. The barn was built from local shelly limestone, with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a Scheduled monument. The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian and early 20th century periods. Other exhibits show local crafts, including willow coppicing, mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay, peat digging on the Somerset Levels and the production of milk, cheese, and cider. In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh, the story of one farm worker, John Hodges, is told from cradle to grave. Outside, there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep in the cider apple orchard.

The Langport &amp; River Parrett Visitor Centre at Langport details local life, history, and wildlife. The Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum, near the town on the River Parrett, is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the Levels, dating from the 1830s; it was closed in the 1950s. Featuring several steam engines, some built locally, the museum holds a number of live steam days each year. The pump house has been Grade II* listed, and is on English Heritage&#x27;s Heritage at Risk Register.
