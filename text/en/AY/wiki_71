<text>Monday Night Football (often abbreviated as MNF) is the branding used for broadcasts of National Football League (NFL) games that air on Monday nights. It originally ran on ABC from 1970 to 2005, before moving exclusively to sister network ESPN from 2006 to 2019. While still airing on ESPN, &quot;MNF&quot; returned to ABC in 2020 beginning with select ESPN simulcasts, later expanding to select ABC exclusive telecasts in 2022, and since 2023 ABC has aired the bulk of the games in simulcast with ESPN. In addition, ESPN2 features the &quot;Manningcast&quot; alternate telecast of select games, which was established in 2020, and since 2021, ESPN+ has served as the U.S. streaming home of &quot;MNF&quot;.

During its initial run on ABC, &quot;MNF&quot; became one of the longest-running U.S. television series, as well as one of the highest-rated, particularly among male viewers. Since 1993, it has been preceded by the ESPN pregame show &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;. Per an NFL broadcasting policy intended to allow those who do not subscribe to cable or satellite television to see local games televised by a pay television network, the ESPN-exclusive games are also made available on an over-the-air station in each participating team&#x27;s local market.

&quot;MNF&quot; is broadcast in Canada on TSN and RDS, in most of Australia on ESPN Australia, in Portugal on Eleven Sports, on TV 2 Sport in Denmark, on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and in some other regions of the world outside the U.S. on ESPN International. A Spanish-language version airs on ESPN Deportes in the U.S. and on ESPN International in Latin America, while a Portuguese version airs on ESPN Brasil.
==Overview==
===History===

During the early 1960s, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during prime time that could be viewed by a greater television audience. An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games, and in any event had been prohibited by Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 for that very reason alongside Saturday games to protect college football. Two years later, Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four-year experiment of playing on Monday night, scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the 1966 and 1967 seasons, and two contests during each of the next two years. NBC followed suit in 1968 and 1969 with games involving American Football League teams.

During negotiations on a new television contract that would begin in 1970 (coinciding with the completion of a merger between the NFL and AFL), Rozelle concentrated on signing a weekly Monday night deal with one of the three major networks. However, both NBC and CBS were reluctant to disturb their regular programming schedules. On the other hand, ABC was a distant third in prime time ratings and more willing to take any perceived risk, moreover, ABC&#x27;s existing Monday night prime time lineup was a particular weak spot. As a result, Rozelle made a deal with ABC.

Despite high ratings, ABC lost millions of dollars on televising the games during the late 1990s and 2000s. The NFL also indicated that it wanted Sunday night to be the new night for its marquee game, because more people tend to watch television on Sundays, and games held on that night would be more conducive to flexible scheduling, a method by which some of the NFL&#x27;s best games could be moved from the afternoon to the evening on Sunday on short notice. Given these factors, as well as the rise of ABC&#x27;s ratings on Sunday night, and the network&#x27;s wish of protecting its TV series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; on that night, on April 18, 2005, ABC and the NFL announced the end of their 36-year partnership, with the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts being moved to ESPN starting with the 2006 season.

In 2011, ESPN extended its &quot;MNF&quot; contract for an additional eight seasons, giving it rights to the broadcasts until 2021. The deal, valued around 15 billion, also gave ESPN rights to expanded highlights, international, and streaming rights. A new deal signed in 2021 sees ESPN retain these rights through 2033. Included with the new contract are the rights to two Super Bowls in 2027 and 2031, the introduction of flexible scheduling, three doubleheaders during the season with exclusive games on ABC, one divisional playoff game, and one exclusive game on ESPN+.

===Simulcasts on ABC===
Beginning with the 2020 season, select &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games have been simulcast on ABC. In the 2020 season, three games were simulcast. In the 2021 season, three &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games and the new Week 18 Saturday doubleheader were simulcast. After ESPN renewed its &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; contract, it was revealed that these simulcasts would expand starting with the 2022 season. To accommodate the expanded simulcasts, ABC announced that &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; would move to Disney+ for its 31st season only. ABC later announced that &quot;DWTS&quot; returned to ABC and simulcast on Disney+ after one year and moved to Tuesdays permanently.

On September 18, 2023, amid the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, ABC announced that it would simulcast &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; during each week of the 2023 NFL season. The decision was made while the season was already underway, and therefore upset the league&#x27;s other broadcasters. The move gave ABC an immediate financial benefit since ABC could now charge higher commercial fees during those additional weeks since NFL games generally have higher ratings than most other programming. The simulcast came at a cost for Disney&#x27;s cable partners, who would lose revenue from local insertion advertising as viewers gravitated towards their local ABC station to watch the game instead, rather than the ESPN networks.

ABC&#x27;s planned simulcast schedule for the 2024 NFL season had reverted back to four games, before Disney confirmed the simulcasts would continue until the end of the season on October 11, 2024, bringing the ESPN/ABC simulcast total from the originally planned four to ten.

===Scheduling problems===


To avoid unfairness due to a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game where, just before the first playoff game, a team may have five days off and others six, and also to allow the league to have games with mutual playoff implications played at the same time, most games during the final week of the regular season are played on Sunday. Consequently, there is no Monday night game that week. From 2003 to 2005, one game was played on Thursday and another on Monday under the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; banner. Starting in 2006, when the series moved to cable, two games are played on the opening Monday night to capitalize on fan interest during &quot;NFL Kickoff Weekend&quot;.

Before 2023, the &quot;MNF&quot; schedule was set during each Spring before the regular season, which could not be changed. Thus, the league and network cannot guarantee that each late-season &quot;MNF&quot; matchup would have any significance or would be highly anticipated. The problem of having a national spotlight game which during the season&#x27;s most critical weeks late in the year probably would not show the most important game of the week was long known by the league and network. As a result of this, the NFL wished to move the &quot;Game of the Week&quot; idea to Sunday nights to make flex scheduling possible, and they had long stated that it was only interested in having flex scheduling on Sundays, and not Mondays since it is easier logistically on relatively short notice to move kickoff times by hours instead of days. This became one of the major factors leading to the 2006 end of &quot;MNF&quot; on ABC, and NBC instead agreeing to air the &quot;Game of the Week&quot; with flex scheduling on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. The NFL finally agreed to expand flex scheduling to &quot;MNF&quot; beginning in the 2023 season. That same season, in Week 15, the originally scheduled game between the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots became the first game to be flexed out of the MNF spot; it was replaced with a matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Seattle Seahawks. 2023 was also the first NFL season New Year&#x27;s Day fell on a Monday in the penultimate week of the regular season, consequently to avoid a conflict with the College Football Playoff there were no Monday games scheduled for the final two weeks of the regular season.

===Franchises with the most appearances===
The franchise with the most Monday night appearances is the Dallas Cowboys, with 85. The Pittsburgh Steelers secured the all-time lead with most wins on November 28, 2022, at 52.

The most common &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; pairings are Broncos vs. Raiders (19 times as of ) and Commanders vs. Cowboys (17 match-ups as of , most among NFC matchups).

The defunct Candlestick Park in San Francisco holds the record for hosting the most &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games, including its 36th and final Monday night game on December 23, 2013. Among the active stadiums following the conclusion of the 2017 season, Miami Gardens, Florida&#x27;s Hard Rock Stadium had hosted the most games with 36.

Eight new NFL stadiums have made their regular season debuts on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Most recently, Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, hosted its first NFL game on September 21, 2020, when the Las Vegas Raiders defeated the New Orleans Saints 34–24 on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

==As entertainment==
&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; has continued to provide entertainment as sports throughout its run. In addition to the extra cameras, the program has also pioneered technological broadcast innovations, such as the use of enhanced slow motion replays and computerized graphics.

Celebrity guests – such as former Vice President Spiro Agnew, singers Plácido Domingo and former Beatle John Lennon, former President Bill Clinton, and even Kermit the Frog – were often featured during the game to &quot;liven up&quot; the broadcast. The December 9, contest featured a rare instance of two celebrities entering the booth, with Lennon being interviewed by Howard Cosell and California governor Ronald Reagan speaking with Frank Gifford, with Reagan explaining the rules of American football (off-camera) to Lennon as the game went along. However, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw an even more increased reliance on the entertainment factor. Some halftime shows, featuring popular music stars, were broadcast in their entirety rather than being ignored in favor of analysis of the game by the commentators, as in previous seasons.

On December 8, 1980, one of the most memorable moments of &quot;MNF&quot; occurred when Cosell announced in a news flash that John Lennon had been shot and killed in New York City. &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; was the first national broadcast to announce his death.

An ABC advertisement for &quot;MNF&quot; featuring Nicollette Sheridan of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; dropping her towel in front of Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens created some controversy, including at least 1,997 complaints being sent to the FCC and outrage from FCC chairman Michael Powell.

The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC and the majority owner of ESPN, has used &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; to promote its other properties, releasing a trailer for the 2015 film &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; during one broadcast and incorporating The Muppets into another trailer.

===2000s===
====2006 summary====
For its 2006 debut on ESPN, Williams Jr. re-recorded the &quot;MNF&quot; opening theme with an all-star jam band that included among others Brian Setzer, Little Richard, Questlove, Joe Perry, Clarence Clemons, Rick Nielsen, Bootsy Collins, Charlie Daniels, and Steven Van Zandt. The 2006 telecast generally began with a cinematic tease produced by Rico Labbe, Michael Sciallis, and Jason Jobes. It was during one of these teases that Barack Obama spoofed his announcement for the 2008 Presidential candidacy in favor of his hometown Chicago Bears in their game against the St. Louis Rams.

That year, the tease was followed by the show open produced by Los Angeles-based The Syndicate called &quot;Transformation&quot;. It features computer-generated imagery showing a city being transformed into a football stadium and passers-by on the street turning into players, coaches, fans, and officials set to an updated orchestral treatment of the &quot;Heavy Action&quot; theme song. The sequence began every week with a different celebrity walking down the street, picking up a glowing football helmet with the ESPN logo on the side and saying, &quot;I&#x27;m ready for some football! Are you?&quot;, thus beginning the transformation process. Celebrities for 2006 included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Matthew Fox, Hugh Hefner, Paris Hilton, Spike Lee, Ashton Kutcher, Samuel L. Jackson, Ludacris, Jack Black, Kiefer Sutherland, James Belushi, Ben Stiller, Tyra Banks, Carmen Electra, and Eva Longoria.

In addition, celebrities returned in full force to the booth, though this proved to be the major criticism of ESPN&#x27;s first &quot;MNF&quot; season. On the opening weekend, Arnold Schwarzenegger, another celebrity-turned-California governor, was in the booth at McAfee Coliseum in Oakland, California; before that, Jamie Foxx appeared at FedExField in suburban Washington, D.C. Following them, celebrity appearances included NBA basketball superstar Dwyane Wade, Basketball Hall of Fame player Charles Barkley, NASCAR Cup Series driver Jeff Gordon, comedian Jimmy Kimmel (whose opening words to Joe Theismann were &quot;how&#x27;s the leg?&quot;), actor Sylvester Stallone, film director Spike Lee, hip hop artist Jay-Z, and &quot;MNF&quot; theme singer Hank Williams Jr.

====2007 summary====

ESPN scaled back to only one opening tease for the 2007 season. Williams Jr. and the all-star band returned, only this time they played in a &quot;juke joint&quot; set on a country road. The lead singer arrives in a GMC Yukon truck (GMC paid for product placement) with the license plate &quot;BOCEPHUS&quot;, which is Williams&#x27; nickname. The Syndicate&#x27;s computer-generated tease was dropped and replaced by short pre-taped films focusing on a team or player in the game. Some of them have featured actor Jamie Foxx.

Joe Theismann did not return to the &quot;MNF&quot; booth after 1 season, and was replaced by Ron Jaworski.

The guest visits continued: Barkley returned to the booth on September 17 in Philadelphia. Other guests throughout the season included Kimmel (another returnee), Drew Carey, Miley Cyrus, Russell Crowe and Terry Bradshaw. In addition, Gordon was a halftime guest on the game just before the season-ending Ford 400 and was joined by teammate Jimmie Johnson.

At the end of each game, Williams returned to say, &quot;See you in (city that is the site of the next week&#x27;s game).&quot; Both the open and close contain helmets of the participating teams, organized in the style of a concert poster.

====2008 summary====
Despite the de-emphasis on entertainment on the overall telecast, ESPN did bring back Hank Williams Jr. for his 20th season as part of the opening. This time, the opening sequence was set in a private residence. At the end of the song, Williams Jr. touched a foot pump, which supposedly contained the helmets of that night&#x27;s participating teams. The helmets were launched from the home toward the stadium at which the game was held. Through computer-generated imagery, the helmets &quot;land&quot; at midfield during a live shot, and then explode. The &quot;exploding helmets&quot; gimmick was also used at various times in the 1980s and 1990s during the pre-game tease. Williams Jr. then appeared again at the end of the game to promote the next week&#x27;s matchup.

ESPN also continued to promote upcoming albums through its use in bumper music. On September 29 (Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers), ESPN used &quot;Another Way to Die&quot;, a duet between Alicia Keys and Jack White of the White Stripes – the song was part of the soundtrack for the 2008 film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, then the latest in the James Bond series.

&quot;MNF&quot; celebrated its 600th game broadcast on October 20, 2008, in a game which the New England Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos, 41–7.

The 39th season of &quot;MNF&quot; ended on December 22, 2008, when the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers, 20–17, in overtime at home at Soldier Field in Chicago.

====2009 summary====
The title sequence for the 40th season of &quot;MNF&quot; featured Hank Williams Jr. seen on the steps of a building (presumably a museum), surrounded by dancers, football fans, and statues/busts – which, along with everyone else in the scene, begin to move and dance – patterned after those at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The transition to Williams Jr. is a book, with the chapter number (in Roman numerals, sequentially with each week) and a tag line about the game to be played that night.

At the end of the song, Williams Jr. plugged in the cords, thereby launching animated &quot;helmets&quot; into space, from the building toward the stadium at which the game was held (with the exception of October 5, 2009, when the helmets zoomed towards Brett Favre instead), passing the International Space Station. As with the previous season (as mentioned above), the helmets &quot;land&quot; at midfield during a live shot and then crashed into each other. Williams Jr. appeared again at the end of the telecast to promote the following week&#x27;s matchup. After that, the picture was freezeframed and the shot zoomed out to the book, which showed the freezeframed picture as part of a page. As this happened, the NFL end-of-game bumper music was played and the book closed, revealing a golden NFL logo on the back cover and signifying the end of the &quot;chapter&quot;, or game. The scene was filmed in the summer of 2009 at The Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee.

Before Williams Jr. appears, Frank Gifford gave a short vignette about a memorable moment in the history of &quot;MNF&quot; featuring one or both of the teams playing that night&#x27;s game.

Tony Kornheiser did not return to the booth after 3 seasons and was replaced by former Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Jon Gruden.

The 40th season of &quot;MNF&quot; ended on December 28, 2009, with the Minnesota Vikings–Chicago Bears game in Chicago, in which the Bears won in overtime, 36–30. The telecast ended with a vignette that featured Gifford taking a look back at highlights from the previous four decades – and the 40th season – of &quot;MNF&quot;, after which the book closed, signifying the end of the season. The 40th season had the highest season viewership for &quot;MNF&quot; since ESPN acquired the rights to the broadcast. This was primarily due to the buffo ratings ESPN received for airing the October 5, 2009 game which featured Favre taking on his former team, the Green Bay Packers.

===2010s===
====2010 summary====
The opening for the 2010 season was identical to that used in 2009, except for the final scenes. This time, Williams Jr. turns a wheel filled with paint, with CGI colors blasting into the air, revealing the helmets containing logos of the participating teams – which stay on top of the building. In one other minor difference, the chapter numbers in the &quot;book&quot; were changed from Roman to Arabic numerals. Gifford provided new vignettes and the Parthenon scenes were repeated from the year before. The 2010 season marked Williams&#x27; 22nd as part of the telecast&#x27;s open.

In an unusual coincidence, both games which had the New York Jets as a home team at New Meadowlands Stadium (now MetLife Stadium) were delayed because of heavy rain and lightning in the area. In the first instance, the September 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens, it was delayed 25 minutes; the second delay, prior to the October 11 contest against the Minnesota Vikings, lasted for 40 minutes. Prior to the September 13 game, the last ESPN telecast to encounter weather problems was on October 4, 1998 (a Sunday night) when lightning halted a game between the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs during the second quarter. The first delay forced ESPN to use ESPN2 for a game telecast, this time for the Chiefs&#x27; home opener against the San Diego Chargers. As in 2007, the broadcast was shifted to ESPN once the first game was over.

The game between the Jets and the Vikings was both Brett Favre&#x27;s first game in East Rutherford since his only season there in 2008 and marked Randy Moss&#x27;s return to the Vikings. Moss played only four games for Minnesota until he was waived on November 2.

====2011 summary====
The opening sequence for the 2011 season was set in a closed-studio setting, with Hank Williams Jr. (in his 23rd year) performing with a band with members such as Jimi K Bones from KIX and Blondie, The House Jacks, and Jenny Morrison (bass guitar), Chris King (trumpet), Clay Lucovich (trombone), and Florizel Dennis (baritone saxophone) from Orlando, Florida ska band Tef London, in front of a live audience with large video screens in the background. The end of the opening sequence featured the team logos of that night&#x27;s participants transitioning into the new &quot;ESPN Monday Night Football&quot; logo before going to a live shot. On October 3, 2011, ESPN pulled the theme song after Williams appeared on the Fox News Channel program, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, where he compared a golf outing involving Barack Obama, John Boehner, Joe Biden and John Kasich to &quot;Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu.&quot; On October 6, 2011, it was announced that Williams would no longer be singing the theme song, and that &quot;All My Rowdy Friends&quot; would no longer be used as its theme, as Williams still owns the song. A statement from ESPN said that the network has &quot;decided to part ways with Hank Williams Jr. We appreciate his contributions over the past years. The success of &quot;MNF&quot; has always been about the games and that will continue.&quot; Williams commented on the matter: &quot;After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made my decision... By pulling my opening October 3, [ESPN] stepped on the toes of the First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore me, my song, and &quot;All My Rowdy Friends&quot; are out of here. It&#x27;s been a great run.&quot; &quot;MNF&quot; did not have an opening sequence at all from Week 4 through the end of that season.

With Suzy Kolber reassigned to the new studio show &quot;NFL32&quot;, and Michele Tafoya having left ESPN for &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, the sideline reporter position rotated between various reporters for the season.

For the second year in a row, and the third time overall, the beginning of the 10:15 p.m. Eastern Time game (Oakland Raiders at Denver Broncos) was shown on ESPN2 as the game that began at 7:00 pm. Eastern Time (New England Patriots at Miami Dolphins) ran past the scheduled time period.

====2012 summary====
Lisa Salters was named the permanent solo sideline reporter for the 2012 season. In addition, color commentator Ron Jaworski did not return to the booth after 5 seasons. As a result, Jon Gruden became the solo color commentator, with &quot;MNF&quot; going back to a two-man booth for the first time since its final season on ABC (2005). &quot;MNF&quot;″s opening graphic sequence, which showed the helmet logos of the game&#x27;s two participating NFL teams and then the program&#x27;s logo, was seen before the &quot;Monday Night Football Launch&quot; segment.

====2013–14 summary====
The opening animation sequence begins with an image of a 2014 GMC Sierra (GMC paid for product placement) and then goes into a timeline of historical events that occurred during the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; era, including some highlights of &quot;MNF&quot; games from the previous 43 seasons up to 2012. At the end of the sequence, helmets featuring logos of that night&#x27;s two participating teams are shown, followed by the various &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; logos used since the program&#x27;s debut in 1970. The 80-second opening animation sequence, which also featured Pac-Man, Darth Vader and President Ronald Reagan, was created by actor/filmmaker Peter Berg.

A revision of the opening sequence was used for the 2014 season. Among the few changes, GMC&#x27;s product placement promoted the automaker&#x27;s line of Denali vehicles, while the sequence itself included some additional highlights of &quot;MNF&quot; games from the previous 44 seasons up to 2013.

====2015 summary====
A 3D opening animation sequence is used for the 2015 season (46th season overall and tenth on ESPN). GMC&#x27;s product placement once again promoted the automaker&#x27;s line of Denali vehicles, including the Yukon Denali that is seen at the beginning. Also among the many changes is the highlights of &quot;MNF&quot; games – this time, they are set inside a computer-generated stadium using 3D imagery – from the previous 45 seasons up to 2014.

This was Mike Tirico&#x27;s final season as the play-by-play announcer for &quot;MNF&quot;, as he would join NBC Sports in June 2016.

====2016 summary====
After three years of using the timeline-themed open, &quot;MNF&quot; debuted a new 75-second, Hollywood-themed open on September 12, 2016, featuring ESPN&#x27;s new &quot;MNF&quot; broadcast team – Sean McDonough (play-by-play), Jon Gruden (color) and Lisa Salters (sideline reporter) – and more than 20 active NFL stars and Pro Football Hall of Famers walking along a red carpet entrance lined by cheering fans and photographers taking pictures. It began with a shot of a downtown stadium surrounded by skyscrapers, with a 2017 GMC Acadia (product placement again provided by GMC) displaying the location for that week&#x27;s &quot;MNF&quot; game on its navigation system. The Acadia then headed to a glitzy red carpet at the stadium&#x27;s entrance, where McDonough, Gruden and Salters exit the car, followed on the carpet by a flood of NFL players representing the past and present of &quot;MNF&quot;. Players then posed for pictures and wave to the crowd as they reach the stadium entrance. Josh Norman (Redskins), Larry Fitzgerald (Cardinals) and Rob Gronkowski (Patriots) were among the current players being represented in the open, with Franco Harris (Steelers), Jerry Rice (49ers), Barry Sanders (Lions) and Bruce Smith (Bills) among the past players being represented.

For the Spanish-language version of the Hollywood-themed open, it featured ESPN&#x27;s Spanish-language &quot;MNF&quot; broadcast team – Álvaro Martín (play-by-play), Raúl Allegre (color) and John Sutcliffe (sideline reporter) as well as the current Hispanic NFL players and the team of the Latin American version of &quot;NFL Live&quot; led by Ciro Procuna.

====2017 summary====
&quot;MNF&quot; returned to two teases for the first time since its first season on ESPN (2006). The Hollywood-themed open was repeated from the previous season, this time with the 2018 GMC Terrain being used as the automaker&#x27;s product placement.

Also, Hank Williams Jr. returned to &quot;MNF&quot; on September 11, 2017, with an all-new version of the iconic opening theme song, &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night&quot; (used from 1989 to Week 3 of the 2011 season) and it appeared just before that night&#x27;s New Orleans Saints-Minnesota Vikings game. The new version, which is seen just before the kickoff of each game, is a collaboration of Williams Jr., country duo Florida Georgia Line, and R&amp;B singer Jason Derulo.

The second game of the Week 1 &quot;MNF&quot; doubleheader between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Denver Broncos saw Beth Mowins become the first woman to call a nationally televised NFL game.

====2018 summary====

2018 brought in a shakeup of the booth. Jon Gruden left &quot;MNF&quot; after 9 seasons and returned to coaching with the Oakland Raiders and was replaced by Jason Witten, formerly a tight end for the Dallas Cowboys. Sean McDonough and Joe Tessitore traded places, with McDonough taking Tessitore&#x27;s place in the college booth, and Tessitore taking McDonough&#x27;s place in the &quot;MNF&quot; booth. In addition, Booger McFarland, who has been a college football analyst for the network since 2014, joined the &quot;MNF&quot; team as field analyst and consultant. Finally, rules analyst Gerald Austin left &quot;MNF&quot; to work as an adviser to Gruden and the Raiders and was replaced by recently retired referee Jeff Triplette. Lisa Salters remained the sideline reporter.

Also, ESPN once again scaled back to only one opening tease for the 2018 season, as the Hollywood-themed open was dropped after two seasons. &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night&quot; featuring country music legend Hank Williams Jr., country music duo Florida-Georgia Line and R&amp;B singer Jason Derulo returned from the previous season and is once again seen just before the opening kickoff. Due to the Thousand Oaks shooting, and the then-ongoing Northern California wildfires, the opening intro was not shown during the November 12 broadcast between Pro Bowl wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and the New York Giants and Super Bowl-winning cornerback Richard Sherman and the San Francisco 49ers and also, the historic Kansas City Chiefs-Los Angeles Rams game the following week (November 19). In the case of the latter, it was originally scheduled to be played at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, but was moved to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (the Rams&#x27; home stadium at the time, which itself last hosted a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in 1985) due to the poor field conditions at the former. The game would be the highest scoring game in &quot;MNF&quot; history, with the Rams defeating the Chiefs by a score of 54–51.

In addition, ESPN also added musical performances during the halftime segment, branded as the &quot;Genesis Halftime Show&quot; as part of a sponsorship deal. These performances typically aired at the end of the commercial-free halftime segments and, with the expectation of the Chiefs-Rams game in which there was a live performance, were typically prerecorded in various locations, usually around the city where that week&#x27;s &quot;MNF&quot; game took place.

====2019 summary====
ESPN underwent another broadcast booth shakeup, as Jason Witten left to return to the Dallas Cowboys, and rules analyst Jeff Triplette left after one season. Triplette was replaced with John Parry, who retired after Super Bowl LIII. Witten was not replaced, therefore making the 2019 broadcast team consist of Joe Tessitore (play-by-play), Booger McFarland (color commentator) and Lisa Salters (sideline reporter).

The network also brought back Hank Williams Jr. to perform &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night&quot;, which for the first time since 2011, he performed solo, as Florida Georgia Line and Jason Derulo all departed after two seasons. The intro to &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; also celebrated the 50th season of the program with NFL Legends and Hall of Famers or current NFL players (Texans&#x27; J. J. Watt for the Playoffs) saying &quot;Are you ready for some football?&quot; before Williams Jr. begins playing.

The &quot;Genesis Halftime Show&quot; returned for another season and continued to feature prerecorded musical performances; however they were later dropped on October 28 due to poor reception from viewers and was replaced with additional game analysis although Genesis continued to sponsor the halftime show for the remainder of the season.

===2020s===
====2020 summary====
After poor reviews and major criticism, the 2020 season saw another major revamp to ESPN&#x27;s booth, with Steve Levy, Brian Griese, and Louis Riddick, who called one of ESPN&#x27;s opening week doubleheader games the year before, replacing Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland. McFarland, however, would switch places with Riddick, taking over in the studio. ESPN/ABC&#x27;s lead college football commentary team of Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, and Maria Taylor called the first game of the Week 1 doubleheader (as Fowler and Taylor were already in the New York area handling the US Open (Fowler) and the NBA Playoffs (Taylor) respectively). Fowler and Herbstreit were considered as the new MNF booth, if the 2020 college football season were to be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To formally celebrate the 50th anniversary of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, the Las Vegas Raiders&#x27; Week 2 home opener (their first after relocating from Oakland) was simulcast by ABC. The game also featured a special Monday Night Megacast, hosted by Rece Davis and Herbstreit. This alternate broadcast aired on ESPN2, the first time it had aired an NFL game in its entirety. The Hank Williams Jr. &quot;MNF&quot; theme was once again dropped, being replaced by a cover of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot; by Virginia-based band Butcher Brown.

As the game was postponed to October 12 due to a player testing positive for COVID-19, the Week 5 game between the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots was reassigned to ESPN as the first half of a rare in-season &quot;MNF&quot; doubleheader, with the game scheduled for a 5:00 p.m. ET kickoff. Fowler and Herbstreit were slated to return and call the game. This time, they would have been joined by Laura Rutledge, host of &quot;NFL Live&quot; and &quot;SEC Nation&quot; on SEC Network. However, the game was ultimately postponed to the following Sunday as a Week 6 game due to further positive tests. Rutledge would eventually fill in for Lisa Salters during the Week 16 &quot;MNF&quot; game in Foxborough, as Salters had been following ESPN&#x27;s COVID-19 protocols.

ESPN announced on November 30 that two December Monday night games, both involving the Buffalo Bills, would be simulcast on ABC. Also announced on November 30 was the debut of the NFL Playoff Megacast, which featured alternate feeds of the Baltimore Ravens-Tennessee Titans matchup on ESPN2, ESPN+, and Freeform.

The December 21 matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals featured the Muppets and was themed as &quot;Muppet Night Football.&quot; In the opening broadcast of the game, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy served as announcers from the booth while Fozzie Bear reported from the sidelines. After their appearance in the opening broadcast, the Muppets soon re-appeared with Rowlf the Dog, Scooter, Gonzo, Animal, Beaker, the Swedish Chef and others singing a football-themed rendition &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the segments involving the Muppets were shot with puppeteers in front of a green screen at home.

====2021 summary====
For the first time since 2005, there was no season-opening doubleheader as the opening game of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;″s 52nd season consisted only of the Baltimore Ravens-Las Vegas Raiders matchup, which was aired on ESPN and simulcast on ABC, ESPN2, and ESPN+, as part of the network&#x27;s Megacast series. Also, Butcher Brown&#x27;s cover of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Rip it Up&quot; returned for the second consecutive year as the intro theme for &quot;MNF&quot;.

Like last season, two late-season games, both being NFC rivalries, were simulcast on ABC, as well as ESPN+. ABC and ESPN+ also simulcast the first ever Week 18 Saturday Doubleheader, a new addition to ESPN&#x27;s schedule, which was part of the NFL expanding their regular season from 16 to 17 games, and to accommodate ESPN&#x27;s new NFL media rights deal, which includes the Saturday Doubleheader, a Sunday International game for ESPN+ subscribers, more games on ABC, a Divisional playoff game, and Super Bowls LXI and LXV on ABC, along with rights for ESPN+ to simulcast every ESPN/ABC game, accommodate select games with alternate broadcasts, and flex scheduling beginning in 2023.

On July 19, ESPN announced an agreement with Omaha Productions, the production company of Peyton Manning, to produce alternate telecasts of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; with Manning, his brother Eli, and guest celebrities for ten games each season on ESPN2 and ESPN+, from 2021 through 2023. The Manningcast would also be a part of ESPN&#x27;s first ever Monday Night Super Wild Card Megacast, which had alternate broadcasts of the game on ESPN2 and ESPN+, to accommodate the main broadcast on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+. The success of the Manningcast&#x27;s first season would lead to ESPN adding an extra year to their deal with Omaha Productions in the offseason.

====2022 summary====
This season, ESPN will be working under a new bridge deal to transition themselves into the next television contract. The 2022 season will see ESPN+ add a Sunday International game, an exclusive &quot;MNF&quot; game on ABC, and the continuation of the Week 18 Saturday Doubleheader. ESPN made a colossal change to the &quot;MNF&quot; booth, the fourth change since 2015, when the network hired Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, who were Fox&#x27;s lead commentary team for the past 20 seasons, as the new announcers for &quot;MNF&quot;, replacing Levy, Griese (who eventually left ESPN to become the new quarterbacks coach of the San Francisco 49ers), and Riddick. Levy and Riddick will continue to call doubleheaders as the #2 team, with Dan Orlovsky replacing Griese and Laura Rutledge serving as that team&#x27;s sideline reporter.

Butcher Brown&#x27;s cover of &quot;Rip it Up&quot; did not return as the intro theme for MNF. Instead, a remix of &quot;Heavy Action&quot; was used, produced by EDM producer and DJ Marshmello.

====2023 summary====
For the 2023 season, ESPN aired four exclusive &quot;MNF&quot; games on ABC (Cleveland Browns vs Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 2, Philadelphia Eagles vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 3, Green Bay Packers vs. New York Giants in Week 14, and Baltimore Ravens vs. San Francisco 49ers in Week 16). On September 18, 2023, as previously mentioned, ABC did simulcast 10 additional &quot;MNF&quot; games that were originally slated to air only on ESPN, starting with the Week 4 game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New York Giants, making this the first time since 2005 in which ABC will air &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games all season long. During this season, Joe Buck and Troy Aikman became the NFL&#x27;s longest-tenured broadcasting team surpassing Pat Summerall and John Madden. The #2 booth saw ESPN&#x27;s lead college football play-by-play announcer Chris Fowler take over for Levy with Riddick and Orlovsky. The trio called all three ESPN-exclusive games, as well as the London game (Atlanta Falcons vs. Jacksonville Jaguars) in Week 4 and one of the two Week 18 Saturday doubleheader games. The London game also featured a youth-oriented alternate broadcast on ESPN+ and Disney+, using the league&#x27;s player tracking data to render a live animated version of the game portrayed by characters from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise.

This was the first year in which flex scheduling would now apply to &quot;MNF&quot; games between Weeks 12 and 17, enabling ESPN to select more viable matchups in later weeks of the season. On November 30, 2023, the Week 15 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs at the New England Patriots was flexed out of Monday Night Football in favor of the Philadelphia Eagles at the Seattle Seahawks.

====2024 summary====
For the 2024 season, ESPN originally reduced the amount of ABC simulcasts to four, but maintained the three exclusive &quot;MNF&quot; games on ABC (Washington Commanders vs Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3, Seattle Seahawks vs Detroit Lions in Week 4, and Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings in Week 15). In addition, in lieu of a London game, ESPN+&#x27;s exclusive game will air on a Monday night in Week 7, with the Los Angeles Chargers facing the Arizona Cardinals. It will be the first MNF game that ESPN+ exclusively streams. On October 11, ESPN announced that four more ABC simulcasts were added to the schedule. ESPN further announced on October 28 that ESPN+, Disney+ and NFL+ will stream an alternate broadcast Cincinnati Bengals vs. Dallas Cowboys called &quot;The Simpsons Funday Football&quot; in Week 14 that will use the league&#x27;s player tracking data to render a live animated version of the game portrayed by characters from &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; franchise&quot;.

This is the second year in which flex scheduling applies to &quot;MNF&quot; games. Games between Weeks 12 and 17 enable ESPN to select more viable matchups in later weeks of the season, though ESPN waived Week 12 due to the lead time involving pre-production elements for &quot;The Simpsons Funday Football&quot; broadcast.

==Anthems==
Hank Williams Jr. reworked his country music hit &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot; to be included in the telecast&#x27;s introduction as &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night&quot; (the original introduction music was an organ-based piece called &quot;Score&quot;, written by Charles Fox and recorded by Bob&#x27;s Band). In addition, Edd Kalehoff modernized the classic &quot;Heavy Action&quot; theme in 1989.

For ABC&#x27;s last &quot;MNF&quot; game in 2005, Williams Jr.&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Turn Out the Lights, The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, closed the broadcast.

In 2018, ESPN brought back the classic &quot;Heavy Action&quot; theme as the main theme song for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

In 2020, ESPN replaced Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s &quot;MNF&quot; theme with a cover of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot; by Virginia-based band Butcher Brown for the 2020 and 2021 seasons. For the 2021–22 season, the theme sometimes played in reverse.

In 2022, ESPN added the remixed version of &quot;Heavy Action&quot; done by American DJ Marshmello as the intro theme for &quot;MNF&quot; as a replacement for Butcher Brown&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot;; the aforementioned original version of &quot;Heavy Action&quot; is still being used in the broadcast.

In 2023, ESPN debuted the official new opening song, &quot;In the Air Tonight,&quot; a cover of the 1981 Phil Collins classic, featuring Chris Stapleton, Cindy Blackman Santana, and Snoop Dogg. The new opening song is co-produced by ESPN&#x27;s Creative Content Unit and Grammy-winning musician David Cobb, with lyrics written by MK Asante. The song aired before all Monday Night Football games as well as ESPN&#x27;s week 18 Saturday doubleheader, super wild card and first divisional playoff game. This theme was retained for the 2024 season.

==Digital on-screen graphics==

Prior to 1997, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; had a limited graphics package. A CGI-based intro began being used in 1984, with on-screen graphics still limited to basic text. In 1988, the entire graphics package was updated significantly to be more in line with the rest of ABC Sports&#x27; presentations. That year, it introduced the &quot;clashing helmets&quot; intro, with on-screen graphics consisting of italicized text underlined in red. It was updated in 1994, the year the network hosted Super Bowl XXIX, with a more box-like design. A permanent score bug would not be introduced until 1997.

===1997–2005===
&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; began using a score bug in 1997, the second network to do so after Fox introduced the first regular on-screen scoring bug when it began airing NFL games in 1994. Prior to this, the graphics package was limited, but followed a basic &quot;ketchup and mustard&quot; color scheme of red and yellow. The first scorebug included team names, scores, time remaining, and displayed which quarter the game was in. This design was used through the 1998 season.

ABC hosted Super Bowl XXXIV for 1999, and updated its graphics package to more closely resemble those of sister cable network ESPN. ABC began using extended abbreviations for team names (for example, &quot;TENN&quot;, &quot;VIKES&quot;, &quot;PACK&quot;, and &quot;FINS&quot; instead of &quot;TEN&quot;, &quot;MIN&quot;, &quot;GB&quot;, and &quot;MIA&quot;), as four-letter and five-letter abbreviations were used on ESPN coverage. The result was a larger scorebug with a more conventional font. It was slightly modified in 2000 to have a border that was more in line with the red and yellow color scheme.

The graphics for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; were changed in the 2002 season, the year the network hosted Super Bowl XXXVII. The scorebug was a solid color, with a more rounded shape, and a horizontally compressed font. ESPN&#x27;s graphics were no longer similar to those of ABC&#x27;s (with ESPN instead using a gray and black design with rounded corners). In 2005, the broadcast&#x27;s final year on ABC, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; began using a horizontal bar on the bottom of the screen rather than a scorebug, with all information being contained on a single line.

===2006–present===
After &quot;MNF&quot; moved to ESPN in 2006 (around the same time that ABC Sports rebranded as ESPN on ABC), ESPN adopted new red and black graphics with heavier use of 3D elements and animations. These graphics would be subsequently implemented as a standard appearance for most major ESPN properties (including college football, the NBA, Major League Baseball, and NASCAR among others). For &quot;MNF&quot;, a &quot;pod&quot; scoreboard at the bottom-center of the screen was used.

For the 2008 season, a new graphics scheme was introduced, in which a scorebar and all lower thirds were confined to a dedicated &quot;dashboard&quot; area spanning across the bottom the screen. Lower third graphics replaced the scorebar when in use. For 2009, an updated metallic silver design was introduced, dropping the &quot;dashboard&quot;. The scheme would, again, be adopted by other major ESPN properties. In the 2011 season, &quot;MNF&quot; introduced a dedicated graphics package with a red and black metallic design and larger scoreboard, as well as a redesigned &quot;MNF&quot; shield logo.

For the 2015 season, ESPN introduced another overhaul of its &quot;MNF&quot; graphics, with a new scoreboard spanning the bottom of the screen, capable of being faded away when plays are in progress. This design persisted through 2018, although with amendments in its final season (including a different, italicized font for the scoreboard and downs indicator, and the downs indicator now resembling an arrow, and alternating sides of the screen with the ESPN logo depending on the direction of play).

In 2019, ESPN introduced a new graphics scheme its NFL programming (modeled upon branding used for the NFL Draft since 2018), incorporating refreshed logos, and a color scheme featuring black, white, and a lime color referred to internally as &quot;venom&quot;. The &quot;MNF&quot; scoreboard retained a similar layout to before, but with new fonts and only showing team logos.

During the first game of ESPN&#x27;s opening doubleheader, the network faced criticism from viewers for coloring the downage indicator on its scoreboard in the aforementioned &quot;venom&quot; color, which could be confused for a graphic indicating a penalty (typically colored in yellow to match the penalty flag; the flag graphic used a black rectangle with a venom-colored border and text). In response to the criticism, ESPN producers modified the graphic over halftime, changing the indicator to use a white, light-on-dark color scheme instead. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; media writer Phil Rosenthal described the briefly-used graphic as a &quot;fluorescent-highlighter fever dream&quot;, and felt that &quot;the quickness with which ESPN abandoned this unnecessary bit of flash probably speaks more to how misguided this latest supposed &#x27;innovation&#x27; was than any increased sensitivity to the twitterati.&quot; Despite the previous incident, ESPN faced similar criticism in January 2021 during the College Football Playoff semi-finals, where it used a gold-textured downs indicator.

Starting with the 2020 XFL season, the graphics have been modified for XFL broadcasts to match the XFL&#x27;s new look, while the score bug has been moved upwards to make room of the ESPN BottomLine. After a graphics refresh in 2023 to match the updated logo, these graphics are now used as part of ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the UFL.

Starting with the 2023 NFL season, ESPN debuted new graphics for its &quot;MNF&quot; broadcasts. The look is similar to its previous look with a more translucent background. The timeout indicator moved from under the team names to the side of the names. The down indicator changed from an arrow to a more standard box.

For the Toy Story Funday Football broadcast on Disney+ and ESPN+, the graphics have been modified to match the film&#x27;s visuals, such as sky wallpaper in Andy&#x27;s Room.

Similarly, for the &quot;The Simpsons Funday Football&quot; broadcast on Disney+ and ESPN+, the graphics have been modified to match the show&#x27;s visuals, like Springfield&#x27;s sky background.

===Most frequent matchups===
==Monday Night Football scheduling==

From to , ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; coverage began at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, with game kickoff typically occurring at seven minutes past the hour. Coverage was moved one hour earlier to 8 p.m. Eastern Time in , with a pre-game show titled &quot;Monday Night Blast&quot;, hosted by Chris Berman from the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore preceding the start of the game at 8:20 p.m. This was done mainly to address ABC&#x27;s inability to find a suitable 8 p.m. lead-in program for &quot;MNF&quot; since &quot;MacGyver&quot; ended its run in 1992 (not even two other series from &quot;MacGyver&quot;″s production company Paramount Television – &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; and &quot;The Marshal&quot; – saw success, despite the former&#x27;s ties to Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series), and to allow stations to start their late local newscasts nearer to their regular times. Poor ratings caused this experiment to be dropped after one season, with &quot;MNF&quot; once again moving to 9 p.m. in , though in many NFL markets, the 8 p.m. (Eastern Time) hour from 1999 to 2006 was replaced by affiliates with locally produced and programmed sports discussion and coaches shows, with ABC programming in that hour moved to late night or weekend slots; by the end of the ABC run, the 8 p.m. time-slot was filled with either news magazines and short-lived reality television programs which failed to make any ratings headways due to affiliate pre-emptions.

From to , Fisher Broadcasting&#x27;s ABC affiliates in Seattle (KOMO-TV) and Portland (KATU) aired &quot;MNF&quot; games on a one-hour tape delay starting at 7 p.m. Pacific Time (games normally started in the Pacific Time Zone at 6 p.m., corresponding to 9 p.m. Eastern) in order to accommodate local newscasts (unless the Seattle Seahawks were playing, in which case the game was shown live). The practice, long opposed by viewers and ABC, ended in . KOMO then tried to accommodate having to air its local newscasts earlier than its local station competitors by marketing it as &quot;KOMO 4 News Primetime&quot;, touting it as a way to watch the news at a more convenient time than during evening rush hour. Additionally, this practice was done in Hawaii, where Honolulu ABC affiliate KITV delayed the game until 7 p.m. Hawaii–Aleutian Time. Thus, the game, which was broadcast live on local radio starting at 3 or 4 p.m., was almost over before it aired on television. In the case of Guam, KTGM, the ABC affiliate in that U.S. territory, aired &quot;MNF&quot; live on Tuesdays at 11 am-2:30 pm as Guam is a day ahead of the United States due to being located on the other side of International Date Line.

The demand to broadcast &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games live across the United States over ABC was difficult to reconcile with other prime-time programming, which is usually set to begin at a certain local time regardless of time zone. On the East Coast, with &quot;MNF&quot; beginning at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, there was an hour of primetime in which to schedule regular programming. However, on the West Coast, the games lasted from 6 to 9:30 p.m. Pacific Time (or in the case of Seattle and Portland from 1970 to 1995, 7 to 10:30 p.m.), leaving little or no time for additional network programming on Monday. As a result, network programs scheduled for prime time on the East Coast were broadcast at various hours on the West Coast. Most affiliates pushed the network shows to immediately after the game; however, Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KABC-TV postponed them until 10 p.m. from at least the mid-1990s until 2005 to show trivia contests and other sports shows produced locally (the longest-tenured such show was &quot;Monday Night Live&quot;, hosted by sports anchor Todd Donoho). Meanwhile, KOMO, one of the stations that tape delayed &quot;MNF&quot; in most cases, broadcast new episodes of the sitcom &quot;Coach&quot; on Saturday afternoons (usually reserved, coincidentally enough, for college football telecasts; much of the series took place on a fictional college campus). Except for Seattle and Portland from 1970 to 1995, &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; was routinely preempted on most West Coast affiliates, though the ABC network-owned stations (e.g. Los Angeles) aired the program earlier in the afternoon.

Since ESPN took over the coverage in 2006, games normally had a kickoff time of 8:30 p.m. Eastern, which was later changed to 8:15 p.m. Eastern in 2018. However, when ESPN aired a doubleheader during the first week of the season until 2021, the games respectively started at 7 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. Eastern.

When ESPN took over &quot;MNF&quot; in 2006, the NFL mandated that games needed to be simulcast on a local station in each team&#x27;s home market. Although they were officially determined via a syndication-like process, in most cases these local stations were ABC affiliates. This became a problem when ABC aired &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on Monday nights. Whenever an ABC affiliate pre-empted the show to air the NFL, these stations would then broadcast &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on tape delay immediately after their late-evening local newscasts, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Nightline&quot;. This resulted in the program&#x27;s telephone and Internet voting coordinators keeping a late-night voting window open for the market(s) where &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; was pre-empted.

In some cases, the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; was moved to a sister station of the ABC affiliate to air live instead (for example, until 2011 in the Minneapolis–St. Paul market, when NBC affiliate KARE took over as the local broadcaster of &quot;MNF&quot; games if the Minnesota Vikings were playing a game being simulcast on local ABC affiliate KSTP-TV, sister independent station KSTC-TV aired &quot;DWTS&quot; live). In 2016, for the opening week Monday night game (the second in a doubleheader) between the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers, the ABC-owned stations in both markets (KABC-TV and KGO-TV) would broadcast &quot;World News Tonight&quot; and &quot;DWTS&quot; in their live Eastern Time Zone slots, thus airing at 3:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. PT respectively (the &quot;WNT&quot; simulcast was later made permanent on both stations every weekday for ratings purposes).

In 2022, when ABC began airing select exclusive &quot;MNF&quot; telecasts, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; was moved to Disney+ for at least that season. ABC then scheduled &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; and other programming on Monday nights instead, which were then preempted nationally during those weeks when the network aired its exclusive &quot;MNF&quot; games. In May 2023, ABC announced that &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; would be moved back to ABC on Monday nights, and would thus again cause the same local market conflict during those weeks when &quot;MNF&quot; is nationally only on ESPN, in August, as a result of the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, ABC announced that its Monday and Tuesday schedules were getting revised, with &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; scheduled to air on Tuesdays, once again, therefore resolving the conflict for this season. Eventually, because of the strikes, ABC picked up the entire season of MNF, in addition to their four exclusive games, to fill their Monday schedule in the fall. This wound up being the first full season of MNF to air on ABC in any capacity since 2005.

==Commentators==

==Foreign-language versions==
===Spanish version===
Since , a Spanish-language telecast is also broadcast on ESPN Deportes, the Spanish version of ESPN and on ESPN Latin America, featuring NBA and NFL play-by-play announcer Álvaro Martín, Super Bowl winner Raul Allegre as color commentator and John Sutcliffe as the field reporter. This is the same crew of La NFL Dominical, the Spanish version of ESPN Sunday Night Football, until . The announcers of the second game of the 2006 doubleheader were Eduardo Varela (play-by-play), Robert Abramowitz (color) and Georgina Ruiz Sandoval (field reporter). Preceding the game NFL Esta Noche (&quot;NFL Tonight&quot;), the 30-minute pre-game show, can be seen on both networks.

The four booth announcers called the 2007 season opening games from ESPN&#x27;s Bristol, Connecticut headquarters while watching games on monitors. None of them traveled to the game sites and there were no sideline reporters in the early weeks. Sutcliffe would later report from the game sites. Allegre did not work the season finale between the Broncos and Chargers; he was replaced by Abramovitz.

In 2008, Martin and Allegre only travelled to the Cowboys-Eagles game, during the NFL&#x27;s celebrations of Hispanic Heritage Month.

As part of ESPN&#x27;s agreement to simulcast their Wild Card game on ABC, Martin and Allegre&#x27;s Spanish-language commentary is carried over the SAP channel on ABC, equivalent to the rest of the NFL&#x27;s over-the-air broadcast partners.

When CBS televised Super Bowls 50, LIII, and LV, ESPN sub-licensed the rights to air dedicated Spanish-language telecasts on ESPN Deportes, using the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; commentary team and with surrounding coverage in the language. CBS did not have any sister Spanish-language cable or broadcast network like Fox and NBC, who have used Fox Deportes and Universo/Telemundo, respectively. For Super Bowl LVIII, CBS sold its sub-license rights to TelevisaUnivision instead.

In 2017 and 2018, ESPN2 simulcast ESPN Deportes&#x27; telecast, &quot;NFL Esta Noche&quot;, and the ESPN Latin America &quot;SportsCenter&quot; after the game, during the first nine weeks of the season (prior to the start of its Monday-night college basketball broadcasts). ESPN2 had previously scheduled lesser-viewed filler programming during the period. In the 2020-21 playoffs, ESPN Deportes also aired an AFC Divisional Playoff game and the AFC Championship Game.

For the 2023 season, ESPN Deportes introduced the new Monday Night Football team of Rebeca Landa on the play-by-play, with Sergio Dipp as analyst, and Katia Castorena as sideline reporter. John Sutcliffe will continue to be part of the team, providing reports from site.
On October 16, 2023, ESPN2 did simulcast ESPN Deportes’ Spanish-Language Presentation of Monday Night Football, featuring the Dallas Cowboys and the L.A. Chargers.

For the 2024 season, MJ Acosta-Ruiz joined Monday Night Football on ESPN Deportes as sideline reporter.

===Portuguese version===
Since the 1990s, ESPN Latin America has a Portuguese language feed targeted to their viewers in Brazil. Ivan Zimmermann (play-by-play), André José Adler (play-by-play), Roberto Figueroa (color), and Marco Alfaro (color), among others, were the announcers broadcasting from ESPN&#x27;s headquarters. Since , the structure of the Brazilian feed has been merged with ESPN Brasil and the broadcasting is done from São Paulo. The current announcers are Fernando Nardini (play-by-play) and Paulo Antunes (color). Ari Aguiar (play-by-play) and Antony Curti (color) occasionally fill in.

==Radio broadcasts==

&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; has also been carried on national radio networks over the years. The Mutual Broadcasting System aired the games initially, with Van Patrick (–), Lindsey Nelson (–) and Al Wester announcing. CBS Radio took over the rights in with Jack Buck and Hank Stram commentating. After a two-year stint (–) with Don Criqui and Bob Trumpy calling the games on NBC Radio, Buck and Stram resumed with CBS Radio in . In , Howard David and Matt Millen replaced Buck and Stram. Marv Albert and Boomer Esiason were the &quot;MNF&quot; radio voices from to , with Kevin Harlan replacing Albert in . Kurt Warner joined the crew in for games when Esiason was unavailable, taking over full-time in .

In the 1990s, CBS Radio purchased a controlling stake in Westwood One, which in turn had bought out both the NBC and Mutual networks. As of 2008, Westwood One was no longer controlled by CBS, but the network retained its NFL broadcast rights. In , Westwood One was purchased by Dial Global. Then in , Dial Global, including Westwood One, was acquired by Cumulus Media.

The Spanish-language broadcast is carried on ESPN Deportes Radio.

As with other regular-season NFL games, Monday night games are also broadcast locally by the featured teams&#x27; own radio networks and announcers.

===Playoff games and Super Bowls===
When ABC first acquired the rights to air &quot;MNF&quot; in 1970, it did not include any playoff games. The network was eventually allowed into the rotation of airing the Super Bowl, starting with Super Bowl XIX in January 1985. When the league expanded the playoffs from a 10-team to a 12-team tournament in 1990, ABC was then given the rights to air the first two Wild Card Playoff games. Originally, ABC&#x27;s college football crews would call the first Wild Card Game.

Following The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s purchase of both ESPN and ABC, the two network&#x27;s sports departments merged in 1997. Beginning with the 1997 season, the &quot;ESPN Sunday Night Football&quot; crew called the first game, with the ABC &quot;MNF&quot; crew calling the second game. ESPN provided wraparound studio programming, with part of the pre and postgame airing on ABC, and ESPN&#x27;s Ron Jaworski often appeared from the studio for extra analysis during the first game. This arrangement lasted from 1997 through 2005, except for 2002 when ESPN/ABC&#x27;s college football crew did the early game. Super Bowls on ABC in this period were treated as ESPN events.

After &quot;MNF&quot; was awarded to ESPN and &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; was acquired by NBC in 2006, the Wild Card doubleheader that had aired on ABC, as well as a share of the rotating rights to the Super Bowl, was also given to NBC.

On April 22, 2014, the NFL announced that it had exercised an option in ESPN&#x27;s recent contract extension for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; rights to air a first-round Wild Card playoff game on the channel after the conclusion of the 2014 season. This was the first time that an NFL playoff game was ever broadcast exclusively on cable television in the United States, in lieu of any of the league&#x27;s broadcast network partners. The &quot;MNF&quot; broadcast team of Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden and sideline reporter Lisa Salters called the game, the first of the 2014–15 NFL playoffs. The NFC South Champion Carolina Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27–16. As with all &quot;MNF&quot; games, the matchup was simulcast on local affiliates WJZY (a Fox affiliate) in Charlotte and KASW (a CW affiliate) in Phoenix. This was because of the NFL&#x27;s rule that requires local affiliates to allow viewers over-the-air access to the game.

However, the cable-only playoff game experiment would only last one season, as on May 11, 2015, it was announced that ABC would simulcast ESPN&#x27;s Wild Card playoff game for the 2015 season. This was the first NFL game broadcast nationally on ABC since &quot;MNF&quot; left the network at the end of the 2005 season. The game, announced by the broadcast team of Tirico, Gruden and Salters, was the first of the 2015–16 NFL playoffs. The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 30–0. The ESPN/ABC simulcast has continued ever since.

Additionally, ESPN Deportes picked up the rights to air Super Bowl 50, Super Bowl LIII and Super Bowl LV in Spanish (from Super Bowl LVIII on Univision picked up those rights), as CBS, who aired the game in English, does not have a Spanish language sports network. It will also air additional CBS playoff games in the 2021 playoffs and 2022 playoffs.

Starting with Super Bowl LIII, ESPN International has produced an English-language broadcast of the Super Bowl for ESPN Australia (as an alternative to the main world feed produced by NFL Network and the domestic U.S. feed), using the domestic broadcasters&#x27; camera feeds and the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; commentary team. It also features additional pre-game coverage, augmenting ESPN&#x27;s U.S. NFL studio programming. The video is also used by the Super Bowl telecast for ESPN Brasil, dubbed with Portuguese commentary.

During the Baltimore Ravens-Tennessee Titans Wild Card game during the 2021 playoffs, not only did ESPN and ABC simulcast the game, but other ESPN and Disney-owned networks helped to broadcast the game for the first ever NFL Playoff Megacast. ESPN2, ESPN+, and Freeform all pitched in alternate feeds of the game. This was the first NFL Playoff game to get a Megacast treatment. The announcement of the Playoff Megacast went along with the announcement of ABC simulcasting two late-season MNF games that aired on ESPN (both games involving the Buffalo Bills).

With the new NFL TV contracts that begin during the 2023 season, ESPN/ABC&#x27;s playoff coverage expands to include a game in the Divisional Round, to go along with the Wild Card Game. Both games will air on ESPN and ABC. The new contracts also see both networks re-enter the Super Bowl rotation, beginning with Super Bowl LXI in 2027.

Beginning with the 2022 playoffs, ESPN will begin a new 5-year deal that will see the ESPN networks and ABC Megacast the brand new &quot;Monday Night Wild Card Game&quot;, as part of the NFL expanding Wild Card Weekend (branded by the league as &quot;Super Wild Card Weekend&quot; until the 2024 playoffs) from two days to three days. ESPN and ABC will simulcast the main feed, with ESPN2, ESPN+, and other ESPN and Disney networks providing alternative options. The final game always features a matchup between a No. 4 and No. 5 seed to ensure that it is known which opponent the winner will play before kickoff. This arrangement allows the NFL to release the divisional round schedule upon the completion of the other five wild card games, and the winner of the Monday game always plays the following Sunday to ensure they receive six days&#x27; rest.

===Non-Monday games===
From 1974 to 1977, &quot;MNF&quot; aired on Saturday during the final week of the regular season instead of Monday. From 1978 to 1986, it broadcast selected Thursday and Sunday night games. And from 1983 to 1986, &quot;MNF&quot; also aired a Friday night game in the final week of the regular season, in addition to the normal Monday night game.

From 2003 to 2005, &quot;MNF&quot; also aired the Thursday Night NFL Kickoff game during the first week of the regular season.

As part of ESPN&#x27;s new contract signed in 2021, ESPN/ABC/ESPN+ began simulcasting a Saturday NFL doubleheader during the final week of the regular season, and ESPN+ was given the rights to exclusively stream one game per season starting in 2022. ESPN+&#x27;s exclusive games are not tied to a specific day: they could either be Sunday morning NFL International Series games like in 2022 and 2023, or part of an &quot;MNF&quot; doubleheader like in 2024.

In 2023, &quot;MNF&quot; aired a game on Saturday, December 30, to accommodate New Year&#x27;s Day falling on a Monday. The game featured the Detroit Lions at the Dallas Cowboys.

===Pro Bowl===
ABC televised the Pro Bowl from 1975 to 1987, and again from 1995 to 2003.

As part of their 2011 rights agreement, ESPN was given the exclusive rights to the Pro Bowl from 2015 through 2022. from 2018 on the game was simulcast on ABC.

<doc id="195070" wikidata="Q1573501" url="?curid=195070" title="Hamilton Fish III">
<text>Hamilton Fish III (born Hamilton Stuyvesant Fish and also known as Hamilton Fish Jr.; December 7, 1888 – January 18, 1991) was an American soldier, author, and politician from New York. He represented New York&#x27;s 26th congressional district in the Hudson Valley region in the United States House of Representatives from 1920 to 1945. In the second half of his House career, Fish was a chief critic and opponent of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, especially on matters of international affairs and American entry into World War II prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Born into a political family whose legacy dated to the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam, Fish was educated at St. Mark&#x27;s School and Harvard College, where he graduated at the age of 20 before enrolling at Harvard Law School. He was elected to the New York State Assembly from Putnam County in 1913 as a member of the Progressive Party. He served three terms before enlisting in World War I, in which he commanded a company of the 369th Infantry Regiment, a unit of African-American soldiers known as the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters.&quot; After the war, Fish was elected to the United States House as a Republican. In the House, he advocated for veterans and the anti-lynching movement. He became the body&#x27;s leading anti-communist as chair of the Fish Committee, a special body established in 1930 to investigate Soviet and communist influence in the United States. He also sponsored the Lodge–Fish Resolution, expressing American support for the British establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.

In 1932, Fish crossed party lines to privately support Hudson Valley native Franklin D. Roosevelt for president, but he soon became a leading critic of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation and Atlanticist foreign policy. Throughout the 1930s, Fish was the subject of multiple foreign influence campaigns, since he was identified by Nazi Party officials as a natural ally to their international ambitions (though he was on the record criticizing the treatment of Jews in Germany) and by British security organizations as an obstacle to American aid for Great Britain. His chief of staff, George Hill, was convicted of perjury in relation to his involvement with George Sylvester Viereck, and agents of the British Security Co-ordination office repeatedly raised money for Fish&#x27;s opponents and published anti-Fish leaflets in his district. In 1941, Fish was
implicated in an America First Committee franking controversy leading to William Power Maloney&#x27;s grand jury investigating Nazi penetration in the United States.

After the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and German declaration of war, Fish called for unified support for Roosevelt as a wartime president. He delivered the first speech calling for a declaration of war against Japan and sought to re-enlist but was denied a commission by Roosevelt; he later returned to his criticism, arguing that Roosevelt should have prevented the Japanese strike. Like many leading isolationists, Fish&#x27;s popularity waned during wartime, and he was defeated for re-election in 1944. Late in the decade, former United States Department of Justice prosecutor O. John Rogge accused Fish of Nazi sympathies. He continued to actively comment on American diplomacy and military strategy during and after the Cold War, criticizing the United Nations, John Foster Dulles, and the Vietnam War while supporting NATO, the American invasions of Grenada and Panama, and the Gulf War.

==Family and early life==

Hamilton Stuyvesant Fish was born on December 7, 1888, in Garrison, New York to Hamilton Fish II and the former Emily Mann. Hamilton Fish II had been a Republican member of the New York Assembly and would later serve as Speaker of the Assembly and a United States Representative. Hamilton Fish, the paternal grandfather of this article&#x27;s subject, was United States Secretary of State under President Ulysses S. Grant.

In 1898, the young Fish&#x27;s cousin, also named Hamilton Fish and a volunteer in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders, was the first American soldier killed in action in the Spanish–American War. In his honor, Fish&#x27;s father legally changed his ten-year-old son&#x27;s name from &quot;Hamilton Stuyvesant Fish&quot; to just &quot;Hamilton Fish&quot;.

Fish is also related to the notorious serial killer and child molester, Albert Fish. Albert Fish’s first name was also Hamilton, until he changed it to Albert in his teens.

During his childhood, Hamilton Fish attended Chateau de Lancy near Geneva, which his father had also attended. The younger Fish learned French, played soccer, and spent summers with his family in Bavaria. He returned to the United States to attend the Fay School in Southborough, Massachusetts and St. Mark&#x27;s School, a preparatory school also in Southborough. In his memoirs, Fish described himself as a &quot;B student&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s but successful in several different sports.

Fish graduated from St. Mark&#x27;s in 1906 and attended Harvard College, where he graduated in the class of 1910. He was a member of the Porcellian Club and played tackle for Harvard&#x27;s football team. Standing and weighing , &quot;Ham&quot; Fish was highly successful as a football player; he was twice an All-America and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. He was the only Harvard man on Yale graduate Walter Camp&#x27;s all-time All-American team. After graduating, Fish continued his involvement in football. He donated $5,000.00 for several awards to Harvard football players and organized the Harvard Law School football team, which played exhibition games with other colleges around the country. During his time at Harvard, Fish became friends with Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the son of President Theodore Roosevelt.

In 1909, at 20, Fish graduated early from Harvard with a &quot;cum laude&quot; degree in history and government. He declined an offer to teach history at Harvard and instead attended Harvard Law School. He left law school before graduating, and took a job in a New York City insurance office.

===New York State Assembly (1914–16)===
Since Fish&#x27;s father had served as Assistant Treasurer of the United States in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, and Fish himself had befriended Roosevelt&#x27;s son at Harvard, he actively supported Roosevelt in the 1912 primaries against President William Howard Taft. Fish attended the 1912 Republican National Convention with his father and was dismayed when Taft was nominated despite popular support for Roosevelt. Fish joined Roosevelt in bolting the Republican Party and, with assistance from his father, he was appointed chair of the Putnam County Bull Moose Party. They campaigned for Roosevelt in the general election but, despite Roosevelt&#x27;s defeat, Fish remained a committed Progressive.

In 1913, Fish ran for Assembly against Republican county political boss John Yale, whom Fish later remembered as &quot;thoroughly corrupt.&quot; In a largely rural county facing challenges from industrialization and modernization, Fish&#x27;s message of limiting private influence in government without limiting the exercise of private liberties was popular. Yale ultimately withdrew from the Assembly race in favor of a political ally, whom Fish easily defeated running on an anti-corruption platform. As a progressive, Fish enjoyed the support of former President Roosevelt and a friendly relationship with Roosevelt&#x27;s distant cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a State Senator and resident of Hyde Park in neighboring Dutchess County. Before Fish&#x27;s election, Fish and Senator Roosevelt collaborated on a plan to establish direct primary elections in 1912. The two men would continue cordial relations for the next two decades; after Franklin left Albany to become Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he continued to assist Fish with patronage requests and securing federal contracts for his insurance firm, the John Paige Insurance Company.

As an Assemblyman for three terms, Fish championed progressive social and political reforms, including the reform of the New York state primary election system, a widow&#x27;s pension, penal reforms, and workmen&#x27;s compensation. With support from Theodore Roosevelt, Fish opposed a bill which would allow insurance companies to bypass the workmen&#x27;s compensation scheme to settle claims and attacked the Speaker of the Assembly, Thaddeus Sweet, for misuse of public funds and hiring political allies for no-show jobs. Though Fish never substantiated his allegations, he won public applause.

==Military service==

Prior to the United States entering the First World War, Fish was captain of Company K, 15th New York Infantry. When the 15th was mobilized for Federal service, Fish accepted an offer from Col. William Hayward to retain his position in the 369th Infantry (as the 15th New York was re-designated following mobilization). The 369th was a unit of African American enlisted men with white officers (and a few African American officers at the start of the war) which came to be known as the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters.&quot; The 369th Infantry was assigned to the 93d Division.

The summer after President Wilson&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany (in April 1917), Fish and about two thousand soldiers began training at Camp Whitman (in New York). In October 1917, the unit was ordered to Camp Wadsworth (in South Carolina) for further training. In November 1917, the regiment boarded the USS &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, destined for France, although shortly thereafter the ship returned to shore due to engine problems. After another aborted departure, the ship left on December 13, 1917. Despite colliding with another ship and not having a destroyer escort to protect against German submarines, the regiment reached France. (Fish complained to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt about the lack of an escort.)

Fish and his unit landed in Brest on December 26 and were placed under the control of the French army by U.S. General John J. Pershing. Altogether, the 369th Infantry spent 191 days on the front lines, the longest of any American regiment. It was also the first Allied regiment to reach the Rhine River. Fish received the Silver Star and the French War Cross 1914–1918. In addition, Fish and his sister Janet, who had been a nurse near the front lines, were both later inducted into the French Legion of Honor for their wartime service.

Fish was promoted to major on March 13, 1919. He returned to the United States on April 25 and was discharged on May 14. He continued as a member of the Organized Reserve Corps until 1948, and attained the rank of colonel.

Fish later credited his service with the 369th Infantry for his long support for civil rights in Congress. In 1922, 1937, and 1940, Fish joined with other Republicans and northern Democrats to pass anti-lynching bills, each of which was defeated in the Senate. During debate on the Military Appropriations Bill of 1941, Fish succeeded in adding an amendment to ban racial discrimination in the selection and training of military personnel, which was credited as an important step leading to desegregation of the military. Fish continued to advocate for the equal treatment of Black servicemen throughout World War II, remarking in 1944, &quot;Fourteen millions of loyal Americans have the right to expect that in a war for the advancement of the &#x27;Four Freedoms,&#x27; their sons be given the same right as any other American to train, to serve, and to fight in combat units in defense of the United States in this greatest war in its history.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives (1920–45)==
Fish represented the Hudson Valley in the U.S. House from November 2, 1920, until January 3, 1945, after he was defeated running for what would have been his thirteenth term in office.

In nearly 25 years as a Representative, Fish would become known as a strong anticommunist and eventually an acerbic critic of his former ally and constituent, President Franklin Roosevelt, and Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, although he privately supported Roosevelt in 1932 and urged his wife to vote for him. His unapologetic opposition to the New Deal provoked Roosevelt to include him with two other Capitol Hill opponents in a rollicking taunt that became a staple of Roosevelt&#x27;s 1940 re-election campaign: &quot;Martin, Barton and Fish.&quot;

Finally, in part under the influence of New York Governor Thomas Dewey, Fish&#x27;s congressional career ended when he won the Republican Party primary in his district but lost the general election in 1944.

===Early House career===
In 1919, Fish returned home to become a founding member of the new American Legion. He was named chair of the three-member committee which wrote the preamble to the Legion&#x27;s constitution and selected two other Roosevelt supporters as its other members. Though the three men collaborated on drafting, Fish later insisted he was primarily responsible for the preamble, which was a reflection of Rooseveltian nationalism. In November 1919, Fish attended the first American Legion convention in Minneapolis and backed the Roosevelt wing of the organization in its successful bid for control.

====1920 election====
After the American Legion convention, Fish returned to Garrison to plan his political future. He announced on April 15, 1920, that he would challenge incumbent United States Representative Edmund Platt in the Republican primary. Platt soon opted not to run for re-election and ultimately resigned in July to join the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Despite this, Fish faced a fight for the Republican nomination. Putnam County, his political base, was the smallest of the three counties in the district, and Republican organizations in the other counties endorsed their own candidates. Fish instead appealed directly to voters on a fourteen-point platform which blended progressive domestic policy, opposition to internationalism, and reactionary nativism, including &quot;restriction of immigration based on [a] character test&quot; and &quot;drastic action&quot; against &quot;Anarchists, I.W.Ws, Communists and ultra Socialists.&quot; Despite opposition from the party establishment, Fish enjoyed high name recognition from his and his father&#x27;s time in office and support from veterans, the state Federation of Labor, and Black voters. He won the primary handily despite losing Dutchess County by 4,000 votes and very easily defeated Rosslyn Cox, the mayor of Middletown, in the general election. After his victory, Fish received congratulations from Franklin Roosevelt, who had been defeated as the Democratic nominee for vice president in the concurrent 1920 election. Roosevelt wrote,

====Tomb of the Unknown Soldier====

Upon entering the House, the young Fish was the only veteran of World War I in Congress. On December 21, 1920, he introduced a resolution instituting Veterans Day as a national holiday. Fish also introduced House Resolution 67 of the 66th Congress, which provided for the internment of the remains of an unknown American soldier in a hallowed tomb to be constructed outside the Memorial Amphitheater in Arlington National Cemetery. Congress approved the resolution unanimously on March 4, 1921. The tomb, completed in 1937 with Fish&#x27;s input, came to be known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

===Fish Committee and opposition to Roosevelt===
Fish was a fervent anticommunist; in a 1931 article titled &quot;The Menace of Communism&quot;, he described communism as &quot;the most important, the most vital, the most far-reaching, and the most dangerous issue in the world&quot; and believed that there was extensive communist influence in the United States.

On May 5, 1930, he introduced House Resolution 180, which proposed to establish a committee to investigate communist activities in the United States; the resulting committee, commonly known as the Fish Committee, undertook extensive investigations of people and organizations suspected of being involved with or supporting communist activities in the United States. Among those who testified before the committee were Communist Party USA chair William Z. Foster and Roger Nash Baldwin, founder and director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

On January 17, 1931, the committee issued its final report, authored by Fish. Though Fish had earlier promised that the committee would request stronger immigration restrictions and deportation of communists, his report stated, &quot;the surest and most effective way of combatting communism in the United States is to give the fullest publicity to the fundamental principles and aims of the communist... as they are not likely to prove acceptable to any considerable number of American citizens, unless camouflaged by extraneous issues.&quot;

In 1933, Fish was on a committee that sponsored the publication in the United States of a translation of &quot;Communism in Germany&quot; by Adolf Ehrt, a Nazi propaganda book which claimed that Jews were responsible for communism in Germany and that only Adolf Hitler could stop it. In the prefatory note, the committee said it they did not publish it as a defense of anti-Semitism or the Nazi regime but because it believed that the struggle between Nazis and communists in Germany provided a lesson about using &quot;effective measures&quot; to defend against communism. Under pressure from American Jewish and liberal groups, Fish and the other committee members disavowed the book.

Fish&#x27;s opposition to communism and the Soviet Union led him to break with Franklin D. Roosevelt upon the President&#x27;s decision to extend diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union in 1933. Fish later called this decision &quot;the first clear indication of the arrogance that would come to typify Roosevelt&#x27;s administration.&quot; He also opposed the New Deal as &quot;starting us down the road to socialism and dictatorship.&quot;

===World War II===
As the ranking Republican member on the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs in the years leading up to World War II, Fish played the leading role in advocating against American involvement in the war and Roosevelt&#x27;s policy of economic aid to the Allies, especially the Soviet Union, and what Fish viewed as antagonism of Germany and Japan.

==== Involvement with Nazi Germany ====
A non-interventionist until after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Fish was among those in the U.S. Congress who went on record protesting the treatment of Jews in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Germany, but Germans touted him as friendly ally in Congress. Fish spoke from a stage decorated in swastikas at a German Day rally held at Madison Square Garden in 1938.

On August 14, 1939, Fish served as president of the United States delegation to the Interparliamentary Union Congress conference in Oslo, Norway, where he flew in the private plane of Joachim Ribbentrop. At the conference, Fish advocated better diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany and hoped to solve the &quot;Danzig question,&quot; where he believed that German claims were &quot;just.&quot; Fish and his faction of the Republican Party received material support from the Germans to promote isolationism and non-interventionism in the United States, particularly at the 1940 Republican National Convention.

Fish (and several others in Congress) became tools of the Nazi government in a plot designed to keep the US out of World War II. The German government wrote speeches that were delivered to congressional offices for members of Congress to give in the House and Senate. Once those speeches were made and published in the Congressional Record, German funds were used to print copies. Congressional mailing lists and &quot;franked&quot; envelopes were then used to mail the copies to hundreds of thousands of American homes and businesses. It was these actions that led to the trial of Fish&#x27;s staffer, George Hill.

==== 1940 election ====

In 1940, amid the early stages of World War II, the British Security Co-ordination agency focused a great deal of effort attempting to influence the United States government through front groups and influence. In 1940, British agents established and operated the Nonpartisan Committee to Defeat Hamilton Fish to &quot;put the fear of God into every isolationist senator and congressman.&quot; The committee raised substantial sums of money for Fish&#x27;s opponent, co-ordinated media attacks, created false charges of wrongdoing just before elections, and helped to distribute books that charged Fish with disloyalty. The committee as much as possible tried to make attacks on Fish appear to originate from his district, but historical documents indicate that most attacks originated outside of his district. Fish survived the attacks but won his election with less than half the margin of victory that he had earned two years earlier.

In 1940, just after the presidential election, Fish sent a telegram to Roosevelt which read: &quot;Congratulations. I pledge my support for national defense ... and to keep America out of foreign wars.&quot;

==== Trial of George Hill ====
In 1941, a judiciary panel investigating the activities of Nazi agents in the US, sent officers to the Washington headquarters of an anti-British organization, the Islands for War Debts Committee, to seize eight bags of franked congressional mail containing speeches by isolationist members of Congress. George Hill, Fish&#x27;s chief of staff, had the mail taken to Fish&#x27;s office storeroom just prior to their arrival.

A grand jury was convened and summoned Hill to explain why he had been so solicitous about the Islands for War Debts Committee&#x27;s mail and his close association with George Sylvester Viereck, a Nazi propaganda agent. (Viereck would later be convicted of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act and for having subsidized the Islands for War Debts Committee.) Hill said that he had not sent for the mail and did not know Viereck. The jury promptly indicted Hill for perjury.

Shortly after the indictment, Fish defended Hill claiming, &quot;George Hill is 100% O.K., and I&#x27;ll back George Hill to the limit on anything.&quot; During the trial, Hill had explained that Viereck visited Capitol Hill in 1940 and arranged for wholesale distribution of congressional speeches attacking the administration&#x27;s foreign policy. After hearing that a jury had reached its verdict and anticipating a conviction, Fish issued a statement: &quot;I am very sorry to learn that George Hill, a disabled, decorated veteran of the World War and a clerk in my office, has been convicted of perjury ... Mr. Hill is of English ancestry ... He had an obsession against our involvement in war.&quot; Twenty hours later, the jury convicted Hill. He was sentenced to 2 to 6 years in prison, which was reduced to 10 months to 3 years on appeal.

==== Pearl Harbor attack and call for war ====
On December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Fish made the first speech in Congress asking for a declaration of war against Japan. He volunteered for Army service, &quot;preferably with colored troops,&quot; to avenge the attack. At age 53, he did not have an opportunity to volunteer, and continued to serve in Congress.Fish later said he regretted his call for war and would not have made his speech had he been aware of Roosevelt&#x27;s policy toward Japan before the attack. He published &quot;FDR: The Other Side of the Coin&quot; in 1976, arguing that Roosevelt had deliberately provoked the Japanese and had advance knowledge of the attack. In his 1991 memoirs, Fish described himself as &quot;ashamed of his remarks&quot; in support of Roosevelt.

==== 1942 election ====
In the 1942 election, Fish, like other former isolationists, was considered vulnerable. The Orange and Putnam district, which Fish represented, had begun to turn against him. Polls predicted, incorrectly, that Fish would not even win the Republican primary. For the first time in his 22 years of political campaigning, he opened campaign headquarters. Soon thereafter, he was repudiated by the popular Republican gubernatorial candidate, Thomas Dewey. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, a persistent critic of Fish, termed him &quot;the Nation&#x27;s No. 1 isolationist.&quot; Less than two weeks before the 1942 election, Drew Pearson&#x27;s nationally syndicated column &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; described in detail how in 1939, Fish had received over $3,100 in cash from a source with German ties.

==== 1944 defeat ====
However, reapportionment, which took effect in 1944, fragmented what had been his 26th District. That year, he ran in the 29th District, which no longer included his home county of Putnam but included one county (Orange) from his previous district and three new counties. Augustus W. Bennet of Newburgh defeated Fish by approximately 5,000 votes. As &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported, &quot;In New York, to the nation&#x27;s delight, down went rabid anti-Roosevelt isolationist Hamilton Fish, after 24 years in Congress. His successor: liberal Augustus W. Bennet, Newburgh lawyer.&quot;

Fish said in his concession speech that his defeat &quot;should be largely credited to Communistic and Red forces from New York City backed by a large slush fund probably exceeding $250,000.&quot; In a farewell speech before the house on December 11, 1944, he stated, &quot;It took most of the New Deal Administration, half of Moscow, $400,000, and Governor Dewey to defeat me.&quot; Fish also stated, &quot;I particularly wanted to be elected to serve as chairman of the Rules Committee to stop the march toward communism and totalitarianism in America. I have no regrets whatever, as I waged the strongest possible fight that I knew how.&quot;

Embittered by his defeat, Fish promptly sued Robert F. Cutler, the executive secretary of the group Good Government Committee for libel, seeking $250,000 in damages for advertisements depicting Fish as a Nazi sympathizer. The ads also depicted Fish associating with the &quot;American Führer,&quot; Fritz Kuhn. He would later discontinue the lawsuit without a settlement.

==Later life==
Fish was one of the witnesses portrayed in the 1981 Warren Beatty film &quot;Reds&quot;, which depicts the life of journalist John Reed and his experiences during Russia&#x27;s 1917 October Revolution, which led to the creation of a communist state in Russia and the Soviet Union. As part of producing the film, the crew interviewed in the 1970s several individuals who had witnessed the events of 1917. The interviews were used throughout the film to describe places and events and to bridge transitions between the scenes.

Fish endorsed Conservative Party nominee James L. Buckley in the 1970 United States Senate election in New York.

In his 1991 memoirs, Fish would accuse the United Nations of being a means for Franklin Roosevelt to &quot;become president of the entire world.&quot; In addition, Fish would express support for NATO, United States invasions of Panama and Grenada, and the 1990 Gulf War, while criticizing the Vietnam War. Harshly critical of American support for France against Southeast Asian independence movements, Fish would describe John Foster Dulles as the “worst Secretary of State in American history.”

==Personal life==
Fish was married four times. His first marriage in 1921 to Grace Chapin Rogers (1885–1960), daughter of former mayor of Brooklyn Alfred C. Chapin (1848–1936), produced three children. Their son, Hamilton Fish IV, was a thirteen-term U.S. Representative from New York, holding office from 1969 to 1995. The Fishes&#x27; daughter Lillian Veronica Fish married David Whitmire Hearst, son of William Randolph Hearst.

In 1976, Hamilton Fish III married Alice Desmond, the widow of his long-time colleague Thomas Desmond. In 1980, Fish and Desmond created a library for the Garrison, NY community where the Fish family had family ties. Mrs. Fish gave the funds to establish the Alice Curtis Desmond and Hamilton Fish Library. The couple divorced in 1984.

Fish married his fourth and final wife, Lydia Ambrogio Fish, on September 9, 1988. They remained married until his death. She died in Port Jervis on January 12, 2015.

==Death and burial==
Fish died in Cold Spring, New York, on January 18, 1991. He was buried at Saint Philip&#x27;s Church Cemetery in Garrison, New York.

<doc id="195077" wikidata="Q782735" url="?curid=195077" title="Special Air Service Regiment">
<text>The Special Air Service Regiment, officially abbreviated SASR though commonly known as the SAS, is a special forces unit of the Australian Army. Formed in 1957 as a company, it was modelled on the British SAS with which it shares the motto, &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;. Expanded to a regiment in August 1964, it is based at Campbell Barracks, in Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, and is a direct command unit of the Special Operations Command.

The regiment first saw active service in Borneo in 1965 and 1966 during the Indonesian Confrontation, mainly conducting reconnaissance patrols, including secret cross-border operations into Indonesian territory. The regiment&#x27;s three squadrons were rotated through Vietnam, carrying out tasks included medium-range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long-range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory. They also served with US Army Special Forces, and conducted training missions. The SASR squadrons were highly successful, and were known to the Viet Cong as &quot;Ma Rung&quot; or &quot;phantoms of the jungle&quot; due to their stealth.

Following the Sydney Hilton bombing of February 1978, the regiment became responsible for developing a military counter-terrorism response force in August 1979, known as the Tactical Assault Group (TAG). SASR troops have also served in Somalia, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as many other peacekeeping missions. The SASR also provides a counter-terrorist capability, and has been involved in a number of domestic security operations. It has been alleged that some SASR personnel committed war crimes in Afghanistan.

==Role==
===Tasks and capabilities===
A direct command unit of Special Operations Command, the SASR &quot;is tasked to provide special-operations capabilities in support of the Australian Defence Force. This includes providing unique capabilities to support sensitive strategic operations, hostage rescue, advisory and training assistance, special reconnaissance, precision strike and direct action&quot;. The regiment is primarily structured to conduct covert, long range reconnaissance and surveillance in small teams in enemy-controlled territory (in contrast to Australian commandos, who usually conduct raids in larger groups). In addition to war-fighting in conventional conflicts, the SASR has also long maintained a specialist counter-terrorist capability. The regiment is also trained in counter-insurgency operations. Other capabilities include training local or indigenous forces, recovery of Australian citizens and humanitarian assistance.

===Warfighting and special reconnaissance===
In the long-range reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of between five and six operators with the task of infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable of covering long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.

===Counter-terrorism and hostage rescue===
One of the primary roles of the regiment is to provide a counter-terrorist capability, with an element of the SASR designated as the Tactical Assault Group (West) to respond to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations. TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal Police Tactical Groups. Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery.

A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role. The 2nd Commando Regiment provides Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.

==History==
===Early years===
The SASR draws on the experiences of Z Special Unit, M Special Unit, the Independent Companies and the Coastwatchers which operated in the South West Pacific Area against the Japanese during World War II. These units had been disbanded soon after the war as part of the demobilisation of the Australian military; however, after observing the operations of the British Special Air Service during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s the Australian Army decided to raise its own SAS unit. The 1st Special Air Service Company was established on 25 July 1957 at Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, with a strength of 16 officers and 144 other ranks.

In 1960, the company became part of the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) and was given the responsibility for commando and special forces operations. As part of the pentropic organisation adopted by the Australian Army at the time, the regiment&#x27;s primary wartime role was divisional-level reconnaissance. On 20 August 1964, the SAS gained regimental status and was expanded to two sabre squadrons and a headquarters, severing the link with the RAR. The raising of a third squadron was approved on 30 April 1965 as part of an overall expansion of the Australian Army.

===Borneo===

The SASR first saw action in 1965 as part of the British Commonwealth force stationed in North Borneo during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. The SASR troopers operated alongside their British and New Zealand counterparts in operations aimed at stopping Indonesian infiltration into Malaysia, taking part in Operation Claret. 1 Squadron conducted reconnaissance patrols in Sarawak from February to July 1965, and cross-border operations between May and July. They suffered their first fatality on 2 June when a soldier was gored by an elephant. 1 Squadron completed operations on 1 August and returned to Australia.

2 Squadron arrived in Borneo in January 1966 for a four-month deployment, and despite the suspension of Claret operations it also conducted reconnaissance patrols and cross-border operations, undertaking a total of 45 patrols on both sides of the border. On 19 March two soldiers drowned during a river crossing. On 21 July, 2 Squadron was relieved by a British SAS squadron and returned to Australia in August. Despite often being deployed in the reconnaissance role, the SASR killed at least 20 Indonesian soldiers in a series of ambushes and contacts. Three SASR soldiers were killed. These operations mostly occurred in secret, and were never admitted during the war.

===Vietnam===
Based in Nui Dat, the SASR was responsible for providing intelligence to both the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and US forces, operating throughout Phuoc Tuy Province as well as Bien Hoa, Long Khanh and Binh Tuy provinces. From 1966 SASR squadrons rotated through Vietnam on year-long deployments, with each of the three Sabre Squadrons completing two tours before the last squadron was withdrawn in 1971. Missions included medium range reconnaissance patrols, observation of enemy troop movements, and long range offensive operations and ambushing in enemy dominated territory.

Operating in small groups of four to six men they moved more slowly than conventional infantry through jungle or bushland and were heavily armed, employing a high rate of fire to simulate a larger force on contact and to support their withdrawal. The primary method of deployment was by helicopter, with the SASR working closely with No. 9 Squadron RAAF which regularly provided rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree top height. On occasion, SASR patrols were also deployed by M-113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) with a method devised to deceive the Viet Cong as to their insertion and the location of their drop-off point despite the noise they made moving through the jungle. An operational parachute jump was also undertaken.

A fourth squadron was raised in mid-1966, but was later disbanded in April 1967. The SASR operated closely with the New Zealand SAS, with a troop being attached to each Australian squadron from late 1968. Completing its final tour in October 1971, 2 Squadron was disbanded on return to Australia, with Training Squadron raised in its place. During its time in Vietnam the SASR proved highly successful, with members of the regiment known to the Viet Cong as &quot;Ma Rung&quot; or &quot;phantoms of the jungle&quot; due to their stealth.

In a six-year period the Australian and New Zealand SAS in Vietnam conducted nearly 1,200 patrols and inflicted heavy casualties on the Viet Cong, including 492 killed, 106 possibly killed, 47 wounded, 10 possibly wounded and 11 prisoners captured. Their own losses totalled one killed in action, one died of wounds, three accidentally killed, one missing and one death from illness. Twenty-eight men were wounded. During the period of its deployment 580 men served in the SASR in Vietnam. The remains of the last Australian soldier who went missing in action in 1969 after falling into the jungle during a suspended rope extraction were found in August 2008. Australian SASR personnel also worked with US Army Special Forces in Vietnam, and provided instructors to the MACV Recondo School, and then to the LRRP Training Wing at the AATTV-operated Van Kiep Training Centre from 1967. Some members of the regiment also served with MACV-SOG units, with soldiers often serving on exchange with American Special Forces.

===Defence of Australia and counter-terrorism===
The Australian withdrawal from Vietnam brought to an end the doctrine of &#x27;forward defence&#x27; through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military&#x27;s new focus was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR took the lead in developing the Australian Army&#x27;s capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR.

In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north Irian Jaya with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, as well as a number of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders.

Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was assigned the responsibility of developing a military counter-terrorism response force in August 1979 with the unit to be designated as the Tactical Assault Group (TAG). In July 1980 the TAG was also tasked with developing a maritime capability with an emphasis on offshore oil and gas rigs. Navy divers from the Clearance Diving Branch were tasked with assisting the TAG to develop the capability as the regiment did not have sufficient divers in the water troops at the time. There was initial animosity the first year between badged troopers and the clearance divers who after having completed five months of training had only five out of eighteen applicants selected.

In 1981, the divers completed a modified SASR selection course. Towards the end of 1981, 2 Squadron was re-raised due to war roles being impacted as a consequence of the large commitment by the regiment to establishing the TAG. In 1987, 1 Squadron who had been tasked with establishing the TAG was rotated with the now full strength 2 Squadron. In 1995, Navy clearance divers stopped supporting the TAG with many divers having passed the full SASR selection over the years.

In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.

===Peacekeeping===
The first SASR units to deploy on active service after the Vietnam War did so as part of Australian peacekeeping deployments. Small numbers of SASR personnel were involved in Operation Habitat in Turkey and Northern Iraq as medics to assist Kurdish refugees between May and June 1991. Personnel were also provided by the regiment as part of the Australian contribution to the UN Special Commission established to oversee the destruction of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction between 1991 and 2000. SASR medics deployed with some of the weapons inspection teams, and at times were also employed as drivers and for &quot;personal protection&quot; tasks.

Several SASR signallers from 152 Signal Squadron also deployed to the Western Sahara between September 1991 and May 1994 as part of the Australian contingent there. Contrary to some reports, the SASR did not provide a security team for service in Cambodia although some SASR-qualified signals sergeants from 152 Signal Squadron were deployed as part of the Australian military contribution to the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC) and Force Communications Unit between 1991 and 1993. A small number of members of the regiment served on exchange with the British SAS and Special Boat Service (SBS) in Bosnia in the early 1990s, including a sergeant who commanded an SBS detachment in April 1993.

In April 1994, a 10-man SASR team from J Troop was attached to Australian forces in Somalia to provide an elite response, VIP protection and force protection to the Australian Service Contingent in Mogadishu. Known as &quot;the Gerbils&quot;, the small team operated from Toyota Landcruisers and Datsun utility vehicles and two M-113 APCs. They were subsequently involved in a number of actions, including an incident on 21 May when they were flown to the scene of a downed Canadian civilian helicopter north of Mogadishu to protect the crew. On 16 August they were involved in a skirmish during a convoy which resulted in two Somalis being killed after one of them aimed an AK-47 at the Australians. They returned to Australia in November 1994.

In August 1994 SASR-qualified medical personnel were deployed as part of the contribution to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, some of whom were present during the Kibeho Massacre in April 1995, for which one SASR soldier and two other Australians were awarded the Medal for Gallantry for their actions. In addition, individual members of the SASR have been attached to a wide range of Australian peacekeeping deployments as observers, including in Kashmir, Lebanon and in the Sinai.

===Black Hawk accident===
Deaths during training accidents make up the majority of the SASR&#x27;s fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment&#x27;s history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two S-70-A9 Black Hawk helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at Fire Support Base Barbara in the High Range Training Area near Townsville, Queensland. This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place on the second day of the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use night vision goggles.

Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the landing zone, one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the tail rotor of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead. Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment died in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.

===Cambodia and Bougainville===
In July 1997 an eight-man SASR team deployed at short notice to Butterworth in Malaysia to provide close protection and communications to the Australian ambassador and embassy staff in Cambodia if required, in preparation for the evacuation of Australian nationals in the wake of civil unrest which occurred following a coup in that country. The evacuation operation was subsequently completed successfully, with RAAF C-130s supported by Airfield Defence Guards and other military personnel evacuating 455 Australians and other nationals from Cambodia as part of Operation Vista.

Following the agreement of a truce in October 1997 which ended the conflict in Bougainville, Australian personnel were deployed as part of the New Zealand-led Truce Monitoring Group, with an SASR officer being included in the reconnaissance party and later serving on its headquarters. In April 1998, Australia took over leadership of the mission, which was renamed the Peace Monitoring Group. Numerous SASR personnel served in Bougainville over a four-year period as part of Operation Bel Isi, both in headquarters positions and as part of the monitoring teams.

===Kuwait===
In 1998, the SASR made its first squadron-strength deployment since Vietnam when 1 Squadron, with an attached New Zealand SAS troop, was deployed to Kuwait in February as part of the American-led Operation Desert Thunder. The force, known as Anzac Special Operations Force (ANZAC SOF), was fully integrated, with the New Zealanders providing the squadron&#x27;s third troop. While the crisis was resolved peacefully, if military action had been taken the SASR would have been used in the combat search and rescue (CSAR) role to recover aircrew shot down by Iraqi air defences. The force returned to Australia in June 1998. Regardless, the operation represented the first time that SASR tactical headquarters had been deployed outside of Australia.

===East Timor===
The SASR played a key role in the Australian-led international peacekeeping force (INTERFET) in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry at the airport and seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET&#x27;s special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR).

The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from a Navy landing craft with vehicles into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after a clandestine reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site the previous night by Navy Clearance divers from HMAS &quot;Success&quot;.

It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.

It has been alleged that a member of the SASR killed a prisoner taken after a SASR and New Zealand SAS Response Force counterattack at Suai on 6 October 1999 after the militia earlier ambushed the SASR. After a lengthy investigation the SASR soldier was charged with mistreating two corpses of militia killed in the engagement, but the case collapsed after the New Zealand SAS soldiers who had reported the incident were not granted anonymity by an Australian Defence Force magistrate. The ABC has reported that the New Zealand Army was concerned about the safety of its soldiers. The Australian soldier received an apology from the Chief of Army for how long the investigation into him had taken.

===Domestic security and controversy===
The regiment formed a key element of the security force in place for the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, and in the lead-up to the event the regiment underwent a period of modernisation, acquiring new equipment and capabilities, including the ability to respond to chemical, biological and radiological threats, as well as developing techniques for the clandestine boarding of moving ships at night. During the Games two SASR squadrons were available for counter-terrorist operations, with one designated to respond to incidents in Sydney and Canberra, while the other was on standby for incidents elsewhere. Defence involvement in domestic security increased after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, and the unit has since formed part of the security force for a range of international sporting and political events held in Australia, including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Coolum, Queensland in March 2002, and the visit of US President George W. Bush to Canberra in October 2003. The SASR maintains TAG (West) to respond to incidents on the west coast of Australia. It also provided the training and use of their facilities to raise a second Tactical Assault Group in the 2nd Commando Regiment.

On 12 April 2001, an SASR troop conducted a boarding of the fishing vessel &quot;South Tomi&quot; using two rigid-hull inflatable boats launched from the South African Navy vessel SAS &quot;Protea&quot; in international waters south of Cape Agulhas, South Africa. On 29 March, the Togo registered &quot;South Tomi&quot; fled the AFMA fisheries patrol vessel &quot;Southern Supporter&quot; after being detected poaching Patagonian toothfish near Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean. The &quot;South Tomi&quot; fled towards Africa with the South African government agreeing to a request to provide a South African Navy vessel for an intercept. The SASR troop was flown on a commercial flight to South Africa. &quot;South Tomi&quot; was boarded after a pursuit of by the &quot;Southern Supporter&quot;.

In August 2001, the SASR was involved in the Tampa affair when its counter-terrorist squadron was ordered to Christmas Island and to board the MV &quot;Tampa&quot; once it illegally entered Australian waters. While the members of the SASR involved did what they could to improve conditions on the &quot;Tampa&quot;, the use of an elite military unit to prevent asylum seekers landing in Australia was not supported by all members of the regiment and remains controversial. Less controversial was the SASR&#x27;s involvement in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV &quot;Pong Su&quot;—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003 .

===Afghanistan===
In October 2001, the Australian government announced that it was sending a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron to participate in the campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan designated Operation Slipper. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals. The SASR&#x27;s main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and Taliban positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations. After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with US Marines from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around Kandahar and into the Helmand Valley near the Iranian-border. On 16 February 2002 Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a land mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident. Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.

The SASR then moved to eastern Afghanistan where it played a key role in Operation Anaconda in March 2002. During the operation SASR teams were to provide on-location, in-depth operational intelligence and reconnaissance after they infiltrated the Shahi-Kot Valley ten days prior to the operation, and also saved the lives of 24 soldiers of the US 75th Ranger Regiment after their helicopter was shot down, by providing sniper overwatch and guiding in precise air strikes to end the enemy advance as they attempted to overrun the isolated Americans. Up to 300 al Qaeda fighters were later estimated to have been killed as a result of the airstrikes they called-in. Two SASR advisory and liaison officers were attached with the US 10th Mountain Division to help plan the division&#x27;s air assault operations, and were subsequently involved in heavy fighting after the unit they were with became pinned down and took a number of casualties. Supported by heavy close air support they were evacuated by helicopter that evening.

Four days into the operation, SASR elements identified a potential escape route for the al-Qaeda leadership. Other coalition special forces had attempted to establish observation posts, but had quickly been discovered by shepherds or villagers. The Australians inserted a patrol undetected to monitor the escape route. From more than high on a mountain, the patrol spotted a group of al-Qaeda figures dressed in Russian camouflage and wearing black balaclavas. They carried more advanced weapons than normal insurgents, and appeared to be guarding a white-robed older man with a cane as they fled the battlefield. US intelligence at first believed it was Osama bin Laden but later revised the identification to his second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. An airstrike was called in; however, there was later doubt about whether it was successful. Australian forces later uncovered a number of arms caches and destroyed an anti-aircraft piece, while other elements were tasked with screening possible escape routes to the south and killed a number of fighters as they attempted to withdraw. The initial task group was replaced by another squadron in March and April 2002, while a third squadron rotated into Afghanistan in August 2002. The SASR withdrew from Afghanistan in November 2002 after all three sabre squadrons had served in the country.

A Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was deployed to Afghanistan in August or September 2005, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG consisted of elements from the SASR, 4 RAR (Commando), the Incident Response Regiment (IRR) and logistic support personnel. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were deployed to Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. This task group was withdrawn in September 2006, after a year of operations working closely with special forces from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days, involved in 139 contacts, and sustained 11 soldiers wounded. The SFTG was replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry.

A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was redeployed to Afghanistan to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including an SASR squadron, commando company group, and an integral combat service support team. The commando element was mostly used to conduct direct action tasks, with the SASR returning to conducting strategic reconnaissance. On 16 January 2009, Trooper Mark Donaldson was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia, the highest award for gallantry in the Australian honours system, for gallant acts performed whilst serving with the SASR in Afghanistan on 2 September 2008 when his patrol was ambushed, resulting in the wounding of nine Australians. In addition to the SASR&#x27;s contribution to the SOTG, the regiment also provided &quot;Defence Support Teams&quot; to protect Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) agents in Afghanistan.

On 23 January 2011, Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for single-handedly neutralising two machine-gun positions during an operation in Tizak on 11 June 2010. On 26 March 2013, it was announced that Special Operations Command would receive the Australian Army&#x27;s first battle honour since the end of the Vietnam War for outstanding performance during the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in Afghanistan from May to June 2010. The battle honour, titled &quot;Eastern Shah Wali Kot&quot;, was awarded in recognition of the operational actions of the SASR and 2nd Commando Regiment from the Australian Special Operations Task Group Rotation XII. The SASR has also been collectively awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation and Unit Citation for Gallantry for its actions in Afghanistan.

The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of the Australian drawdown, although some special forces remain as part of the small Australian force in the country. SASR casualties in Afghanistan include five soldiers killed in action.

On 26 October 2018, a SASR dog, Kuga, was posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal for bravery on a patrol on 26 August 2011 in the Khas Uruzgan district in which he was shot five times attacking an insurgent positioned to ambush the patrol.

====Alleged war crimes====
During an operation in April 2013, an SASR corporal cut the right hands from the corpses of three insurgents after being told by a military lawyer that this would be an acceptable way of obtaining fingerprints. After this incident was reported to the senior Australian command at Tarin Kowt, the SOTG was withdrawn from operations for a week-long &quot;operational pause&quot;. One soldier remained under investigation for this incident in August 2015, but was later cleared of all charges.

In 2018, it was reported that a small number of SASR personnel were being investigated for possibly committing war crimes in Afghanistan. The allegations include the murder of a detainee in September 2012. Major General Jeff Sengelman, the head of Special Operations Command, was also reported to have issued a memo in 2015 which expressed concern over standards of leadership and accountability within the Regiment, and invited troopers to write to him about any concerns. Sengelman regarded the SASR as having the worst disciplinary record of any unit in the Army. A 2015 report by the former head of ASIO David Irvine judged that the regiment was dysfunctional and affected by &quot;arrogance, elitism and a sense of entitlement&quot;.

In 2020, further allegations arose of cover-ups and the deliberate killing of non-combatants. An inquiry by the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force was expected to report to the Chief of the ADF later that year.

In November 2020, an investigation by Justice Paul Brereton into allegations of war crimes found that SAS troops had been involved in the murder of 39 Afghan civilians, with prisoners being killed to &quot;blood&quot; new troops, and weapons and radios planted to disguise the crimes. None of the killings were &quot;in the heat of battle&quot;. The &quot;Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force Afghanistan Inquiry Report&quot; was published in November 2020. The report stated that some of the incidents the inquiry uncovered constituted &quot;possibly the most disgraceful episode in Australia&#x27;s military history, and the commanders at troop, squadron and task group level bear moral command responsibility for what happened under their command, regardless of personal fault&quot;, though no information on these incidents was published on legal grounds. 36 incidents have been referred to the Australian Federal Police for prosecution, and the 2nd squadron will be disbanded in the wake of the findings and be replaced with a new sub-unit. The Chief of the ADF considered disbanding the SASR as a whole, but decided to pursue improvements to its culture instead.

In June 2023, a Federal Court judge found as part of a defamation action Roberts-Smith had initiated that it was &quot;substantially true&quot; he had killed a prisoner in Afghanistan during 2009 and ordered other SASR soldiers to kill two prisoners during 2009 and 2012. Several SASR soldiers who testified to support elements of Roberts-Smith&#x27;s evidence were found to have not been reliable witnesses.

===Iraq===

The SASR provided the majority of the ground-force element of the Australian contribution to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, known as Operation Falconer, moving in quickly and successfully, thus enhancing Australia&#x27;s standing amongst its allies. The Australian Special Forces Task Group was built around 1 Squadron, with a platoon from the 4 RAR (Commando) and a troop from the IRR available to support the SASR. 1 Squadron operated in Western Iraq as part of Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West (CJSOTF-West) where it was successful in securing its area of operations. B and C Troops of the SAS Squadron crossed the Iraqi border from Jordan on the night of 19 March by vehicle, penetrating before engaging in one of the first actions of the war. A Troop was inserted by U.S. Army MH-47E helicopters with their vehicles over from the staging base in Jordan. A Troop patrols were the closest coalition elements to Baghdad for a number of days, observing key roads and facilities. The Troops fought a number of actions over the following month including a raid on a radio relay station, while later they conducted highway interdiction tasks. Towards the conclusion of the 42-day campaign the SAS secured the huge but undefended Al Asad air base, approximately west of Baghdad, capturing more than 50 air force fighter jets and helicopters with a large number inoperable, and repaired the runway that had been damaged by air strikes. 1 Squadron was withdrawn from Iraq without replacement shortly after the end of the war, and was subsequently awarded a Unit Citation for Gallantry.

Yet some members of the SASR continued to operate in Iraq over the next few years in a number of roles. In 2004 claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter-insurgency operations inside Iraq, although this was denied by the government. An SASR team was deployed to Iraq in May and June 2005 as part the effort to free Douglas Wood, an Australian engineer kidnapped in Baghdad; however, he was later recovered alive by US and Iraqi forces. In 2007, British media reports suggested that SASR elements were still operating in Iraq, along the southern border with Iran, targeting arms smugglers. Later, a small number of SASR personnel were deployed to Iraq in June 2014 to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, while others were reported to have been tasked with providing security to Royal Australian Air Force aircrew aboard transport aircraft delivering arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq during September 2014.

===Timor Leste, the Philippines and Fiji===
An SASR troop was deployed to Timor Leste in May 2006 as part of Operation Astute, operating alongside a Commando Company Group as part of the Special Forces Component following renewed unrest there. On 4 March 2007, along with the commandos, SASR personnel took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. It was reported in October 2006 that 20 SASR operators were in the southern Philippines, supporting Filipino operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah terrorist groups, but this was denied by the Department of Defence. Meanwhile, following tensions in Fiji between the military and the government the Australian Government dispatched three naval vessels in November and December 2006 as part of Operation Quickstep, in preparation for a potential evacuation of Australian citizens. On 29 November 2006, a Black Hawk helicopter from the 171st Aviation Squadron carrying four crew and six soldiers from the SASR crashed while attempting to land on HMAS &quot;Kanimbla&quot; and sank in international waters off Fiji. The helicopter&#x27;s pilot and a soldier from SASR were killed in the crash.

===Africa and special recovery planning===
In March 2012, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that the fourth sabre squadron had been reraised in 2005 and that for many years it had been carrying out special recovery planning, gathering intelligence in Africa, specifically Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Kenya, to develop plans in case Australian civilians needed to be rescued from a hostile environment. The Squadron was reported to be working closely with the Swan Island based ASIS. Concerns within the SASR were reported that they would not be afforded legal protection the same as ASIS operatives if exposed and that there was no contingencies plans if they were detained. Professor Hugh White from the Australian National University was quoted as saying that, as soldiers, they would not have the legal cover ASIS would have if caught. The newspaper also reported that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd had argued for squadron to be used in Libya during the civil war, but was overruled by the Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, and the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley. The operations were not confirmed by the Minister for Defence. While, Rudd said the Libya claims were a &quot;total, absolute, fabrication&quot;. However, it has been reported that the SASR has conducted intelligence gathering expeditions overseas since the late 1980s, during which a select few personnel have travelled for months at a time, with the first in Asia being to Laos, Cambodia and Burma.

==Organisation==
The strength of the SASR is over 700 personnel. Based at Campbell Barracks, it is a battalion-sized element and is known to be made up of a regimental headquarters, three sabre squadrons, an operational support squadron, a specialist support squadron, and a signals squadron. In 2002 it was reported that two sabre squadrons (designated as contingency squadrons) were assigned to maintain the regiment&#x27;s warfighting capability and that the third sabre squadron was designated as the Tactical Assault Group, with squadrons rotating through the two roles. In 2015, the existence of a fourth sabre squadron was acknowledged. In 2021 the seniority of the commander of the SASR was increased from a lieutenant colonel to a full colonel.

The regiment is currently believed to be organised as follows:
* Regimental headquarters
** 1 Squadron
** 2 Squadron
** 3 Squadron
** 4 Squadron
** Specialist Support Squadron
** Operational Support Squadron
** 152 Signal Squadron

Each sabre squadron is approximately 90-strong, and is divided into three troops (Water Troop, Free-Fall Troop and Vehicle Mounted Troop). A troop comprises four patrols with five or six operators in each patrol, and is commanded by a captain with each patrol commanded by a sergeant. For surveillance operations the SASR usually operates in patrols; however, for CT operations it usually employs larger force elements. Support personnel include signallers, mechanics and technicians, medical staff, storemen, drivers, caterers and various specialists. It was reported in 2012 that six female soldiers were being trained in the United States. As of 2003, 152 Signal Squadron comprised four troops. Military dogs, designated Special Operations Military Working Dog (SOMWD), have been members of the SASR since 2005, seeing service in Afghanistan and have their own memorial.

While the SASR is a regular army unit, it also has a pool of Army Reserve personnel. These soldiers are former regular Army members of the SASR or specialists.

Following the release of the Brereton Report into war crimes in Afghanistan, the Chief of the Defence Force General Angus Campbell announced in 2020 that 2 Squadron would be struck from the Army&#x27;s order of battle due to its association with war crimes, and that over time the regiment would re-raise a differently titled squadron. The ceremony to disband the squadron scheduled to take place in September 2021 was cancelled by the then Minister for Defence Peter Dutton.

==Uniform and equipment==
The standard dress of the regiment is the new Multicam-design camouflage which became standard issue to special forces troops in 2012, and is now being introduced to all other Australian Army soldiers in Afghanistan and will eventually become the standard Operational Combat Uniform (OCU). Although SASR parade, working and field uniforms are generally the same as those used by the rest of the Australian Army, special uniforms—including black coveralls—are used depending on the tactical situation. Qualified SASR members wear a sandy-coloured beret with a metal, gold and silver badge, depicting the sword Excalibur, with flames issuing upwards from below the hilt, with a scroll across the front of blade inscribed with the regimental motto &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, on a black shield. This differs from the British Special Air Service, which wears a woven cloth cap badge of the same design. SAS &#x27;Ibis&#x27;-style parachute wings (rounded at the bottom and straight on top) are worn on the right shoulder on general duty, ceremonial and mess dress uniforms only. A garter blue lanyard is worn. Members of the regiment often dispense with rank, use first names, and wear long hair and beards on operations or when in the field.

Soldiers are armed with a variety of weapons systems depending on what the mission dictates. These include the M4A1 carbine (designated as the M4A5 in Australia), which is used as their primary weapon. The shortened version of the M4, known as the Mk 18 CQBR, is also used. The SIG-Sauer MCX is used in counter-terrorist and specialist roles, largely replacing the legacy MP5. Primary weapons are complemented with the two issued sidearms, the USP Tactical and the Glock 19. For medium to long range engagements the Heckler &amp; Koch HK417, SR-25 marksman rifle, and Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle are also used. Support weapons used include the Mk48 Maximi Modular, MAG 58 and the Para Minimi. Sniper rifles used have included the SR-98, Blaser Tactical 2, and Barrett M82A2. The regiment also uses a number of direct and indirect fire support weapons including 66 mm M72 rockets, 84 mm M3 MAAWS, FGM-148 Javelins, M2-QCB Browning .50 calibre machine guns, Mk 47 Striker grenade launchers, and mortars. Flash bang devices and fragmentation grenades are also used depending on the tactical situation, including the thermobaric Mk 14 Anti-Structure Munition (ASM-HG) which has reportedly been used in Afghanistan.

A range of different vehicles are used, including the Supacat High Mobility Transporter (HMT) Extenda with 31 purchased in 2007 designated the Special Operations Vehicle – Special Reconnaissance (SOV-SR), named &quot;Nary&quot; after a SASR warrant officer killed during pre-deployment training in 2005. The first Nary was delivered in 2008 but due to technical problems the vehicles did not enter service until 2011, replacing the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) which had seen extensive service in Afghanistan and Iraq. New SOV-Logistics trucks are being acquired to replace the Mercedes-Benz Unimog for supply, support and recovery of the SOV-SR. A lighter, less protected vehicle, more akin to the LRPV—the Polaris Defense DAGOR (Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road)—was being trialled in 2015. Motorcycles are also used for long range strategic reconnaissance seeing service in Afghanistan. Polaris six-wheel all-terrain vehicles are also used, seeing service in Afghanistan. Heavily modified up-armoured Toyota Land Cruiser four wheel drive vehicles designated SOV-Support are used for domestic counter-terrorism and special recovery. The USMI 11m Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat designated Air Drop Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (ADRHIB) is used for domestic counter-terrorism and special recovery. The Divex Shadow rebreather is used in diving operations.

==Selection and training==
The SASR has high personnel standards, and selection into the regiment is considered the most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected for their ability to work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual&#x27;s strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16-month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary &quot;SAS: The Search for Warriors&quot; was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary &quot;Battle for the Golden Road&quot;, had also been produced on the course.

The Review of Special Operations Command report in June 2020 by David Irvine recommended that SOCOMD introduce a joint selection course conducted by the Defence Special Operations Training and Education Centre for the regiment and the 2nd Commando Regiment rather than the units conduct their own individual selection courses. In 2024, the first joint selection course for the three SOCOMD combat units the SASR, 2nd Commando Regiment and the Reserve 1st Commando Regiment was held in Western Australia.

All members of the SASR are parachute qualified, and each member of a patrol has at least one specialisation, including medic, signaller, explosive expert or linguist. Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and building clearance. This training is conducted in a range of advanced facilities, including electronic indoor and outdoor CQB ranges, outdoor sniper range, and urban training facilities at Swanbourne. Additional facilities include a special urban complex, vertical plunging range, method of entry house, and simulated oil rig and aircraft mock-ups in order to provide realistic training environments for potential operational scenarios. Free-Fall training includes High Altitude Parachute Operations (HAPO) either High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) conducted at a maximum of . SASR personnel also provide training in weapons handling to ASIS operatives at Swan Island in Victoria. Despite a possible reduction in rank, SASR operators receive significant allowances, which make them among the highest-paid soldiers in the Australian Defence Force, with a trooper (equivalent to a private) reportedly earning about $100,000 per annum in 2006.

The SASR maintains close links with special forces from the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, regularly participating in joint exercises and individual personnel exchange programs with the British Special Air Service and Special Boat Service, Canada&#x27;s Joint Task Force 2, the New Zealand Special Air Service and the United States Navy SEALs, SEAL Team Six, U.S. Army Special Forces and Delta Force. The regiment also regularly conducts exercises with and trains soldiers from South East Asian nations, and participates in exercises with regional special forces. From 1992 this has included close links with the Indonesian Kopassus, a relationship which has at times been politically controversial. Since its formation the SASR has lost more men in training than in combat, due to the nature of the training regime. In 2014, the regiment celebrated its 50th anniversary. During this period 48 soldiers have been killed during operations or in training accidents, while another 20 died in &quot;other circumstances&quot;. More than 200 have been wounded. The names of those killed are recorded on a plaque on a memorial made of a large piece of granite outside the SASR headquarters at Campbell Barracks, known as &quot;The Rock&quot;.

<text>Marcelle Ferron (January 29, 1924 – November 19, 2001) was a Canadian painter and stained glass artist, was one of the original 16 signatories of Paul-Émile Borduas&#x27;s Refus global manifesto, and a major figure in the Quebec contemporary art scene, associated with the Automatistes.

==Early years==
Ferron was born in Louiseville, Quebec on January 29, 1924. Her brother Jacques Ferron and her sister Madeleine Ferron were both writers. She studied at the École des beaux-arts de Québec before dropping out, unsatisfied with the way the school&#x27;s instructors addressed modern art.

Ferron was an early member of Paul-Émile Borduas&#x27;s &quot;Automatistes&quot; art movement. She signed the manifesto Refus global, a watershed event in the Quebec cultural scene, in 1948.

==Work==
In 1953, she moved to Paris, where she worked for 13 years in drawing and painting and was introduced to the art of stained glass, for which she would become best known. She was particularly inspired by the work of French glass artist, Michel Blum and his innovations. Ferron returned in 1966 to Quebec, where she worked exclusively with stained glass for the next two decades.

One of her stained-glass windows is at Champ-de-Mars metro station in Montreal, Quebec. It was one of the first non-figurative works to be installed in the metro, in defiance of the didactic style present in other works of the period, and signalled a major shift in public art in Montreal between the policies of then art director Robert Lapalme and future art director and fellow &quot;automatiste&quot; Jean-Paul Mousseau. Other examples of her works can be seen at Vendôme metro station, Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine, and the ICAO headquarters, in Montreal; the Place du Portage in Gatineau, Quebec; and the Granby, Quebec courthouse.

==Awards and honours==
At the VI Bienal (1961) in São Paulo, Brazil, she represented Canada along with Ron Bloore, Alex Colville, Gordon Smith and Harold Town and won the silver medal, making her the first Québécoise to receive such an international recognition.
In 1983, she was awarded the Paul-Émile-Borduas prize for the visual arts by the government of Quebec. In 1985, she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 2000. She also was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

==Death==
She died in Montreal, Quebec, on November 19, 2001.

==Legacy==
A nursing home in Brossard, Quebec, the Centre d&#x27;Accueil Marcelle-Ferron, is named after her. On 7 September 2019, Google honoured Ferron with a “google doodle” to mark the anniversary of the unveiling of her installation in Montreal&#x27;s Vendôme station.

<doc id="195083" wikidata="Q584238" url="?curid=195083" title="BACH motif">
<text>In music, the BACH motif is the motif, a succession of notes important or characteristic to a piece, &quot;B flat, A, C, B natural&quot;. In German musical nomenclature, in which the note &quot;B natural&quot; is named &quot;H&quot; and the &quot;B flat&quot; named &quot;B&quot;, it forms Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s family name. One of the most frequently occurring examples of a musical cryptogram, the motif has been used by countless composers, especially after the Bach Revival in the first half of the 19th century.

==Origin==
Johann Gottfried Walther&#x27;s &quot;Musicalisches Lexikon&quot; (1732) contains the only biographical sketch of Johann Sebastian Bach published during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. There the motif is mentioned thus:This reference work thus indicates Bach as the inventor of the motif.

==Usage in compositions==
In a comprehensive study published in the catalogue for the 1985 exhibition &quot;300 Jahre Johann Sebastian Bach&quot; (&quot;300 years of Johann Sebastian Bach&quot;) in Stuttgart, Germany, Ulrich Prinz lists 409 works by 330 composers from the 17th to the 20th century using the BACH motif. A similar list is available in Malcolm Boyd&#x27;s volume on Bach: it also contains some 400 works.

===Johann Sebastian Bach===
Johann Sebastian Bach used the motif in a number of works, most famously as a fugue subject in the last &quot;Contrapunctus&quot; of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;. The motif also appears in other pieces. Later commentators wrote: &quot;The figure occurs so often in Bach&#x27;s bass lines that it cannot have been accidental.&quot;

Instances of B–A–C–H appearing in Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s compositions and arrangements:
* Fugue from his BWV 898
* Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, BWV 1047 (the continuo part at bar 109)
* Gigue from his English Suite No. 6 for keyboard
* The subject of the &quot;Sinfonia in F minor&quot; BWV 795 &quot;incorporates&quot; a version of the motif. This five-note version appears transposed: a&#x27;–g&#x27; (rest) g&#x27;–b&#x27;–a&#x27;. Eventually, in measure 17, the piece makes its way to a passage in which the five-note version of the motif starts on B: as B–A–(rest)–A–C–H.
* His arrangement of a motet for SSATB singers
* Near the end of the Augmentation Canon of Bach&#x27;s Canonic Variations on &quot;Vom Himmel hoch da komm&#x27; ich her&quot;, BWV 769:

* Near the end of Contrapunctus IV of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;:

* As first four notes of the third and last subject of the final unfinished fugue of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;:
Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht goes as far as to reconstruct Bach&#x27;s putative intentions as an expression of Lutheran thought, imagining Bach to be saying, &quot;I am identified with the tonic and it is my desire to reach it ... Like you I am human. I am in need of salvation; I am certain in the hope of salvation, and have been saved by grace,&quot; through his use of the motif rather than a standard changing tone figure (B–A–C–B) in the final measures of the fourth fugue of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;.

===Other composers===

The motif was used as a fugue subject by Bach&#x27;s son Johann Christian, and by his pupil Johann Ludwig Krebs. It also appears in a work by Georg Philipp Telemann.

The motif&#x27;s wide popularity came only after the start of the Bach Revival in the first half of the 19th century. A few mid-19th century works that feature the motif prominently are:
*1845 – Robert Schumann: &quot;Sechs Fugen über den Namen: Bach&quot;, for organ, pedal piano, or harmonium, Op. 60
*1855 – Franz Liszt: &quot;Fantasy and Fugue on the Theme B-A-C-H&quot;, for organ (later revised, 1870, and arranged, 1871, for piano) 
*1856 – Johannes Brahms: &quot;Fugue in A-flat minor for organ&quot;, WoO 8
*1878 – Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov – 
Composers found that the motif could be easily incorporated not only into the advanced harmonic writing of the 19th century, but also into the totally chromatic idiom of the Second Viennese School; so it was used by Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and their disciples and followers. A few 20th-century works that feature the motif prominently are:
*1926–28 – Arnold Schoenberg: &quot;Variations for Orchestra&quot;, Op. 31
*1937–38 – Anton Webern: String Quartet (the tone row is based on the BACH motif)
*1942 – Charles Koechlin: Offrande musicale sur le nom de Bach, Op.187
* 1951–55 – Luigi Dallapiccola:
** 1951–55: &quot;Canti di liberazione&quot;
** 1952: &quot;Quaderno musicale di Annalibera&quot; for piano 
** 1954: &quot;Variazioni&quot; (&quot;Variations&quot; 1942, orchestral version of &quot;Quaderno musicale di Annalibera&quot;)
*1966 – Krzysztof Penderecki: &quot;St Luke Passion&quot;
* 1968–81 – Alfred Schnittke:
**1968:
*** &quot;The Glass Harmonica&quot; soundtrack (repeated motif)
*** &quot;Quasi Una Sonata&quot; (repeated motif borrowed from &quot;The Glass Harmonica&quot;, one reviewer, &quot;noting that B–A–C–H is the victor of the composition&quot;)
**1981: Symphony No. 3 – used alongside the monograms of several other composers.
* 1971–2000 – Bertold Hummel:
**1971: &quot;Metamorphoses on B-A-C-H for Organ and winds op. 40&quot;
**2000: &quot;Aphorisms on B-A-C-H for Percussion solo and Strings, op. 105&quot;
*1974 – Jon Lord and Eberhard Schoener: &quot;Continuo On B.A.C.H.&quot; on the album &quot;Windows&quot;
*1992 – Ron Nelson: &quot;Passacaglia (Homage on B–A–C–H)&quot; for wind ensemble

In the 21st century, composers continue writing works using the motif, frequently in homage to Johann Sebastian Bach.

<doc id="195084" wikidata="Q696310" url="?curid=195084" title="Hamtaro">
<text>Hamtaro, known in Japan as , is a Japanese manga and storybook series created and illustrated by Ritsuko Kawai about a hamster. The manga was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Shōgaku Ninensei&quot; (&quot;Second Grade&quot;) magazine in April 1997; more &quot;Hamtaro&quot; stories would later be added into the other grade-level magazines, as well as in &quot;Ciao&quot;. The series focuses on a hamster named Hamtaro, who has a variety of adventures with other hamsters known as the &quot;Ham-Hams&quot; (&quot;Hamuchans&quot; in the Japanese version). Viz Media published the manga adaptations and storybooks in English.

Multiple anime adaptations were produced by TMS Entertainment and aired on TV Tokyo. The first series was dubbed in English by The Ocean Group.

== Plot ==
The series revolves around a hamster named Hamtaro, who is owned by a 10-year-old girl named Laura Haruna (Hiroko Haruna in the Japanese/Original version). Curious by nature, he ventures out each day to make friends and go on adventures with a clan of fellow hamster friends known as The Ham-Hams. The Ham-Hams meet at a special clubhouse built by Boss (&quot;Taisho&quot;).

== Media ==
=== Manga ===
There are three manga about Hamtaro, &quot;A Home for Hamtaro&quot;, &quot;Hamtaro Gets Lost&quot;, and &quot;Jealous Hamtaro&quot;. In the first two, Hamtaro&#x27;s owner is named Yukari while in the latter, her name is Amy.

=== Anime ===
In Japan, &quot;Hamtaro&quot; aired three anime series, released four films, several specials, many video game/DVD releases, and merchandise. By 2002, the franchise had generated $2.5 billion in merchandise sales. The success was not paralleled in the United States, however, with only the first series, some special episodes, three video games (though two others were released in Europe), and limited merchandise. On 23 February 2011, it was announced that &quot;Hamtaro&quot; would be receiving a series titled &quot;Trotting Hamtaro Dechu!&quot;.

=== Games ===
The Hamtaro franchise has multiple video game titles with independent storylines. These titles include adventure and educational games that can be found for PC, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance (GBA), and the Nintendo DS consoles.

== In popular culture ==
On 26 July 2020, a group of more than 2,000 protesters in Bangkok called the Free Youth Movement led a protest against the government of Thailand which involved singing the theme song for &quot;Hamtaro&quot; with modified lyrics to say &quot;The most delicious food is taxpayers&#x27; money. [...]Dissolve the parliament! Dissolve the parliament! Dissolve the parliament!&quot; Other student protests during the same week continued to use Hamtaro as a symbol for the government&#x27;s &quot;feasting on taxpayer&#x27;s money,&quot; and have involved groups running in circles, as if in hamster wheels, while singing the modified version of the jingle.

<doc id="195086" wikidata="Q182658" url="?curid=195086" title="Harper Lee">
<text>Nelle Harper Lee (April 28, 1926 – February 19, 2016) was an American novelist whose 1960 novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize and became a classic of modern American literature. She assisted her close friend Truman Capote in his research for the book &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1966). Her second and final novel, &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, was an earlier draft of &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, set at a later date, that was published in July 2015 as a sequel.

The plot and characters of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; are loosely based on Lee&#x27;s observations of her family and neighbours in Monroeville, Alabama, as well as a childhood event that occurred near her hometown in 1936. The novel deals with racist attitudes and the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s as depicted through the eyes of two children.

Lee received numerous accolades and honorary degrees, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007, which was awarded for her contribution to literature.

==Early life==
Nelle Harper Lee was born on April 28, 1926, in Monroeville, Alabama, the youngest of four children of Frances Cunningham (née Finch) and Amasa Coleman Lee. Her parents chose her middle name, Harper, to honor pediatrician Dr. William W. Harper, of Selma, who had saved the life of her sister Louise. Her first name, Nelle, was her grandmother&#x27;s name spelled backwards and the name she used, whereas Harper Lee was primarily her pen name. Lee&#x27;s mother was a homemaker; her father was a former newspaper editor, businessman, and lawyer, who also served in the Alabama State Legislature from 1926 to 1938. Through her father, she was related to Confederate General Robert E. Lee and a member of the prominent Lee family. Before A. C. Lee became a title lawyer, he once defended two black men accused of murdering a white storekeeper. Both clients, a father and son, were hanged. 

Lee&#x27;s three siblings were Alice Finch Lee (1911–2014), Louise Lee Conner (1916–2009), and Edwin Lee (1920–1951). Although Nelle remained in contact with her significantly older sisters throughout their lives, only her brother was close enough in age to play with, though she bonded with Truman Capote (1924–1984), who visited family in Monroeville during the summers from 1928 until 1934.

While enrolled at Monroe County High School, Lee developed an interest in English literature, in part through her teacher Gladys Watson, who became her mentor. After graduating high school in 1944, like her eldest sister Alice Finch Lee, Nelle attended the then all-female Huntingdon College in Montgomery for a year, then transferred to the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where she studied law for several years. Nelle also wrote for the university newspaper (&quot;The Crimson White&quot;) and a humor magazine (&quot;Rammer Jammer&quot;), but to her father&#x27;s great disappointment, she left one semester short of completing the credit hours for a degree. In the summer of 1948, Lee attended a summer school program, &quot;European Civilisation in the Twentieth Century&quot;, at Oxford University in England, financed by her father, who hoped—in vain, as it turned out—that the experience would make her more interested in her legal studies in Tuscaloosa.

==&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;==
In 1949, Lee moved to New York City and took jobs—first at a bookstore, then as an airline reservation agent—while writing in her spare time. After publishing several long stories, Lee found an agent in November 1956; Maurice Crain would become a friend until his death decades later. The following month, at Michael Brown&#x27;s East 50th Street townhouse, friends gave Lee a gift of a year&#x27;s wages with a note: &quot;You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.&quot;

===Origin===

In the spring of 1957, a 31-year-old Lee delivered the manuscript for &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; to Crain to send out to publishers, including the now-defunct J. B. Lippincott Company, which eventually bought it. At Lippincott, the novel fell into the hands of Tay Hohoff. Hohoff was impressed. &quot;[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line&quot;, she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott. But as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, &quot;more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel&quot;. During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

Like many unpublished authors, Lee was unsure of her talents. &quot;I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told,&quot; Lee said in a statement in 2015 about the evolution from &quot;Watchman&quot; to &quot;Mockingbird&quot;. Hohoff later described the process in Lippincott&#x27;s corporate history: &quot;After a couple of false starts, the story-line, interplay of characters, and fall of emphasis grew clearer, and with each revision—there were many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision of it—the true stature of the novel became evident.&quot; (In 1978, Lippincott was acquired by Harper &amp; Row, which became HarperCollins which published &quot;Watchman&quot; in 2015.) Hohoff described the give and take between author and editor: &quot;When she disagreed with a suggestion, we talked it out, sometimes for hours&quot; ... &quot;And sometimes she came around to my way of thinking, sometimes I to hers, sometimes the discussion would open up an entirely new line of country.&quot; One winter night, as Charles J. Shields recounts in &quot;Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee&quot;, Lee threw her manuscript out her window and into the snow, before calling Hohoff in tears. Shields recollected that &quot;Tay told her to march outside immediately and pick up the pages&quot;.

When the novel was finally ready, the author opted to use the name &quot;Harper Lee&quot; rather than risk having her first name Nelle be misidentified as &quot;Nellie&quot;.

Published July 11, 1960, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It remains a bestseller, with more than 40 million copies in print. In 1999, it was voted &quot;Best Novel of the Century&quot; in a poll by the &quot;Library Journal&quot;.

===Autobiographical details in the novel===
Like Lee, the tomboy Scout in the novel is the daughter of a respected small-town Alabama attorney. Scout&#x27;s friend, Dill Harris, was inspired by Lee&#x27;s childhood friend and neighbor, Truman Capote; Lee, in turn, is the model for a character in Capote&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;, published in 1948. Although the plot of Lee&#x27;s novel involves an unsuccessful legal defense similar to one undertaken by her attorney father, the 1931 landmark Scottsboro Boys interracial rape case may also have helped to shape Lee&#x27;s social conscience.

While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical parallels in the book, Truman Capote, mentioning the character Boo Radley in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, described details he considered autobiographical: &quot;In my original version of &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; I had that same man living in the house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But you see, I take the same thing and transfer it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way.&quot;
==After &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;==

===Middle years===
For 40 years, Lee lived part-time at 433 East 82nd Street in Manhattan, near her childhood friend Capote. His first novel, the semi-autobiographical &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;, had been published in 1948; a decade later Capote published &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, which became a film, a musical, and two stage plays. As the &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; manuscript went into publication production in 1959, Lee accompanied Capote to Holcomb, Kansas, to help him research what they thought would be an article on a small town&#x27;s response to the murder of a farmer and his family. Capote would expand the material into his best-selling book, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, serialized beginning in September 1965 and published in 1966. Her friendship with Capote, however, would suffer and peter out eventually in the wake of the worldwide success of Lee&#x27;s novel, which Capote had troubles coming to terms with.

After &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was released, Lee began a whirlwind of publicity tours, which she found difficult given her penchant for privacy and many interviewers&#x27; characterization of the work as a &quot;coming-of-age story&quot;. Racial tensions in the South had increased prior to the book&#x27;s release. Students at North Carolina A&amp;T University staged the first sit-in months before publication. As the book became a best seller, Freedom Riders arrived in Alabama and were beaten in Anniston and Birmingham. Meanwhile, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 1961 Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews and became a Reader&#x27;s Digest Book Club condensed selection and an alternate Book of the Month Club selection.

Lee helped with the adaptation of the book to the 1962 Academy Award–winning screenplay by Horton Foote, and said: &quot;I think it is one of the best translations of a book to film ever made.&quot; Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his portrayal of Atticus Finch, the father of the novel&#x27;s narrator, Scout. The families became close; Peck&#x27;s grandson, Harper Peck Voll, is named after her.

From the time of the publication of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; until her death in 2016, Lee granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances and, with the exception of a few short essays, published nothing further until 2015. She worked on a follow-up novel—&quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;—but eventually filed it away unfinished.

Lee assumed significant care responsibilities for her aging father, who was thrilled with her success, and who even began signing autographs as &quot;Atticus Finch&quot;. His health worsened and he died in Alabama on April 15, 1962. Lee decided to spend more time in New York City as she mourned. Over the decades, her friend Capote had adopted a decadent lifestyle, which contrasted with Lee&#x27;s preference for a quiet, more anonymous existence. Lee preferred to visit friends at their homes (though she came to distance herself from those who criticized her drinking), and also made unannounced appearances at libraries or other gatherings, particularly in Monroeville.

In January 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Lee to the National Council on the Arts.

Lee also realized that her book had become controversial, particularly with segregationists and other opponents of the civil rights movement. In 1966, Lee wrote a letter to the editor in response to the attempts of a Richmond, Virginia, area school board to ban &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as &quot;immoral literature&quot;:

James J. Kilpatrick, editor of &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot;, started the Beadle Bumble fund to pay fines for victims of what he termed &quot;despots on the bench&quot;. He built the fund using contributions from readers and later used it to defend books as well as people. After the board in Richmond ordered schools to dispose of all copies of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, Kilpatrick wrote, &quot;A more moral novel scarcely could be imagined.&quot; In the name of the Beadle Bumble fund, he then offered free copies to children who wrote in, and by the end of the first week, he had given away 81 copies.

Beginning in 1978, with her sisters&#x27; encouragement, Lee returned to Alabama and began a book about an Alabama serial murderer and the trial of his killer in Alexander City, under the working title &quot;The Reverend&quot;, but also put it aside when she was not satisfied.
When Lee attended the 1983 Alabama History and Heritage Festival in Eufaula, Alabama, as her sister had arranged, she presented the essay &quot;Romance and High Adventure&quot;.

===2005–2014===
In March 2005, Lee arrived in Philadelphia—her first trip to the city since signing with publisher Lippincott in 1960—to receive the inaugural ATTY Award for positive depictions of attorneys in the arts from the Spector Gadon &amp; Rosen Foundation. At the urging of Peck&#x27;s widow, Veronique Peck, Lee traveled by train from Monroeville to Los Angeles in 2005 to accept the Los Angeles Public Library Literary Award. She also attended luncheons for students who had written essays based on her work, held annually at the University of Alabama. On May 21, 2006, she accepted an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, where graduating seniors saluted her with copies of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; during the ceremony.

On May 7, 2006, Lee wrote a letter to Oprah Winfrey (published in &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot; in July 2006) about her love of books as a child and her dedication to the written word: &quot;Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have laptops, cell phones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books.&quot;

While attending an August 20, 2007, ceremony inducting four members into the Alabama Academy of Honor, Lee declined an invitation to address the audience, saying: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s better to be silent than to be a fool.&quot;
On November 5, 2007, George W. Bush presented Lee with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is the highest civilian award in the United States and recognizes individuals who have made &quot;an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors&quot;.

In 2010, President Barack Obama awarded Lee the National Medal of Arts, the highest award given by the United States government for &quot;outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support and availability of the arts&quot;.

In a 2011 interview with an Australian newspaper, Rev. Dr. Thomas Lane Butts said Lee was living in an assisted-living facility, was using a wheelchair, partially blind and deaf, and suffering from memory loss. Butts also shared that Lee told him why she never wrote again: &quot;Two reasons: one, I wouldn&#x27;t go through the pressure and publicity I went through with &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; for any amount of money. Second, I have said what I wanted to say, and I will not say it again.&quot;

On May 3, 2013, Lee filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court to regain the copyright to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, seeking unspecified damages from a son-in-law of her former literary agent and related entities. Lee claimed that the man &quot;engaged in a scheme to dupe&quot; her into assigning him the copyright on the book in 2007 when her hearing and eyesight were in decline, and she was residing in an assisted-living facility after suffering a stroke. In September 2013, attorneys for both sides announced a settlement of the lawsuit.

In February 2014, Lee settled a lawsuit against the Monroe County Heritage Museum for an undisclosed amount. The suit alleged that the museum had used her name and the title &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; to promote itself and to sell souvenirs without her consent. Lee&#x27;s attorneys had filed a trademark application on August 19, 2013, to which the museum filed an opposition. This prompted Lee&#x27;s attorney to file a lawsuit on October 15 that same year, &quot;which takes issue the museum&#x27;s website and gift shop, which it accuses of &#x27;palming off its goods&#x27;, including T-shirts, coffee mugs other various trinkets with Mockingbird brands.&quot;

===2015: &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;===
According to Lee&#x27;s lawyer Tonja Carter, following an initial meeting to appraise Lee&#x27;s assets in 2011, she re-examined Lee&#x27;s safe-deposit box in 2014 and found the manuscript for &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;. After contacting Lee and reading the manuscript, she passed it on to Lee&#x27;s agent Andrew Nurnberg. On February 3, 2015, it was announced that HarperCollins would publish &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, which includes versions of many of the characters in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. According to a HarperCollins press release, it was originally thought that the &quot;Watchman&quot; manuscript was lost. According to Nurnberg, &quot;Mockingbird&quot; was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: &quot;They discussed publishing &quot;Mockingbird&quot; first, &quot;Watchman&quot; last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.&quot;

Jonathan Mahler&#x27;s account in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of how &quot;Watchman&quot; was only ever really considered to be the first draft of &quot;Mockingbird&quot; makes this assertion seem unlikely. Evidence where the same passages exist in both books, in many cases word for word, also further refutes this assertion.

The book was met with controversy when it was published in July 2015 as a sequel to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot; Although it had been confirmed as a first draft of the latter with many narrative incongruities, it was repackaged and released as a completely separate work. The book is set some 20 years after the time period depicted in &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, when Scout returns as an adult from New York to visit her father in Maycomb, Alabama. It alludes to Scout&#x27;s view of her father, Atticus Finch, as the moral compass (&quot;watchman&quot;) of Maycomb, and, according to the publisher, how she finds upon her return to Maycomb, that she &quot;is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father&#x27;s attitude toward society and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood.&quot;

Not all reviewers had a harsh opinion about the publication of the sequel book. Michiko Kakutani in her &quot;Books of The Times&quot; review found that the book &quot;makes for disturbing reading&quot; when Scout finds her father is racist. While not fully praising the book, Kakutani found the publication of &quot;Watchman&quot; an important stepping stone in understanding Lee&#x27;s work.

The publication of the novel, announced by Lee&#x27;s lawyer, raised concerns over why Lee, who for 55 years had maintained that she would never write another book, would suddenly choose to publish again. In February 2015, the State of Alabama, through its Human Resources Department, launched an investigation into whether Lee was competent enough to consent to the publishing of &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;. The investigation found that the claims of coercion and elder abuse were unfounded, and, according to Lee&#x27;s lawyer, Lee was &quot;happy as hell&quot; with the publication.

This characterization, however, was contested by many of Lee&#x27;s friends. Marja Mills, author of &quot;The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee&quot;, a friend and former neighbor, painted a very different picture. In her piece for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Harper Lee I Knew&quot;, she quoted AliceLee&#x27;s sister, whom she described as &quot;gatekeeper, advisor, protector&quot; for most of Lee&#x27;s adult lifeas saying, &quot;Poor Nelle Harper can&#x27;t see and can&#x27;t hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.&quot; She made note that &quot;Watchman&quot; was announced just two and a half months after Alice&#x27;s death and that all correspondence to and from Lee went through her new attorney. She described Lee as &quot;in a wheelchair in an assisted living center, nearly deaf and blind, with a uniformed guard posted at the door&quot; and her visitors &quot;restricted to those on an approved list.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Joe Nocera continued this argument. He also took issue with how the book had been promoted by the &quot;Murdoch Empire&quot; as a newly discovered novel and that the manuscript had been brought to light by Tonja B. Carter, who worked in Alice Lee&#x27;s law office and became Lee&#x27;s &quot;new protector&quot;—lawyer, trustee, and spokesperson—after her sister Alice&#x27;s death. Nocera noted that other people in a 2011 Sotheby&#x27;s meeting insisted that Lee&#x27;s attorney was present in 2011, when Lee&#x27;s former agent (who was subsequently fired) and the Sotheby&#x27;s specialist found the manuscript. They said she knew full well that it was the same one submitted to Tay Hohoff in the 1950s that was reworked into &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, and that Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee&#x27;s affairs.

The authorship of both &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; was investigated with the help of forensic linguistics and stylometry. In a study conducted by three Polish academics, Michał Choiński, Maciej Edera and Jan Rybicki, the authorial fingerprints of Lee, Hohoff and Capote were contrasted to prove that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot; were both written by the same person. However, their study also suggests that Capote could have helped Lee with the writing of the opening chapters of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

== Death ==
Lee died in her sleep on the morning of February 19, 2016, aged 89. Prior to her death, she lived in Monroeville, Alabama. On February 20, her funeral was held at First United Methodist Church in Monroeville. The service was attended by close family and friends, and the eulogy was given by Wayne Flynt.

After her death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; filed a lawsuit that argued that since Lee&#x27;s will was filed in a probate court in Alabama that it is part of the public record and that Lee&#x27;s will should be made public. An Alabama court unsealed the will in 2018.

==Fictional portrayals==
Harper Lee was portrayed by Catherine Keener in the film &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), by Sandra Bullock in the film &quot;Infamous&quot; (2006), and by Tracey Hoyt in the TV movie &quot;Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story&quot; (1998). In the adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s novel &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot; (1995), the character of Idabel Thompkins, who was inspired by Capote&#x27;s memories of Lee as a child, was played by Aubrey Dollar.

<text>Louis Sachar ( ; born March 20, 1954) is an American young-adult mystery-comedy author. He is best known for the &quot;Wayside School&quot; series and the novel &quot;Holes&quot;.

&quot;Holes&quot; won the 1998 U.S. National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature and the 1999 Newbery Medal for the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;. In 2013, it was ranked sixth among all children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

==Biography==
Sachar was born on March 20, 1954, at Meadowbrook Hospital in East Meadow, New York to a religious Jewish family. As a child, he attended Hebrew school and Sunday school. After graduating from Tustin High School, Sachar attended Antioch College for a semester before transferring to University of California, Berkeley, during which time he began helping at an elementary school in return for three college credits. Sachar later recalled,

Sachar graduated from UC Berkeley in 1976 with a degree in economics, and began working on &quot;Sideways Stories From Wayside School&quot;, a children&#x27;s book set at an elementary school with supernatural elements. Although the book&#x27;s students were named after children from Hillside and there is a presumably autobiographical character named &quot;Louis the Yard Teacher,&quot; Sachar has said that he draws very little from personal experience, stating that &quot;my personal experiences are kind of boring. I have to make up what I put in my books.&quot;

Sachar wrote the book at night over the course of nine months, during which he worked during the day in a Connecticut sweater warehouse. After being fired from the warehouse, Sachar decided to go to law school, around which time &quot;Sideways Stories From Wayside School&quot; was accepted for publication. The book was released in 1978; though it was not widely distributed and subsequently did not sell very well, Sachar began to accumulate a fan base among young readers. Sachar graduated from University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1980 and did part-time legal work while continuing to write children&#x27;s books. By 1989, his books were selling well enough that Sachar was able to begin writing full-time.

Sachar married Carla Askew, an elementary school counselor, in 1985. They live in Austin, Texas, and have a daughter, Sherre, born January 19, 1987. Sachar has mentioned both his wife and daughter in his books; Carla was the inspiration for the counselor in &quot;There&#x27;s a Boy in the Girls&#x27; Bathroom&quot; (1988) and for Stanley&#x27;s lawyer in &quot;Holes&quot;.

In 2015, when asked whether he thought children had changed over the years, Sachar responded: &quot;I&#x27;ve actually been writing since 1976, and my first book is still in print and doing very well. So, no, I don&#x27;t think kids have changed.&quot;

==Film and television==
On April 11, 2003, Disney&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Holes&quot; was released, which earned $71.4 million worldwide. Sachar himself wrote the screenplay, at the request of the film&#x27;s director Andrew Davis, and has a brief on-screen cameo during one of the flashback scenes. On November 19, 2005, the &quot;Wayside School&quot; series was adapted into an animated direct-to-video . Two years later, it became a television series with two seasons, airing on the Canadian Teletoon and Nickelodeon in the U.S.

<doc id="195091" wikidata="Q1080137" url="?curid=195091" title="Troop">
<text>A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the US Cavalry and the King&#x27;s Troop Royal Horse Artillery where a troop is a subunit comparable to an infantry company or artillery battery. Historically the remainder of the Royal Horse Artillery used the term &quot;troop&quot; in the same manner but they eventually aligned with the rest of the Royal Regiment of Artillery in referring to troops as subordinate to artillery batteries.

&quot;Troops&quot; is often used to refer to the other members of one&#x27;s company or cause, but because of its military connotations, it conveys a particularly altruistic type of dedicated worker. Traditionally, &quot;troops&quot; refers to the soldiers in a military.

A cavalry soldier of private rank is called a &quot;trooper&quot; in many Commonwealth armies (abbreviated &quot;Tpr&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;trouper&quot;). 

A related sense of the term, &quot;troops&quot; refers to members of the military collectively, as in &quot;the troops&quot;; see Troop (disambiguation).

== Troops in various forces ==
Today, a troop is defined differently in different armed forces.

In the Australian Army a troop is the equivalent of a platoon sized element in units of certain corps, those being:

* Australian Army Aviation
* Royal Australian Armoured Corps
* Royal Australian Corps of Signals
* Royal Australian Corps of Transport
* Royal Australian Engineers
* Royal Australian Survey Corps (now disbanded)
* Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery 
* Special Air Service Regiment (SASR)

The SASR is the only unit in the Royal Australian Infantry Corps to use the term &quot;troop&quot; to refer to its platoon-size elements. SASR troops are also unusual as they are commanded by a captain—most troop or platoon-sized elements are commanded by a lieutenant. In most cases, units which refer to platoon sized elements as troops refer to company-sized elements as squadrons and battalion-sized elements as regiments (regiments in the RAA use the term &#x27;battery&#x27; for company-sized elements). Privates in the Royal Australian Armoured Corps and SASR hold the rank &quot;trooper&quot;, however this is not the case for any other corps or units, which use the term &quot;troops&quot;.

In the British Army the definition of a troop varies by corps.

* Household Cavalry and Royal Armoured Corps: Three or four armoured fighting vehicles commanded by a subaltern, i.e. effectively the same level element as an infantry platoon. A unit of two to four guns or launchers, or an equivalent headquarters unit.
* Royal Artillery: A half-battery. In the Royal Horse Artillery, a troop used to be the equivalent to a battery in other artillery units.
* Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Royal Logistic Corps, Special Air Service, and Honourable Artillery Company (and formerly the Royal Corps of Transport): A unit equivalent in size to a platoon in other corps, divided into sections or patrols. The Royal Engineers and Royal Corps of Signals used platoons instead until after World War II.

Other Army corps do not use the term.

In the Royal Marines, a troop is the equivalent to an Army platoon; a carryover from the organisation of the British Commandos in World War II.

In the Canadian Army, a troop is the equivalent of a platoon within the armoured, artillery, engineer, and signals branches. Two to four troops comprise the main elements of a squadron.

In the United States Army, in the cavalry branch, a troop is the equivalent unit to the infantry company, commanded by a captain and consisting of three or four platoons, and are called a troop within a regiment. Companies were renamed troops in 1883. In some instances, an infantry company may be titled as a &quot;troop&quot; due to its presence in a cavalry squadron; this is typically the case for the dismounted reconnaissance troop (DRT) of a RSTA squadron, in which an infantry company-sized element is part of a cavalry-branched squadron. 

==Troops in civilian organizations==
In the United States, state police forces are often regionally divided into troops. This usage came from these organizations modelling themselves on the US Army, and especially the older cavalry units. For this same reason the state police and highway patrol personnel of most states are known as &quot;troopers&quot; rather than &quot;officers&quot;.

In Scouting, a scout troop is a unit made up of scouts or guides from the same locality under a leader. In the case of Guides, the term &quot;company&quot; is used more often, and was used by the founder in his first books about guiding.

<text>The Beatitudes () are blessings recounted by Jesus in Matthew 5:3–10 within the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, and four in the Sermon on the Plain in the Gospel of Luke, followed by four woes which mirror the blessings.

In the Latin Vulgate, each of these blessings begins with the word , which translates to (plural adjective). The corresponding word in the original Greek is (), with the same meaning. Thus &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit&quot; appears in Latin as . The Latin noun was coined by Cicero to describe a state of blessedness and was later incorporated within the chapter headings written for Matthew 5 in various printed versions of the Vulgate. Subsequently, the word was anglicized to in the Great Bible of 1540, and has, over time, taken on a preferred spelling of &quot;beatitudes&quot;.

While some opinions can differ as to exactly how many distinct statements into which the Beatitudes should be divided (ranging from eight to ten), most scholars consider them to be only eight. These eight of Matthew follow a simple pattern: Jesus names a group of people normally thought to be unfortunate and pronounces them blessed.

== Matthew 5:3–12 ==
The nine Beatitudes in Matthew:

The ninth beatitude (Matthew 5:11–12) refers to the bearing of reviling and is addressed to the disciples. R.T. France considers verses 11 and 12 to be based on .

The Beatitudes unique to Matthew are the meek, the merciful, the pure of heart, and the peacemakers, while the other four have similar entries in Luke, but are followed almost immediately by &quot;four woes&quot;. The term &quot;poor in spirit&quot; is unique to Matthew. While thematically similar, the introduction of the phrase &quot;Poor in spirit&quot; spiritualizes or ethicizes the poor in their predicament (in alignment with Isaiah 61), while the Lucan version focuses on their actual hardship, poverty, marginalization and rejection of the poor who will see eventual vindication.

== Luke ==

The four Beatitudes in are set within the Sermon on the Plain.

 (&quot;Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.&quot;) appears to parallel the text in Matthew 5:11–12.

The four woes that follow in Luke 6:24–26

These woes are distinct from the &quot;Seven Woes of the Pharisees&quot; which appear later in .

== Analysis and interpretation ==
Each Beatitude consists of two phrases: the condition and the result. In almost all cases the phrases used are familiar from an Old Testament context, but in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus elevates them to new levels and teachings. Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of ideals that focus on love and humility rather than force and exaction. They echo the highest ideals of Jesus&#x27; teachings on spirituality and compassion.

The term &quot;the meek&quot; would be familiar in the Old Testament, e.g., as in . Although the Beatitude concerning the meek has been much praised even by some non-Christians such as Mahatma Gandhi, some view the admonition to meekness skeptically. Friedrich Nietzsche in &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot; considered the verse to be embodying what he perceived as a slave morality.

In Christian teachings, the works of mercy (good acts that are considered meritorious) have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy. These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.

The term &quot;peacemakers&quot; has traditionally been interpreted to mean not only those who live in peace with others, but also those who do their best to promote friendship among humanity and between God and man. St. Gregory of Nyssa interpreted it as &quot;Godly work&quot;, which was an imitation of God&#x27;s love of man. John Wesley said the peacemakers &quot;endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men, to quiet their turbulent passions, to soften the minds of contending parties, and, if possible, reconcile them to each other. They use all innocent arts, and employ all their strength, all the talents which God has given them, as well to preserve peace where it is, as to restore it where it is not.&quot;

The phrase &quot;poor in spirit&quot; () in Matthew 5:3 has been subject to a variety of interpretations. A.W. Tozer describes poverty of spirit as &quot;an inward state paralleling the outward circumstances of the common beggar in the streets.&quot; It is not a call to material poverty, but spiritual need. The idea being that when one realizes how much they need God, he will satisfy their need by giving them himself. Conversely, if someone does not really believe they need God, he will not reveal himself to them.

William Burnet Wright, seeking to avoid a common misunderstanding of the meaning of poverty of spirit, distinguishes those who are &quot;poor in spirit&quot; from those he calls &quot;poor spirited,&quot; who &quot;consider crawling the Christian&#x27;s proper gait.&quot;
== In other religious texts ==
Also in the New Testament, the Epistle of James contains a verse which is worded in much the same way as the Beatitudes; and which shares themes particularly with Matthew 5:10,12:

In the Book of Mormon, a religious text of the Latter Day Saint movement, Jesus delivers a sermon to a group of people in the Americas shortly after His death and resurrection. This event, believed by adherents to be part of Christ’s visit to the Americas around the year 34, is recorded in 3 Nephi 12, where Jesus teaches a version of the Beatitudes similar to that found in Matthew 5.

Though the teachings in 3 Nephi 12 closely mirror the Beatitudes in Matthew, the Book of Mormon version emphasizes the importance of baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost, which is seen as central to the blessings. Additionally, in 3 Nephi 12:48, Jesus invites the people to be perfect, “even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect,” expanding the call to divine perfection to include Himself, thus highlighting His divinity in the post-resurrection context of the Americas.

The Baháʼí &quot; Lawḥ-i-Aqdas&quot; tablet concludes with 21 beatitudes, including this statement:
The Qur&#x27;an mirrors the Bible only in Q:21:105 which resembles referred to in ; but the Qur&#x27;an uses &quot;righteous&quot; rather than &quot;meek&quot;. The Qur&#x27;an (e.g., &quot;say the word of humility and enter the gate of paradise&quot;) and some Hadith (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;My mercy exceeds my anger&quot;) contain some passages with somewhat similar tone, but distinct phraseology, from the Beatitudes.

The Bhagavad Gita and the traditional writings of Buddhism (e.g., some of the Mangala Sutta) have been interpreted as including teachings whose intentions resemble some of the messages of Beatitudes (e.g., humility and absence of ego), although their wording is not the same.

Six &quot;modern Beatitudes&quot; were proposed by Pope Francis during his visit to Malmö, Sweden on All Saints Day 2016:

<doc id="195100" wikidata="Q8860000" url="?curid=195100" title="Voskhod programme">
<text>The Voskhod programme (, , &quot;Ascent&quot; or &quot;Dawn&quot;) was the second Soviet human spaceflight project. Two one-day crewed missions were flown using the Voskhod spacecraft and rocket, one in 1964 and one in 1965, and two dogs flew on a 22-day mission in 1966.

Voskhod development was both a follow-on to the Vostok programme and a recycling of components left over from that programme&#x27;s cancellation following its first six flights. The Voskhod programme was superseded by the Soyuz programme.

==Design==
The Voskhod spacecraft was basically a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup, solid-fueled retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. As it was much heavier, the launch vehicle would be the 11A57, a Molniya 8K78M with the Blok L stage removed and later the basis of the Soyuz booster. The ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. However, the position of the in-flight controls was not changed, so the crew had to crane their heads 90° to see the instruments.

In the case of Voskhod 2, an inflatable exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. The airlock was jettisoned after use. This apparatus was needed because the vehicle avionics and environmental systems were air-cooled, and depressurization in orbit would cause overheating. A solid-fueled braking rocket was also added to the parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the Voskhod descent module landed with the crewmen still inside.

Unlike Vostok and the later Soyuz, Voskhod had no launch abort system, meaning that the crew lacked any means of escape from a malfunctioning launch vehicle.

Voskhod had a solid-fueled backup retrorocket on top of the capsule in case the main one failed (as it did on Voskhod 2). While Vostok lacked this feature, it was not considered a problem since the spacecraft would decay from orbit within 10 days. Relatively lightweight, Voskhod was well below the 11A57 booster&#x27;s lift capacity, meaning that it launched into a much higher orbit and would not decay as quickly.

==Flights==
The Voskhod flights, with launch dates:

===Uncrewed===
*Kosmos 47 – Uncrewed test flight of the Voskhod hardware.
*Kosmos 57 – Uncrewed test flight, unsuccessful.
*Kosmos 110 – Uncrewed, sent two dogs, Veterok and Ugolyok, on a 22-day flight, launched 22 February 1966 and landed 16 March.

===Crewed===
===Cancelled===
*Voskhod 3 – 19-day two-man mission to study long-term weightlessness with artificial gravity, medical, military and other experiments
*Voskhod 4 – 20-day single-man mission to study long-term weightlessness with artificial gravity, medical, military, and other experiments
*Voskhod 5 – 10-day two-woman mission with medical and other experiments and first female EVA-spacewalk
*Voskhod 6 – 15-day two-man mission with military and other experiments and multiple spacewalks to test new EVA jet belt

==Results==
While the Vostok programme was dedicated more toward understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod&#x27;s two flights were more aimed towards spectacular firsts. Although achieving the first EVA (&quot;spacewalk&quot;) became the main success of the programme, beating the American Project Gemini to put the first multiman crew in orbit was the objective that initially motivated the programme. After those goals were realized, the programme planned to focus on other advances the spacecraft could accomplish, such as longer duration and a second female flight. However, there were delays preparing for Voskhod 3, and during that time the Gemini programme accomplished most of what had been planned for future Voskhods. In the end, the Voskhod programme was abandoned, aided by a change in Soviet leadership which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights, and this allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the Soyuz programme.

<doc id="195102" wikidata="Q7990761" url="?curid=195102" title="What's Going On (game show)">
<text>What&#x27;s Going On is an American game show that aired for five weeks beginning on November 28, 1954, and ending on December 26, 1954. The show aired on ABC and was a Mark Goodson-Bill Todman production. It was sponsored by Revlon, and originated live from New York City.

Lee Bowman served as host of the show. There were six celebrities involved in the game: Hy Gardner, Audrey Meadows, Gene Raymond, Kitty Carlisle, Cliff Norton, and Susan Oakland. Jayne Meadows was a substitute panelist when her sister Audrey was doing a stage play.

==Format==
Each week, three of the celebrities would be sent to either record film of an activity or to participate in a live remote broadcast documenting or doing an activity. Examples include washing windows at the Empire State Building, eating dinner at a Chinese restaurant, or destroying money no longer suitable for circulation at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. The remaining three celebrities would form the panel which would attempt to guess the activity. Each round, one activity would be introduced to the audience with part of the film or live remote, which would be shown behind the panel (they could only see it if they turned around). The activity was silently displayed (usually via written cards they would hold up in the film or remote) for the audience.

The panel would then take turns asking questions to determine the activity, limited by timer in a manner similar to &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. Depending on the presumed difficulty in guessing the activity, the panel could be given anywhere from three to ten &quot;chimes&quot; (guessing turns) between them, which would be revealed in advance. In some of the segments, an audience member would be recruited to engage in the activity with a panelist. In those cases, a relative of the audience member joined the panel attempting to guess the activity. Correctly guessing the activity resulted in a $100 prize. In the segments played exclusively by the panelists, there were no prizes.

==Episode status==
The first four episodes are known to be intact, and were aired by GSN in 2005 as part of its late-night &quot;Black &amp; White Overnight&quot; programming block. One of the four episodes was rerun on August 28, 2006 and April 30, 2007. The fifth and final episode&#x27;s status is unknown.

One episode was aired on September 27, 2020 as part of Buzzr&#x27;s 5th annual Lost and Found marathon.

<doc id="195109" wikidata="Q937034" url="?curid=195109" title="The Harder They Come (soundtrack)">
<text>The Harder They Come is the soundtrack album to the film of the same name, released in 1972 in the United Kingdom as Island Records ILPS 9202. It was issued in February 1973 in North America as Mango Records SMAS-7400. It peaked at No. 140 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
In 2021, the album was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

==Recordings==
The heart of the soundtrack comes from performances by the film&#x27;s star, reggae singer Jimmy Cliff. Only the title track &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; was recorded by Cliff specifically for the soundtrack, with three earlier songs by Cliff added. The remainder of the album is a compilation of singles released in Jamaica from the period of 1967 through 1972, assembled by &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; director and co-writer, Perry Henzell, from songs by favored reggae singers. In addition to Cliff, these artists include the Melodians, the Slickers, DJ Scotty, and seminal early reggae stars Desmond Dekker and Toots and the Maytals.

Two songs are repeated on side two to end the album. The second version of &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot; is a dub version of the song mostly minus a few vocals, while the second version of &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; is an alternate take.

==Reception and legacy==

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said the soundtrack &quot;collected the best songs of artists whose music was either unavailable or not rich enough to fill an LP&quot;.

The soundtrack album played a major part in popularizing reggae in the United States and the world beyond, the film itself preventing the genre from remaining an isolated phenomenon in Jamaica. In 2003, the album was ranked number 119 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, number 122 in a 2012 revision, and number 174 in the 2020 reboot of the list. The album also appears on greatest albums lists from &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot;, and was named the 97th best album of the 1970s by Pitchfork Media. In 2024, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the 3rd greatest soundtrack of all time.

On August 5, 2003, Universal Music Group issued a deluxe edition of the album, with the original remastered and reissued on one disc. A bonus disc continued the idea of the original soundtrack itself, compiling additional singles from the early days of reggae, titled &quot;Reggae Hit the Town: Crucial Reggae 1968–1972&quot;.

<doc id="195113" wikidata="Q244752" url="?curid=195113" title="Digital divide">
<text>The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet. The digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources. In the Information Age, people without access to the Internet and other technology are at a disadvantage, for they are unable or less able to connect with others, find and apply for jobs, shop, and learn.

People who are homeless, living in poverty, elderly people, and those living in rural communities may have limited access to the Internet; in contrast, urban middle class and upper-class people have easy access to the Internet. Another divide is between producers and consumers of Internet content, which could be a result of educational disparities. While social media use varies across age groups, a US 2010 study reported no racial divide.

==History==
The historical roots of the digital divide in America refer to the increasing gap that occurred during the early modern period between those who could and could not access the real time forms of calculation, decision-making, and visualization offered via written and printed media. Within this context, ethical discussions regarding the relationship between education and the free distribution of information were raised by thinkers such as Immanuel Kant, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Mary Wollstonecraft (1712–1778). The latter advocated that governments should intervene to ensure that any society&#x27;s economic benefits should be fairly and meaningfully distributed. Amid the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, Rousseau&#x27;s idea helped to justify poor laws that created a safety net for those who were harmed by new forms of production. Later when telegraph and postal systems evolved, many used Rousseau&#x27;s ideas to argue for full access to those services, even if it meant subsidizing hard-to-serve citizens. Thus, &quot;universal services&quot; referred to innovations in regulation and taxation that would allow phone services such as AT&amp;T in the United States to serve hard-to-serve rural users. In 1996, as telecommunications companies merged with Internet companies, the Federal Communications Commission adopted Telecommunications Services Act of 1996 to consider regulatory strategies and taxation policies to close the digital divide. Though the term &quot;digital divide&quot; was coined among consumer groups that sought to tax and regulate information and communications technology (ICeT) companies to close the digital divide, the topic soon moved onto a global stage. The focus was the World Trade Organization which passed a Telecommunications Services Act, which resisted regulation of ICT companies so that they would be required to serve hard to serve individuals and communities. In 1999, to assuage anti-globalization forces, the WTO hosted the &quot;Financial Solutions to Digital Divide&quot; in Seattle, US, co-organized by Craig Warren Smith of Digital Divide Institute and Bill Gates Sr. the chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It catalyzed a full-scale global movement to close the digital divide, which quickly spread to all sectors of the global economy. In 2000, US president Bill Clinton mentioned the term in the State of the Union Address.

===During the COVID-19 pandemic ===
At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide issued stay-at-home orders that established lockdowns, quarantines, restrictions, and closures. The resulting interruptions to schooling, public services, and business operations drove nearly half of the world&#x27;s population into seeking alternative methods to live while in isolation. These methods included telemedicine, virtual classrooms, online shopping, technology-based social interactions and working remotely, all of which require access to high-speed or broadband internet access and digital technologies. A Pew Research Centre study reports that 90% of Americans describe the use of the Internet as &quot;essential&quot; during the pandemic. The accelerated use of digital technologies creates a landscape where the ability, or lack thereof, to access digital spaces becomes a crucial factor in everyday life.

According to the Pew Research Center, 59% of children from lower-income families were likely to face digital obstacles in completing school assignments. These obstacles included the use of a cellphone to complete homework, having to use public Wi-Fi because of unreliable internet service in the home and lack of access to a computer in the home. This difficulty, titled the homework gap, affects more than 30% of K-12 students living below the poverty threshold, and disproportionally affects American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic students. These types of interruptions or privilege gaps in education exemplify problems in the systemic marginalization of historically oppressed individuals in primary education. The pandemic exposed inequity causing discrepancies in learning.

A lack of &quot;tech readiness&quot;, that is, confident and independent use of devices, was reported among the US elderly population; with more than 50% reporting an inadequate knowledge of devices and more than one-third reporting a lack of confidence. Moreover, according to a UN research paper, similar results can be found across various Asian countries, with those above the age of 74 reporting a lower and more confused usage of digital devices. This aspect of the digital divide and the elderly occurred during the pandemic as healthcare providers increasingly relied upon telemedicine to manage chronic and acute health conditions.

==Aspects==

There are manifold definitions of the digital divide, all with slightly different emphasis, which is evidenced by related concepts like digital inclusion, digital participation, digital skills, media literacy, and digital accessibility.

===Infrastructure===
The infrastructure by which individuals, households, businesses, and communities connect to the Internet address the physical mediums that people use to connect to the Internet such as desktop computers, laptops, basic mobile phones or smartphones, iPods or other MP3 players, gaming consoles such as Xbox or PlayStation, electronic book readers, and tablets such as iPads.

Traditionally, the nature of the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices. Given the increasing number of such devices, some have concluded that the digital divide among individuals has increasingly been closing as the result of a natural and almost automatic process. Others point to persistent lower levels of connectivity among women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with lower incomes, rural residents, and less educated people as evidence that addressing inequalities in access to and use of the medium will require much more than the passing of time. Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).

As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, &quot;the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s&quot; increased digital inequality, as well as &quot;the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality&quot;. During the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. 5G and fiber optics FTTH). Measurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach – ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union. The Good Things Foundation, a UK non-profit organisation, collates data on the extent and impact of the digital divide in the UK and lobbies the government to fix digital exclusion

===Skills and digital literacy===
Research from 2001 showed that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment. There are at least three factors at play: information accessibility, information utilization, and information receptiveness. More than just accessibility, the digital divide consists of society&#x27;s lack of knowledge on how to make use of the information and communication tools once they exist within a community. Information professionals have the ability to help bridge the gap by providing reference and information services to help individuals learn and utilize the technologies to which they do have access, regardless of the economic status of the individual seeking help.

===Location===
One can connect to the internet in a variety of locations, such as homes, offices, schools, libraries, public spaces, and Internet cafes. Levels of connectivity often vary between rural, suburban, and urban areas.

In 2017, the Wireless Broadband Alliance published the white paper &quot;The Urban Unconnected&quot;, which highlighted that in the eight countries with the world&#x27;s highest GNP about 1.75 billion people had no internet connection, and one third of them lived in the major urban centers. Delhi (5.3 millions, 9% of the total population), São Paulo (4.3 millions, 36%), New York (1.6 mln, 19%), and Moscow (2.1 mln, 17%) registered the highest percentages of citizens who had no internet access of any type.

As of 2021, only about half of the world&#x27;s population had access to the internet, leaving 3.7 billion people without internet. A majority of those are in developing countries, and a large portion of them are women. Also, the governments of different countries have different policies about privacy, data governance, speech freedoms and many other factors. Government restrictions make it challenging for technology companies to provide services in certain countries. This disproportionately impacts the different regions of the world; Europe has the highest percentage of the population online while Africa has the lowest. From 2010 to 2014 Europe went from 67% to 75% and in the same time span Africa went from 10% to 19%.

Network speeds play a large role in the quality of an internet connection. Large cities and towns may have better access to high speed internet than rural areas, which may have limited or no service. Households can be locked into a specific service provider, since it may be the only carrier that even offers service to the area. This applies to regions that have developed networks, like the United States, but also applies to developing countries, so that very large areas have virtually no coverage. In those areas there are very limited actions that a consumer could take, since the issue is mainly infrastructure. Technologies that provide an internet connection through satellite are becoming more common, like Starlink, but they are still not available in many regions.

Based on location, a connection may be so slow as to be virtually unusable, solely because a network provider has limited infrastructure in the area. For example, to download 5 GB of data in Taiwan it might take about 8 minutes, while the same download might take 30 hours in Yemen.

From 2020 to 2022, average download speeds in the EU climbed from 70 Mbps to more than 120 Mbps, owing mostly to the demand for digital services during the pandemic. There is still a large rural-urban disparity in internet speeds, with metropolitan areas in France and Denmark reaching rates of more than 150 Mbps, while many rural areas in Greece, Croatia, and Cyprus have speeds of less than 60 Mbps.

The EU aspires for complete gigabit coverage by 2030, however as of 2022, only over 60% of Europe has high-speed internet infrastructure, signalling the need for more enhancements.

===Applications===
Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco, surveyed almost 1,400 parents and reported in 2011 that 47 percent of families with incomes more than $75,000 had downloaded apps for their children, while only 14 percent of families earning less than $30,000 had done so.

==Reasons and correlating variables==

As of 2014, the gap in a digital divide was known to exist for a number of reasons. Obtaining access to ICTs and using them actively has been linked to demographic and socio-economic characteristics including income, education, race, gender, geographic location (urban-rural), age, skills, awareness, political, cultural and psychological attitudes. Multiple regression analysis across countries has shown that income levels and educational attainment are identified as providing the most powerful explanatory variables for ICT access and usage. Evidence was found that Caucasians are much more likely than non-Caucasians to own a computer as well as have access to the Internet in their homes. As for geographic location, people living in urban centers have more access and show more usage of computer services than those in rural areas.

In developing countries, a digital divide between women and men is apparent in tech usage, with men more likely to be competent tech users. Controlled statistical analysis has shown that income, education and employment act as confounding variables and that women with the same level of income, education and employment actually embrace ICT more than men (see Women and ICT4D), this argues against any suggestion that women are &quot;naturally&quot; more technophobic or less tech-savvy. However, each nation has its own set of causes or the digital divide. For example, the digital divide in Germany is unique because it is not largely due to difference in quality of infrastructure.

The correlation between income and internet use suggests that the digital divide persists at least in part due to income disparities. Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.

In research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled to eliminate interaction effects or mediating variables, but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Measurements for the intensity of usages, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as Infostate, proposed by Orbicom-UNESCO, the Digital Opportunity Index, or ITU&#x27;s ICT Development Index).

===Economic gap in the United States===
During the mid-1990s, the United States Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration (NTIA) began publishing reports about the Internet and access to and usage of the resource. The first of three reports is titled &quot;Falling Through the Net: A Survey of the &quot;Have Nots&quot; in Rural and Urban America&quot; (1995), the second is &quot;Falling Through the Net II: New Data on the Digital Divide&quot; (1998), and the final report &quot;Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide&quot; (1999). The NTIA&#x27;s final report attempted clearly to define the term digital divide as &quot;the divide between those with access to new technologies and those without&quot;. Since the introduction of the NTIA reports, much of the early, relevant literature began to reference the NTIA&#x27;s digital divide definition. The digital divide is commonly defined as being between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot;.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) 2019 Broadband Deployment Report indicated that 21.3 million Americans do not have access to wired or wireless broadband internet. As of 2020, BroadbandNow, an independent research company studying access to internet technologies, estimated that the actual number of United States Americans without high-speed internet is twice that number. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center report, smartphone ownership and internet use has increased for all Americans, however, a significant gap still exists between those with lower incomes and those with higher incomes: U.S. households earning $100K or more are twice as likely to own multiple devices and have home internet service as those making $30K or more, and three times as likely as those earning less than $30K per year. The same research indicated that 13% of the lowest income households had no access to internet or digital devices at home compared to only 1% of the highest income households.

According to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults executed from January 25 to February 8, 2021, the digital lives of Americans with high and low incomes are varied. Conversely, the proportion of Americans that use home internet or cell phones has maintained constant between 2019 and 2021. A quarter of those with yearly average earnings under $30,000 (24%) says they don&#x27;t own smartphones. Four out of every ten low-income people (43%) do not have home internet access or a computer (43%). Furthermore, the more significant part of lower-income Americans does not own a tablet device.

On the other hand, every technology is practically universal among people earning $100,000 or higher per year. Americans with larger family incomes are also more likely to buy a variety of internet-connected products. Wi-Fi at home, a smartphone, a computer, and a tablet are used by around six out of ten families making $100,000 or more per year, compared to 23 percent in the lesser household.

===Racial gap in the United States===
Although many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the Internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. Pew research shows that as of 2021, home broadband rates are 81% for White households, 71% for Black households and 65% for Hispanic households. While 63% of adults find the lack of broadband to be a disadvantage, only 49% of White adults do. Smartphone and tablet ownership remains consistent with about 8 out of 10 Black, White, and Hispanic individuals reporting owning a smartphone and half owning a tablet. A 2021 survey found that a quarter of Hispanics rely on their smartphone and do not have access to broadband.

===Physical and mental disability gap===
Inequities in access to information technologies are present among individuals living with a physical disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. In 2011, according to the Pew Research Center, 54% of households with a person who had a disability had home Internet access, compared to 81% of households that did not have a person who has a disability. The type of disability an individual has can prevent them from interacting with computer screens and smartphone screens, such as having a quadriplegia disability or having a disability in the hands. However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home Internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, national and regional government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities. In 2022, a survey of people in the UK with severe mental illness found that 42% lacked basic digital skills, such as changing passwords or connecting to Wi-Fi.

People with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016–17 and 2017–18 according to a report published by Leonard Cheshire, a health and welfare charity. Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price&#x27;s son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Price to ensure that Britain&#x27;s MPs held accountable those who perpetuate online abuse towards those with disabilities. Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and &quot;faking&quot; their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.

===Gender gap===
Due to the rapidly declining price of connectivity and hardware, skills deficits have eclipsed barriers of access as the primary contributor to the gender digital divide. Studies show that women are less likely to know how to leverage devices and Internet access to their full potential, even when they do use digital technologies. In rural India, for example, a study found that the majority of women who owned mobile phones only knew how to answer calls. They could not dial numbers or read messages without assistance from their husbands, due to a lack of literacy and numeracy skills. A survey of 3,000 respondents across 25 countries found that adolescent boys with mobile phones used them for a wider range of activities, such as playing games and accessing financial services online. Adolescent girls in the same study tended to use just the basic functionalities of their phone, such as making calls and using the calculator. Similar trends can be seen even in areas where Internet access is near-universal. A survey of women in nine cities around the world revealed that although 97% of women were using social media, only 48% of them were expanding their networks, and only 21% of Internet-connected women had searched online for information related to health, legal rights or transport. In some cities, less than one quarter of connected women had used the Internet to look for a job.

Studies show that despite strong performance in computer and information literacy (CIL), girls do not have confidence in their ICT abilities. According to the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) assessment girls&#x27; self-efficacy scores (their perceived as opposed to their actual abilities) for advanced ICT tasks were lower than boys&#x27;.

A paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children. This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the under representation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley.

There has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies. In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon&#x27;s machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon&#x27;s computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10-year period. During this ten-year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.

===Age gap===
The age gap contributes to the digital divide due to the fact that people born before 1983 did not grow up with the internet. According to Marc Prensky, people who fall into this age range are classified as &quot;digital immigrants.&quot; A digital immigrant is defined as &quot;a person born or brought up before the widespread use of digital technology.&quot; The internet became officially available for public use on January 1, 1983; anyone born before then has had to adapt to the new age of technology. On the contrary, people born after 1983 are considered &quot;digital natives&quot;. Digital natives are defined as people born or brought up during the age of digital technology.

Across the globe, there is a 10% difference in internet usage between people aged 15–24 years old and people aged 25 years or older. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 75% of people aged 15–24 used the internet in 2022 compared to 65% of people aged 25 years or older. The highest amount of digital divide between generations occurs in Africa with 55% of the younger age group using the internet compared to 36% of people aged 25 years or older. The lowest amount of divide occurs between the Commonwealth of Independent States with 91% of the younger age group using the internet compared to 83% of people aged 25 years or older.

In addition to being less connected with the internet, older generations are less likely to use financial technology, also known as fintech. Fintech is any way of managing money via digital devices. Some examples of fintech include digital payment apps such as Vemno and Apple Pay, tax services such as TurboTax, or applying for a mortgage digitally. In data from World Bank Findex, 40% of people younger than 40 years old utilized fintech compared to less than 25% of people aged 60 years or older.

=== Global level===


The divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the global digital divide, which examines the technological gap between developing and developed countries. The divide within countries (such as the digital divide in the United States) may refer to inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different socioeconomic levels or other demographic categories. In contrast, the global digital divide describes disparities in access to computing and information resources, and the opportunities derived from such access. As the internet rapidly expands it is difficult for developing countries to keep up with the constant changes. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential. This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70–75% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, replaced by China, who hosted more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).

Some zero-rating programs such as Facebook Zero offer free/subsidized data access to certain websites. Critics object that this is an anti-competitive program that undermines net neutrality and creates a &quot;walled garden&quot;. A 2015 study reported that 65% of Nigerians, 61% of Indonesians, and 58% of Indians agree with the statement that &quot;Facebook is the Internet&quot; compared with only 5% in the US.

==Implications==

===Social capital===
Once an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. Social capital is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a &quot;digital citizen.&quot;

=== Economic disparity ===
In the United States, the research provided by Unguarded Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company&#x27;s access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy. The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills. Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world. A BEG report suggests that in countries like Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K., the digital connection among communities is made easier, allowing for their populations to obtain a much larger share of the economies via digital business. In fact, in these places, populations hold shares approximately 2.5 percentage points higher. During a meeting with the United Nations a Bangladesh representative expressed his concern that poor and undeveloped countries would be left behind due to a lack of funds to bridge the digital gap.

=== Education ===
The digital divide impacts children&#x27;s ability to learn and grow in low-income school districts. Without Internet access, students are unable to cultivate necessary technological skills to understand today&#x27;s dynamic economy. The need for the internet starts while children are in school – necessary for matters such as school portal access, homework submission, and assignment research. The Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Broadband Task Force created a report showing that about 70% of teachers give students homework that demand access to broadband. Approximately 65% of young scholars use the Internet at home to complete assignments as well as connect with teachers and other students via discussion boards and shared files. A recent study indicates that approximately 50% of students say that they are unable to finish their homework due to an inability to either connect to the Internet or in some cases, find a computer. Additionally, The Public Policy Institute of California reported in 2023 that 27% of the state’s school children lack the necessary broadband to attend school remotely, and 16% have no internet connection at all.

This has led to a new revelation: 42% of students say they received a lower grade because of this disadvantage. According to research conducted by the Center for American Progress, &quot;if the United States were able to close the educational achievement gaps between native-born white children and black and Hispanic children, the U.S. economy would be 5.8 percent—or nearly $2.3 trillion—larger in 2050&quot;.

In a reverse of this idea, well-off families, especially the tech-savvy parents in Silicon Valley, carefully limit their own children&#x27;s screen time. The children of wealthy families attend play-based preschool programs that emphasize social interaction instead of time spent in front of computers or other digital devices, and they pay to send their children to schools that limit screen time. American families that cannot afford high-quality childcare options are more likely to use tablet computers filled with apps for children as a cheap replacement for a babysitter, and their government-run schools encourage screen time during school. Students in school are also learning about the digital divide.

To reduce the impact of the digital divide and increase digital literacy in young people at an early age, governments have begun to develop and focus policy on embedding digital literacies in both student and educator programs, for instance, in Initial Teacher Training programs in Scotland. The National Framework for Digital Literacies in Initial Teacher Education was developed by representatives from Higher Education institutions that offer Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programs in conjunction with the Scottish Council of Deans of Education (SCDE) with the support of Scottish Government This policy driven approach aims to establish an academic grounding in the exploration of learning and teaching digital literacies and their impact on pedagogy as well as ensuring educators are equipped to teach in the rapidly evolving digital environment and continue their own professional development.

=== Demographic differences ===
Factors such as nationality, gender, and income contribute to the digital divide across the globe. Depending on what someone identifies as, their access to the internet can potentially decrease. According to a study conducted by the ITU in 2022, Africa has the fewest people on the internet at a 40% rate; the next lowest internet population is the Asia-Pacific region at 64%. Internet access remains a problem in Least Developing Countries and Landlocked Developing Countries. They both have 36% of people using the internet compared to a 66% average around the world.

Men generally have more access to the internet around the world. The gender parity score across the globe is 0.92. A gender parity score is calculated by the percentage of women who use the internet divided by the percentage of men who use the internet. Ideally, countries want to have gender parity scores between 0.98 and 1.02. The region with the least gender parity is Africa with a score of 0.75. The next lowest gender parity score belongs to the Arab States at 0.87. Americans, Commonwealth of Independent States, and Europe all have the highest gender parity scores with scores that do not go below 0.98 or higher than 1. Gender parity scores are often impacted by class. Low income regions have a score of 0.65 while upper-middle income and high income regions have a score of 0.99.

The difference between economic classes has been a prevalent issue with the digital divide up to this point. People who are considered to earn low income use the internet at a 26% rate followed by lower-middle income at 56%, upper-middle income at 79%, and high income at 92%. The staggering difference between low income individuals and high income individuals can be traced to the affordability of mobile products. Products are becoming more affordable as the years pass; according to the ITU, “the global median price of mobile-broadband services dropped from 1.9 percent to 1.5 percent of average gross national income (GNI) per capita.” There is still plenty of work to be done, as there is a 66% difference between low income individuals and high income individuals&#x27; access to the internet.

===Facebook divide===
The Facebook divide, a concept derived from the &quot;digital divide&quot;, is the phenomenon with regard to access to, use of, and impact of Facebook on society. It was coined at the International Conference on Management Practices for the New Economy (ICMAPRANE-17) on February 10–11, 2017.

Additional concepts of Facebook Native and Facebook Immigrants were suggested at the conference. &quot;Facebook divide&quot;, &quot;Facebook native&quot;, &quot;Facebook immigrants&quot;, and &quot;Facebook left-behind&quot; are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook immigrants utilize Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. Facebook natives, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook divide phenomenon.

==Solutions==
In the year 2000, the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) program launched its Online Volunteering service, which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.

Since May 17, 2006, the United Nations has raised awareness of the divide by way of the World Information Society Day. In 2001, it set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force. Later UN initiatives in this area are the World Summit on the Information Society since 2003, and the Internet Governance Forum, set up in 2006.

As of 2009, the borderline between ICT as a necessity good and ICT as a luxury good was roughly around US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year, which means that people consider ICT expenditure of US$120 per year as a basic necessity. Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income. 
Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through Telecentres.

In 2022, the US Federal Communications Commission started a proceeding &quot;to prevent and eliminate digital discrimination and ensure that all people of the United States benefit from equal access to broadband internet access service, consistent with Congress&#x27;s direction in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Social media websites serve as both manifestations of and means by which to combat the digital divide. The former describes phenomena such as the divided users&#x27; demographics that make up sites such as Facebook, WordPress and Instagram. Each of these sites hosts communities that engage with otherwise marginalized populations.

=== Libraries ===
In 2010,
an &quot;online indigenous digital library as part of public library services&quot; was created in Durban, South Africa to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.

In 2002, the Gates Foundation started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training assistance and guidance in libraries.

In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began. In the early 2000s, the Carnegie Foundation funded a revitalization project through the Kenya National Library Service. Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons. In 2012, public libraries in the Busia and Kiberia communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools. By 2013, the program expanded into ten schools.

===Effective use===
Even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are opposed by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend or limit the information that the Internet provides. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.

Community informatics (CI) focuses on issues of &quot;use&quot; rather than &quot;access&quot;. CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to Michael Gurstein, that the means for the &quot;effective use&quot; of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available. Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of &quot;open data&quot; and coined the term &quot;data divide&quot; to refer to this issue area.

==Criticism==

===Knowledge divide===
Since gender, age, race, income, and educational digital divides have lessened compared to the past, some researchers suggest that the digital divide is shifting from a gap in access and connectivity to ICTs to a knowledge divide. A knowledge divide concerning technology presents the possibility that the gap has moved beyond the access and having the resources to connect to ICTs to interpreting and understanding information presented once connected.

===Second-level digital divide===
The second-level digital divide, also referred to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the Internet from the producers of content. As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the Internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving. Previously, digital divide research was focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with an increasing number of the population gaining access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people use the Internet to create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.

New applications have made it possible for anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to be a creator of content, yet the majority of user-generated content available widely on the Internet, like public blogs, is created by a small portion of the Internet-using population. Web 2.0 technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.

Some of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.

Other reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status. Users of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to participate in content creation due to disadvantages in education and lack of the necessary free time for the work involved in blog or website creation and maintenance. Additionally, there is evidence to support the existence of the second-level digital divide at the K-12 level based on how educators&#x27; use technology for instruction. Schools&#x27; economic factors have been found to explain variation in how teachers use technology to promote higher-order thinking skills.

<text>The  () is a Chinese mouth-blown polyphonic free reed instrument consisting of vertical pipes.

It is one of the oldest Chinese instruments, with images depicting its kind dating back to 1100 BCE, and there are original instruments from the Han dynasty that are preserved in museums today. Traditionally, the has been used as an accompaniment instrument for solo or performances. It is one of the main instruments in and some other forms of Chinese opera. Traditional small ensembles also make use of the , such as the wind and percussion ensembles in northern China. In the modern large Chinese orchestra, it is used for both melody and accompaniment.

The has been used in the works of a few non-Chinese composers, including Unsuk Chin, Jukka Tiensuu, Lou Harrison, Tim Risher, Daníel Bjarnason, Guus Janssen and Christopher Adler. Some believe that Johann Wilde and Pere Amiot traveled to China and brought the first to Europe in 1740 and 1777 respectively, although there is evidence that free reed musical instruments similar to the were known in Europe a century earlier.

==History==

Chinese free-reed wind instruments named and were first mentioned in bone oracle writings dating from the 14th to the 12th centuries BCE, and were identified in later texts as types of . The first appearance of the word is in some of the poems of (&quot;Book of Odes&quot;), dating back . Ancient instruments with gourd wind chambers, varying numbers of pipes, with bamboo or metal reeds have been discovered in archaeological finds at the tomb of the Marquis Yi of Zeng () in present-day Hubei province, and the Han tombs at Mawangdui () in Hunan province.

In the 8th century, three and three were sent to the Japanese court and these have been preserved in the Shōsōin imperial repository in Nara. All the instruments had 17 pipes with a long curving mouthpiece and are very similar to the traditional in use today. However, variants with different numbers of pipes, and chromatic instruments have been documented over the centuries.

===Modern changes===

The kinds of currently used are the products of changes made since the early 20th century that enhanced its sound and volume as well as increasing its range. Early changes were made by Zheng Jinwen (, 1872–1935) who increased the number of pipes to 32, expanding its range and allowing it to play harmony and chords. The air chamber and size of the pipes were also enlarged, changing the tone color of the instrument. Later various changes were also introduced by players such as Weng Zhenfa () and particularly Hu Tianquan (), with different variants of the instrument produced.

==Acoustics and performance==
The &#x27;s reeds vibrate at a fixed frequency unlike single reeds, double reeds, and pointed free reeds which vibrate at the pitch according to the length of the attached air column. Covering the hole(s) on a traditional &#x27;s pipe(s) would cause the entire length of the pipe(s) to resonate with the reeds&#x27; frequency. If the hole is open, the resonant frequency would not match, and hence no sound is produced.

The is sounded by either exhaling or inhaling into the mouthpiece, and players can produce a relatively continuous sound without pause by quickly switching between the two, similarly to playing a harmonica. The traditional performance style is to sound two or three notes at the same time by adding a fifth and/or octave above the main melody note. When a higher note is not available, a lower note a fourth below the main melody note can be played instead.

==Types==
 varieties can be classified into traditional () and keyed () (sometimes also known as &quot;improved &quot; ()). Keyed shengs were only developed in the 20th century, from roughly 1950 onwards.

With more and more hybrid models being introduced, the difference between the two types of are increasingly blurred. However, instruments are generally categorized into either type based on the kind of fingering system that they adopt. This includes (on traditional ) certain notes (namely the leading note, submediant, dominant, followed by tonic) present as a group on the left posterior side. Due to fourth and fifth harmonies being common in traditional repertoire, the fingerings on traditional are optimized for such. As a result, fingerings for traditional tend to look jumbled up, and can vary regionally. Keyed , on the other hand, have sequenced fingerings that allow for easy key changes.

On a traditional , there are holes on the finger pipes which can be covered by the player&#x27;s fingers to sound that particular note. On a keyed , the holes are opened and closed by means of keys or levers. The greater number of pipes combined with the size of the larger instruments makes it impractical to operate newer instruments without keys.

===Traditional ===
The traditional () used in, for example, northern Chinese ritual music, and Jiangnan sizhu ensembles generally have 17 pipes but with only 13 or 14 sounding pipes. Its scale is mainly diatonic, for example the 17-pipe (4 of which are silent decorative pipes) used in Jiangnan sizhu is tuned:

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative c&quot; { a b c cis d e fis g a b cis d}&lt;/score&gt;

With the development of music in mid-20th century China, the underwent changes to increase its range and volume. The had all its 17 pipes fitted with reeds, then the number of pipes increased to 21, and metal tubes were attached to the bamboo pipes to amplify its sound. The other change was the development of the keyed .

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative c&#x27; { d e fis g a b c cis d e f fis g gis a b c cis d e fis}&lt;/score&gt;
Nowadays, traditional are usually only used for solo repertoire, due them not being fully chromatic (and also the fact that certain techniques – like glissandi – can only be achieved on a traditional ). For an orchestra setting, keyed tend to be preferred for being fully chromatic. Many modern traditional do come with some keys for ease of fingering; there are also fully chromatic traditional . These are still known by the blanket term &quot;traditional &quot; due to them retaining the typical traditional -like fingering. Also, traditional are usually held in the player&#x27;s hands when playing, and a 37-reed fully chromatic traditional tends to be too heavy to be held for long performances.

===Keyed ===

Chromatic 24- and 26-reed keyed were common during the 1950s, but current models usually have 32 to 38 reeds. There are four main ranges of keyed , forming a family of soprano, alto, tenor and bass. All are chromatic throughout their range, and equal tempered. They have markedly different fingering from their traditional counterparts, having been redesigned so that key changes can be achieved without cumbersome fingerings. These also differ from their traditional counterparts by the fact that they tend to be placed on the musician&#x27;s lap or on a stand while playing.
====Soprano ====
The soprano () is a 36-reed with a soprano range of G3 to F#6. It primarily uses the treble clef in sounding pitch.

However, to suit the needs of modern repertoire, 38- or even 42-reed have become increasingly prevalent in the late 2010s (those go all the way up to C7). Some models even include levers that allow for sounding of chords (i.e. more than one note is sounded when one lever is depressed).

The Piccolo Sheng is twice as size as soprano sheng but has one octave higher than the soprano sheng

====Alto ====
The alto () is a 36-reed with an alto range of C3 to B5. They sound a perfect 5th lower than soprano . They often sport an additional row of 12 black keys, that plays all 3 pipes corresponding to the same note in different octaves (e.g., pressing the black &quot;C&quot; causes the notes C3, C4 and C5 to be sounded simultaneously). It primarily uses the treble (octave down) and alto clefs (albeit less common as of the late 2010s – notably with Singapore Chinese Orchestra deciding to scribe alto scores in treble clef). The alto variants tend to have a more mellow timbre than the slightly more metallic sounding soprano . While many countries have alto with a range of C3 to B5, some regional variants tend to have a range of G2 to F#5 (i.e. the tenor &#x27;s range).

The alto plays an important role in modern Chinese orchestras, serving to provide chordal accompaniment as well as supplementing lower-pitched instruments like the cello. There are two main form factors of alto in modern Chinese music: the (, lit: &quot;hug &quot;) and the (, lit: &quot; in rows&quot;). The is usually placed on the musician&#x27;s lap; one would reach around to the buttons on its posterior (in effect hugging the instrument, and hence the name). It is cylindrical in nature, and tends to be smaller (i.e. less heavy and bulky) due to the pipes having been engineered to bend inside the body to make effective use of all available space inside the . This, however, presents the drawback of it being difficult to disassemble and reassemble for maintenance or repairs. The on the other hand, is typically placed on a stand. This form is so named as the pipes and resonators are arranged into 3 rows (in a linear manner) instead of a circular fashion. These are commonly seen in school orchestras, as there is a reduced likelihood of it being dropped (since it is placed on a stand), and is less difficult/expensive to repair (due to its simpler layout).

====Tenor ====
The tenor () is a 36-reed with a tenor range of G2 to F5 or F2 to E5 that sound one octave lower than soprano , and primarily uses the tenor clef or treble clef (octave down), and at times the bass clef. This variant tends to have a warmer and richer timbre, despite being less common than its alto counterpart. They are sometimes made with more reeds to cover the alto &#x27;s range as well, and also come in 2 form factors ( and ).
==== Bass ====
The bass () is usually a 32-reed with a bass range of C2 to G4, and primarily uses the bass clef.

These similarly come in two form factors as well: the (, lit. &quot;large row &quot;); a large standing organ-like instrument that comes with or without pedals (the pedals are used to pump air into the instrument like a reed organ), and the (lit. &quot;held &quot;, although it is placed on a stand due to its weight). With the bass , the differences between the 2 variants are more pronounced; bass paisheng tend to require a greater breath volume to play.

The Contrabass Sheng is also used for bass sheng but two octaves lower than the alto sheng and tenor sheng

==== Keyboard ====
In the 21st century, keyboard (), or that have a keyboard layout instead of the typical buttons, have emerged. These can vary from 37-reed all the way to 53-reed ones (if not more like 61), covering a variety of ranges from alto to bass. The keyboard has a range of up to 5 octaves from C2 to C7 just like many modern day pipe organs. Keyboard are considered niche, as very few repertoires make use of the keyboard layout. In fact, many of the chordal parts written for are currently heavily clustered, and as such, a keyboard layout tends to result in slightly cumbersome fingering. However, repertoire written for piano is playable on them.

<doc id="195127" wikidata="Q7644480" url="?curid=195127" title="Supplication">
<text>Supplication (also known as petitioning) is a form of prayer, wherein one party humbly or earnestly asks another party to provide something, either for the party who is doing the supplicating (e.g., &quot;Please spare my life.&quot;) or on behalf of someone else.

==In Classical Greek religion==
Supplication is a theme of earliest antiquity, embodied in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as the prayers of Chryses for the return of his daughter, and of Priam for the dead body of his son, Hector. Richard Martin notes repeated references to supplicants throughout the poem, including warriors begging to be spared by the Greeks on the battlefield.

==In ancient Rome==
In ancient Rome, formal supplication as a request, whether to a private individual or following surrender or military defeat, had four formal steps:

1. Approach: the suppliant approaches the &quot;supplicandus&quot;, the person from whom the request is sought. During the Republican era, this approach was not made at an altar and was not considered a prayer &quot;(prex)&quot; in the technical religious sense.

2. Identification: the suppliant performs conventional gestures or words in order to identify himself.

3. Request: the suppliant states what his request is and may present an argument for why he should receive it.

4. Rejection or acceptance: The supplicandus may reject the request. If he accepts it, he makes a pledge to fulfill it.

The pledge to fulfill the request is the part of the process considered sacred and witnessed by deities including Fides and Jupiter.

In Latin, the word &quot;submissio&quot; more commonly expresses this act than &quot;supplicatio&quot;, which was a form of public prayer procession. In the Imperial era, however, a petition to the emperor for judicial review was called a &quot;supplicatio,&quot; with the term later used for a request that the emperor review a legal judgment that otherwise would not have been subject to appeal.

==In Christianity==
In Christianity, the prayer of supplication for health by and on behalf of the sick is referenced in early Christian writings in the New Testament, especially James 5:13-16.

One example of supplication is the Western Christian ritual of novena (from &quot;novem&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;nine&quot;) wherein one repeatedly asks for the same favor over a period of nine days. This ritual began in Spain during the Middle Ages when a nine-day period of hymns and prayers led up to a Christmas feast, a period which ended with gift giving. A contemporary Christian example of supplication is the practice of the Daily Prayer for Peace by the Community of Christ where a member prays for peace each day at a specified time. Philippians 4:6 says, &quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.&quot;

== In Hinduism ==
In Hinduism, &quot;prārthanā&quot; is the Sanskrit term that denotes the practice of supplication to a deity. It one of the various preparatory rites performed before &quot;pūjā&quot; (ritualistic worship of a deity), performed for the purpose of the purification of the devotee.

==In Islam==
In Islam, the Arabic word &quot;duʻā&quot; (plural &quot;daʿwat&quot; or &quot;ʾadʿiyah&quot;) is used to refer to supplications. &quot;Adʻiya&quot; may be made in any language, although there are many traditional Islamic supplications in Arabic, Persian and Turkish. In Islam, &quot;duʻā&quot; tends to mean supplication. The supplications (Duaas) of Islamic prophets are given in the Quran.
There are a number of supplications mentioned in Islam in the Quran and Sunnah that can be recited for various purposes for the blessings and the rewards of God. Supplications can range in nature for everyday tasks like sleeping, eating, drinking water and can be more specific in nature like supplications for knowledge or supplications for health and more.

The Quran is the most authentic source of supplications and 30 such supplications that are mentioned in the Quran are most commonly recited by Muslims.

==In Sikhism==
The word Ardâs ( ਅਰਦਾਸ ) is derived from the Persian word &#x27;Arazdashat&#x27;, meaning a request, a supplication, a prayer, a petition or an address to a superior authority. It is a Sikh prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily Banis (prayers); or after completion of a service like the Paath, kirtan (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

<doc id="195130" wikidata="Q2172728" url="?curid=195130" title="The Early Show">
<text>The Early Show is an American morning television show that aired on CBS from November 1, 1999, to January 7, 2012, replacing the original incarnation of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, and the ninth attempt at a morning news-talk program by the network since 1954. The program originally broadcast from the General Motors Building in New York City.

&quot;The Early Show&quot;, like many of its predecessors, traditionally placed third in the ratings, behind NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Much like &quot;Today&quot; and its fellow NBC program &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, the &quot;Early Show&quot; title was analogous to that of CBS&#x27;s late-night talk show, &quot;The Late Show&quot;. Unlike CBS&#x27; other attempts at a morning news program (which emphasize hard news), &quot;The Early Show&quot; followed the format of its two other competitors, which have long used a lighter soft news, lifestyle and infotainment approach.

On November 15, 2011, CBS announced the cancellation of &quot;The Early Show&quot;, and replacement by a new morning program that CBS News chairman Jeff Fager and president David Rhodes stated would &quot;redefine the morning television landscape.&quot; &quot;The Early Show&quot; ended its twelve-year run on January 7, 2012, replaced three days later on January 9 by the second version of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;.

==History of CBS&#x27;s morning news shows==
===&quot;The Morning Show&quot; (1954)===
CBS&#x27; first attempt at a morning program debuted on March 15, 1954, with The Morning Show, originally hosted by Walter Cronkite and very similar in format to &quot;Today&quot; (which, like the pioneering NBC morning program, also ran for two hours from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time until it was reduced to one hour to accommodate the premiere of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in 1955). Additional hosts over the years included Jack Paar, John Henry Faulk and Dick Van Dyke. Paar, the most successful of them in drawing an audience, made significant changes in the tone of the program during his tenure as host, casting it into a talk program with some infotainment elements but featuring an emphasis on humor and conversation, reminiscent of the kind of morning radio show he had done prior to World War II. In 1956, Paar was moved from &quot;The Morning Show&quot; to his own late-morning talk program on the network, which aired after &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. (Paar left CBS to take over NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1957.)

====&quot;Good Morning! with Will Rogers Jr.&quot; and another &quot;Morning Show&quot;====
Next came Good Morning! with Will Rogers Jr., which lasted for 14 months before being replaced in April 1957 by a different version of The Morning Show, a variety program hosted by country music singer Jimmy Dean, which ended that December after nine months. The 45-minute program aired at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time; it was followed by a 15-minute news program, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;, anchored by Richard C. Hottelet, and later Stuart Novins, which led into &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; at 8:00 a.m.

===&quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; (1963)===
CBS did not make any serious attempt to program against &quot;Today&quot; for eight years. The CBS Morning News debuted on September 2, 1963; the program was similar in style to its &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; counterpart in that it was also a hard news-focused program, featuring various hosts and correspondents from CBS News over the years. It debuted as a half-hour broadcast anchored by Mike Wallace, who joined the network that year, and aired Monday through Friday at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Coincidentally, it replaced the daytime magazine program &quot;Calendar&quot;, which was hosted by Wallace&#x27;s future &quot;60 Minutes&quot; colleague Harry Reasoner.

In August 1965, CBS decided it could get better ratings by airing reruns of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in the 10:00 a.m. slot. The network moved the &quot;Morning News&quot; to 7:05 a.m. (although most affiliates carried it at 7:30 a.m. on tape delay). Wallace only lasted one more year after the move. Wallace left the program to serve as co-host on the news magazine show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (initially aired bi-weekly in September 1968), which saw him cover topics such as Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968 comeback presidential campaign.

Los Angeles newsman Joseph Benti was selected to replace Wallace. Notably, Benti was at a bar near the CBS Broadcast Center waiting for his shift to start as morning anchor on the early hours of June 6, 1968 when someone came onto the place to say that Robert F. Kennedy had been shot at midnight in California (which was 3:00 a.m in New York), necessitating having to try and get onto the air earlier than expected, complete with reports from Terry Drinkwater that saw Benti joined by Cronkite and Wallace midway through. It was during Joseph Benti&#x27;s run (through August 28, 1970) that the program became the first regularly scheduled one-hour newscast on network television on March 31, 1969. Until 1981, it preceded &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; on CBS&#x27;s morning schedule from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The new hour-long format featured John Hart reading the news headlines from Washington, D.C. and CBS News Moscow correspondent Hughes Rudd as an occasional contributor. After Hart replaced Benti as the main anchor in New York City, the Washington anchor desk was assumed by Bernard Kalb until 1972, and by Nelson Benton for a year afterwards. It was announced in May 1973 that Benton and Hart would be replaced in midsummer.

In an effort to emulate &quot;Today&quot;, which had Barbara Walters as a co-anchor, Rudd was teamed up with former &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter Sally Quinn, who received considerable publicity despite having no prior television experience. The broadcasts did little to shape the ratings beyond third place, with Quinn garnering little enthusiasm. In January 1974, she was put off the anchor desk in favor of contributing &quot;special features and interviews daily from Washington.&quot; Quinn left after the February 1, 1974 telecast. A more experienced correspondent, Bruce Morton, later took over the Washington desk, remaining there until 1977. During that period, the newscast evolved into a straightforward delivery of the morning news, much like Cronkite&#x27;s evening newscast. Despite the anchor turnover through the years, the broadcast set a consistent tone which emphasized news and ideas over celebrity gossip or self-help tips. Following Morton&#x27;s departure, correspondent Barry Serafin took over anchor duties at the Washington desk. Morton and Rudd were each awarded a Peabody Award for their work in 1976. The anchor desk was subsequently shared by the team of Lesley Stahl and Richard Threlkeld (who co-anchored the program from 1977 to 1979), while Morton and Rudd returned to provide feature reports and commentary; Rudd would again leave the program in 1979.

===The &quot;Morning&quot; (1979)===
On Sunday, January 28, 1979, CBS revamped the program, premiering Morning, which was titled in accordance to the day of the week (&quot;Monday Morning&quot;, &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot;, etc.). The weekday &quot;Morning&quot; series competed with &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;. Charles Kuralt hosted Sundays, while Bob Schieffer hosted the rest of the week; Kuralt took over the daily broadcasts as well starting on October 27, 1980.

The program featured long-form pieces from CBS News bureaus, and many viewed it as a highbrow, classy newscast. Despite critical acclaim, the program remained dead last in the ratings, and CBS was under more pressure from affiliates to present a more viable morning competitor, particularly since the Sunday edition did better with viewers. So on September 28, 1981, &quot;Morning&quot; dropped the days of the week from its title (except for &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;), was extended to 90 minutes and added Diane Sawyer as co-host. In the process, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; was reduced to a half-hour daily and pushed to an earlier time period (7:00 a.m.).

===&quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; (1982)===
On January 18, 1982, again at the expense of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Morning&quot; was expanded to the same two-hour format that &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;GMA&quot; were utilizing. Along the way it reassumed the title of The CBS Morning News (not to be confused with CBS&#x27;s earlier morning newscast, the &quot;CBS Early Morning News&quot;, later retitled as the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;). Kuralt was replaced on the weekday broadcasts on March 15, 1982. By this time management decided that morning news programming should be more competitive and hired Bill Kurtis, anchor of the highly rated evening newscasts at WBBM-TV in Chicago, as Sawyer&#x27;s co-host. The Sunday edition of &quot;Morning&quot;, with Kuralt as host, was kept; it remains on the air under its original title, &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; (now hosted by Jane Pauley).

By the fall of 1982, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; had disappeared from the daily schedule, and the new team of Kurtis and Sawyer were anchoring three hours of news in the morning, as they were also seen on the &quot;CBS Early Morning News&quot; an hour earlier.

Their teamwork helped boost the program&#x27;s ratings, albeit briefly; George Merlis, a former &quot;Good Morning America&quot; producer hired to revamp the broadcast, is also credited by most network insiders with nearly doubling viewership numbers for &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; by March 1983. The numbers continued to climb during the summer; during one week in August 1983, it passed &quot;Today&quot; for the second place spot behind &quot;GMA&quot;, and was in closing distance behind the latter program for the #1 spot before it dropped back to third place again. After Merlis was relieved from his duties for his trouble, Sawyer, anxious to move on, left in the fall of 1984 to become the first female correspondent on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

CBS News correspondents Jane Wallace and Meredith Vieira briefly alternated as interim co-host in an on-air try-out that lasted several months, but both were passed over for the permanent spot. Instead, CBS settled for former Miss America and &quot;The NFL Today&quot; co-host Phyllis George, who was given a three-year contract following a mere two-week trial run. Disputes between Kurtis and CBS over his role with George &quot;over matters of journalistic style and substance&quot; led to him leaving the job for WBBM-TV in June.

The lowest point of her very brief tenure came on May 14, 1985, during George&#x27;s interview with false rape accuser Cathleen Mae Webb and the man whom she had falsely accused, Gary Dotson. In an effort to get the two to make amends to each other, George made a simple suggestion: &quot;How about a hug?&quot; Both Webb and Dotson graciously refused. That infamous interview alienated audiences and was blasted by critics, helping to put an unpleasant close to George&#x27;s television career at this initial mark. Once again, Bob Schieffer served as a brief replacement. Phyllis George eventually left CBS for good that fall.

Maria Shriver, who had joined CBS as a West Coast feature reporter in 1983, and Forrest Sawyer, new to the network, were named co-anchors of &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; on August 30, 1985. After a respectable year albeit still placing third in the ratings, Shriver and Sawyer made their last appearance on the program on August 1, 1986, after CBS News president Van Gordon Sauter announced that the early morning time slot would be handed to a newly created unit in the CBS Broadcast Group. Prodded by network affiliates who wanted something lighter than the news-oriented formats it had previously offered, CBS decided that an entertainment format might work better against &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;, and planning began for a new show that would come to be called &quot;The Morning Program&quot;. Bruce Morton and Faith Daniels became the first in a string of substitutes to host &quot;Morning News&quot; until it left the air. With the loss of what had been its biggest block of air time in one form or another for two decades, dozens of employees were laid off, a factor that cost Sauter his job.

In an August 1986 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, columnist Jonathan Alter wrote regarding the move, &quot;&quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; was simply shot dead. Underappreciated co-anchors Forrest Sawyer and Maria Shriver left the air with a classy farewell after the network&#x27;s announcement that the perennially lagging show would be canceled by the end of the year.&quot;

Tom Shales reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;throughout the industry there is shock and derision for the way CBS has handled [the] &quot;Morning News,&quot; so long its problem child. Competitors are saying the &quot;Morning News&quot; fiasco is a symptom of a new disarray in CBS News, and some question whether current CBS News executives will all be able to ride out the storm.&quot;

===&quot;The Morning Program&quot; (1987)===

On January 12, 1987, The Morning Program made its debut hosted by actress Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, former longtime anchor at WCBS-TV in New York City. Radio personality Mark McEwen handled the weather, while comedian Bob Saget did comedy bits. Produced by a newly created division, the show ran for 90 minutes (7:30 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific, 6:30 to 8:00 a.m. Central and Mountain) behind a briefly expanded 90-minute &quot;CBS Early Morning News&quot; broadcast (6:00 to 7:30 a.m. local; although most larger-market affiliates pre-empted all or part of the 6:00 a.m. hour to carry a locally produced morning newscast), which had dropped &quot;Early&quot; from its title.

However, &quot;The Morning Program&quot;, with its awkward mix of news, entertainment and comedy, became the joke of the industry, receiving scathing reviews; Hartley in particular was panned by critics. After its first week garnered a 3.1 rating, it dropped deep into last place and never recovered. At one point, it generated a mere 10 percent share, the lowest ratings that CBS had seen in the morning slot in five years. The show was also dragging down ratings for the syndicated programming that most affiliates aired in the 9:00 Eastern and Pacific/8:00 Central and Mountain slot. While they had wanted lighter fare in the morning, &quot;The Morning Program&quot; was far lighter than even they had anticipated. Many of them were threatening to preempt the show unless changes were made (for instance, CBS affiliate KKTV in Colorado Springs, Colorado replaced the morning block with syndicated cartoon programming). CBS patriarch William S. Paley quickly soured on the show, saying it was too &quot;theatrical&quot; for that time of day. Finally, on September 28, 1987, CBS announced it would cancel the show in November and return the time slot to the news division after a 10½-month run. Hartley and Smith were dumped (the former departed the program two weeks early and was replaced by Sandy Hill, who had formerly co-hosted &quot;Good Morning America&quot;), while Saget left to star on the ABC sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;. A longtime producer summed up this version of the program upon its demise by saying, &quot;...everyone thought we had the lowest ratings you could have in the morning. &quot;The Morning Program&quot; proved us wrong&quot;.

===&quot;CBS This Morning&quot; (1987)===

On November 30, 1987, &quot;The Morning Program&quot; was replaced by the original &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. It lasted for twelve years, staying in third place for its entire run. However, it was far more competitive than its predecessors had ever been (with the aforementioned KKTV, after previously dropping &quot;The Morning Program&quot;, beginning to air &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; in early 1989).

By May 1999, CBS had managed to corral Bryant Gumbel to be a host on the morning show, although he did not join the program until after its cancellation; at the time, it was reported that the CBS morning show had averaged slightly below three million viewers on average, with ABC being second at 3.7 million and &quot;Today&quot; being number one with 6.1 million. It ended on October 29, 1999 and was replaced by &quot;The Early Show&quot;. In 2012, the second iteration of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; replaced &quot;The Early Show&quot;.

==History==
===Gumbel, Clayson, McEwen and Chen (November 1, 1999–2002)===
&quot;The Early Show&quot; began on November 1, 1999 (around the time when Viacom, a former CBS division, had purchased the network) when CBS executives successfully lured former &quot;Today&quot; host Bryant Gumbel to head up the broadcast, teamed with ABC News correspondent Jane Clayson. Unlike with &quot;This Morning&quot;, CBS asked its affiliates to carry the two-hour program in its entirety. Julie Chen read the news, while Mark McEwen of &quot;Live by Request&quot;, the sole holdover from &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, did the weather. Initial ratings were not encouraging, and were actually lower than those of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. Gumbel left on May 17, 2002, and shortly thereafter Clayson and McEwen were replaced.

Clayson may be best known for her awkward confrontation with &quot;Early Show&quot; food and style contributor Martha Stewart during this period; Stewart was involved in the ImClone stock trading case, but retained her &quot;Early Show&quot; contributor duties during the initial stages of the controversy. CBS required Stewart to address the issue as a condition of keeping those contributor duties. Stewart, upon consulting her legal team, agreed to take questions on-air, but not in a separate interview. As a result, during one of Stewart&#x27;s usual live cooking segments (in June 2002), Clayson, who normally assisted Stewart with preparing the meal, asked her to comment on her involvement with ImClone and her selling of company stock just one day before an application for a new cancer drug developed by the pharmaceutical company was rejected by the Food and Drug Administration; a visibly uncomfortable Stewart, obsessively chopping vegetables for a salad, evaded Clayson&#x27;s questions, citing her inability to comment on an ongoing investigation (Stewart was indicted in 2003, tried and convicted in 2004, and served five months in federal prison for her involvement in the case). Stewart stopped contributing to the program after the appearance, which was immortalized in an NBC TV-movie of Stewart&#x27;s life that aired a few months later (with Cybill Shepherd playing the role of Stewart).

===Smith, Storm, Chen, Syler and Price (October 2002–December 2006)===
On October 28, 2002, &quot;The Early Show&quot; overhauled its hosting staff. The new team consisted of Chen, Harry Smith (former host of &quot;Biography&quot; and &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;), Hannah Storm (former commentator for NBC Sports), Rene Syler (who joined the program after serving as a news anchor at CBS&#x27; owned-and-operated station KTVT in Dallas), and weatherman Dave Price (joining the program after a run as a morning meteorologist at New York City Fox O&amp;O WNYW), who also worked at WCBS-TV for some time after joining &quot;The Early Show&quot;. To keep affiliates happy, CBS went back to the local/national hybrid format originated on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; in 1997. The program also had a number of &quot;correspondents&quot; who conducted short segments on specific issues, including Martha Stewart (until not long after the aforementioned segment with Jane Clayson), Martha Quinn, Bobby Flay and Bob Vila, among others. In 2004, Susan Koeppen became the program&#x27;s consumer correspondent.

On October 30, 2006, &quot;The Early Show&quot; received a revamp, featuring new graphics (with a new blue and orange color scheme instead of blue and yellow) and music similar to that used on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; (which were also rolled out on &quot;Up to the Minute&quot; and the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; in early October). On December 4, 2006, it was announced that Rene Syler would leave the show by the end of the month; her last show was December 22, 2006.

===Smith, Storm, Chen, Mitchell, and Price (December 2006–December 2007)===
On December 7, 2006, CBS News named Russ Mitchell (who had been co-anchor of the program&#x27;s Saturday edition since its inception as &quot;CBS News Saturday Morning&quot; in 1997) as the news anchor for the program starting January 2, 2007. On November 28, 2007, it was announced that Hannah Storm was leaving as the program&#x27;s co-anchor; her last day was December 7, 2007.

===Smith, Rodriguez, Chen, Mitchell and Price (January 2008–January 2010)===
On December 5, 2007, CBS announced that Maggie Rodriguez (who had joined the program earlier that year as anchor of its Saturday edition) would succeed Storm as co-anchor. During that month, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; shared its studio/set with &quot;The Early Show&quot;. &quot;The Early Show&quot; itself debuted a new set on January 7, 2008, when it also abandoned the aforementioned local/national hybrid format, opting to require its stations carry the entire two-hour broadcast. Ratings for &quot;The Early Show&quot; dropped with the institution of these changes. However, the gap between the program and second-place &quot;Good Morning America&quot; remained virtually consistent as all three morning shows saw similar ratings erosion.

On April 16, &quot;The Early Show&quot; scored a coup with the broadcast of a live musical performance by Susan Boyle. &quot;The Early Show&quot; enjoyed a relatively successful May sweeps, racking up a 5% increase in total viewership year-to-year while remaining flat in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, at a time when both &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot; were shedding viewers to the tune of 3 and 4% respectively.

Howard Kurtz&#x27;s &quot;Washington Post&quot; profile of CBS &quot;Early Show&quot; co-host Maggie Rodriguez said her addition to the program accounts for &quot;an uptick in the ratings, lifting spirits at the broadcast&quot;. Rodriguez landed some high-profile interviews with the grandparents of Caylee Anthony, Levi Johnston, and disgraced former Roman Catholic priest Alberto Cutié, who later became an Episcopal minister. Rodriguez stated that &quot;If [I] were to program a show for my viewing pleasure, I would make it all news ...[B]ut we&#x27;re programming for all of America. We have to include Jon and Kate — regardless of whether I personally care, they&#x27;re on the cover of every magazine. You can&#x27;t be so highbrow that you only cover hard news. I&#x27;m not a journalistic snob.&quot; In addition to her duties on the morning show, Rodriguez regularly filled in for Katie Couric on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

On January 13, 2010, CBS announced that news anchor Russ Mitchell would exit &quot;The Early Show&quot; at the end of the week, leaving a gap in the program&#x27;s anchor lineup. He became the national correspondent for CBS and would remain as anchor of the Sunday edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. Around this time, Koeppen left &quot;The Early Show&quot; to become a primary news anchor for CBS-owned KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh; her spot as consumer correspondent was not replaced.

===Smith, Rodriguez, Chen, Hill and Price (January–December 2010)===
In January 2010, Erica Hill became the program&#x27;s news update anchor, joining Smith, Rodriguez, Price and now features correspondent Chen.

&quot;The Early Show&quot; became the last morning network news/talk program to begin broadcasting in high definition on April 26, 2010. The &quot;Evening News&quot; control room was to be used to base the program, as construction was under way for a new control room for &quot;The Early Show&quot; at the General Motors Building. New graphics were now overlaid to accommodate added screen space, and were also used throughout other CBS News programs.

===Wragge, Hill, Chen, Glor and Castro (January–September 2011)===
Smith, Price and Rodriguez were fired from the program in November 2010. Erica Hill and Chris Wragge (who previously anchored the Saturday edition) were appointed as anchors of the weekday &quot;Early Show&quot; on January 3, 2011. Marysol Castro was also added as a weather anchor, replacing Dave Price; while Julie Chen remained a part of the staff, presenting additional feature stories, with Jeff Glor taking Hill&#x27;s spot as news anchor. Chen, the wife of CBS President &amp; CEO Les Moonves, was the only one to stay with the program since its inception before leaving the full-time anchor position to become host of &quot;The Talk&quot; in late 2010; however, she remained with &quot;The Early Show&quot; as a special contributing anchor.

In March 2011, the program introduced a redesigned set, which included a new anchor desk backdrop, a new reporter area and a blue color scheme. On September 2, 2011, it was announced that Marysol Castro would be leaving her post as weather anchor effective immediately.

===Wragge, Hill and Glor (September 2011–January 2012)===
After Castro&#x27;s departure, the hosts had cut directly to local CBS affiliates to provide forecast cut-ins (with a narrated national outlook available to stations that did not provide cut-ins due to the absence of a news department), making CBS the only one of the three major broadcast morning shows without a national forecast segment.

In 2011, the program had begun focusing on hard news in contrast to the other network morning news programs, which show a mix of hard news, lighter news and infotainment. Coverage consisted of national and international news, including occasional town halls with political leaders and in-depth coverage of major events.

====Cancellation and final broadcast====
On November 15, 2011, CBS News announced &quot;The Early Show&quot; would be cancelled, and replaced by a new hard news and interview-focused program on January 9, 2012. The new program&#x27;s title was announced on December 1, as &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. Erica Hill was the only holdover from &quot;The Early Show&quot; that became part of the new program, joined by Charlie Rose and Gayle King; Hill was replaced by then-CBS News Washington D.C. correspondent Norah O&#x27;Donnell in July 2012 (Hill subsequently became a co-anchor of the weekend edition of &quot;Today&quot;).

Chris Wragge returned to WCBS-TV as an anchor; originally co-anchoring on both WCBS&#x27; 6:00 p.m. newscast and sister station WLNY-TV&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. newscast, before being moved to WCBS&#x27; weekday morning and noon newscasts in 2013. Jeff Glor now appears on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; as a special correspondent, and became the Sunday evening &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor on January 15, 2012 following Russ Mitchell&#x27;s departure to become the lead anchor at WKYC-TV in Cleveland.

The final edition of &quot;The Early Show&quot; aired on January 7, 2012, with that week&#x27;s final Saturday edition being broadcast from the set of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; at CBS Broadcast Center, anchored by Rebecca Jarvis, news anchor Betty Nguyen and weather anchor Lonnie Quinn.

==Saturday edition==
Alongside the relaunch of the weekday program as &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;CBS News Saturday Morning&quot;, which had debuted in 1997, was also relocated to the General Motors Building and renamed &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot;. In 2008, the title of the Saturday program was shortened to &quot;The Early Show&quot;, fully in line with the weekday program. Anchors of the Saturday edition during this era included Russ Mitchell (1999-2007 and 2011), Thalia Assuras (1999–2002), Gretchen Carlson (2002–2005), Tracy Smith (2005–2007), Chris Wragge and Erica Hill (both 2008-10), and Rebecca Jarvis (2010 and 2011–12), alongside weather anchors Ira Joe Fisher (1999-2006) and Lonnie Quinn (2006–12).

Unlike its competitors &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot; did not have a Sunday edition, due to the continued success of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, which maintained a distinct newsmagazine format with long-form feature reports and in-depth interview segments.

==Ratings==
CBS has been the perennial third-place finisher in the morning race since 1976, placing second only a few times in the past 30 years. CBS surpassed ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; for second place during the weeks of January 17, 1977 and December 28, 1998, running behind first-place &quot;Today&quot; which was in first place both times. However, &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; outrated &quot;Today&quot;, then often in second place (with &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in first), for a few weeks in 1984 while &quot;Today&quot; co-host Jane Pauley was on maternity leave.

In September 2007, CBS sought to get &quot;The Early Show&quot; out of the ratings basement by hiring Shelley Ross, who previously served as executive producer of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 1999 to 2004. Significant changes were made to the program as Ross asserted her influence; on January 7, 2008, the network began requiring affiliates to air the program in its entirety, ending the local-national hybrid format and restricting the local news inserts to :25 and :55 minutes past the hour. CBS reportedly viewed the removal of those breaks as vital to creating a national profile for the program.

However, some CBS affiliates continued to air the entire program on a sister station in order to continue to airing a locally produced morning newscast during &quot;The Early Show&quot;″s timeslot; WWL-TV in New Orleans never aired &quot;The Early Show&quot;, any of its previous versions or its successor &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, opting to instead air the final two hours of its &quot;Eyewitness Morning News&quot; broadcast from 5:00 to 9:00 a.m. instead; however after former owner Belo acquired that station in 2007, &quot;The Early Show&quot; began airing in New Orleans on MyNetworkTV affiliate WUPL. WKRC-TV in Cincinnati began airing the full two-hour &quot;Early Show&quot; broadcast, while moving the third hour of its local morning newscast to the station&#x27;s CW-affiliated subchannel. Salt Lake City&#x27;s KUTV (which was formerly owned by the network until 2007) continued to preempt the program&#x27;s first hour despite the network&#x27;s insistence. KOTV in Tulsa and WFMY in Greensboro, North Carolina began airing the program in its entirety on a one-hour delay at 8:00 a.m. to accommodate a 7:00 a.m. hour of their local newscasts (in the case of KOTV, it chose to move the 8:00 a.m. hour of its morning newscast to its CW-affiliated sister station KQCW to comply with the new requirements).

Industry insiders considered Shelley Ross&#x27; influence to be a serious threat to raising the profile of the program to turn it into a true competitor to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. However, Ross was fired as executive producer after only six months, following frequent feuds with staff (particularly Smith and Chen), who reportedly informed management that either Ross would have to go or they would resign on their own.

Despite the change in staff in 2011, the program remained mired in third place, with a total average viewership of around 2 to 2.5 million viewers per week. The program also faced pressure from network management to take advantage of the redefining of CBS News as more of a hard news organization after the end of Katie Couric&#x27;s tenure at the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, asking the program&#x27;s staff to take advantage of stories presented on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and expand upon them on the morning program rather than following the lead of &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;GMA&quot; to the letter.

==Theme music==
The debut theme for &quot;The Early Show&quot; was a typical opener for an American morning news program. Created by Chris Bowman, the song was called &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Bowman created two versions of the song that were used until 2002 when Bryant Gumbel left the show. When the show reformatted with new hosts and set, an instrumental version of the same-titled track from Sting&#x27;s 1999 hit album, &quot;Brand New Day&quot; until late October 2006, when it was replaced by a variant of the James Horner theme originally composed that year for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. On January 7, 2008, as part of CBS&#x27;s attempt to relaunch the show with new hosts and set, an updated version of Horner&#x27;s composition was introduced; the theme was modified a number of times after the format change. On June 27, 2011, &quot;The Early Show&quot; began using a slower-tempoed version of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; theme by Trivers-Myers Music (the original version of which was first used on the evening news program from 1987 to 1991, before being revived in 2011 upon Scott Pelley taking over as anchor of the broadcast).

==International broadcasts==
In Australia, &quot;The Early Show&quot; aired on Network 10 on weekday mornings from 4.00 a.m. under the title &quot;The CBS Early Show&quot;, with the Friday edition being held over to the following Monday. A national weather map of Australia was inserted during local affiliate weather cutaways; however, no local news segments were inserted into the broadcast. Unlike the Seven Network&#x27;s airing of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and the Nine Network&#x27;s airing of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot; was not condensed or edited for broadcast by Ten. It was, however, pre-empted in most regional areas in favor of paid and religious programming.

==Awards==
In 2010, &quot;The Early Show&quot; was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for &quot;Outstanding TV Journalism Segment&quot; for the segment &quot;Reverend&#x27;s Revelation: Minister Speaks Out About Being Transgender&quot;.

<text>CBS News Mornings is an American early-morning news broadcast presented weekdays on the CBS television network. The program features late-breaking news stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. Since October 7, 2024, the program has been anchored by Michael George during early editions and Errol Barnett at 7 a.m. ET. 

The program is broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, preceding local news beginning at 4:30 a.m. on many CBS stations. It is transmitted in a continuous half-hour broadcast delay loop until 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, when &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; begin in the Pacific Time Zone. In the few markets where the station does not produce a morning newscast, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;. Some CBS stations (such as WAKA in Montgomery, Alabama, which still does not air it today) were forced to pre-empt the program when they implemented it less than two months earlier. The show is updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, while stations throughout the network will join &quot;CBS Mornings&quot; in all time zones past that time at their local discretion or network orders for live coverage.

==History==

===Background===
The &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; title was originally used as the name of a conventional morning news program that served as a predecessor to the network&#x27;s current &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;. For most of the 1960s and 1970s, the program aired as a 60-minute hard news broadcast at 7:00 a.m., preceding &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; and airing opposite the first hour of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. Walter Cronkite and sportscaster Jim McKay both anchored the original &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; at one time. Joseph Benti became the anchor in 1969. Other anchors of the broadcast in this format included John Hart, Hughes Rudd, Sally Quinn, Richard Threlkeld, Lesley Stahl and Bruce Morton.

===&quot;CBS Early Morning News&quot;/current &quot;Morning News&quot; format===
The program first aired in its current format on October 4, 1982 as the CBS Early Morning News. It was a half-hour extension of the two-hour &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; which aired directly opposite &quot;Today&quot;. Bill Kurtis and Diane Sawyer originally anchored both the &quot;Early Morning News&quot; and the &quot;Morning News&quot; of that era. Sawyer departed both programs in mid-1984, to be named a correspondent for &quot;60 Minutes&quot; later that year. In her absence, Kurtis was joined by a rotating series of co-hosts, principally Maria Shriver, Meredith Vieira and Jane Wallace.

Kurtis anchored the &quot;Early Morning News&quot; solo until March 1985, while co-anchoring the &quot;Morning News&quot; with Phyllis George until July of that year. Faith Daniels took over and would remain on the anchor desk, most of the time sharing the role with Forrest Sawyer (July to December 1985 and January to September 1987) and later Douglas Edwards and Charles Osgood, until Daniels left CBS to become anchor of competing early-morning newscast &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot; in 1990. The program would drop &quot;Early&quot; from its title in January 1987, assuming the name previously used by the network&#x27;s flagship morning broadcast, which had been cancelled and replaced by the critically panned news/entertainment/comedy show &quot;The Morning Program&quot; (which itself was cancelled after 10½ months in favor of the more traditional &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;); the renamed &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; also briefly expanded into a 90-minute broadcast (6:00 to 7:30 a.m. local), although affiliates in several larger markets chose to preempt all or part of the first hour to accommodate their local morning newscasts.

Osgood would remain anchor of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; until June 1992, paired with Victoria Corderi from 1990 to 1991, Giselle Fernández through February 1992, and then with Meredith Vieira for the remainder of Osgood&#x27;s run as co-anchor. After Osgood left the program in 1992, the anchor turnover continued. The program continued to maintain a two-anchor format until Thalia Assuras was appointed as anchor of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; in 1998, at which point the program switched to a single-anchor format, which it has had ever since. In March 2009, when Michelle Gielan was named anchor of &quot;Up to the Minute&quot;, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; became integrated with the overnight news program, using the same anchors on both programs.

In November 2010, &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; became the third and final early morning news program to begin broadcasting in high-definition television; its counterpart, &quot;Up to the Minute&quot;, continued to be broadcast in standard-definition television until November 2012, when the program converted to high definition. In November 2012, production of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; and &quot;Up to the Minute&quot; relocated in the CBS Broadcast Center. The &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; moved to the studio of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, and &quot;Up to the Minute&quot; was moved to the Studio 57 facility, the same studio where &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; was also broadcast, until its cancellation on September 18, 2015.

On September 21, 2015, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; relocated to the CBSN newsroom and adopted new graphics based on those of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; (after having previously aligned itself with the branding of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;). Concurrently, &quot;Up to the Minute&quot; was replaced the same day by the &quot;CBS Overnight News.&quot;

On March 11, 2020, the CBS Broadcast Center was temporarily closed after a number of CBS News staffers tested positive for COVID-19. While CBS News did attempt to reopen the Broadcast Center with minimal crews following a thorough decontamination and cleaning, a second shutdown on March 18, along with directives by CBS News President Susan Zirinsky in the wake of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television resulted in dramatic changes to many of CBS News&#x27;s programs and operations. CBSN had itself experienced major issues in both producing a normal schedule, with its operations largely being outsourced temporarily to its CBS Television Stations, and with producing programs for CBS News.

While CBS News did attempt to produce the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; with limited staff and graphics from its Washington, D.C. bureau the following week, it became impossible to consistently produce the program under their normal standards, and as a result production of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; was temporarily suspended beginning on March 24, 2020, with a repeat of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; or local newscasts or programming taking its place. On August 31, 2020, nearly six months after the pandemic began, production of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; resumed with its primary anchor, Anne-Marie Green, anchoring from her home studio.

On September 8, 2021, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; was updated to match the branding of &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, which replaced &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; around the same time. On February 5, 2024, the program was retitled CBS News Mornings, in conjunction with a graphics update on &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;. The title itself was originally used by the CBS News streaming channel for its weekday 7:00 a.m. ET newswheel, which itself rebranded from &quot;CBSN AM&quot; in 2021; the 7:00 hour then became a half-hour show titled &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; now anchored by Errol Barnett.

<doc id="195132" wikidata="Q3799162" url="?curid=195132" title="Negligible set">
<text>In mathematics, a negligible set is a set that is small enough that it can be ignored for some purpose.
As common examples, finite sets can be ignored when studying the limit of a sequence, and null sets can be ignored when studying the integral of a measurable function.

Negligible sets define several useful concepts that can be applied in various situations, such as truth almost everywhere.
In order for these to work, it is generally only necessary that the negligible sets form an ideal; that is, that the empty set be negligible, the union of two negligible sets be negligible, and any subset of a negligible set be negligible.
For some purposes, we also need this ideal to be a sigma-ideal, so that countable unions of negligible sets are also negligible.
If and are both ideals of subsets of the same set , then one may speak of &quot;-negligible&quot; and &quot;-negligible&quot; subsets.

The opposite of a negligible set is a generic property, which has various forms.

== Examples ==

Let &quot;X&quot; be the set N of natural numbers, and let a subset of N be negligible if it is finite.
Then the negligible sets form an ideal.
This idea can be applied to any infinite set; but if applied to a finite set, every subset will be negligible, which is not a very useful notion.

Or let &quot;X&quot; be an uncountable set, and let a subset of &quot;X&quot; be negligible if it is countable.
Then the negligible sets form a sigma-ideal.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a measurable space equipped with a measure &quot;m,&quot; and let a subset of &quot;X&quot; be negligible if it is &quot;m&quot;-null.
Then the negligible sets form a sigma-ideal.
Every sigma-ideal on &quot;X&quot; can be recovered in this way by placing a suitable measure on &quot;X&quot;, although the measure may be rather pathological.

Let &quot;X&quot; be the set R of real numbers, and let a subset &quot;A&quot; of R be negligible if for each ε &gt; 0, there exists a finite or countable collection &quot;I&quot;1, &quot;I&quot;2, … of (possibly overlapping) intervals satisfying:

: formula_1

and

: formula_2

This is a special case of the preceding example, using Lebesgue measure, but described in elementary terms.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space, and let a subset be negligible if it is of first category, that is, if it is a countable union of nowhere-dense sets (where a set is nowhere-dense if it is not dense in any open set).
Then the negligible sets form a sigma-ideal.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a directed set, and let a subset of &quot;X&quot; be negligible if it has an upper bound.
Then the negligible sets form an ideal.
The first example is a special case of this using the usual ordering of &quot;N&quot;.

In a coarse structure, the controlled sets are negligible.

==Derived concepts==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a set, and let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal of negligible subsets of &quot;X&quot;.
If &quot;p&quot; is a proposition about the elements of &quot;X&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; is true &quot;almost everywhere&quot; if the set of points where &quot;p&quot; is true is the complement of a negligible set.
That is, &quot;p&quot; may not always be true, but it&#x27;s false so rarely that this can be ignored for the purposes at hand.

If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are functions from &quot;X&quot; to the same space &quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are &quot;equivalent&quot; if they are equal almost everywhere.
To make the introductory paragraph precise, then, let &quot;X&quot; be N, and let the negligible sets be the finite sets.
Then &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are sequences.
If &quot;Y&quot; is a topological space, then &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; have the same limit, or both have none.
(When you generalise this to a directed sets, you get the same result, but for nets.)
Or, let &quot;X&quot; be a measure space, and let negligible sets be the null sets.
If &quot;Y&quot; is the real line R, then either &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; have the same integral, or neither integral is defined.

<text>A bicycle frame is the main component of a bicycle, onto which wheels and other components are fitted. The modern and most common frame design for an upright bicycle is based on the safety bicycle, and consists of two triangles: a main triangle and a paired rear triangle. This is known as the &quot;diamond frame&quot;. Frames are required to be strong, stiff and light, which they do by combining different materials and shapes.

A frameset consists of the frame and fork of a bicycle and sometimes includes the headset and seat post. Frame builders will often produce the frame and fork together as a paired set.

==Variations==

Besides the ubiquitous diamond frame, many different frame types have been developed for the bicycle, several of which are still in common use today.

===Diamond===
In the diamond frame, the main &quot;triangle&quot; is not actually a triangle because it consists of four tubes: the head tube, top tube, down tube and seat tube. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube joined by paired chain stays and seat stays.

The head tube contains the headset, the interface with the fork. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top. The top tube may be positioned horizontally (parallel to the ground), or it may slope downwards towards the seat tube for additional stand-over clearance. The down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket shell.

The rear triangle connects to the rear fork ends, where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run connecting the bottom bracket to the rear fork ends. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

===Step-through===

Historically, bicycle frames designed for women had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height. This was to allow the rider to dismount while wearing a skirt or dress. The design has since been used in unisex utility bikes to facilitate easy mounting and dismounting, and is also known as a step-through frame or an open frame. Another style that accomplishes similar results is the mixte.

===Cantilever===
In a cantilever bicycle frame the seat stays continue past the seat post and curve downwards to meet with the down tube. Cantilever frames are popular on the cruiser bicycle, the lowrider bicycle, and the wheelie bike. In many cantilever frames the only straight tubes are the seat tube and the head tube.

===Recumbent===

The recumbent bicycle moves the cranks to a position forward of the rider instead of underneath, generally improving the slipstream around the rider without the characteristic sharp bend at the waist used by racers of diamond-frame bicycles. Banned from bicycle racing in France in 1934 to avoid rendering diamond-frame bicycles obsolete in racing, manufacturing of recumbent bicycles remained depressed for another half century, but many models from a range of manufacturers were available by 2000.

===Prone===
The uncommon prone bike moves the cranks to the rear of the rider, resulting in a head-forward, chest-down riding position.

===Cross or girder===
A cross frame consists mainly of two tubes that form a cross: a seat tube from the bottom bracket to the saddle, and a backbone from the head tube to the rear hub.

===Truss===
A truss frame uses additional tubes to form a truss. Examples include Humbers, Pedersens, and the one pictured.

===Monocoque===
A monocoque frame consists only of a hollow shell with no internal structure.

===Folding===

Folding bicycle frames are characterized by the ability to fold into a compact shape for transportation or storage.

===Penny-farthing===
Penny-farthing frames are characterized by a large front wheel and a small rear wheel.

===Tandem and sociable===
Tandem and sociable frames support multiple riders.

===Others===
There are many variations on the basic diamond frame design.
*Frames without seat tubes, such as the Trek Y-Foil, the Zipp 2001, the Kestrel Airfoil, and most frames by Softride.
*Frames without top tubes such as &quot;Old Faithful&quot; by Graeme Obree.
*Frames that use cables for members that are only under tension, such as the Dursley Pedersen bicycle pictured, the Pocket Bicycle, the 2009 Viva Wire, the Wire Bike from designer Ionut Predescu, or the Slingshot Bicycles fold-tech series.
*Frames with hoops replacing the seat tube, chain stays and seat stays: called &quot;roundtail&quot;s.
* The elevated chain stay bicycle was popular in the early 90s. It featured a rear triangle with elevated bottom frame stays, negating the need for the chain to be drawn through the rear frame. This allowed for a shorter wheelbase and improved handling during technical ascents, at the cost of compromised integrity and resultant increased bottom bracket flex (unless reinforced) compared to a frame with traditional chain stays.

The cycle types article describes additional variations.

It is also possible to add couplers either during manufacturing or as a retrofit so that the frame can be disassembled into smaller pieces to facilitate packing and travel.

==Frame tubes==
The diamond frame consists of two triangles, a main triangle and a paired rear triangle. The main triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube and seat tube. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube, and paired chain stays and seat stays.

===Head tube===

The head tube contains the headset, the bearings for the fork via its steerer tube. In an integrated headset, cartridge bearings interface directly with the surface on the inside of the head tube, on non-integrated headsets the bearings (in a cartridge or not) interface with &quot;cups&quot; pressed into the head tube.

===Top tube===

The top tube, or cross-bar, connects the top of the head tube to the top of the seat tube.

In a traditional-geometry diamond frame, the top tube is horizontal (parallel to the ground). In a compact-geometry frame, the top tube is normally sloped downward toward the seat tube for additional standover clearance. In a mountain bike frame, the top tube is almost always sloped downward toward the seat tube. Radically sloped top tubes that compromise the integrity of the traditional diamond frame may require additional gusseting tubes, alternative frame construction, or different materials for equivalent strength. (&quot;See Road and triathlon bicycles for more information on geometries.&quot;)

Step-through frames usually have a top tube that slopes down steeply to allow the rider to mount and dismount the bicycle more easily. Alternative step-through designs may include leaving out the top tube out completely, as in monocoque mainframe designs using a separated or hinged seat tube, and twin top tubes that continue to the rear fork ends as with the mixte frame. These alternatives to the diamond frame provide greater versatility, though at the expense of added weight to achieve equivalent strength and rigidity.

Control cables are routed along mounts on the top tube, or sometimes inside the top tube. Most commonly, this includes the cable for the rear brake, but some mountain bikes and hybrid bicycles also route the front and rear derailleur cables along the top tube. Inside routing, once only present in the highest price ranges, protects the cables from damage and dirt, which can e.g. make gear shifting unreliable.

The space between the top tube and the rider&#x27;s groin while straddling the bike and standing on the ground is called clearance. The total height from the ground to this point is called the height lever.

===Down tube===
The down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket shell. On racing bicycles and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the down tube, or inside the down tube. On older racing bicycles, the shift levers were mounted on the down tube. On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.

Bottle cage mounts are also on the down tube, usually on the top side, sometimes also on the bottom side. In addition to bottle cages, small air pumps may be fitted to these mounts as well.

===Seat tube===
The seat tube contains the seatpost of the bike, which connects to the saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the seatpost is inserted into the seat tube. On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick release lever. The seatpost must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a &quot;minimum insertion mark&quot;.

The seat tube also may have braze-on mounts for a bottle cage or front derailleur.

===Chain stays===
The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket shell (which holds the axis around which the pedals and cranks rotate) to the rear fork ends or dropouts. A shorter chain stay generally means that the bike will accelerate faster and be easier to ride uphill, at least while the rider can avoid the front wheel losing contact with the ground.

When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along the chain stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will be attached to the chain stays. There may be a small brace that connects the chain stays in front of the rear wheel and behind the bottom bracket shell, called a &quot;chainstay bridge&quot;.

Chain stays may be designed using tapered or untapered tubing. They may be relieved, ovalized, crimped, S-shaped, or elevated to allow additional clearance for the rear wheel, chain, crankarms, or the heel of the foot.

===Seat stays===

The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork dropouts. A traditional frame uses a simple set of paralleled tubes connected by a bridge above the rear wheel. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the top tube, it is also usually routed along the seat stay.

Many alternatives to the traditional seat stay design have been introduced over the years. A style of seat stay that extends forward of the seat tube, below the rear end of the top tube and connects to the top tube in front of the seat tube, creating a small triangle, is called a &quot;Hellenic&quot; stay after the British frame builder Fred Hellens, who introduced them in 1923. &quot;Hellenic&quot; seat stays add aesthetic appeal at the expense of added weight. This style of seat stay was popularized again in the late 20th century by GT Bicycles (under the moniker &quot;triple triangle&quot;), who had incorporated the design element into their BMX frames, as it also made for a much stiffer rear triangle (an advantage in races); this design element has also been used on their mountain bike frames for similar reasons.

In 2012, a variation of the traditional seat stay that bypasses the seat tube and connects further into the top tube was patented by Volagi Cycles. This frame element added length to the traditional design of seat stays, making a softer ride at the sacrifice of frame stiffness.

Another common seat stay variant is the &quot;wishbone&quot;, &quot;single seat stay&quot;, or &quot;mono stay&quot;, which joins the stays together just above the rear wheel into a monotube that is joined to the seat tube. A wishbone design adds vertical rigidity without increasing lateral stiffness, generally an undesirable trait for bicycles with unsuspended rear wheels. The wishbone design is most appropriate when used as part of a rear triangle subframe on a bicycle with independent rear suspension.

A &quot;dual seat stay&quot; refers to seat stays which meet the front triangle of the bicycle at two separate points, usually side-by-side.

&quot;Fastback&quot; seat stays meet the seat tube at the back instead of the sides of the tube.

On most seat stays, a bridge or brace is typically used to connect the stays above the rear wheel and below the connection with the seat tube. Besides providing lateral rigidity, this bridge provides a mounting point for rear brakes, fenders, and racks. The seat stays themselves may also be fitted with brake mounts. Brake mounts are often absent from fixed-gear or track bike seat stays.

===Bottom bracket shell===
The bottom bracket shell is a short and large diameter tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle&#x27;s chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the bottom bracket shell.

There are a few traditional standard shell widths (68, 70 or 73 mm). Road bikes usually use 68 mm; Italian road bikes use 70 mm; Early model mountain bikes use 73 mm; later models (1995 and newer) use 68 mm more commonly. Some modern bicycles have shell widths of 83 or 100 mm and these are for specialised downhill mountain biking or snowbiking applications. The shell width influences the Q factor or tread of the bike. There are a few standard shell diameters (34.798 – 36 mm) with associated thread pitches (24 - 28 tpi).

On some gearbox bicycles, the bottom bracket shell may be replaced by an integrated gearbox or a mounting location for a detachable gearbox.

==Frame geometry==

The length of the tubes, and the angles at which they are attached define a frame geometry. In comparing different frame geometries, designers often compare the seat tube angle, head tube angle, (virtual) top tube length, and seat tube length. To complete the specification of a bicycle for use, the rider adjusts the relative positions of the saddle, pedals and handlebars:
* saddle height, the distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the point of reference on top of the middle of the saddle.
* stack, the vertical distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube.
* reach, the horizontal distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the top of the head tube.
* bottom bracket drop, the distance by which the center of the bottom bracket lies below the level of the rear hub.
* handlebar drop, the vertical distance between the reference at the top of the saddle to the handlebar.
* saddle setback, the horizontal distance between the front of the saddle and the center of the bottom bracket.
* standover height, the height of the top tube above the ground.
* front center, the distance from the center of the bottom bracket to the center of the front hub.
* toe overlap, the amount that the feet can interfere with steering the front wheel.
The geometry of the frame depends on the intended use. For instance, a road bicycle will place the handlebars in a lower and further position relative to the saddle giving a more crouched riding position; whereas a utility bicycle emphasizes comfort and has higher handlebars resulting in an upright riding position.

Frame geometry also affects handling characteristics. For more information, see the articles on bicycle and motorcycle geometry and bicycle and motorcycle dynamics.

===Frame size===

Frame size was traditionally measured along the seat tube from the center of the bottom bracket to the center of the top tube. Typical &quot;medium&quot; sizes are 54 or 56 cm (approximately 21.2 or 22 inches) for a European men&#x27;s racing bicycle or 46 cm (about 18.5 inches) for a men&#x27;s mountain bike. The wider range of frame geometries that now exist has also led to other methods of measuring frame size. Touring frames tend to be longer, while racing frames are more compact.

===Road and triathlon bicycles===
A road racing bicycle is designed for efficient power transfer at minimum weight and drag. Broadly speaking, the road bicycle geometry is categorized as either a traditional geometry with a horizontal top tube, or a compact geometry with a sloping top tube.

Traditional geometry road frames are often associated with more comfort and greater stability, and tend to have a longer wheelbase which contributes to these two aspects. Compact geometry allows the top of the head tube to be above the top of the seat tube, decreasing standover height, and thus increasing standover clearance and lowering the center of gravity. Opinion is divided on the riding merits of the compact frame, but several manufacturers claim that a reduced range of sizes can fit most riders, and that it is easier to build a frame without a perfectly level top tube.

Road bicycles for racing tend to have a steeper seat tube angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack (less vertical) seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chain stay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.

Road racing bicycles that are used in UCI-sanctioned races are governed by UCI regulations, which state among other things that the frame must consist of two triangles. Hence designs that lack a seat tube or top tube are not allowed.
Triathlon- or time-trial-specific frames rotate the rider forward around the axis of the bottom bracket of the bicycle as compared to the standard road bicycle frame. This is in order to put the rider in an even lower, more aerodynamic position. While handling and stability is reduced, these bicycles are designed to be ridden in environments with less group riding aspects. These frames tend to have steep seat-tube angles and low head tubes, and shorter wheelbase for the correct reach from the saddle to the handlebar. Additionally, since they are not governed by the UCI, some triathlon bicycles, such as the Zipp 2001, Cheetah and Softride, have non-traditional frame layouts, which can produce better aerodynamics.

===Track bicycles===
Track frames have much in common with road and time trial frames, but come with horizontal, rear-facing, rear fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension. Rear hub spacing is rather than or more for road frames. Bottom bracket drop is smaller, typically . Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.

===Mountain bicycles===
For ride comfort and better handling, shock absorbers are often used; there are a number of variants, including full suspension models, which provide shock absorption for the front and rear wheels; and front suspension only models (&quot;hardtails&quot;) which deal only with shocks arising from the front wheel. The development of sophisticated suspension systems in the 1990s quickly resulted in many modifications to the classic diamond frame.

Recent mountain bicycles with rear suspension systems have a pivoting rear triangle to actuate the rear shock absorber. There is much manufacturer variation in the frame design of full-suspension mountain bicycles, and different designs for different riding purposes.

===Roadster/utility bicycles===
Roadster bicycles traditionally have a fairly slack seat-tube and head-tube angle of about 66 or 67 degrees, which produces a very comfortable and upright &quot;sit-up-and-beg&quot; riding position. Other characteristics include a long wheelbase, upwards of 40 inches (often between 43 and 47 inches, or 57 inches for a longbike), and a long fork rake, often of about 3 inches (76mm compared to 40mm for most road bicycles). This style of frame has had a resurgence in popularity in recent years due to its greater comfort compared to Mountain bicycles or Road bicycles. A variation on this type of bicycle is the &quot;sports roadster&quot; (also known as the &quot;light roadster&quot;), which typically has a lighter frame, and a slightly steeper seat-tube and head-tube angle of about 70 to 72 degrees.

==Frame materials==

Historically, the most common material for the tubes of a bicycle frame has been steel. Steel frames can be made of varying grades of steel, from very inexpensive carbon steel to more costly and higher quality chromium molybdenum steel alloys. Frames can also be made from aluminum alloys, titanium, carbon fiber, and even bamboo and cardboard. Occasionally, diamond (shaped) frames have been formed from sections other than tubes. These include I-beams and monocoque. Materials that have been used in these frames include wood (solid or laminate), magnesium (cast I-beams), and thermoplastic. Several properties of a material help decide whether it is appropriate in the construction of a bicycle frame:
* Density (or specific gravity) is a measure of how light or heavy the material per unit volume.
* Stiffness (or elastic modulus) can in theory affect the ride comfort and power transmission efficiency. In practice, because even a very flexible frame is much more stiff than the tires and saddle, ride comfort is ultimately more a factor of saddle choice, frame geometry, tire choice, and bicycle fit. Lateral stiffness is far more difficult to achieve because of the narrow profile of a frame, and too much flexibility can affect power transmission, primarily through tire scrub on the road due to rear triangle distortion, brakes rubbing on the rims and the chain rubbing on gear mechanisms. In extreme cases gears can change themselves when the rider applies high torque out of the saddle.
* Yield strength determines how much force is needed to permanently deform the material (for crashworthiness).
* Elongation determines how much deformity the material allows before cracking (for crash-worthiness).
* Fatigue limit and Endurance limit determines the durability of the frame when subjected to cyclical stress from pedaling or ride bumps.
Tube engineering and frame geometry can overcome much of the perceived shortcomings of these particular materials. 
Frame materials are listed by commonality of usage.

===Steel===

Steel frames are often built using various types of steel alloys including chromoly. They are strong, easy to work, and relatively inexpensive. However, they are denser (and thus generally heavier) than many other structural materials. It is common (as of 2018, in hybrid commuter bikes) to use steel for the fork blades even when the rest of the frame is made of a different material, because steel offers better vibration dampening. 

A classic type of construction for both road bicycles and mountain bicycles uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs. Lugs are fittings made of thicker pieces of steel. The tubes are fitted into the lugs, which encircle the end of the tube, and are then brazed to the lug. Historically, the lower temperatures associated with brazing (silver brazing in particular) had less of a negative impact on the tubing strength than high temperature welding, allowing relatively light tube to be used without loss of strength. Recent advances in metallurgy (&quot;Air-hardening steel&quot;) have created tubing that is not adversely affected, or whose properties are even improved by high temperature welding temperatures, which has allowed both TIG &amp; MIG welding to sideline lugged construction in all but a few high end bicycles. More expensive lugged frame bicycles have lugs which are filed by hand into fancy shapes - both for weight savings and as a sign of craftsmanship. Unlike MIG or TIG welded frames, a lugged frame can be more easily repaired in the field due to its simple construction. Also, since steel tubing can rust (although in practice paint and anti-corrosion sprays can effectively prevent rust), the lugged frame allows a fast tube replacement with virtually no physical damage to the neighbouring tubes. 

A more economical method of bicycle frame construction uses cylindrical steel tubing connected by TIG welding, which does not require lugs to hold the tubes together. Instead, frame tubes are precisely aligned into a jig and fixed in place until the welding is complete. Fillet brazing is another method of joining frame tubes without lugs. It is more labor-intensive, and consequently is less likely to be used for production frames. As with TIG welding, Fillet frame tubes are precisely notched or mitered and then a fillet of brass is brazed onto the joint, similar to the lugged construction process. A fillet braze frame can achieve more aesthetic unity (smooth curved appearance) than a welded frame.

Among steel frames, using butted tubing reduces weight and increases cost. Butting means that the wall thickness of the tubing changes from thick at the ends (for strength) to thinner in the middle (for lighter weight).

Cheaper steel bicycle frames are made of mild steel, also called &quot;high tensile steel&quot;, such as might be used to manufacture automobiles or other common items. However, higher-quality bicycle frames are made of high strength steel alloys (generally chromium-molybdenum, or &quot;chromoly&quot; steel alloys) which can be made into lightweight tubing with very thin wall gauges. One of the most successful older steels was Reynolds &quot;531&quot;, a manganese-molybdenum alloy steel. More common now is 4130 ChroMoly or similar alloys. Reynolds and Columbus are two of the most famous manufacturers of bicycle tubing. A few medium-quality bicycles used these steel alloys for only some of the frame tubes. An example was the Schwinn &quot;Le tour&quot; (at least certain models), which used chromoly steel for the top and bottom tubes but used lower-quality steel for the rest of the frame.

A high-quality steel frame is generally lighter than a regular steel frame. All else being equal, this loss of weight can improve the acceleration and climbing performance of the bicycle. 

If the tubing label has been lost, a high-quality (chromoly or manganese) steel frame can be recognized by tapping it sharply with a flick of the fingernail. A high-quality frame will produce a bell-like ring where a regular-quality steel frame will produce a dull thunk. They can also be recognized by their weight (around 2.5 kg for frame and forks) and the type of lugs and fork ends used.

===Aluminum alloys===

Aluminum alloys have a lower density and lower strength compared with steel alloys; however, they possess a better strength-to-weight ratio, giving them notable weight advantages over steel.
Early aluminum structures have shown to be more vulnerable to fatigue, either due to ineffective alloys, or imperfect welding technique being used. This contrasts with some steel and titanium alloys, which have clear fatigue limits and are easier to weld or braze together. However, some of these disadvantages have since been mitigated with more skilled labor capable of producing better quality welds, automation, and the greater accessibility to modern aluminum alloys. Aluminum&#x27;s attractive strength to weight ratio as compared to steel, and certain mechanical properties, assure it a place among the favored frame-building materials. 

Popular alloys for bicycle frames are 6061 aluminum and 7005 aluminum.

The most popular type of construction today uses aluminum alloy tubes that are connected together by Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding. Welded aluminum bicycle frames started to appear in the marketplace only after this type of welding became economical in the 1970s.

Aluminum has a different optimal wall thickness to tubing diameter from steel. It is at its strongest at around 200:1 (diameter:wall thickness), whereas steel is a small fraction of that. However, at this ratio, the wall thickness would be comparable to that of a beverage can, far too fragile against impacts. Thus, aluminum bicycle tubing is a compromise, offering a wall thickness to diameter ratio that is not of utmost efficiency, but gives us oversized tubing of more reasonable aerodynamically acceptable proportions and good resistance to impact. This results in a frame that is significantly stiffer than steel. While many riders claim that steel frames give a smoother ride than aluminum because aluminum frames are designed to be stiffer, that claim is of questionable validity: the bicycle frame itself is extremely stiff vertically because it is made of triangles. Conversely, this very argument calls the claim of aluminum frames having greater vertical stiffness into question. On the other hand, lateral and twisting (torsional) stiffness improves acceleration and handling in some circumstances.

Aluminum frames are generally recognized as having a lower weight than steel, although this is not always the case. A low quality aluminum frame may be heavier than a high quality steel frame. Butted aluminum tubes—where the wall thickness of the middle sections are made to be thinner than the end sections—are used by some manufacturers for weight savings. Non-round tubes are used for a variety of reasons, including stiffness, aerodynamics, and marketing. Various shapes focus on one or another of these goals, and seldom accomplish all.

===Titanium===

Titanium is a relatively specialised material for bicycle frames. It has many desirable characteristics including a high specific strength, high fatigue limit, and excellent corrosion resistance. While not as light as carbon fiber titanium&#x27;s can provide a more pleasant ride quality, making the material popular among cyclists seeking comfort over performance. However, titanium has a high material cost and is more difficult to machine than steel or aluminum, which translates to relatively expensive frames compared to steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber.

Titanium frames typically use titanium alloys and tubes that were originally developed for the aerospace industry. The most commonly used alloy on titanium bicycle frames are 3AL-2.5V (3.5% aluminum and 2.5% vanadium), followed by 6AL-4V (6% aluminum and 4% vanadium). Some manufacturers are experimenting with other alloys designed specifically for cycling. Tubes can be cold-drawn and hydroformed into various shapes and allow for internal cabling. Welding is typically done in inert conditions to protect the welds from oxidation.

===Carbon fiber===
Carbon fiber composite is a popular non-metallic material commonly used for bicycle frames. Although expensive, it is light-weight, corrosion-resistant and strong, and can be formed into almost any shape desired. The result is a frame that can be fine-tuned for specific strength where it is needed (to withstand pedaling forces), while allowing flexibility in other frame sections (for comfort). Custom carbon fiber bicycle frames may even be designed with individual tubes that are strong in one direction (such as laterally), while compliant in another direction (such as vertically). The ability to design an individual composite tube with properties that vary by orientation cannot be accomplished with any metal frame construction commonly in production. Some carbon fiber frames use cylindrical tubes that are joined with adhesives and lugs, in a method somewhat analogous to a lugged steel frame. Another type of carbon fiber frames are manufactured in a single piece, called monocoque construction.

In one series of tests conducted by Santa Cruz Bicycles, it was shown that for a frame design with identical shape and nearly similar weight, the carbon frame is considerably stronger than aluminum, when subjected to an overall force load (subjecting the frame to both tension and compression), and impact strength. While carbon frames can be lightweight and strong, they may have lower impact resistance compared to other materials, and can be prone to damage if crashed or mishandled. Cracking and failure can result from a collision, but also from over tightening or improperly installing components. It has been suggested that these materials may be vulnerable to fatigue failure, a process which occurs with use over a long period of time, though this is often limited to interlaminar cracks or cracks in adhesive at joints, where stresses can be well controlled with good design practices. It is possible for broken carbon frames to be repaired, but because of safety concerns it should be done only by professional firms to the highest possible standards.

Many racing bicycles built for individual time trial races and triathlons employ composite construction because the frame can be shaped with an aerodynamic profile not possible with cylindrical tubes, or would be excessively heavy in other materials. While this type of frame may in fact be heavier than others, its aerodynamic efficiency may help the cyclist to attain a higher overall speed.

Other materials besides carbon fiber, such as metallic boron, can be added to the matrix to enhance stiffness further. Some newer high end frames are incorporating Kevlar fibers into the carbon weaves to improve vibration damping and impact strength, particularly in downtubes, seat stays, and chain stays.

===Thermoplastic===
Thermoplastics are a category of polymers that can be reheated and reshaped, and there are several ways that they can be used to create a bicycle frame. One implementation of thermoplastic bicycle frames are essentially carbon fiber frames with the fibers embedded in a thermoplastic material rather than the more common thermosetting epoxy materials. GT Bicycles was one of the first major manufacturers to produce a thermoplastic frame with their STS System frames in the mid 1990s. The carbon fibers were loosely woven into a tube along with fibers of thermoplastic. This tube was placed into a mould with a bladder inside which was then inflated to force the carbon and plastic tube against the inside of the mould. The mould was then heated to melt the thermoplastic. Once the thermoplastic cooled it was removed from the mould in its final form.

===Magnesium===
A handful of bicycle frames are made from magnesium, which has around 64% the density of aluminum. In the 1980s, an engineer, Frank Kirk, devised a novel form of frame that was die cast in one piece and composed of I beams rather than tubes. A company, Kirk Precision Ltd, was established in Britain to manufacture both road bike and mountain bike frames with this technology. However, despite some early commercial success, there were problems with reliability and manufacture stopped in 1992.
The small number of modern magnesium frames in production are constructed conventionally using tubes.

===Scandium aluminum alloy===
Some manufacturers of bikes make frames out of aluminum alloys containing scandium, usually referred to simply as scandium for marketing purposes although the Sc content is less than 0.5%. Scandium improves the welding characteristics of some aluminum alloys with superior fatigue resistance permitting the use of smaller diameter tubing, allowing for more frame design flexibility.

===Beryllium===
American Bicycle Manufacturing of St. Cloud, Minnesota, briefly offered a frameset made of beryllium tubes (bonded to aluminum lugs), priced at $26,000. Reports were that the ride was very harsh, but the frame was also very laterally flexible.

===Bamboo===

Several bicycle frames have been made of bamboo tubes connected with metal or composite joinery. Aesthetic appeal has often been as much of a motivator as mechanical characteristics.

===Wood===

Several bicycle frames have been made of wood, either solid or laminate. Although one survived 265 grueling kilometers of the Paris–Roubaix race, aesthetic appeal has often been as much of a motivator as ride characteristics. Wood is used to fashion bicycles in East Africa. Cardboard has also been used for bicycle frames.

===Combinations===

Combining different materials can provide the desired stiffness, compliance, or damping in different areas better than can be accomplished with a single material. The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal down tube and chain stays with carbon top tube, seat tube, and seat stays. Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon seat stays.
Carbon forks have become very common on racing bicycles of all frame materials.

===Other===
The bicycle types article describes additional variations.

==Butted tubing==
Butted tubing has increased thickness near the joints for strength while keeping weight low with thinner material elsewhere. For example, triple butted means the tube, usually of an aluminum alloy, has three different thicknesses, with the thicker sections at the end where they are welded. The same material can be used in handlebars.

==Braze-ons==

A variety of small features—bottle cage mounting holes, shifter bosses, cable stops, pump pegs, cable guides, etc.—are described as braze-ons because they were originally, and sometimes still are, brazed on.

==Suspension==

Many bicycles, especially mountain bikes, have suspension.

<text>An oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an industrial process plant where petroleum (crude oil) is transformed and refined into products such as gasoline (petrol), diesel fuel, asphalt base, fuel oils, heating oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and petroleum naphtha. Petrochemical feedstock like ethylene and propylene can also be produced directly by cracking crude oil without the need of using refined products of crude oil such as naphtha. The crude oil feedstock has typically been processed by an oil production plant. There is usually an oil depot at or near an oil refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil feedstock as well as bulk liquid products. In 2020, the total capacity of global refineries for crude oil was about 101.2 million barrels per day.

Oil refineries are typically large, sprawling industrial complexes with extensive piping running throughout, carrying streams of fluids between large chemical processing units, such as distillation columns. In many ways, oil refineries use many different technologies and can be thought of as types of chemical plants. Since December 2008, the world&#x27;s largest oil refinery has been the Jamnagar Refinery owned by Reliance Industries, located in Gujarat, India, with a processing capacity of per day.

Oil refineries are an essential part of the petroleum industry&#x27;s downstream sector.

The Chinese were among the first civilizations to refine oil. As early as the first century, the Chinese were refining crude oil for use as an energy source. Between 512 and 518, in the late Northern Wei dynasty, the Chinese geographer, writer and politician Li Daoyuan introduced the process of refining oil into various lubricants in his famous work &quot;Commentary on the Water Classic&quot;.

Crude oil was often distilled by Persian chemists, with clear descriptions given in handbooks such as those of Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (). The streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu al-Hasan &#x27;Alī al-Mas&#x27;ūdī in the 10th century, and by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads. Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Through Islamic Spain, distillation became available in Western Europe by the 12th century.

In the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), a workshop called the &quot;Fierce Oil Workshop&quot;, was established in the city of Kaifeng to produce refined oil for the Song military as a weapon. The troops would then fill iron cans with refined oil and throw them toward the enemy troops, causing a fire – effectively the world&#x27;s first &quot;fire bomb&quot;. The workshop was one of the world&#x27;s earliest oil refining factories where thousands of people worked to produce Chinese oil-powered weaponry.

Prior to the nineteenth century, petroleum was known and utilized in various fashions in Babylon, Egypt, China, Philippines, Rome and Azerbaijan. However, the modern history of the petroleum industry is said to have begun in 1846 when Abraham Gessner of Nova Scotia, Canada devised a process to produce kerosene from coal. Shortly thereafter, in 1854, Ignacy Łukasiewicz began producing kerosene from hand-dug oil wells near the town of Krosno, Poland.

Romania was registered as the first country in world oil production statistics, according to the Academy Of World Records.

In North America, the first oil well was drilled in 1858 by James Miller Williams in Oil Springs, Ontario, Canada. In the United States, the petroleum industry began in 1859 when Edwin Drake found oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania. The industry grew slowly in the 1800s, primarily producing kerosene for oil lamps. In the early twentieth century, the introduction of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles created a market for gasoline that was the impetus for fairly rapid growth of the petroleum industry. The early finds of petroleum like those in Ontario and Pennsylvania were soon outstripped by large oil &quot;booms&quot; in Oklahoma, Texas and California.

Samuel Kier established America&#x27;s first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh Avenue near Grant Street, in 1853. Polish pharmacist and inventor Ignacy Łukasiewicz established an oil refinery in Jasło, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Poland) in 1854.

The first large refinery opened at Ploiești, Romania, in 1856–1857. 
It was in Ploiesti that, 51 years later, in 1908, Lazăr Edeleanu, a Romanian chemist of Jewish origin who got his PhD in 1887 by discovering amphetamine, invented, patented and tested on industrial scale the first modern method of liquid extraction for refining crude oil, the Edeleanu process. This increased the refining efficiency compared to pure fractional distillation and allowed a massive development of the refining plants. Successively, the process was implemented in France, Germany, U.S. and in a few decades became worldwide spread. In 1910 Edeleanu founded &quot;Allgemeine Gesellschaft für Chemische Industrie&quot; in Germany, which, given the success of the name, changed to Edeleanu GmbH, in 1930. During Nazi&#x27;s time, the company was bought by the Deutsche Erdöl-AG and Edeleanu, being of Jewish origin, moved back to Romania. After the war, the trademark was used by the successor company EDELEANU Gesellschaft mbH Alzenau (RWE) for many petroleum products, while the company was lately integrated as EDL in the Pörner Group.
The Ploiești refineries, after being taken over by Nazi Germany, were bombed in the 1943 Operation Tidal Wave by the Allies, during the Oil Campaign of World War II.

Another close contender for the title of hosting the world&#x27;s oldest oil refinery is Salzbergen in Lower Saxony, Germany. Salzbergen&#x27;s refinery was opened in 1860.

At one point, the refinery in Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia owned by Saudi Aramco was claimed to be the largest oil refinery in the world. For most of the 20th century, the largest refinery was the Abadan Refinery in Iran. This refinery suffered extensive damage during the Iran–Iraq War. Since 25 December 2008, the world&#x27;s largest refinery complex is the Jamnagar Refinery Complex, consisting of two refineries side by side operated by Reliance Industries Limited in Jamnagar, India with a combined production capacity of . PDVSA&#x27;s Paraguaná Refinery Complex in Paraguaná Peninsula, Venezuela, with a capacity of &quot;but effective run rates have been dramatically lower due to the impact of 20 years of sanctions&quot;, and SK Energy&#x27;s Ulsan in South Korea with are the second and third largest, respectively.

Prior to World War II in the early 1940s, most petroleum refineries in the United States consisted simply of crude oil distillation units (often referred to as atmospheric crude oil distillation units). Some refineries also had vacuum distillation units as well as thermal cracking units such as visbreakers (viscosity breakers, units to lower the viscosity of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or within a few years after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.

In the United States, for various complex economic and political reasons, the construction of new refineries came to a virtual stop in about the 1980s. However, many of the existing refineries in the United States have revamped many of their units and/or constructed add-on units in order to: increase their crude oil processing capacity, increase the octane rating of their product gasoline, lower the sulfur content of their diesel fuel and home heating fuels to comply with environmental regulations and comply with environmental air pollution and water pollution requirements.

=== United States ===
In the 19th century, refineries in the U.S. processed crude oil primarily to recover the kerosene. There was no market for the more volatile fraction, including gasoline, which was considered waste and was often dumped directly into the nearest river. The invention of the automobile shifted the demand to gasoline and diesel, which remain the primary refined products today.

Today, national and state legislation require refineries to meet stringent air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, oil companies in the U.S. perceive obtaining a permit to build a modern refinery to be so difficult and costly that no new refineries were built (though many have been expanded) in the U.S. from 1976 until 2014 when the small Dakota Prairie Refinery in North Dakota began operation. More than half the refineries that existed in 1981 are now closed due to low utilization rates and accelerating mergers. As a result of these closures total US refinery capacity fell between 1981 and 1995, though the operating capacity stayed fairly constant in that time period at around . Increases in facility size and improvements in efficiencies have offset much of the lost physical capacity of the industry. In 1982 (the earliest data provided), the United States operated 301 refineries with a combined capacity of of crude oil each calendar day. In 2010, there were 149 operable U.S. refineries with a combined capacity of per calendar day. By 2014 the number of refinery had reduced to 140 but the total capacity increased to per calendar day. Indeed, in order to reduce operating costs and depreciation, refining is operated in fewer sites but of bigger capacity.

In 2009 through 2010, as revenue streams in the oil business dried up and profitability of oil refineries fell due to lower demand for product and high reserves of supply preceding the economic recession, oil companies began to close or sell the less profitable refineries.

==Operation==

Raw or unprocessed crude oil is not generally useful in industrial applications, although &quot;light, sweet&quot; (low viscosity, low sulfur) crude oil has been used directly as a burner fuel to produce steam for the propulsion of seagoing vessels. The lighter elements, however, form explosive vapors in the fuel tanks and are therefore hazardous, especially in warships. Instead, the hundreds of different hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil are separated in a refinery into components that can be used as fuels, lubricants, and feedstocks in petrochemical processes that manufacture such products as plastics, detergents, solvents, elastomers, and fibers such as nylon and polyesters.

Petroleum fossil fuels are burned in internal combustion engines to provide power for ships, automobiles, aircraft engines, lawn mowers, dirt bikes, and other machines. Different boiling points allow the hydrocarbons to be separated by distillation. Since the lighter liquid products are in great demand for use in internal combustion engines, a modern refinery will convert heavy hydrocarbons and lighter gaseous elements into these higher-value products.

Oil can be used in a variety of ways because it contains hydrocarbons of varying molecular masses, forms and lengths such as paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes (or cycloalkanes), alkenes, dienes, and alkynes. While the molecules in crude oil include different atoms such as sulfur and nitrogen, the hydrocarbons are the most common form of molecules, which are molecules of varying lengths and complexity made of hydrogen and carbon atoms, and a small number of oxygen atoms. The differences in the structure of these molecules account for their varying physical and chemical properties, and it is this variety that makes crude oil useful in a broad range of several applications.

Once separated and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant can be sold without further processing. Smaller molecules such as isobutane and propylene or butylenes can be recombined to meet specific octane requirements by processes such as alkylation, or more commonly, dimerization. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by catalytic reforming, which involves removing hydrogen from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as aromatics. Intermediate products such as gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of cracking such as fluid catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, and hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product specifications. Another method for reprocessing and upgrading these intermediate products (residual oils) uses a process to separate usable oil from the waste asphaltene material. Certain cracked streams are particularly suitable to produce petrochemicals includes polypropylene, heavier polymers, and block polymers based on the molecular weight and the characteristics of the olefin specie that is cracked from the source feedstock. 

Oil refineries are large-scale plants, processing about a hundred thousand to several hundred thousand barrels of crude oil a day. Because of the high capacity, many of the units operate continuously, as opposed to processing in batches, at steady state or nearly steady state for months to years. The high capacity also makes process optimization and advanced process control very desirable.

==Major products==


Petroleum products are materials derived from crude oil (petroleum) as it is processed in oil refineries. The majority of petroleum is converted to petroleum products, which includes several classes of fuels.

Oil refineries also produce various intermediate products such as hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, reformate and pyrolysis gasoline. These are not usually transported but instead are blended or processed further on-site. Chemical plants are thus often adjacent to oil refineries or a number of further chemical processes are integrated into it. For example, light hydrocarbons are steam-cracked in an ethylene plant, and the produced ethylene is polymerized to produce polyethene.

To ensure both proper separation and environmental protection, a very low sulfur content is necessary in all but the heaviest products. The crude sulfur contaminant is transformed to hydrogen sulfide via catalytic hydrodesulfurization and removed from the product stream via amine gas treating. Using the Claus process, hydrogen sulfide is afterward transformed to elementary sulfur to be sold to the chemical industry. The rather large heat energy freed by this process is directly used in the other parts of the refinery. Often an electrical power plant is combined into the whole refinery process to take up the excess heat.

According to the composition of the crude oil and depending on the demands of the market, refineries can produce different shares of petroleum products. The largest share of oil products is used as &quot;energy carriers&quot;, i.e. various grades of fuel oil and gasoline. These fuels include or can be blended to give gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, and heavier fuel oils. Heavier (less volatile) fractions can also be used to produce asphalt, tar, paraffin wax, lubricating and other heavy oils. Refineries also produce other chemicals, some of which are used in chemical processes to produce plastics and other useful materials. Since petroleum often contains a few percent sulfur-containing molecules, elemental sulfur is also often produced as a petroleum product. Carbon, in the form of petroleum coke, and hydrogen may also be produced as petroleum products. The hydrogen produced is often used as an intermediate product for other oil refinery processes such as hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization.

Petroleum products are usually grouped into four categories: light distillates (LPG, gasoline, naphtha), middle distillates (kerosene, jet fuel, diesel), heavy distillates, and residuum (heavy fuel oil, lubricating oils, wax, asphalt). These require blending various feedstocks, mixing appropriate additives, providing short-term storage, and preparation for bulk loading to trucks, barges, product ships, and railcars. This classification is based on the way crude oil is distilled and separated into fractions.
* Gaseous fuel such as liquified petroleum gas and propane, stored and shipped in liquid form under pressure.
* Lubricants (produces light machine oils, motor oils, and greases, adding viscosity stabilizers as required), usually shipped in bulk to an offsite packaging plant.
* Paraffin wax, used in the candle industry, among others. May be shipped in bulk to a site to prepare as packaged blocks. Used for wax emulsions, candles, matches, rust protection, vapor barriers, construction board, and packaging of frozen foods.
* Sulfur (or sulfuric acid), byproducts of sulfur removal from petroleum which may have up to a couple of percent sulfur as organic sulfur-containing compounds. Sulfur and sulfuric acid are useful industrial materials. Sulfuric acid is usually prepared and shipped as the acid precursor oleum.
* Bulk tar shipping for offsite unit packaging for use in tar-and-gravel roofing.
* Asphalt used as a binder for gravel to form asphalt concrete, which is used for paving roads, lots, etc. An asphalt unit prepares bulk asphalt for shipment.
* Petroleum coke, used in specialty carbon products like electrodes or as solid fuel.
* Petrochemicals are organic compounds that are the ingredients for the chemical industry, ranging from polymers and pharmaceuticals, including ethylene and benzene-toluene-xylenes (&quot;BTX&quot;) which are often sent to petrochemical plants for further processing in a variety of ways. The petrochemicals may be olefins or their precursors, or various types of aromatic petrochemicals.
* Gasoline
* Naphtha
* Kerosene and related jet aircraft fuels
* Diesel fuel and fuel oils
* Heat
* Electricity

Over 6,000 items are made from petroleum waste by-products, including fertilizer, floor coverings, perfume, insecticide, petroleum jelly, soap, and vitamin capsules.

==Chemical processes==

* Desalter unit washes out salt, and other water soluble contaminants, from the crude oil before it enters the atmospheric distillation unit.
* Pre-flash and/or pre-distillation which is found in most atmospheric crude oil units of more than 100,000 bpsd in capacity. 
* Crude oil distillation unit distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions for further processing in other units. See continuous distillation.
* Vacuum distillation further distills the residue oil from the bottom of the crude oil distillation unit. The vacuum distillation is performed at a pressure well below atmospheric pressure.
* Naphtha hydrotreater unit uses hydrogen to desulfurize naphtha from atmospheric distillation. Naphtha must be desulfurized before sending it to a catalytic reformer unit.
* Catalytic reformer converts the desulfurized naphtha molecules into higher-octane molecules to produce reformate (reformer product). The reformate has higher content of aromatics and cyclic hydrocarbons which is a component of the end-product gasoline or petrol. An important byproduct of a reformer is hydrogen released during the catalyst reaction. The hydrogen is used either in the hydrotreaters or the hydrocracker.
* Distillate hydrotreater desulfurizes distillates (such as diesel) after atmospheric distillation. Uses hydrogen to desulfurize the naphtha fraction from the crude oil distillation or other units within the refinery. Distillate hydrotreaters that operate above 700 psi are also capable of removing nitrogen contaminants from feedstocks if given adequate liquid hourly space velocity. 
* Fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) upgrades the heavier, higher-boiling fractions from the crude oil distillation by converting them into lighter and lower boiling, more valuable products.
* Hydrocracker uses hydrogen to upgrade heavy residual oils from the vacuum distillation unit by thermally cracking them into lighter, more valuable reduced viscosity products.
* Merox desulfurize LPG, kerosene or jet fuel by oxidizing mercaptans to organic disulfides.
* Alternative processes for removing mercaptans are known, e.g. doctor sweetening process and caustic washing.
* Coking units (delayed coker, fluid coker, and flexicoker) process very heavy residual oils into gasoline and diesel fuel, leaving petroleum coke as a residual product.
* Alkylation unit uses sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid to produce high-octane components for gasoline blending. The &quot;alky&quot; unit converts light end isobutane and butylenes from the FCC process into &quot;alkylate&quot;, a very high-octane component of the end-product gasoline or petrol.
* Dimerization unit converts olefins into higher-octane gasoline blending components. For example, butenes can be dimerized into isooctene which may subsequently be hydrogenated to form isooctane. There are also other uses for dimerization. Gasoline produced through dimerization is highly unsaturated and very reactive. It tends spontaneously to form gums. For this reason, the effluent from the dimerization needs to be blended into the finished gasoline pool immediately or hydrogenated.
* Isomerization converts linear molecules such as normal pentane to higher-octane branched molecules for blending into gasoline or feed to alkylation units. Also used to convert linear normal butane into isobutane for use in the alkylation unit.
* Steam reforming converts natural gas into hydrogen for the hydrotreaters and/or the hydrocracker.
* Liquified gas storage vessels store propane and similar gaseous fuels at pressure sufficient to maintain them in liquid form. These are usually spherical vessels or &quot;bullets&quot; (i.e., horizontal vessels with rounded ends).
* Amine gas treater, Claus unit, and tail gas treatment convert hydrogen sulfide from hydrodesulfurization into elemental sulfur. The large majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from petroleum refining and natural gas processing plants.
* Sour water stripper uses steam to remove hydrogen sulfide gas from various wastewater streams for subsequent conversion into end-product sulfur in the Claus unit.
* Cooling towers circulate cooling water, boiler plants generates steam for steam generators, and instrument air systems include pneumatically operated control valves and an electrical substation.
* Wastewater collection and treating systems consist of API separators, dissolved air flotation (DAF) units and further treatment units such as an activated sludge biotreater to make water suitable for reuse or for disposal.
* Solvent refining uses solvent such as cresol or furfural to remove unwanted, mainly aromatics from lubricating oil stock or diesel stock.
* Solvent dewaxing removes the heavy waxy constituents petrolatum from vacuum distillation products.
* Storage tanks for storing crude oil and finished products, usually vertical, cylindrical vessels with some sort of vapor emission control and surrounded by an earthen berm to contain spills.

==Flow diagram of typical refinery==

The image below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical oil refinery that depicts the various unit processes and the flow of intermediate product streams that occurs between the inlet crude oil feedstock and the final end products. The diagram depicts only one of the literally hundreds of different oil refinery configurations. The diagram also does not include any of the usual refinery facilities providing utilities such as steam, cooling water, and electric power as well as storage tanks for crude oil feedstock and for intermediate products and end products.


There are many process configurations other than that depicted above. For example, the vacuum distillation unit may also produce fractions that can be refined into end products such as spindle oil used in the textile industry, light machine oil, motor oil, and various waxes.

==Crude oil distillation unit==
The crude oil distillation unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different boiling ranges, each of which is then processed further in the other refinery processing units. The CDU is often referred to as the &quot;atmospheric distillation unit&quot; because it operates at slightly above atmospheric pressure.
Below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit. The incoming crude oil is preheated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then desalted to remove inorganic salts (primarily sodium chloride).

Following the desalter, the crude oil is further heated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (fired heater) to a temperature of about 398 °C and routed into the bottom of the distillation unit.

The cooling and condensing of the distillation tower overhead is provided partially by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat is removed from the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below.

As shown in the flow diagram, the overhead distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The fractions removed from the side of the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom are called &quot;sidecuts&quot;. Each of the sidecuts (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil, and heavy gas oil) is cooled by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the sidecuts, and the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.

==Location of refineries==

A party searching for a site to construct a refinery or a chemical plant needs to consider the following issues:
* The site has to be reasonably far from residential areas.
* Infrastructure should be available for the supply of raw materials and shipment of products to markets.
* Energy to operate the plant should be available.
* Facilities should be available for waste disposal.
Factors affecting site selection for oil refinery:
* Availability of land
* Conditions of traffic and transportation
* Conditions of utilities – power supply, water supply
* Availability of labours and resources

Refineries that use a large amount of steam and cooling water need to have an abundant source of water. Oil refineries, therefore, are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a seashore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline. A pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and railcars, road tankers, and barges are used.

Petrochemical plants and solvent manufacturing (fine fractionating) plants need spaces for further processing of a large volume of refinery products, or to mix chemical additives with a product at source rather than at blending terminals.

==Safety and environment==

The refining process releases a number of different chemicals into the atmosphere (see &quot;AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors&quot;) and a notable odor normally accompanies the presence of a refinery. Aside from air pollution impacts there are also wastewater concerns, risks of industrial accidents such as fire and explosion, and noise health effects due to industrial noise.

Many governments worldwide have mandated restrictions on contaminants that refineries release, and most refineries have installed the equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the pertinent environmental protection regulatory agencies. In the United States, there is strong pressure to prevent the development of new refineries, and no major refinery has been built in the country since Marathon&#x27;s Garyville, Louisiana facility in 1976. However, many existing refineries have been expanded during that time. Environmental restrictions and pressure to prevent the construction of new refineries may have also contributed to rising fuel prices in the United States. Additionally, many refineries (more than 100 since the 1980s) have closed due to obsolescence and/or merger activity within the industry itself.

Environmental and safety concerns mean that oil refineries are sometimes located some distance away from major urban areas. Nevertheless, there are many instances where refinery operations are close to populated areas and pose health risks. In California&#x27;s Contra Costa County and Solano County, a shoreline necklace of refineries, built in the early 20th century before this area was populated, and associated chemical plants are adjacent to urban areas in Richmond, Martinez, Pacheco, Concord, Pittsburg, Vallejo and Benicia, with occasional accidental events that require &quot;shelter in place&quot; orders to the adjacent populations. A number of refineries are located in Sherwood Park, Alberta, directly adjacent to the City of Edmonton, which has a population of over 1,000,000 residents.

NIOSH criteria for occupational exposure to refined petroleum solvents have been available since 1977.

== Worker health ==

===Background===
Modern petroleum refining involves a complicated system of interrelated chemical reactions that produce a wide variety of petroleum-based products. Many of these reactions require precise temperature and pressure parameters.  The equipment and monitoring required to ensure the proper progression of these processes is complex, and has evolved through the advancement of the scientific field of petroleum engineering.

The wide array of high pressure and/or high temperature reactions, along with the necessary chemical additives or extracted contaminants, produces an astonishing number of potential health hazards to the oil refinery worker.  Through the advancement of technical chemical and petroleum engineering, the vast majority of these processes are automated and enclosed, thus greatly reducing the potential health impact to workers.  However, depending on the specific process in which a worker is engaged, as well as the particular method employed by the refinery in which he/she works, significant health hazards remain.

Although occupational injuries in the United States were not routinely tracked and reported at the time, reports of the health impacts of working in an oil refinery can be found as early as the 1800s. For instance, an explosion in a Chicago refinery killed 20 workers in 1890. Since then, numerous fires, explosions, and other significant events have from time to time drawn the public&#x27;s attention to the health of oil refinery workers. Such events continue in the 21st century, with explosions reported in refineries in Wisconsin and Germany in 2018.

However, there are many less visible hazards that endanger oil refinery workers.

===Chemical exposures===

Given the highly automated and technically advanced nature of modern petroleum refineries, nearly all processes are contained within engineering controls and represent a substantially decreased risk of exposure to workers compared to earlier times. However, certain situations or work tasks may subvert these safety mechanisms, and expose workers to a number of chemical (see table above) or physical (described below) hazards. Examples of these scenarios include:
* System failures (leaks, explosions, etc.).
* Standard inspection, product sampling, process turnaround, or equipment maintenance/cleaning activities.

A 2021 systematic review associated working in the petrochemical industry with increased risk of various cancers, such as mesothelioma. It also found reduced risks of other cancers, such as stomach and rectal. The systematic review did mention that several of the associations were not due to factors directly related to the petroleum industry, rather were related to lifestyle factors such as smoking. Evidence for adverse health effects for nearby residents was also weak, with the evidence primarily centering around neighborhoods in developed countries.

BTX stands for benzene, toluene, xylene. This is a group of common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are found in the oil refinery environment, and serve as a paradigm for more in depth discussion of occupational exposure limits, chemical exposure and surveillance among refinery workers.

The most important route of exposure for BTX chemicals is inhalation due to the low boiling point of these chemicals. The majority of the gaseous production of BTX occurs during tank cleaning and fuel transfer, which causes offgassing of these chemicals into the air. Exposure can also occur through ingestion via contaminated water, but this is unlikely in an occupational setting. Dermal exposure and absorption is also possible, but is again less likely in an occupational setting where appropriate personal protective equipment is in place.

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have all established occupational exposure limits (OELs) for many of the chemicals above that workers may be exposed to in petroleum refineries.

Benzene, in particular, has multiple biomarkers that can be measured to determine exposure. Benzene itself can be measured in the breath, blood, and urine, and metabolites such as phenol, &quot;t&quot;,&quot;t&quot;-muconic acid (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;t&quot;MA) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (&quot;s&quot;PMA) can be measured in urine. In addition to monitoring the exposure levels via these biomarkers, employers are required by OSHA to perform regular blood tests on workers to test for early signs of some of the feared hematologic outcomes, of which the most widely recognized is leukemia. Required testing includes complete blood count with cell differentials and peripheral blood smear &quot;on a regular basis&quot;. The utility of these tests is supported by formal scientific studies.

====Potential chemical exposure by process====

=== Physical hazards ===
Workers are at risk of physical injuries due to a large number of high-powered machines in the relatively close proximity of the oil refinery. The high pressure required for many of the chemical reactions also presents the possibility of localized system failures resulting in blunt or penetrating trauma from exploding system components.

Heat is also a hazard. The temperature required for the proper progression of certain reactions in the refining process can reach . As with chemicals, the operating system is designed to safely contain this hazard without injury to the worker. However, in system failures, this is a potent threat to workers&#x27; health. Concerns include both direct injury through a heat illness or injury, as well as the potential for devastating burns should the worker come in contact with super-heated reagents/equipment.

Noise is another hazard. Refineries can be very loud environments, and have previously been shown to be associated with hearing loss among workers. The interior environment of an oil refinery can reach levels in excess of 90 dB. In the United States, an average of 90 dB is the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for an 8-hour work-day. Noise exposures that average greater than 85 dB over an 8-hour require a hearing conservation program to regularly evaluate workers&#x27; hearing and to promote its protection.  Regular evaluation of workers&#x27; auditory capacity and faithful use of properly vetted hearing protection are essential parts of such programs.

While not specific to the industry, oil refinery workers may also be at risk for hazards such as vehicle-related accidents, machinery-associated injuries, work in a confined space, explosions/fires, ergonomic hazards, shift-work related sleep disorders, and falls.

=== Hazard controls ===
The theory of hierarchy of controls can be applied to petroleum refineries and their efforts to ensure worker safety.

Elimination and substitution are unlikely in petroleum refineries, as many of the raw materials, waste products, and finished products are hazardous in one form or another (e.g. flammable, carcinogenic).

Examples of engineering controls include a fire detection/extinguishing system, pressure/chemical sensors to detect/predict loss of structural integrity, and adequate maintenance of piping to prevent hydrocarbon-induced corrosion (leading to structural failure). Other examples employed in petroleum refineries include the post-construction protection of steel components with vermiculite to improve heat/fire resistance. Compartmentalization can help to prevent a fire or other systems failure from spreading to affect other areas of the structure, and may help prevent dangerous reactions by keeping different chemicals separate from one another until they can be safely combined in the proper environment.

Administrative controls include careful planning and oversight of the refinery cleaning, maintenance, and turnaround processes. These occur when many of the engineering controls are shut down or suppressed and may be especially dangerous to workers. Detailed coordination is necessary to ensure that maintenance of one part of the facility will not cause dangerous exposures to those performing the maintenance, or to workers in other areas of the plant. Due to the highly flammable nature of many of the involved chemicals, smoking areas are tightly controlled and carefully placed.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) may be necessary depending on the specific chemical being processed or produced. Particular care is needed during sampling of the partially-completed product, tank cleaning, and other high-risk tasks as mentioned above. Such activities may require the use of impervious outerwear, acid hood, disposable coveralls, etc. More generally, all personnel in operating areas should use appropriate hearing and vision protection, avoid clothes made of flammable material (nylon, Dacron, acrylic, or blends), and full-length pants and sleeves.

===Regulations===
====United States====
Worker health and safety in oil refineries is closely monitored at a national level by both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to federal monitoring, California&#x27;s CalOSHA has been particularly active in protecting worker health in the industry, and adopted a policy in 2017 that requires petroleum refineries to perform a &quot;Hierarchy of Hazard Controls Analysis&quot; (see above &quot;Hazard controls&quot; section) for each process safety hazard. Safety regulations have resulted in a below-average injury rate for refining industry workers. In a 2018 report by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, they indicate that petroleum refinery workers have a significantly lower rate of occupational injury (0.4 OSHA-recordable cases per 100 full-time workers) than all industries (3.1 cases), oil and gas extraction (0.8 cases), and petroleum manufacturing in general (1.3 cases).

Below is a list of the most common regulations referenced in petroleum refinery safety citations issued by OSHA:
* Flammable and Combustible Liquids ()
* The Hazard Communication (HazCom) standard ()
* Permit-Required Confined Spaces ()
* Hazardous (Classified) Locations ()
* The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standard ()
* The Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) standard ()

==Corrosion==
Corrosion of metallic components is a major factor of inefficiency in the refining process. Because it leads to equipment failure, it is a primary driver for the refinery maintenance schedule. Corrosion-related direct costs in the U.S. petroleum industry as of 1996 were estimated at US$3.7 billion.

Corrosion occurs in various forms in the refining process, such as pitting corrosion from water droplets, embrittlement from hydrogen, and stress corrosion cracking from sulfide attack. From a materials standpoint, carbon steel is used for upwards of 80 percent of refinery components, which is beneficial due to its low cost. Carbon steel is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205 °C, but other corrosive chemicals and environments prevent its use everywhere. Common replacement materials are low alloy steels containing chromium and molybdenum, with stainless steels containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments. More expensive materials commonly used are nickel, titanium, and copper alloys. These are primarily saved for the most problematic areas where extremely high temperatures and/or very corrosive chemicals are present.

Corrosion is fought by a complex system of monitoring, preventative repairs, and careful use of materials. Monitoring methods include both offline checks taken during maintenance and online monitoring. Offline checks measure corrosion after it has occurred, telling the engineer when equipment must be replaced based on the historical information they have collected. This is referred to as preventative management.

Online systems are a more modern development and are revolutionizing the way corrosion is approached. There are several types of online corrosion monitoring technologies such as linear polarization resistance, electrochemical noise and electrical resistance. Online monitoring has generally had slow reporting rates in the past (minutes or hours) and been limited by process conditions and sources of error but newer technologies can report rates up to twice per minute with much higher accuracy (referred to as real-time monitoring). This allows process engineers to treat corrosion as another process variable that can be optimized in the system. Immediate responses to process changes allow the control of corrosion mechanisms, so they can be minimized while also maximizing production output. In an ideal situation having on-line corrosion information that is accurate and real-time will allow conditions that cause high corrosion rates to be identified and reduced. This is known as predictive management.

Materials methods include selecting the proper material for the application. In areas of minimal corrosion, cheap materials are preferable, but when bad corrosion can occur, more expensive but longer-lasting materials should be used. Other materials methods come in the form of protective barriers between corrosive substances and the equipment metals. These can be either a lining of refractory material such as standard Portland cement or other special acid-resistant cement that is shot onto the inner surface of the vessel. Also available are thin overlays of more expensive metals that protect cheaper metal against corrosion without requiring much material.

<text>The Free Soil Party, also called the Free Democratic Party or the Free Democracy, was a political party in the United States from 1848 to 1854, when it merged into the Republican Party. The party was focused on opposing the expansion of slavery into the western territories of the United States. The 1848 presidential election took place in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War and debates over the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession. After the Whig Party and the Democratic Party nominated presidential candidates who were unwilling to rule out the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession, anti-slavery Democrats and Whigs joined with members of the Liberty Party (an abolitionist political party) to form the new Free Soil Party. Running as the Free Soil presidential candidate, former President Martin Van Buren won 10.1 percent of the popular vote, the strongest popular vote performance by a third party up to that point in U.S. history.

Though Van Buren and many other Free Soil supporters rejoined the Democrats or the Whigs after the 1848 election, Free Soilers retained a presence in Congress over the next six years. Led by Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, John P. Hale of New Hampshire, and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, the Free Soilers strongly opposed the Compromise of 1850, which temporarily settled the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession. Hale ran as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1852 presidential election, taking just under five percent of the vote. The 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act repealed the long-standing Missouri Compromise and outraged many Northerners, contributing to the collapse of the Whigs and spurring the creation of a new, broad-based anti-slavery Republican Party. Most Free Soilers joined the Republican Party, which emerged as the dominant political party in the United States in the Third Party System (1856–1894).

== History ==
===Background===

Though William Lloyd Garrison and most other abolitionists of the 1830s had generally shunned the political system, a small group of abolitionists founded the Liberty Party in 1840. The Liberty Party was a third party dedicated to the immediate abolition of slavery. The Liberty Party nominated James G. Birney for president and Thomas Earle for vice president in the 1840 presidential election. Months after the 1840 election, the party re-nominated Birney for president, established a national party committee, and began to organize at the state and local level. Support for the party grew in the North, especially among evangelical former Whigs in New England, upstate New York, Michigan, and Ohio&#x27;s Western Reserve. Other anti-slavery Whigs like John Quincy Adams remained within the Whig Party, but increasingly supported anti-slavery policies like the repeal of the gag rule, which prevented the House of Representatives from considering abolitionist petitions. Meanwhile, long-time abolitionist leaders like Lewis Tappan became increasingly open to working within the political system. In a reflection of the rise of anti-slavery sentiment, several Northern states passed personal liberty laws that forbid state authorities from cooperating in the capture and return of fugitive slaves.

Beginning in May 1843, President John Tyler made the annexation of Texas his key priority. Most leaders of both parties opposed opening the question of annexation in 1843 due to their fear of stoking the debate over slavery; the annexation of Texas was widely viewed as a pro-slavery initiative because it would add another slave state to the union. Nonetheless, in April 1844, Secretary of State John C. Calhoun reached a treaty with Texas providing for the annexation of that country. Henry Clay and Martin Van Buren, the two front-runners for the major party presidential nominations in the 1844 presidential election, both announced their opposition to annexation, and the Senate blocked the treaty. To the surprise of Clay and other Whigs, the 1844 Democratic National Convention rejected Van Buren in favor of James K. Polk, and approved a platform calling for the acquisition of both Texas and Oregon Country. Polk went on to defeat Clay in a close election, taking 49.5 of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote. The number of voters casting a ballot for Birney increased tenfold from 6,200 in 1840 (0.3 percent of popular vote) to 62,000 (2.3 percent of the popular vote) in 1844.

===Formation of the Free Soil Party===
====Wilmot Proviso====

Following the annexation of Texas in 1845, President Polk began preparations for a potential war with Mexico, which still regarded Texas as a part of its republic. After a skirmish known as the Thornton Affair broke out on the northern side of the Rio Grande, Polk convinced Congress to declare war against Mexico. Though most Democrats and Whigs initially supported the war, Adams and some other anti-slavery Whigs attacked the war as a &quot;Slave Power&quot; plot designed to expand slavery across North America. Meanwhile, former Democratic Representative John P. Hale had defied party leaders by denouncing the annexation of Texas, causing him to lose re-election in 1845. Hale joined with anti-slavery Whigs and the Liberty Party to create a new party in New Hampshire, and he won election to the Senate in early 1847. In New York, tensions between the anti-slavery Barnburner and the conservative Hunker factions of the Democratic Party rose, as the Hunkers allied with the Whigs to defeat the re-election campaign of Democratic Governor Silas Wright.

In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million (~$ in ) in hopes of using that money as a down payment for the purchase of Alta California in a treaty with Mexico. During the debate over the appropriations bill, Democratic Representative David Wilmot of Pennsylvania offered an amendment known as the Wilmot Proviso, which would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands. Though broadly supportive of the war, Wilmot and some other anti-slavery Northern Democrats had increasingly come to view Polk as unduly favorable to Southern interests, partly due to Polk&#x27;s decision to compromise with Britain over the partition of Oregon. Unlike some Northern Whigs, Wilmot and other anti-slavery Democrats were largely unconcerned by the issue of racial equality, and instead opposed the expansion of slavery because they believed the institution was detrimental to the &quot;laboring white man.&quot; The Wilmot Proviso passed the House with the support of both Northern Whigs and Northern Democrats, breaking the normal pattern of partisan division in congressional votes, but it was defeated in the Senate, where Southerners controlled a proportionally higher share of seats. Several Northern congressmen subsequently defeated an attempt by President Polk and Senator Lewis Cass to extend the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.

In February 1848, Mexican and U.S. negotiators reached the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which provided for the cession of Alta California and New Mexico. Though many senators had reservations about the treaty, the Senate approved it in a 38-to-14 vote in February 1848. Senator John M. Clayton&#x27;s effort to reach a compromise over the status of slavery in the territories was defeated in the House, ensuring that slavery would be an important issue in the 1848 election.

====Election of 1848====

Led by John Van Buren, the Barnburners bolted from the 1848 Democratic National Convention after the party nominated a ticket consisting of Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and former Representative William O. Butler of Kentucky; Cass and Butler had both opposed the Wilmot Proviso. Shortly after the Democrats nominated Cass, a group of Whigs made plans for a convention of anti-slavery politicians and activists in case the 1848 Whig National Convention nominated General Zachary Taylor of Louisiana for president. With the strong backing of slave state delegates, Taylor defeated Henry Clay to win the Whig presidential nomination. For vice president, the Whigs nominated Millard Fillmore of New York, a conservative Northerner. The nomination of Taylor, a slaveholder without any history in the Whig Party, spurred anti-slavery Whigs to go through with their convention, which would meet in Buffalo, New York, in August. A faction of the Liberty Party led by Salmon P. Chase agreed to attend the convention, though another faction of the party, led by Gerrit Smith, refused to consider merging with another party.

Meanwhile, Barnburners convened in Utica, New York, on June 22; they were joined by a smaller number of Whigs and Democrats from outside New York. Though initially reluctant to accept to run for president, former President Van Buren accepted the group&#x27;s presidential nomination. Van Buren endorsed the position that slavery should be excluded from the territories acquired from Mexico, further declaring his belief that slavery was inconsistent with the &quot;principles of the Revolution&quot;. Because Van Buren had favored the gag rule and had generally accommodated pro-slavery leaders during his presidency, many Liberty Party leaders and anti-slavery Whigs were unconvinced as to the sincerity of Van Buren&#x27;s anti-slavery beliefs. Historian A. James Reichley writes that, while resentment stemming from his defeat at the 1844 Democratic National Convention may have played a role in his candidacy, Van Buren ran on the grounds that &quot;the long-term welfare of [the Democratic Party], and the nation, required that the [Democratic Party] shed its Calhounite influence, even at the cost of losing an election or two.&quot;

With mix of Democratic, Whig, and Liberty Party attendees, the National Free Soil Convention convened in Buffalo early August. Anti-slavery leaders made up a majority of the attendees, but the convention also attracted some Democrats and Whigs who were indifferent on the issue of slavery but disliked the nominee of their respective party. Salmon Chase, Preston King, and Benjamin Franklin Butler led the drafting of a platform that not only endorsed the Wilmot Proviso but also called for the abolition of slavery in Washington, D.C., and all U.S. territories. With the backing of most Democratic delegates, about half of the Whig delegates, and a small number of Liberty Party leaders, Van Buren defeated John P. Hale to win the fledgling party&#x27;s presidential nomination. For vice president, the Free Soil Party nominated Charles Francis Adams Sr., the youngest son of the recently deceased John Quincy Adams.

Some Free Soil leaders were initially optimistic that Van Buren could carry a handful of Northern states and force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but Van Buren did not win a single electoral vote. However, the nomination of Van Buren alienated many Whigs; except in northern Ohio, most Whig leaders and newspapers rallied around Taylor&#x27;s candidacy. Ultimately, Taylor won the election with a majority of the electoral vote and a plurality of the popular vote, improving on Clay&#x27;s 1844 performance in the South and benefiting from the defection of many Democrats to Van Buren in the North. Van Buren won ten percent of the national popular vote and fifteen percent of the popular vote in the Northern states; he received a popular vote total five times greater than that of Birney&#x27;s 1844 candidacy. Van Buren was the first third-party candidate in U.S. history to win at least ten percent of the national popular vote. In concurrent congressional elections, Salmon Chase won election to the Senate and about a dozen Free Soil candidates won election to the House of Representatives.

===Between elections, 1849–1852===


The Free Soil Party continued to exist after 1848, fielding candidates for various offices. At the state level, Free Soilers often entered into coalition with either of the major parties to elect anti-slavery officeholders. To sidestep the issue of the Wilmot Proviso, the Taylor administration proposed that the lands of the Mexican Cession be admitted as states without first organizing territorial governments; thus, slavery in the area would be left to the discretion of state governments rather than the federal government. In January 1850, Senator Clay introduced a separate proposal which included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. Free Soilers strongly opposed this proposal, focusing especially on the fugitive slave law.

Taylor died in July 1850 and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore. Fillmore and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which was based on Clay&#x27;s earlier proposal. The Whig Party became badly split between pro-Compromise Whigs like Fillmore and Webster and anti-Compromise Whigs like William Seward, who demanded the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act. The first of several prominent episodes concerning the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law occurred in late 1850, when Boston abolitionists helped Ellen and William Craft, two fugitive slaves, escape to Canada.

Though the fugitive slave act and its enforcement outraged anti-slavery activists, most Northerners viewed it as a necessary trade-off for sectional peace with the South, and there was a backlash in the North against the anti-slavery agitation. The Free Soil Party suffered from this backlash, as well as the desertion of many anti-slavery Democrats (including Van Buren himself), many of whom believed that sectional balance had been restored following Van Buren&#x27;s candidacy and the Compromise of 1850. Charles Sumner won election to the 32nd Congress, but Free Soilers lost a net of five seats in the 1850 and 1851 House of Representatives elections. As the 1852 presidential election approached, Free Soilers cast about for a candidate. Potential candidates with national stature like Van Buren and Senator Thomas Hart Benton declined to run, while Supreme Court Justice Levi Woodbury, another subject of speculation as a potential Free Soil candidate, died in 1851.

===1852 presidential election===

Enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act damaged Fillmore&#x27;s standing among Northerners and, with the backing of Senator Seward, General Winfield Scott won the presidential nomination at the 1852 Whig National Convention. The Whig national convention also adopted a platform that endorsed the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act. Scott and his advisers had initially hoped to avoid openly endorsing the Compromise of 1850 in order to court Free Soil support, but, as a concession to Southern Whigs, Scott agreed to support the Whig platform. The 1852 Democratic National Convention, meanwhile, nominated former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery. Free Soil leaders had initially considered supporting Scott, but they organized a national convention after Scott accepted the pro-Compromise Whig platform.

At the August 1852 Free Soil Convention, held in Pittsburgh, the party nominated a ticket consisting of Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire and former Representative George Washington Julian of Indiana. The party adopted a platform that called for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act and described slavery as &quot;a sin against God and a crime against man.&quot; Free Soil leaders strongly preferred Scott to Pierce, and Hale focused his campaign on winning over anti-slavery Democratic voters. The elections proved to be disastrous for the Whig Party, as Scott was defeated by a wide margin and the Whigs lost several congressional and state elections. Hale won just under five percent of the vote, performing most strongly in Massachusetts, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Though much of this drop in support was caused by the return of Barnburners to the Democratic Party, many individuals who had voted for Van Buren in 1848 sat out the 1852 election. In the aftermath of the decisive defeat of the Whigs, many Free Soil leaders predicted an impending realignment that would result in the formation of a larger anti-slavery party that would unite Free Soilers with anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats.

===Formation of the Republican Party===

Hoping to spur the creation of a transcontinental railroad, in 1853 Senator Douglas proposed a bill to create an organized territorial government in a portion of the Louisiana Purchase that was north of the 36°30′ parallel, and thus excluded slavery under the terms of the Missouri Compromise. After pro-slavery Southern senators blocked the passage of the proposal, Douglas and other Democratic leaders agreed to a bill that would repeal the Missouri Compromise and allow the inhabitants of the territories to determine the status of slavery. In response, Free Soilers issued the &quot;Appeal of the Independent Democrats&quot;, a manifesto that attacked the bill as the work of the Slave Power. Overcoming the opposition of Free Soilers, Northern Whigs, and many Democrats, the Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed into law in May 1854. The act deeply angered many Northerners, including anti-slavery Democrats and conservative Whigs who were largely apathetic towards slavery but were upset by the repeal of a thirty-year-old compromise. Pierce&#x27;s forceful response to protests stemming from the capture of escaped slave Anthony Burns further alienated many Northerners.

Throughout 1854, Democrats, Whigs, and Free Soilers held state and local conventions, where they denounced the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Many of the larger conventions agreed to nominate a fusion ticket of candidate opposed to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and some adopted portions of the Free Soil platform from 1848 and 1852. One of these groups met in Ripon, Wisconsin, and agreed to establish a new party known as the Republican Party if the Kansas–Nebraska Act passed. Though many Democrats and Whigs involved in the anti-Nebraska movement still clung to their partisan affiliation, others began to label themselves as Republicans. Another political coalition appeared in the form of the nativist and anti-Catholic Know Nothing movement, which formed the American Party. While the Republican Party almost exclusively appealed to Northerners, the Know Nothings gathered many adherents in both the North and South; some individuals joined both groups even while they remained part of the Whig Party or the Democratic Party.

Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, as voters provided support to a wide array of new parties opposed to the Democratic Party. Most victorious congressional candidates who were not affiliated with the Democratic Party had campaigned either independently of the Whig Party or in fusion with another party. &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;, a struggle between anti-slavery and pro-slavery settlers for control of Kansas Territory, escalated in 1855 and 1856, pushing many moderate Northerners to join the nascent Republican Party. As cooperation between Northern and Southern Whigs appeared to be increasingly impossible, leaders from both sections continued to abandon the party. In September 1855, Seward led his faction of Whigs into the Republican Party, effectively marking the end of the Whig Party as an independent and significant political force. In May 1856, after denouncing the Slave Power in a speech on the Senate floor, Senator Sumner was attacked by Congressman Preston Brooks, outraging Northerners. Meanwhile, the 1856 American National Convention nominated former President Fillmore for president, but many Northerners deserted the American Party after the party platform failed to denounce the Kansas–Nebraska Act.

The 1856 Republican National Convention convened in Philadelphia in June 1856. A committee chaired by David Wilmot produced a platform that denounced slavery, the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Pierce administration. Though Chase and Seward were the two most prominent members of the nascent party, the Republicans instead nominated John C. Frémont, the son-in-law of Thomas Hart Benton and a political neophyte. The party campaigned on a new version of an old Free Soil slogan: &quot;Free Speech, Free Press, Free Men, Free Labor, Free Territory, and Frémont&quot;. With the collapse of the Whig Party, the 1856 presidential election became a three-sided contest between Democrats, Know Nothings, and Republicans. During his campaign, Fillmore minimized the issue of nativism, instead attempting to use his campaign as a platform for unionism and a revival of the Whig Party. Ultimately, Democrat James Buchanan won the election with a majority of the electoral vote and 45 percent of the popular vote; Frémont won most of the remaining electoral votes and took 33 percent of the popular vote, while Fillmore won 21.6 percent of the popular vote and just eight electoral votes. Frémont carried New England, New York, and parts of the Midwest, but Buchanan nearly swept the South and won several Northern states.

== Ideology and positions ==

The 1848 Free Soil platform openly denounced the institution of slavery, demanding that the federal government &quot;relieve itself of all responsibility for the existence and continuance of slavery&quot; by abolishing slavery in all federal districts and territories. The platform declared: &quot;[W]e inscribe on our banner, &#x27;Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men,&#x27; and under it we will fight on, and fight forever, until a triumphant victory shall reward our exertions&quot;. Unlike the Liberty Party, the 1848 Free Soil Party platform did not address fugitive slaves or racial discrimination, nor did it call for the abolition of slavery in the states. The party nonetheless earned the support of many former Liberty Party leaders by calling for abolition wherever possible, the chief goal of the Liberty Party. The Free Soil platform also called for lower tariffs, reduced postal rates, and improvements to harbors. The 1852 party platform more overtly denounced slavery, and also called for the diplomatic recognition of Haiti. Many Free Soilers also supported the temperance movement.

== Base of support ==
During the 1848 election, the Free Soil Party fared best in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts. Though some anti-slavery Democrats found Cass acceptable or refused to vote for a ticket featuring Charles Francis Adams, about three-fifths of the support for Van Buren&#x27;s candidacy came from Democrats. About one-fifth of those who voted for Van Buren were former members of the Liberty Party, though a small number of Liberty Party members voted for Gerrit Smith instead. Except in New Hampshire and Ohio, relatively few Whigs voted for Van Buren, as slavery-averse Whigs like Abraham Lincoln, Thaddeus Stevens, and Horace Greeley largely backed Taylor.

In New England, many trade unionists and land reformers supported the Free Soil Party, though others viewed slavery as a secondary issue or were hostile to the anti-slavery movement. Other Free Soil Party supporters were active in the women&#x27;s rights movement, and a disproportionate number of those who attended the Seneca Falls Convention were associated with party. One leading women&#x27;s rights activist, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was the wife of Free Soil leader Henry Brewster Stanton and a cousin of Free Soil Congressman Gerrit Smith.

== Party leaders and other prominent individuals ==
Former President Martin Van Buren of New York and Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire served as the two presidential nominees of the party, while Charles Adams of Massachusetts and Congressman George Washington Julian served as the party&#x27;s vice-presidential nominees. Salmon P. Chase, Preston King, Gamaliel Bailey, and Benjamin Butler played crucial roles in leading the first party convention and drafting the first party platform. Among those who attended the first Free Soil convention were poet and journalist Walt Whitman and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, the latter of whom was part of a small group of African Americans to attend the convention. In September 1851, Julian, Congressman Joshua Reed Giddings, and Lewis Tappan organized a national Free Soil convention that met in Cleveland, Ohio. Other notable individuals associated with the party include Cassius Marcellus Clay 1876 Democratic presidential nominee Samuel J. Tilden, Senator Charles Sumner, educational reformer Horace Mann, poet John Greenleaf Whittier, future Montana governor Sidney Edgerton, educator Jonathan Blanchard, poet William Cullen Bryant, and writer Richard Henry Dana Jr.

== Legacy ==

===Free Soilers in the Republican Party===
The Free Soil Party essentially merged into the Republican Party after 1854. However, Martin Van Buren (who had already returned to the Democratic Party in November 1852), his followers and the Barnburners rejoined the Democratic Party. Like their Free Soil predecessors, Republican leaders in the late 1850s generally did not call for the abolition of slavery, but instead sought to prevent the extension of slavery into the territories. The Republicans combined the Free Soil stance on slavery with Whig positions on economic issues, such as support for high tariffs and federally-funded infrastructure projects. After 1860, the Republican Party became the dominant force in national politics. Reflecting on the new electoral strength of the Republican Party years later, Free Soiler and anti-slavery activist Henry Brewster Stanton wrote that &quot;the feeble cause I espoused at Cincinnati in 1832...[now rested] on the broad shoulders of a strong party which was marching to victory.&quot;

Former Free Soiler Salmon Chase was a major candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1860 Republican National Convention, but Abraham Lincoln defeated Chase, Seward, and other candidates to win the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. After Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded, eventually leading to the Civil War. During the war, a faction of the Republican Party known as the Radical Republicans emerged; these Radical Republicans generally went farther than other Republicans in advocating for racial equality and the immediate abolition of slavery. Many of the leading Radical Republicans, including Giddings, Chase, Hale, Julian, and Sumner, had been members of the Free Soil Party. Some Radical Republicans sought to replace Lincoln as the 1864 Republican presidential nominee with either Chase or Frémont, but Lincoln ultimately won re-nomination and re-election. 

In 1865, the Civil War came to an end with the surrender of the Confederacy, and the United States abolished slavery nationwide by ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment. Radical Republicans exercised an important influence during the subsequent Reconstruction era, calling for ambitious reforms designed to promote the political and economic equality of African Americans in the South.

In 1872, a disproportionate number of former Free Soilers helped found the short-lived Liberal Republican Party, a breakaway group of Republicans who launched an unsuccessful challenge to President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s 1872 re-election bid. Aside from defeating Grant, the party&#x27;s central goals were the end of Reconstruction, the implementation of civil service reform, and the reduction of tariff rates. Former Free Soiler Charles Francis Adams led on several presidential ballots of the 1872 Liberal Republican convention, but was ultimately defeated by Horace Greeley. Many other former Free Soilers remained in the Republican Party, including former Free Soil Congressman Henry Wilson, who served as vice president from 1873 until his death 1875.

===Memorials===

Free Soil Township, Michigan, was named after the Free Soil party in 1848.

===Recent revival===
In 2014, the party&#x27;s name was used for the American Free Soil Party with a focus on justice for immigrants, as well as combating discrimination. On February 15, 2019, the American Free Soil Party won ballot access for its first candidate to run under its banner in a partisan race when Dr. James W. Clifton filed to run for town council in Millersburg, Indiana. The following day, the party held its national convention and nominated its 2020 presidential ticket, former Southwick Commissioner Adam Seaman of Massachusetts and Dr. Enrique Ramos of Puerto Rico for president and vice president, respectively. On November 5, Clifton lost his race 47% to 53%.

<doc id="195139" wikidata="Q683478" url="?curid=195139" title="Lightning Bolt (band)">
<text>Lightning Bolt is an American noise rock duo from Providence, Rhode Island, composed of Brian Chippendale on drums and vocals and Brian Gibson on bass guitar. The band met and formed in 1994 as students of the Rhode Island School of Design. Lightning Bolt were listed 8th in Metacritic&#x27;s Artists of the Decade 2000–09.

Lightning Bolt are known for their guerrilla-style live performances, where they typically play on the ground rather than a stage, with the crowd gathered around them. The band&#x27;s sound is typically loud and aggressive, though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as compositional influences.

==History==

The band formed while Chippendale and Gibson attended the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island, and Chippendale had heard about &quot;a new kid who was a whiz on the bass guitar.&quot; The two formed Lightning Bolt, with Brian Chippendale on drums, Brian Gibson on bass guitar, and with Hisham Bharoocha on guitar and vocals joining the group after their first show. Bharoocha left the group in 1996 to continue with another RISD band that would eventually become Black Dice, and Chippendale took over vocal duties. The only officially released music with Bharoocha was a track on the &quot;Repopulation Program&quot; compilation. For the first few years, Lightning Bolt was primarily an improvisational band, touring the United States for months at a time and &quot;just playing&quot;. The concept of writing songs and recording an album didn&#x27;t occur to the band until 1997, when Ben McOsker, founder of Load Records, approached the duo.

During these formative years, Chippendale and his freshman-year college roommate Matt Brinkman began to set up Fort Thunder, a disused warehouse space in the Olneyville district of Providence. The space eventually came to house a number of local avant-garde artists and musicians, including Brian Ralph as well as Lightning Bolt.

The band&#x27;s first full-length album was a self-titled vinyl record on the Load Records label. The album was initially released in a limited edition pressing of 750 copies, and a 50-minute companion cassette titled &quot;Zone&quot; was released later. In 1999 the album was re-released on CD, including &quot;Zone&quot; as bonus tracks and alternative cover art.

Lightning Bolt&#x27;s second full-length album was &quot;Ride the Skies&quot;, released in 2001, followed by &quot;Wonderful Rainbow&quot; in 2003.

The band starred in the 2003 tour-DVD &quot;The Power of Salad&quot; directed by Peter Glantz and Nick Noe. Lightning Bolt have also performed in DVD compilations such as &quot;Pick a Winner&quot; (2004) and &quot;Sleep When You are Dead&quot; by performance artists Mighty Robot (2007).

Rumors have persisted concerning the release of an improvisational album entitled &quot;Frenzy&quot;. A post on Lightning Bolt&#x27;s official website in early 2004 read &quot;The next Lightning Bolt album, Frenzy, is currently in the works over at Load Records. It is expected to be available at the end of the summer.&quot; No official word has since been released.

In 2005, Lightning Bolt released &quot;Hypermagic Mountain&quot;, their most critically acclaimed album to date.

In 2006, Lightning Bolt was deported from Japan days after they arrived to continue their tour from the UK. Band members were detained on arrival on the grounds that they did not have work permits. Their official appeal was rejected after 48 hours, and they were deported back to the United States.

In 2009, their album &quot;Earthly Delights&quot; was released on Load Records.

In 2012, their first EP &quot;Oblivion Hunter&quot; was released on Load Records. The EP is a collection of unreleased material recorded in 2008.

On March 9, 2015, the group&#x27;s full length &quot;Fantasy Empire&quot; became available to stream via NPR&#x27;s First Listen. The accompanying writeup praised the increased clarity and fidelity of the recording, as compared to their earlier work, citing as a parallel example &quot;... the scene in The Wizard Of Oz where a sepia tone gives way to Technicolor; it opens up new vistas to the sound, while giving the band an opportunity to exhibit more involved musicianship.&quot; It was released on the Thrill Jockey label on March 25, 2015.

On October 11, 2019, the group released their seventh studio album &quot;Sonic Citadel&quot; on &quot;Thrill Jockey&quot;.

The band&#x27;s music takes cues from Japanese noise rock bands such as Boredoms and Ruins, although composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra are acknowledged influences. The band&#x27;s sound consists of Chippendale&#x27;s frenetic drumming, his usually incomprehensible vocals, and Gibson&#x27;s rhythmic bass guitar – an example of which is the song &quot;13 Monsters&quot;, where Chippendale sings a playground style counting chant through heavy distortion over the instrumentals of his drums and Gibson&#x27;s bass guitar. As for the band&#x27;s genre, Brian Gibson is quoted as saying, &quot;I hate, hate, hate the category &quot;noise-punk&quot; I really don&#x27;t like being labeled with two words that have so much baggage. It&#x27;s gross.&quot;

As the group&#x27;s vocalist, Chippendale eschews a conventional microphone, instead using the type of microphone built into a household telephone receiver, held in his mouth or attached to a mask, which is then run through an effects processor to further alter the sound. Chippendale has also used a KMD 8021 Drum Exciter, a simple drum-synth module, triggered by the bass drum.

Gibson plays his bass guitar tuned to cello standard tuning, in intervals of fifths (C G D A), using a banjo string for the high A. He used this four-string setup for several years, but has recently been seen using a five-string setup, tuned to C G D A E, with banjo strings for the A and E. Gibson also uses several effects pedals, including overdrive pedals, an octaver, a delay pedal, and a whammy pedal (pitch shifter).

Like many noise rock bands, Lightning Bolt mostly plays extremely loud, aggressive music. In the film &quot;The Power of Salad&quot;, Gibson attributes much of their success to volume:

We used to get more negative reactions when [we] didn&#x27;t have as loud of stuff. It&#x27;s just, be super loud and you&#x27;re all set. (laughs) The rock and roll has been revealed. I do feel that that&#x27;s the message – if there&#x27;s any message, that&#x27;s what it is. This is kinda what we do to keep ourselves excited these days. In &quot;these&quot; days – everyone knows what I&#x27;m talking about. (laughs)

The band have reportedly never been fans of the studio recording process. When they recorded five tracks for their eponymous debut album released in 1999, they discarded four of them and replaced them with lo-fidelity tracks recorded at various live shows from 1997 and 1998. However, their following two albums, &quot;Ride the Skies&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Rainbow&quot;, were recorded more traditionally in a studio. For &quot;Hypermagic Mountain&quot;, half the tracks were recorded in studio, while the rest were performed and recorded in a house direct to a 2-track DAT master tape, where the audio engineer was unable to tell exactly how the final result would sound.

Since the band has only two members and two instruments, their sound has a somewhat limited range, though this is often noted as a positive thing. In one interview, Gibson states that his experiences in Lightning Bolt &quot;has showed [him] the power of an extremely limited palette.&quot;

Lightning Bolt&#x27;s lyrics, when decipherable, are generally tongue-in-cheek, covering such topics as fairy tales, heavy metal clichés, terrorism, anarchy, and superheroes. They delve occasionally into more political subjects, such as the anti-Bush &quot;Dead Cowboy&quot; from &quot;Hypermagic Mountain&quot;.

==Live performances==
Lightning Bolt are known for their so-called &quot;guerrilla gigs&quot;, preferring to play on the floor of the venue rather than the stage, creating a tight circle of spectators around the band. They have also been known to start playing only a few seconds after the opening band finishes, often taking the audience by surprise. In 2004, Lightning Bolt played on the doorstep of radio DJ John Peel&#x27;s chalet at noon during the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival, about which neighbor Steve Albini of Shellac and Big Black commented &quot;Best alarm clock I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; They have also staged concerts in kitchens, on sidewalks, and in parking lots.

<doc id="195142" wikidata="Q5100693" url="?curid=195142" title="Chinese accounting standards">
<text>Chinese accounting standards are the accounting rules used in mainland China. As of February 2010, the Chinese accounting standard systems is composed of Basic Standard, 38 specific standards and application guidance.

Chinese accounting standards are unique because they originated in a socialist period in which the state was the sole owner of industry. Therefore, unlike Western accounting standards, they were less a tool of profit and loss, but an inventory of assets available to a company. In contrast to a Western balance sheet, Chinese accounting standards did not include an accounting of the debts that a corporation holds, and were less suitable for management control than for accounting for tax purposes.

This system of accounting was widely considered to be unsuitable for managing corporations in a market economy. In 2006, the Chinese government introduced a revised accounting law. This was the fruit of considerable discussion and protracted debate, involving the Ministry of Finance, members of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and representatives of some Chinese firms.

This revised law marked a large step forward for the continuing integration of world trade and capital markets, with China adopting a significant number of the accounting standards laid out by the International Accounting Standards Board. The old Chinese Accounting Standards (CAS) were largely replaced by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), to bring China more in line with the rest of the world. The similarity between the new Chinese accounting standards and the IFRS is almost 90–95%.

This has proven to be a massive undertaking. As a consequence Chinese companies who offer shares for sale in the United States used to be required to prepare three sets of statements, one using Chinese accounting standards (China GAAP), one using international standards (IFRS), and one using North American GAAP standards (US GAAP). However, since 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows foreign private issuers to use financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.

<doc id="195143" wikidata="Q2388366" url="?curid=195143" title="Eastern Townships">
<text>The Eastern Townships (, ) is a historical administrative region in southeastern Quebec, Canada. It lies between the St. Lawrence Lowlands and the American border, and extends from Granby in the southwest to Drummondville in the northeast. Since 1987, most of the area is within the administrative region Estrie, and the term Eastern Townships is now used in tourist literature.

The name derives from there also being western townships in Ontario.

==History==

Before European colonization the area was inhabited by the Abenaki, as attested by many toponyms such as Lake Memphremagog and Massawippi River.

Until 1791 the region was organized under the seigneurial system of New France. In 1791 the region was resurveyed under English law. It was divided into counties, which were in turn subdivided into townships.

Settlement by Europeans happened in three waves: first from New England, including some loyalists, then from the British Isles, and finally French-Canadians from surrounding areas.

From 1967 to 1981 the Eastern Townships were an administrative region of Quebec, (région 05). In 1981 the Commission de toponymie du Québec renamed it Estrie. In 1987 during the reorganization of the regional county municipalities, the region lost some territory:
* Arthabaska, Drummond, and parts of the counties of Wolfe and of Mégantic, moved to Centre-du-Québec.
* the other part of Mégantic moved to Chaudière-Appalaches
* Shefford and Missisquoi moved to Montérégie.
Although counties were abolished some survive as regional county municipalities, including Arthabaska, Brome, Compton, Frontenac, Missisquoi, and Shefford. Townships which survive as municipalities include: Cleveland, Hampden, Hatley, Lingwick, Marston, Melbourne, Orford, Memphrémagog, Potton, Saint-Camille, Sainte-Edwidge-de-Clifton, Stanstead, Stratford, Thetford, Valcourt, and Westbury.

<text>A bicycle wheel is a wheel, most commonly a wire wheel, designed for a bicycle. A pair is often called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready built &quot;off the shelf&quot; performance-oriented wheels.

Bicycle wheels are typically designed to fit into the frame and fork via dropouts, and hold bicycle tires.

==Invention==
The first wheel to use the tension in metal spokes was invented by Sir George Cayley to achieve lightness in his 1853 glider.

==Construction==
The first bicycle wheels followed the traditions of carriage building: a wooden hub, a fixed steel axle (the bearings were located in the fork ends), wooden spokes and a shrink fitted iron tire. A typical modern wheel has a metal hub, wire tension spokes and a metal or carbon fiber rim which holds a pneumatic rubber tire.

===Hub===
A hub is the center part of a bicycle wheel. It consists of an axle, bearings and a hub shell. The hub shell typically has two machined metal flanges to which spokes can be attached. Hub shells can be one-piece with press-in cartridge or free bearings or, in the case of older designs, the flanges may be affixed to a separate hub shell.

====Axle====
The axle is attached to dropouts on the fork or the frame. The axle can attach using a: 
* Quick release - a lever and skewer that pass through a hollow axle designed to allow for installation and removal of the wheel without any tools (found on most modern road bikes and some mountain bikes).
* Nut - the axle is threaded and protrudes past the sides of the fork/frame. (often found on track, fixed gear, single speed, BMX and inexpensive bikes)
* Bolt - the axle has a hole with threads cut into it and a bolt can be screwed into those threads. (found on some single speed hubs, Cannondale Lefty hubs)
* Thru axle - a removable axle with a threaded end that is inserted through a hole in one fork leg, through the hub, and then screwed into the other fork leg. Some axles have integrated cam levers that compress axle elements against the fork leg to lock it in place, while others rely on pinch bolts on the fork leg to secure it. Diameters for front thru axles include 20 mm, 15 mm, 12 mm, and 9 mm. Rear axles typically have diameters of 10 or 12 mm. Most thru axles are found on mountain bikes, although increasingly disc-braked cyclocross and road bikes are using them. Thru axles repeatably locate the wheel in the fork or frame, which is important to prevent misalignment of brake rotors when using disc brakes. Unlike other axle systems (except Lefty), the thru axle is specific to the fork or frame, not the hub. Hubs/wheels do not include axles, and the axle is generally supplied with the fork or frame. Adapters are usually available to convert wheels suitable for a larger thru axle to a smaller diameter, and to standard 9mm quick releases. This allows a degree of re-use of wheels between frames with different axle specifications. 
* Female axle - hollow center axle, typically 14, 15, 17, or 20 mm in diameter made of chromoly and aluminum, with two bolts thread into on either side. This design can be much stronger than traditional axles, which are commonly only 8 mm, 9 mm, 9.5 mm, or 10 mm in diameter. (found on higher end BMX hubs and some mountain bike hubs)

Since the 1980s, bicycles have adopted standard axle spacing: the hubs of front wheels are generally 100 mm wide fork spacing, road wheels with freehubs generally have a 130 mm wide rear wheel hub. Mountain bikes have adopted a 135 mm rear hub width, which allows clearance to mount a brake disc on the hub or to decrease the wheel dish for a more durable wheel. Freeride and downhill are available with both 142 and 150 mm spacing.

====Bearings====
The bearings allow the hub shell (and the rest of the wheel parts) to rotate freely about the axle. Most bicycle hubs use steel or ceramic ball bearings. Some hubs use serviceable &quot;cup and cone&quot; bearings, whereas some use pre-assembled replaceable &quot;cartridge&quot; bearings.

A &quot;cup and cone&quot; hub contains loose balls that contact an adjustable &#x27;cone&#x27; that is screwed onto the axle and a &#x27;race&#x27; that is pressed permanently into the hub shell. Both surfaces are smooth to allow the bearings to roll with little friction. This type of hub can be easily disassembled for lubrication, but it must be adjusted correctly; incorrect adjustment can lead to premature wear or failure.

In a &quot;cartridge bearing&quot; hub, the bearings are contained in a cartridge that is shaped like a hollow cylinder where the inner surface rotates with respect to the outer surface by the use of ball bearings. The manufacturing tolerances, as well as seal quality, can be significantly superior to loose ball bearings. The cartridge is pressed into the hub shell and the axle rests against the inner race of the cartridge. The cartridge bearing itself is generally not serviceable or adjustable; instead the entire cartridge bearing is replaced in case of wear or failure.

====Hub shell and flanges====
The hub shell is the part of the hub to which the spokes (or disc structure) attach. The hub shell of a spoked wheel generally has two flanges extending radially outward from the axle. Each flange has holes or slots to which spokes are affixed. Some wheels (like the Full Speed Ahead RD-800) have an additional flange in the center of the hub. Others (like some from Bontrager and Zipp) do not have a noticeable flange. The spokes still attach to the edge of the hub but not through visible holes. Other wheels (like those from Velomax/Easton) have a threaded hub shell that the spokes thread into.

On traditionally spoked wheels, flange spacing affects the lateral stiffness of the wheel, with wider being stiffer, and flange diameter affects the torsional stiffness of the wheel and the number of spoke holes that the hub can accept, with larger diameter being stiffer and accepting more holes. Asymmetrical flange diameters, tried to mitigate the adverse effects of asymmetrical spacing and dish necessary on rear wheels with many sprockets, have also been used with modest benefits.

=====Hub brakes=====
Some hubs have attachments for disc brakes or form an integral part of drum brakes.
* Disc brakes – a disc brake comprises a circular plate or disc attached to the hub which is squeezed between brake pads mounted within a caliper that is fixed to one side of the wheel forks. The brake disc can be attached in a variety of ways using bolts or a central locking ring.
* Drum brakes – a drum brake has two brake shoes that expand out into the inside of the hub shell. Rear-mounted drum brakes are often used on tandems to supplement the rear rim brake and give additional stopping power.
* Coaster brake – coaster brakes are a particular type of drum brake which is actuated by a backward pressure applied to the pedals. The mechanism is contained inside the bicycle wheel hub shell.
For information on other types of bicycle brakes see the full article on bicycle brake systems.

=====Gears=====
The rear hub has one or more methods for attaching a gear to it.
* Freehub – The mechanism that allows the rider to coast is built into the hub. Splines on the freehub body allow a single sprocket or, more commonly, a cassette containing several sprockets to be slid on. A lock ring then holds the cog(s) in place. This is the case for most modern bicycles.
* Freewheel – The mechanism that allows the rider to coast is not part of the hub, it is contained in a separate freewheel body. The hub has threads that allow the freewheel body to be screwed on, and the freewheel body has threads or splines for fitting sprockets, or in the case of most single speed freewheels an integral sprocket. This style of hub was used before the freehub became practical.
* Track sprocket – There is no mechanism that allows the rider to coast. There are two sets of threads on the hub shell. The threads are in opposite directions. The inner (clockwise) set of threads is for a track sprocket and the outer (counter-clockwise) set is for a reverse threaded lock ring. The reverse threads on the lock ring keep the sprocket from unscrewing from the hub, which is otherwise possible when slowing down.
* Flip-flop hub – Both sides of the hub are threaded, allowing the wheel to be removed and reversed in order to change which gear is used. Depending on the style of threads, may be used with either a single-speed freewheel or a track sprocket.
* Internal geared hub – the mechanism to provide multiple gear-ratios is contained inside the shell of the hub. Many bicycles with three-speed internally geared hubs were built in the last century.

===Rim===

The rim is commonly a metal extrusion that is butted into itself to form a hoop, though may also be a structure of carbon fiber composite, and was historically made of wood. Some wheels use both an aerodynamic carbon hoop bonded to an aluminum rim on which to mount conventional bicycle tires.

Metallic bicycle rims are now normally made of aluminium alloy, although until the 1980s most bicycle rims - with the exception of those used on racing bicycles - were made of steel and thermoplastic.

Rims designed for use with rim brakes provide a smooth parallel braking surface, while rims meant for use with disc brakes or hub brakes sometimes lack this surface.

The Westwood pattern rim was one of the first rim designs, and rod-actuated brakes, which press against the inside surface of the rim were designed for this rim. These rims cannot be used with caliper rim brakes.

The cross-section of a rim can have a wide range of geometry, each optimized for particular performance goals. Aerodynamics, mass and inertia, stiffness, durability, tubeless tire compatibility, brake compatibility, and cost are all considerations. If the part of the cross-section of the rim is hollow where the spokes attached, as in the Sprint rim pictured, it is described as box-section or double-wall to distinguish it from single-wall rims such as the Westwood rim pictured. The double wall can make the rim stiffer. Triple-wall rims have additional reinforcement inside the box-section.

Aluminum rims are often reinforced with either single eyelets or double eyelets to distribute the stress of the spoke. A single eyelet reinforces the spoke hole much like a hollow rivet. A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both walls of a double-walled rim.

Bicycle rims utilizing inner tubes also require rim tapes or strips, a flexible but tough liner (usually rubber or woven nylon or similar material) attached to the inner circumference of the wheel to cover the ends of the nipples. Otherwise, the nipple ends wear a hole in the tube causing a flat tire.

====Clincher rims====

Most bicycle rims are &quot;clincher&quot; rims for use with clincher tires. These tires have a wire or aramid (Kevlar or Twaron) fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the bead lock. If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has spoke holes, they must be covered by a rim tape or strip, usually rubber, cloth, or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.

An advantage of this system is that the inner tube can be easily accessed in the case of a leak to be patched or replaced.

The ISO 5775-2 standard defines designations for bicycle rims. It distinguishes between

# Straight-side (SS) rims
# Crochet-type (C) rims
# Hooked-bead (HB) rims

Traditional clincher rims were straight-sided. Various &quot;hook&quot; (also called &quot;crochet&quot;) designs emerged in the 1970s to hold the bead of the tire in place, allowing high (6–10 bar, 80–150 psi) air pressure.

====Tubular or sew-up rims====
Some rims are designed for tubular tires which are torus shaped and attached to the rim with adhesive. The rim provides a shallow circular outer cross section in which the tire lies instead of flanges on which tire beads seat.

====Tubeless====
A tubeless tire system requires an airtight rim — capable of being sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they go all the way through the rim) and the tire bead seat — and a compatible tire. Universal System Tubeless (UST), originally developed by Mavic, Michelin and Hutchinson for mountain bikes is the most common system of tubeless tires/rims for bicycles. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.

Some cyclists have avoided the price premium for a tubeless system by sealing the spoke holes with a special rim strip or tape and then sealing the valve stem and bead seat with a latex sealer. However, tires not designed for the tubeless application do not have as robust a sidewall as those that are.

The drawbacks to tubeless tires are that they are notorious for being harder to mount on the rim than clincher tires, and that the cyclist must still carry a spare tube to insert in case of a flat tire due to a puncture.

French tire manufacturer Hutchinson has introduced a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims, like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road Tubeless rim is similar to the hook bead of a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road Tubeless tire, creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.

In 2006, Shimano and Hutchinson introduced a tubeless system for road bikes.

===Spokes===
The rim is connected to the hub by a number of spokes, which are rods. While early bicycle wheels used wooden spokes that could be loaded only in compression, modern bicycle wheels almost exclusively use spokes that can only be loaded in tension.

The rear wheel is subjected to greater stress because more weight is carried on the rear wheel. The rear wheel spokes on the right are more likely to fail. The rear wheels are asymmetrical to make room for multisprocket gear clusters. This asymmetry means that the spokes on the right are twice as tight as those on the left. The spokes break due to fatigue and not excessive force.

One end of each spoke is threaded for a specialized nut, called a nipple, which is used to connect the spoke to the rim and adjust the tension in the spoke. This is normally at the rim end. The hub end normally has a 90-degree bend to pass through the spoke hole in the hub, and a head so it does not slip through the hole. This is the J-bend type. Another type is straight pull spokes, which have no bend at the hub end, just a head. The major materials for spoke nipples are aluminum and brass.

&quot;Double-butted&quot; spokes have reduced thickness over the center section and are lighter, more elastic, and more aerodynamic than spokes of uniform thickness. &quot;Single-butted&quot; spokes are thicker at the hub and then taper to a thinner section all the way to the threads at the rim. &quot;Triple-butted&quot; spokes also exist and are thickest at the hub, thinner at the threaded end, and thinnest in the middle.

====Cross section====
Spokes are usually circular in cross-section, but high-performance wheels may use spokes of flat or oval cross-section, also known as bladed, to reduce aerodynamic drag. Some spokes are hollow tubes.

====Material====
The spokes on the vast majority of modern bicycle wheels are steel or stainless steel. Stainless steel spokes are favored by most manufacturers and riders for their durability, stiffness, damage tolerance, and ease of maintenance. Non-stainless steel spokes on older or cheaper bikes are sometimes surface-treated by galvanization, paint, or, more rarely, chrome plating, and can rust eventually. Spokes are also available in titanium, aluminum, carbon fiber, and non-rigid materials such as polyethylene composites.
====Number of spokes====
Conventional metallic bicycle wheels have 24, 28, 32 or 36 spokes. Wheels on tandems and BMX often have 40 or 48 spokes to support additional stresses and weight. Lowrider bicycles may have as many as 144 spokes per wheel.

Wheels with fewer spokes have an aerodynamic advantage, as the drag is reduced. The reduced number of spokes also results in a larger section of the rim being unsupported, necessitating stronger and often heavier rims. Some wheel designs also locate the spokes unequally into the rim, which requires a stiff rim hoop and correct tension of the spokes. Conventional wheels with spokes distributed evenly across the circumference of the rim are considered more durable and forgiving to poor maintenance. The more general trend in wheel design suggests technological advancement in rim materials may result in further reduction in the number of spokes per wheel.

====Lacing====
Lacing is the process of threading spokes through holes in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same lacing pattern on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different lacing patterns on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer torque from the hub to the rim, as with driven wheels or wheels with drum or disc brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the hub flange up to a &quot;tangential lacing pattern&quot; to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various lacing patterns are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses.

Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and hub diameter will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called &quot;leading spokes&quot; tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - &quot;trailing spokes&quot; are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the hub torque in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.

Wheels that are not required to transfer any significant amount of torque from the hub to the rim are often laced radially. Here, the spokes leave the hub at perpendicular to the axle and go straight to the rim, without crossing any other spokes - e.g., &quot;cross-0&quot;. This lacing pattern can not transfer torque as efficiently as tangential lacing. Thus it is generally preferred to build a crossed-spoke wheel where torque forces, whether driving or braking, issue from the hub. Where braking is concerned, the older-style caliper devices that contact the rims to apply braking force are not affected by lacing patterns in this way because braking forces are transferred from the calipers directly to the rim, then to the tires and then to the roadway. Disc brakes, however, transfer their force to the roadway via the spokes from the disc&#x27;s mounting point on the hub and are therefore affected by the lacing pattern in a manner similar to that of the drive system.

Hubs that have previously been laced in any other pattern should not be used for radial lacing, as the pits and dents created by the spokes can be the weak points along which the hub flange may break. This is not always the case: for example if the hub used has harder, steel flanges like those on a vintage bicycle.

Wheel builders also employ other exotic spoke lacing patterns (such as &quot;crow&#x27;s foot&quot;, which is essentially a mix of radial and tangential lacing) as well as innovative hub geometries. Most of these designs take advantage of new high-strength materials or manufacturing methods to improve wheel performance. As with any structure, however, practical usefulness is not always agreed, and often nonstandard wheel designs may be opted for solely aesthetic reasons.

====Adjustment (&quot;truing&quot;)====
There are three aspects of wheel geometry which must be brought into adjustment in order to true a wheel. &quot;Lateral truing&quot; refers to elimination of local deviations of the rim to the left or right of center. &quot;Vertical truing&quot; refers to adjustments of local deviations (known as hop) of the radius, the distance from the rim to the center of the hub. &quot;Dish&quot; refers to the left-right centering of the plane of the rim between the lock nuts on the outside ends of the axle. This plane is itself determined as an average of local deviations in the lateral truing. For most rim-brake bicycles, the dish will be symmetrical on the front wheel. However, on the rear wheel, because most bicycles accommodate a rear sprocket (or group of them), the dishing will often be asymmetrical: it will be dished at a deeper angle on the non-drive side than on the drive side.

In addition to the three geometrical aspects of truing, the overall tension of the spokes is significant to the wheel&#x27;s fatigue durability, stiffness, and ability to absorb shock. Too little tension leads to a rim that is easily deformed by impact with rough terrain. Too much tension can deform the rim, making it impossible to true, and can decrease spoke life. Spoke tensiometers are tools which measure the tension in a spoke. Another common method for making rough estimates of spoke tension involves plucking the spokes and listening to the audible tone of the vibrating spoke. The optimum tension depends on the spoke length and spoke gauge (diameter). Tables are available online which list tensions for each spoke length, either in terms of absolute physical tension, or notes on the musical scale which coincide with the approximate tension to which the spoke should be tuned. In the real world, a properly trued wheel will not, in general, have a uniform tension across all spokes, due to variation among the parts from which the wheel is made.

Finally, for best, long-lasting results, spoke wind-up should be minimized. When a nipple turns, it twists the spoke at first, until there is enough torsional stress in the spoke to overcome the friction in the threads between the spoke and the nipple. This is easiest to see with bladed or ovalized spokes, but occurs in round spokes as well. If a wheel is ridden with this torsional stress left in the spokes, they may untwist and cause the wheel to become out of true. Bladed and ovalized spokes may be held straight with an appropriate tool as the nipple is turned. The common practice for minimizing wind-up in round spokes is to turn the nipple past the desired orientation by about a quarter turn, and then turn it back that quarter turn.

In wheel truing, all these factors must be incrementally brought into balance against each other. A commonly recommended practice is to find the worst spot on the wheel, and bring it slightly more into true before moving on to the next worst spot on the wheel.

&quot;Truing stands&quot; are mechanical devices for mounting wheels and truing them. It is also possible to true a wheel while it is mounted on the bike: brake pads or some other fixed point may be used as a reference mark, however this is less accurate.

===Nipples===

At one end of each spoke is a specialized nut, called a nipple, which is used to connect the spoke to the rim and adjust the tension in the spoke. The nipple is usually located at the rim end of the spoke but on some wheels is at the hub end to move its weight closer to the axis of the wheel, reducing the moment of inertia. A variant of this is integrating nipples into the hub, its flange containing the threads for usually bladed spokes.

The most common materials used for bicycle nipples are brass and aluminum (often referred to as &quot;alloy&quot;). Brass nipples are heavier than aluminum, but they are more durable. Aluminum nipples save weight, but they are less durable than brass and more likely to corrode.

A nipple at the rim of a wheel usually protrudes from the rim towards the center of the wheel, but in racing wheels may be internal to the rim, offering a slight aerodynamic advantage.

===Alternatives===
A wheel can be formed in one piece from a material such as thermoplastic (glass-filled nylon in this case), carbon fiber or aluminium alloy. Thermoplastic is commonly used for inexpensive BMX wheels. They have a low maximum tire pressure of 45 psi (3bars or atmospheres). Carbon fiber is typically used for high-end aerodynamic racing wheels.

===Disc wheels===

Disc wheels are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag. A full disc is usually heavier than traditional spoke wheels, and can be difficult to handle when ridden with a cross wind. For this reason, international cycling organizations often ban disc wheels or limit their use to the rear wheel of a bicycle. However, international triathlon federations were (and are still) less restrictive and this is what led to the wheels&#x27; initial usage growth in popularity in the 1980s.

A disc wheel may simply be a fairing that clips onto a traditional, spoke wheel, addressing the drag that the spokes generate by covering them; or the disc can be integral to the wheel with no spokes inside. In the latter case carbon fiber is the material of choice. A spoke wheel with a disc cover may not be legal under UCI Union Cycliste Internationale rules because it is a non-structural fairing but are again acceptable under ITU International Triathlon Union rules.

A compromise that reduces weight and improves cross wind performance has a small number (three or four) tension-compression spokes molded integral to the rim – also typically carbon fiber.

==Types==
Bicycle wheels can be categorized by their primary use.

===Road/racing bicycle wheels===

For road bicycle racing performance there are several factors which are generally considered the most important:

* aerodynamics
* weight
* rotational inertia
* hub/bearing smoothness
* stiffness
Semi-aerodynamic and aerodynamic wheelsets are now commonplace for road bicycles. Aluminum rims are still the most common, but carbon fiber is also becoming popular. Carbon fiber is also finding use in hub shells to reduce weight; however, because of the hub&#x27;s proximity to the center of rotation reducing the hub&#x27;s weight has less effect to the rotational inertia than reducing the rim&#x27;s weight.

Semi-aerodynamic and aerodynamic wheelsets are characterized by greater rim depth, which is the radial distance between the outermost and the innermost surfaces of the rim; a triangular or pyramidal cross-section; and by fewer numbers of spokes, or no spokes at all—with blades molded of composite material supporting the rim. The spokes are also often flattened in the rotational direction to reduce wind drag. These are called &quot;bladed spokes&quot;. However, semi-aerodynamic and aerodynamic wheelsets tend to be heavier than more traditional spoked wheelsets due to the extra shapings of the rims and spokes. More importantly, the rims must be heavier when there are fewer spokes, as the unsupported span between spokes is greater. A number of wheel manufacturers are now producing wheels with roughly half the spokes of the highest performance traditional wheel from the 1980s, with approximately the same rotational inertia and less total weight. These improvements have been made possible primarily through improved aluminum alloys for the rims.

Most clincher carbon fiber wheelsets, such as those made by Zipp and Mavic, still use aluminum parts at the clinching part of the rim. An increased number of all-carbon rims, such as Campagnolo Hyperon Ultra Clincher, Viva v8 wheels, Bontrager&#x27;s Carbon Clincher wheels, DT Swiss RRC1250, Corima Winium and Aero (also tubeless, see below) and Lightweight Standard C wheelsets are now available.

====700C road bicycle wheels / ISO 622 mm====
Touring, race, and cyclo-cross bicycles may have vastly different design goals for their wheels. Aerodynamic performance and low weight are beneficial for road bicycles, while for cyclo-cross strength gains importance, and for touring bicycles, strength becomes more important again. However, this diameter of rim, identical in diameter to the &quot;29er&quot; rim, is by far the most common on these styles of bicycles. Road wheels may be designed for tubular or clincher tires, commonly referred to as &quot;700C&quot; tires.

====650C triathlon bicycle wheels / ISO 571 mm====
These wheels experienced a brief popularity in the 1990s on triathlon bikes.

====650B gravel bicycle wheels / ISO 584 mm====
In the late 2010s, 650B wheels began appearing on gravel bikes.

===Mountain bike wheels===

Mountain bike wheels are described by the approximate outer diameter of the rim plus a wide, ~2+ inch tire.

====24 inch / ISO 507 mm ====
24-inch clincher tires (with inner tubes) are the most common wheel size for junior mountain bikes. The typical 24-inch rim has a diameter of and an outside tire diameter of about .

====26 inch / ISO 559 mm ====
26-inch clincher tires (with inner tubes) were the most common wheel size for new mountain bikes until the early 2010s. This tradition was started initially because the early mountain bike pioneers procured the wheels for their early bikes from American-made bicycles rather than the larger European standards in use. The typical 26-inch rim has a diameter of and an outside tire diameter of about .

====27.5 inch / ISO 584 mm ====

27.5-inch mountain bike wheels (which some also refer to as 650B use a rim that has a diameter of 584 mm (23.0″) with wide, knobby tires (≈27.5 ⋅ 2.3 / ISO 58-584) are approximately the midway point between the 26-inch (ISO-559mm) and the 29-inch (ISO-622mm) standards. They carry some of the advantages of both formats, with a smoother ride than a 26-inch wheel and more stiffness and durability than a 29″ wheel.

====29 inch / ISO 622 mm ====

&quot;29-inch wheels&quot;, which also conform to the popular 700C (622 mm diameter clincher) wheel standard are becoming more popular for not only cyclocross bikes but also cross-country mountain bikes. Their rim diameter of is identical to most road, hybrid, and touring bicycle wheels, but they are typically reinforced for greater durability in off-road riding. The average 29-inch mountain bike tire is ISO 59-622 - corresponding to an outside diameter of about .

32 inch / ISO 686

32-inch wheels have been in use on unicycles and have been appropriated for bicycles to create bikes more proportional for taller riders.

36 inch / ISO 787

36-inch wheels have been developed to create bikes more proportional for taller riders.

===BMX wheels===
There are two distinct wheel sizes that get described as 20 in., and both get used in the BMX sport.

====20 inch / ISO 406 mm====
Usually 20 inches in diameter (rim diameter of 406 mm), BMX wheels are small for several reasons: they are suitable for young and small riders; their lower cost is compatible with inexpensive bicycles; the size makes them stronger to withstand the additional loads generated by BMX jumps and stunts; and to reduce rotational inertia for easier wheel acceleration.

====20 inch / ISO 451 mm====
Nominally 20 x 1-1/8″ or 20 x 1-3/8″, with rim diameter 451 mm. These are intended for racing by lightweight BMX riders, and sometimes referred to as &quot;skinnies&quot;. The size is also used on classic British folding or shopping bikes.

==Technical aspects==

===Sizes===
Bicycle rims and tires came in many different types and sizes before efforts were made to standardize and improve wheel/tire compatibility. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation (ETRTO) define a modern, unambiguous system of sizing designations and measurement procedures for different types of tires and rims in international standard ISO 5775. For example:
* For wired-edge tires the ISO designation lists the width of the inflated tire and the &quot;bead-seat diameter&quot;, both in millimeters and separated by a hyphen: 37-622. The bead seat diameter (BSD) is the diameter of the surface of the rim upon which the tire bead sits.
* For rims the ISO designation lists the rim&#x27;s bead seat diameter and the rim&#x27;s inner width, both in millimeters and separated by a cross, along with a letter code for the rim type (e.g., &quot;C&quot; = Crochet-type): 622x19C

In practice, most tires (and inner tubes) sold today carry, in addition to the modern ISO 5775-1 designation, some historic size markings, which are still widely used:
* an old French tire designation that was based on the approximate outer diameter of the inflated tire in millimeters. The Japanese Industrial Standard JIS D 9112 continues to provide an official definition for the French tire designations. For example: 700×35 C.
* an old British inch-based designation: 597 mm (26 × ), 590 mm (26 × ), 630 mm (27 × ), and 635 mm (28 × )

Which designation is most popular varies with region and type of bicycle. For a comprehensive equivalence table between old and new markings, see the ISO 5775 article, the table in Annex A of the ISO 5772 standard, as well as Tire Sizing by Sheldon Brown.

Most road and racing bicycles today use 622 mm diameter (700C) rims, though 650C rims are popular with smaller riders and triathletes. The 650C size has the ISO diameter size of 571 mm. Size 650B is 584 mm and 650A is 590 mm. 650B is being promoted as a &#x27;best of both worlds&#x27; size for mountain biking. Most adult mountain bikes use 26 inch wheels. Smaller youth mountain bikes use 24 inch wheels. The larger 700C (29 inch) wheels have enjoyed some recent popularity among off-road bicycle manufacturers. These rims are the same bead seat diameter as 700C wheels and are generally compatible with bicycle frames and tires designed for the 700C standard, however, rims designated as 29 inch are designed for wider tires than rims designated 700C, so frame clearance may be an issue. The formerly popular 27 inch (630 mm) wheel size is now rare.

Children&#x27;s bicycles are commonly sized primarily based on wheel diameter rather than seat tube length (along the rider&#x27;s inseam) dimension. Thus, a wide range of small bike wheels are still found, ranging from diameter to .

Smaller wheel sizes are also found on folding bicycles to minimise the folded size. These range from 16-inch diameter (e.g. Brompton) through 20 inches (e.g. Bike Friday) up to even 26 inches.

Wheel rims also come in a variety of widths to provide optimum performance for different uses. High performance road racing rims are narrow, 18 mm or so. Wider touring or durable off-road tires require rims of 24 mm wide or more.

====26 inch====
The common &quot;26-inch&quot; wheel used on mountain bikes and beach cruisers is an American size using a 559 mm rim, traditionally with hooked edges.

=====Other sizes 26″=====
There are four other &quot;26-inch&quot; (British designation) or &quot;650&quot; (French) sizes, from the narrow tires to the widest, which traditionally all measured the same outside diameter.

* 650 - ISO 32-597 (26 ⋅ ) - Older British sport bikes. Schwinns with narrow tires.
* 650A - ISO 37-590 (26 ⋅ ) - Common on many vintage frames ranging from American-made Murray and Huffy as well as English and French manufactures like Raleigh and Peugeot.
* 650B - ISO 40-584 (26 ⋅ ) - Also 650B demi-ballon. French tandems, Porteurs, touring bicycles; enjoying a revival. (584 mm rims with large volume ISO 56-584 knobby tires, aka; balloon, are also known as 27.5 inch mountain bike wheels)
* 650C - ISO 44-571 (26 ⋅ ) - Formerly 47mm wide on Schwinn cruisers and for British trade/delivery bikes. Currently ISO 28-571, size is the same, but the narrower and less overall wheel diameter are built for triathlon, time trial and small road bikes.

Widths of tires and corresponding ISO width designations may vary, though the wheel outside diameter remains approximately the same.

====28 inch====
Traditionally, there were four different sizes of 28-inch diameter wheels, from the narrow tires to the widest, they all measured the same outside diameter, which coincide with four different families of 700 tire sizes, these are 700, 700A, 700B and 700C. The largest of these rims (ISO 647mm/642mm) with the narrower tires are no longer available.

===Rolling resistance===
There are a number of variables that determine rolling resistance: tire tread, width, diameter, tire construction, tube type (if applicable), and pressure are all important.

Smaller diameter wheels, all else being equal, have higher rolling resistance than larger wheels. &quot;Rolling resistance increases in near proportion as wheel diameter is decreased for a given constant inflation pressure.&quot;

===Rotating mass===
Due to the fact that wheels rotate as well as translate (move in a straight line) when a bicycle moves, more force is required to accelerate a unit of mass on the wheel than on the frame. In wheel design, reducing the rotational inertia has the benefit of more responsive, faster-accelerating wheels. To accomplish this, wheel designs are employing lighter rim materials, moving the spoke nipples to the hub or using lighter nipples such as aluminum. Note however that rotational inertia is a factor only during acceleration (and deceleration/braking). At constant speed, aerodynamics are a significant factor. For climbing, total mass remains important. See Bicycle performance for more detail.

===Dish===

The hub flanges of modern tension-spoked bicycle wheels are always spaced wider than where the spokes attach to the rim. When viewed in cross section, the spokes and hub form a triangle, a structure that is stiff both vertically and laterally. In three dimensions, if the spokes were covered (visualize paper covering the spokes on each side), they would form two cones or &quot;dishes.&quot; The greater the separation between the hub flanges, the deeper the dishes, and the stiffer and stronger the wheel can be laterally. The more vertical the spokes, the shallower the dish, and the less stiff the wheel will be laterally.

The dishes on each side of a wheel are not always equal. The cogset (freewheel or cassette) of a rear wheel and disc brake rotors, if installed, takes up width on the hub, and so the flanges may not be located symmetrically about the center plane of the hub or the bike. Since the rim must be centered, but the hub flanges are not, there is a difference in dish between the two sides. Such an asymmetrical wheel is called a &quot;dished&quot; wheel. The side of the wheel with less dish has slightly shorter but significantly higher-tensioned spokes than the side with more dish. Several different techniques have been tried to minimize this spoke asymmetry. In addition to modified hub geometry, some rims have off-center spoke holes, and the mounting of common J-bend spokes at the hub flange can be altered &quot;inboard&quot; or &quot;outboard&quot;.

A truing stand or a dishing gauge, can be used to measure the position of the rim relative to the hub. Thus &quot;dishing&quot; is also used to describe the process of centering the rim on the hub, even in the case of symmetrical wheels.

===Stiffness===
The stiffness of a bicycle wheel can be measured in three primary directions: radial, lateral, and torsional. The radial stiffness is primarily a measure of how well the wheel absorbs bumps from the surface on which it rolls. Lateral stiffness, especially of the front wheel influences the handling of the bicycle. Torsional, or tangential stiffness is a measure of how well the wheel transmits propulsive and braking forces, if applied at the hub, as in the case of hub or disc brakes.

Several factors affect these stiffnesses to varying degrees. These include wheel radius, rim bending and torsional stiffness, number of spokes, spoke gauge, lacing pattern, hub stiffness, hub flange spacing, hub radius. In general lateral and radial stiffness decreases with the number of spoke crossings and torsional stiffness increases with the number of spoke crossings. One factor that has little influence on these stiffnesses is spoke tension.

Too much spoke tension, however, can lead to catastrophic failure in the form of buckling. The &quot;most significant factor affecting the lateral spoke system stiffness&quot; is the angle between the spokes and the wheel midplane. Thus any change that increases this angle, such as increasing the width of the hub, while keeping all other parameters constant, increases the resistance to buckling.

<text>Aníbal Verón was a bus driver from Salta, Argentina. On 10 November 2000 he was protesting together with other workers from his company, who had been fired with unpaid salaries seven months overdue. The protest was harshly repressed, and Verón (aged 37 at the time) was shot and killed.

Since then, Verón became a political martyr for the unemployed workers of Argentina. An activist organization of &quot;piqueteros&quot; was named after him &quot;CTD Aníbal Verón&quot;, or &quot;MTD Anibal Veron&quot;.

<doc id="195149" wikidata="Q48525" url="?curid=195149" title="Federal government of the United States">
<text>The federal government of the United States (U.S. federal government or U.S. government) is the common government of the United States, a federal republic located primarily in North America, comprising 50 states, five major self-governing territories, several island possessions, and the federal district (national capital) of Washington, D.C., where the majority of the federal government is based.

The U.S. federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the president, and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In the federal division of power, the federal government shares sovereignty with each of the 50 states in their respective territories. U.S. law recognizes Indigenous tribes as possessing sovereign powers, while being subject to federal jurisdiction.

== Naming ==

The full name of the republic is the &quot;United States of America&quot;. No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party. The terms &quot;Government of the United States of America&quot; or &quot;United States Government&quot; are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively. 

In casual conversation or writing, the term &quot;Federal Government&quot; is often used, and the term &quot;U.S. Government&quot; is sometimes used. The terms &quot;Federal&quot; and &quot;National&quot; in government agency or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government; for instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Park Service. Because the seat of government is in Washington, D.C., &quot;Washington&quot; is sometimes used as a metonym for the federal government.

== History ==
The U.S. government was established in a series of initiatives in the late 18th century, starting with its decision to establish the Continental Army and appoint George Washington as its commander. The Continental Army resisted the British during the American Revolutionary War, which began in 1775. The following year, in July 1776, delegates to the Second Continental Congress, gathered at present-day Independence Hall in the colonial capital of Philadelphia, unanimously adopted the United States Declaration of Independence with each of the 56 colonial-era delegates signing it. In September 1783, the Thirteen Colonies ultimately prevailed over the British in the Revolutionary War, establishing the United States as an independent nation. On March 4, 1789, again gathered in Philadelphia, the colonies ratified and adopted the Constitution of the United States, which established the nation&#x27;s federal rule of law and was largely based on federalism, republicanism and democracy. 

Under the U.S. Constitution, the power of the U.S. federal government is shared between its executive, legislative, and judicial branches, state governments, and the people. It is a mixed system, neither pure republic nor pure democracy, and often described as a democratic republic, representative democracy, or constitutional republic.

The interpretation and execution of these principles, including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised, have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution. Some make a case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals, the states, or other recognized entities.

Since the American Civil War, the powers of the federal government have expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that time when the legislative branch was more powerful, including the decades immediately following the American Civil War, or when states&#x27; rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action, executive prerogative or by a constitutional interpretation by the courts.

One of the theoretical pillars of the U.S. Constitution is the idea of &quot;checks and balances&quot; among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. For example, while Congress, the federal government&#x27;s legislative branch, has the power to create laws, the executive branch under the president can veto legislation, an act which, in turn, can be overridden by Congress. The president nominates judges to the nation&#x27;s highest judiciary authority, the Supreme Court (as well as to lower federal courts), but those nominees must be approved by Congress. The Supreme Court, in turn, can invalidate unconstitutional laws passed by the Congress.

==Legislative branch== 
The United States Congress, under Article I of the Constitution, is the legislative branch of the federal government. It is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate.

=== Makeup of Congress ===
==== House of Representatives ====

The U.S. House of Representatives is made up of 435 voting members, each of whom represents a congressional district in a state from where they were elected. Apportionment of seats among the 50 states is determined by state populations, and it is updated after each decennial U.S. Census. Each member serves a two-year term. 

In order to be elected as a representative, an individual must be at least 25 years of age, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and must live in the state that they represent. 

In addition to the 435 voting members, there are six non-voting members, consisting of five delegates and one resident commissioner. There is one delegate each from Washington, D.C., Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and a resident commissioner from Puerto Rico.

Unlike the U.S. Senate, all members of the U.S. House must be elected and cannot be appointed. In the case of a vacancy, the seat must be filled through a special election, as required under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.

==== Senate ====
In contrast, the Senate is made up of two senators from each state, regardless of population. There are currently 100 senators (2 from each of the 50 states), who each serve six-year terms. Approximately one-third of the Senate stands for election every two years.

If a vacancy occurs, the state governor appoints a replacement to complete the term or to hold the office until a special election can take place.

==== Separate powers ====
The House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers. For example, the Senate must approve (give &quot;advice and consent&quot; to) many important presidential appointments, including cabinet officers, federal judges (including nominees to the Supreme Court), department secretaries (heads of federal executive branch departments), U.S. military and naval officers, and ambassadors to foreign countries. All legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The approval of both chambers is required to pass all legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the president (or, if the president vetoes the bill, both houses of Congress then re-pass the bill, but by a two-thirds majority of each chamber, in which case the bill becomes law without the president&#x27;s signature). The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people. 

The Constitution also includes the Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants Congress the power to &quot;make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers&quot;. Members of the House and Senate are elected by first-past-the-post voting in every state except Louisiana and Georgia, which have runoffs, and Maine and Alaska, which use ranked-choice voting.

==== Impeachment of federal officers ====

Congress has the power to remove the president, federal judges, and other federal officers from office. The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process. The House must first vote to impeach the official. Then, a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office. , three presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump (twice). None of the three were removed from office following trial in the Senate.

==== Congressional procedures ====
Article I, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives each chamber the power to &quot;determine the rules of its proceedings&quot;. From this provision were created congressional committees, which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters. The 118th Congress (2023–2025) has 20 standing committees in the House and 19 in the Senate, plus 4 joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress, printing, taxation, and the economy. In addition, each house may name special, or select, committees to study specific problems. Today, much of the congressional workload is borne by the subcommittees, of which there are around 150.

=== Powers of Congress ===
The Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress. Enumerated in Article I, Section 8, these include the powers to levy and collect taxes; to coin money and regulate its value; provide for punishment for counterfeiting; establish post offices and roads, issue patents, create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, combat piracies and felonies, declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces, provide for, arm and discipline the militia, exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia, regulate interstate commerce, and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers. Over the two centuries since the United States was formed, many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government. These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court.

==== Congressional oversight ====

Congressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud, protect civil liberties and individual rights, ensure executive compliance with the law, gather information for making laws and educating the public, and evaluate executive performance.

It applies to cabinet departments, executive agencies, regulatory commissions, and the presidency.

Congress&#x27;s oversight function takes many forms:
* Committee inquiries and hearings
* Formal consultations with and reports from the president
* Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties
* House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials
* House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment if the president becomes disabled or if the office of the vice president falls vacant
* Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials
* Congressional membership: each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in the House of Representatives. Each state is allocated two senators regardless of its population. , the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

==Executive branch== 
=== President ===
 
====Executive powers and duties====
The executive branch is established in Article Two of the United States Constitution, which vests executive power in the president of the United States. The president is both the head of state (performing ceremonial functions) and the head of government (the chief executive). The Constitution directs the president to &quot;take care that the laws be faithfully executed&quot; and requires the president to swear or affirm to &quot;preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.&quot; Legal scholars William P. Marshall and Saikrishna B. Prakash write of the Clause: &quot;the President may neither breach federal law nor order their subordinates to do so, for defiance cannot be considered faithful execution. The Constitution also incorporates the English bars on dispensing or suspending the law, with some supposing that the Clause itself prohibits both.&quot; Many presidential actions are undertaken via executive orders, presidential proclamations, and presidential memoranda.

The president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Under the Reception Clause, the president is empowered to &quot;receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers&quot;; the president has broad authority to conduct foreign relations, is generally considered to have the sole power of diplomatic recognition, and is the United States&#x27; chief diplomat, although the Congress also has an important role in legislating on foreign affairs, and can, for example, &quot;institute a trade embargo, declare war upon a foreign government that the President had recognized, or decline to appropriate funds for an embassy in that country.&quot; The president may also negotiate and sign treaties, but ratifying treaties requires the consent of two-thirds of the Senate.

Article II&#x27;s Appointments Clause provides that the president &quot;shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States&quot; while providing that &quot;Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.&quot; These appointments delegate &quot;by legal authority a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal government.&quot;

The Constitution grants the president the &quot;Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment&quot;; this clemency power includes the power to issue absolute or conditional pardons, and to issue commute sentences, to remit fines, and to issue general amnesties. The presidential clemency power extends only to federal crimes, and not to state crimes. 

The president has informal powers beyond their formal powers. For example, the president has major agenda-setting powers to influence lawmaking and policymaking, and typically has a major role as the leader of their political party.

====Election, succession, and term limits====

The president and vice president are normally elected as running mates by the Electoral College; each state has a number of electoral votes equal to the size of its Congressional delegation (&quot;i.e.&quot;, its number of Representatives in the House plus its two senators). The District of Columbia has a number of electoral votes &quot;equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State&quot;. A President may also be seated by succession. As originally drafted, there was no limit to the time a President could serve, however the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, originally limits any president to serving two four-year terms (8 years); the amendment specifically &quot;caps the service of a president at 10 years&quot; by providing that &quot;if a person succeeds to the office of president without election and serves less than two years, he may run for two full terms; otherwise, a person succeeding to office of president can serve no more than a single elected term.&quot;

====Veto power, impeachment, and other issues====

Under the Presentment Clause of Article I, a bill that passes both chambers of Congress shall be presented to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto the bill by returning it to the chamber where it originated. If the president neither signs nor vetoes a bill &quot;within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him&quot; it becomes a law without the president&#x27;s signature, &quot;unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return in which Case it shall not be a Law&quot; (called a pocket veto). A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress; this occurs relatively infrequently.

The president may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;. 

The president may not dissolve Congress, but has the power to adjourn Congress whenever the House and Senate cannot agree when to adjourn; no president has ever used this power. The president also has the constitutional power to, &quot;on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them&quot;; this power has been used &quot;to consider nominations, war, and emergency legislation.&quot; This Section invests the President with the discretion to convene Congress on &quot;extraordinary occasions&quot;; this special session power that has been used to call the chambers to consider urgent matters.

=== Vice president ===
The vice president is the second-highest official in rank of the federal government. The vice president&#x27;s duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1, Section 3, Clauses 4 and 5 as the president of the Senate; this means that they are the designated presiding officer of the Senate. In that capacity, the vice president has the authority (&quot;ex officio&quot;, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession, the vice president&#x27;s duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president, which has happened nine times in U.S. history. Lastly, in the case of a Twenty-fifth Amendment succession event, the vice president would become acting president, assuming all of the powers and duties of president, except being designated as president. Accordingly, by circumstances, the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch, or succeeding to the executive branch as president, or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Because of circumstances, the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office, the title of the office and other matters, such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president.

=== Cabinet, executive departments, and agencies ===

Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution sets forth the creation of a presidential Cabinet. The role of the Cabinet is to advise the president and carry out the programs and laws of the federal government. The Cabinet is composed of the vice president and the leaders of 15 executive departments. Those executive departments are the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security. 

Additionally, there are seven other members of the Cabinet who are appointed by the president. These are the White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management &amp; Budget, United States Trade Representative, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Administrator of the Small Business Administration.

The heads of the 15 departments are chosen by the president and approved with the &quot;advice and consent&quot; of the U.S. Senate. Once confirmed, these &quot;Cabinet secretaries&quot; serve at the pleasure of the president. 

In addition to the executive departments, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President (EOP), which was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The EOP is overseen by the White House Chief of Staff. The EOP includes the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Outside of the EOP and the executive departments are a number of independent agencies. These include the United States Postal Service (USPS), NASA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.

== Judicial branch ==


The Judiciary, under Article III of the Constitution, explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases.

=== Overview of the federal judiciary ===

Article III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise. Section I also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office. Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district. The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94 district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction. Congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court.

The U.S. Supreme Court decides cases and controversies, which include matters pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and interpretation of the United States Constitution, and, in general, can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional, nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions. The United States Constitution does not specifically mention the power of judicial review, which is the power to declare a law unconstitutional. There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches. Below the U.S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals, and below them in turn are the United States District Courts, which are the general trial courts for federal law, and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state, known as diversity jurisdiction.

There are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction, which are courts that handle both criminal and civil suits between individuals. Other courts, such as the bankruptcy courts and the U.S. Tax Court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases, known as subject matter jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Courts are supervised by the district courts, and, as such, are not considered part of the Article III judiciary. As such, their judges do not have lifetime tenure, nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration. The Tax Court is an Article I Court, not an Article III Court.

The district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code) consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of federal question jurisdiction, diversity jurisdiction, and pendent jurisdiction can be filed and decided. The district courts can also hear cases under removal jurisdiction, wherein a case brought in a state court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, and one party litigant chooses to &quot;remove&quot; the case from state court to federal court.

The United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct appeals from administrative agencies, and some interlocutory appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts, and in addition has original jurisdiction over a few cases.

The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an Act of Congress; a U.S. treaty; cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U.S.; cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party; controversies between states (or their citizens) and foreign nations (or their citizens or subjects); and bankruptcy cases (collectively &quot;federal-question jurisdiction&quot;). The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant. It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant.

The power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal law. The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts. Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law, and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts. Both court systems have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others.

The U.S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office &quot;during good behavior&quot;; in practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or resign. A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government. U.S. judges are appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any present Article III judge. However, Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges who take office after such a pay reduction is passed by Congress.

=== Relationships between state and federal courts ===
Separate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court system are the court systems of each state, each dealing with, in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted, a state&#x27;s own laws, and having its own court rules and procedures. Although state governments and the federal government are legally &quot;dual sovereigns&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts (e.g., absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the &quot;doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds&quot;). The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state&#x27;s laws and Constitution. Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U.S. Constitution, but are considered &quot;parallel&quot; (thus, where, for example, the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy, and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be &quot;independent&quot;, the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court—the U.S. Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction).

A State Supreme Court, other than of its own accord, is bound &quot;only&quot; by the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of federal law, but is &quot;not&quot; bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included, or even the federal district courts located in the state, a result of the &quot;dual sovereigns&quot; concept. Conversely, a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law (usually through diversity jurisdiction) must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, a result of the application of the &quot;Erie Doctrine&quot;; however, at the same time, the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules (that is, the application of the &quot;Erie Doctrine&quot; only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply &quot;substantive&quot; state law, but not &quot;procedural&quot; state law, which may be different). Together, the laws of the federal and state governments form U.S. law.

== Budget ==

The budget document often begins with the president&#x27;s proposal to Congress recommending funding levels for the next fiscal year, beginning October 1 and ending on September 30 of the year following. The fiscal year refers to the year in which it ends.

For fiscal year (FY) 2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion. Spending equaled 20.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), equal to the 50-year average. The deficit equaled $779 billion, 3.8 percent of GDP. Tax revenue amounted to $3.33 trillion, with receipt categories including individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%).

== Employees ==

The United States federal government had about 2,260,000 civilian employees in FY2023, with about 160,000 of those in the District of Columbia (not counting the United States Postal Service).

== Elections and voting ==
Suffrage, known as the ability to vote, has changed significantly over time. In the early years of the United States, voting was considered a matter for state governments, and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land. Direct elections were mostly held only for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures, although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state. Under this original system, both senators representing each state in the U.S. Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected. Today, U.S. citizens have almost universal suffrage under equal protection of the laws from the age of 18, regardless of race, gender, or wealth. The only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons, and in some states former felons as well.

Under the U.S. Constitution, the representation of U.S. territories and the federal district of District of Columbia in Congress is limited: while residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes, their only congressional representative is a non-voting delegate; however, they have participated in presidential elections since March 29, 1961. 

Residents of Puerto Rico other than federal employees do not pay federal personal income taxes on income that has its source in Puerto Rico, and do not pay most federal excise taxes (for example, the federal gasoline tax); however, Puerto Ricans pay all other federal taxes, including the federal payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare; the FUTA tax; and business, gift, and estate taxes. Puerto Rico is represented in the Congress by a nonvoting Resident Commissioner, a nonvoting delegate.

== State, tribal, and local governments ==
State governments have the greatest influence over most Americans&#x27; daily lives. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the Constitution; as a result, states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction. Because state governments are not authorized to print currency, they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds. As a result, state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering.

Each state has its own written constitution, government and code of laws. The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have, &quot;a Republican Government&quot;. Therefore, there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states, concerning issues such as property, crime, health and education, amongst others. The highest elected official of each state is the Governor, with below him being the Lieutenant Governor. Each state also has an elected state legislature (bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska), whose members represent the voters of the state. Each state maintains its own state court system. In some states, supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people; in others, they are appointed, as they are in the federal system.

As a result of the Supreme Court case &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;, American Indian tribes are considered &quot;domestic dependent nations&quot; that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but, in some cases, outside of the jurisdiction of state governments. Hundreds of laws, executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis-à-vis individual states, but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies. Tribal governments vary in robustness, from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs, to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government. Tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments, with power resting in elected tribal councils, elected tribal chairpersons, or religiously appointed leaders (as is the case with pueblos). Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent, but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish.

The institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically counties, municipalities, and special-purpose districts, which make laws that affect their particular area. These laws concern issues such as traffic, the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals. A county is an administrative or political subdivision of a state, while Louisiana and Alaska have county-equivalent subdivisions called parishes and boroughs, respectively. The specific governmental powers of counties vary widely between the states, with those in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and some parts of Alaska and Massachusetts having little or no power, existing only as geographic distinctions. In other areas, county governments have more power, such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies. Twenty states further divide their counties into civil townships. Population centers may be organized into incorporated municipalities of several types, including the city, town, borough, and village. These municipal entities also vary from state to state, and typically subordinate to the government of a county or civil township. However, many rural and suburban regions are in unincorporated areas that have no municipal government below the county or civil township level. Certain cities have consolidated with their county government to form consolidated city-counties, or have been legally separated from counties altogether to form independent cities. States may also create special-purpose districts that perform a single function or a set of related functions within an area inside one or more counties or municipalities, like school districts, water management districts, fire management districts, and library districts.

<text>Adolfo Pérez Esquivel (born 26 November 1931) is an Argentine activist, community organizer, painter, writer and sculptor. He was the recipient of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to Argentina&#x27;s last civil-military dictatorship (1976–1983), during which he was detained, tortured, and held without trial for 14 months. He also received, among other distinctions, the Pacem in Terris Award.

== Early life ==
Pérez Esquivel was born in Buenos Aires on 26 November 1931 to a Spanish fisherman from Poio, Galicia, who emigrated to Argentina. His mother died when he was three, and despite his poverty, he attended the Manuel Belgrano School of Fine Arts and the National University of La Plata, where he was trained as a painter and sculptor. He was appointed professor of architecture and worked with a variety of sculptural media, and for 25 years taught in all levels from primary to university. Pérez Esquivel began working with popularly based Latin American Christian pacifist groups during the 1960s. He relinquished his teaching post in 1974, when he was chosen as coordinator general for a network of Latin America-based communities promoting liberation of the poor through non-violence.

==Plight for human rights==
When systematic repression followed the March 1976 coup, which brought the dictatorship of General Jorge Videla to power, Pérez Esquivel contributed to the formation and financing of the linkages between popularly based organizations to defend human rights in Argentina and support the families of the victims of the Dirty War. The NGO &quot;Servicio Paz y Justicia&quot; (&quot;Service, Peace and Justice Foundation&quot;, or SERPAJ), which he co-founded in 1974, and served as an instrument for the defense of human rights by promoting an international campaign to denounce the atrocities committed by the military regime. SERPAJ is a member of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR), which supported Esquivel&#x27;s work from the beginning.

Pérez Esquivel was detained by the Brazilian Military Police in 1975. He was jailed in 1976 in Ecuador, along with Latin American and North American bishops. He was detained in Buenos Aires in 1977 by the Argentine Federal Police, tortured, and held without trial for 14 months; during that, he received, among other distinctions, the Pope John XXIII Peace Memorial.

===Distinctions===
Nominated by 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureates Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams, Pérez Esquivel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on 10 December 1980, for his efforts in the defense of human rights. Accepting the prize &quot;in the name of the poorest and smallest of my brothers and sisters,&quot; he donated the prize money to charity. He remained active in support of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo despite ongoing harassment by the dictatorship, and later joined causes in support of the indigenous peoples of Argentina and environmentalism and against austerity policies and the Free Trade Area of the Americas.

Pérez Esquivel was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award in 1999.

Pérez Esquivel served as president of the Honorary Council of Service, Latin American Peace and Justice Foundation and of the International League for Human Rights and Liberation of Peoples (based in Milan), and as a member of the Permanent Peoples&#x27; Tribunal. He published &quot;Caminando Junto al Pueblo&quot; (&quot;Walking Together with the People&quot;, 1995), in which he relates his experiences with nonviolence in Latin America, and he was appointed Professor of Peace and Human Rights Studies at the University of Buenos Aires in 1998. He campaigned during 2010 against the practice on the part of the Esquel Police Department of training children into paramilitary squads, an operation that he compared to the creation of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Hitler Youth.

==Recent years==
Pérez Esquivel is a permanent lecturer at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Social Sciences, where he directs the seminar &quot;Culture for Peace and Human Rights&quot;.

He opposed the European intervention in the 2011 Libyan Civil War and warned against an intervention in the Syrian Civil War. In the aftermath of the death of Osama bin Laden, he sent a letter to President Barack Obama suggesting the United States killed rather than tried bin Laden because he could have revealed unsettling information about 9/11. He argued, &quot;You know that there are people who have investigated the tragic events of 9/11/2001 and claim there is evidence that this was a self-coup (self-inflicted attack).&quot; Later, he added, &quot;this event was the perfect excuse to launch a war against Afghanistan and Iraq and now against Libya,&quot; and referred to the United States an &quot;axis of evil.&quot;

Pérez Esquivel expressed himself regarding the 2013 election of Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Bergoglio as Pope Francis, stating that as Provincial superior of Jesuits &quot;he had lacked the sufficient courage shown by other Bishops to support our cause for human rights during the dictatorship.&quot; Pérez Esquivel also said that &quot;Bergoglio did what he could given his age at that time.&quot; He, however, clarified that the future Pope &quot;was no accomplice and had no links with the dictatorship&quot; and that while &quot;it is said he did not do enough to get two priests out of jail, I know personally that many bishops called on the military junta for the release of prisoners and priests and that these requests were not granted.&quot;

In June 2017, he defended the government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, saying that the country was undergoing a coup d&#x27;état attempt, orchestrated by the United States.

He was hospitalized in January 2022 following a stroke.

==Works of art==

Esquivel&#x27;s work ranges from exhibitions to murals and monuments, including the 15 station Latin American Via Crucis (including a Lenten cloth &quot;A new sky and a new land&quot;) made in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the conquest of America; Monument to Refugees, located in the Headquarters of the UNHCR in Switzerland; the Latin American Peoples Mural in the Cathedral of Riobamba, Ecuador, dedicated to Monsignor Proaño and the indigenous peoples; and a bronze statue in tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Gandhi Square, in Barcelona.

<text>Domingo Felipe Cavallo (born July 21, 1946) is an Argentine economist and politician. Between 1991 and 1996, he was the Minister of Economy during Carlos Menem&#x27;s presidency. He is known for implementing the convertibility plan, which established a pseudo-currency board with the United States dollar and allowed the dollar to be used for legal contracts. This brought the inflation rate down from over 1,300% in 1990 to less than 20% in 1992 and nearly to zero during the rest of the 1990s. He implemented pro-market reforms which included privatizations of state enterprises. Productivity per hour worked during his five-years as minister of Menem increased by more than 100%. In 2001, he was the economy minister for nine months during the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. During a bank run, he implemented a restriction on cash withdrawing, known as &quot;corralito&quot;. This was followed by the December 2001 riots in Argentina and the fall of Fernando de la Rúa as president.

Cavallo is a Doctor in Economic Sciences from the National University of Córdoba and obtained his PhD in Economics from Harvard University. He received five Honoris Causa doctorates from Genoa, Turin, Bologna, Ben-Gurion and Paris Pantheon-Sorbonne universities. He was professor at the National and Catholic Universities of Córdoba, and at New York, Harvard, and Yale universities.

==Early years==
Cavallo was born in San Francisco, Córdoba Province to Florencia and Felipe Cavallo, Italian Argentine immigrants from the Piedmont Region. He graduated with honors in Accounting (1967) and Economics (1968) at the National University of Córdoba, where he earned his doctorate in economics in 1970. He married the former Sonia Abrazián in 1968, and had three children. He would later enroll at Harvard University, where he earned a second doctorate in Economics in 1977.

Cavallo taught at the National University of Córdoba (1969–84), the Catholic University of Córdoba (1970–74), and New York University (1996–97). He wrote a number of books and was publisher of Forbes in 1998–99.

==Central Bank==
In July 1982, after the Falklands War fiasco brought more moderate leadership to the military dictatorship, Cavallo was appointed president of the Central Bank. He inherited the country&#x27;s most acute financial and economic crisis since 1930, and a particularly heinous Central Bank regulation painfully remembered as the Central Bank &quot;Circular 1050&quot;.

Implemented in 1980 at the behest of conservative Minister of Economy, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, policy tied adjustable loan installments (nearly all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable interest basis) to the value of the US dollar locally. Exchange rates were controlled at the time and therefore raised little concern. The next February, however, the peso was sharply devalued and continued to plummet for the rest of 1981 and into 1982. Mortgage and business borrowers saw their monthly installments increase over tenfold in just a year and many, including homeowners just months away from paying off their loans, unable to keep up, either lost their entire equity or everything outright.

Cavallo immediately rescinded the hated &quot;Circular 1050&quot; and as a result, saved millions of homeowners and small-business owners from financial ruin (as well as millions more, indirectly). What followed, however, remained the subject of great controversy.

Though nothing new to the economic history of Argentina, he is often accused of implementing financial policies that may have allowed Argentina&#x27;s main private enterprises to transfer their debts to the state, transforming their private debt into public obligations. During 1982 and 1983, more than 200 firms (30 economic groups and 106 transnational enterprises) transferred a great part of their 17 billion dollar debt to the federal government, thanks to secured exchange rates on loan installments. This fraud took place both before and after his very brief turn at the Central Bank, but not while he was in charge. In a speech in September 1982 he was forced renounce and express his opposition to the transfer of debt to the state. He inherited this practice from Martínez de Hoz himself (whose chief interest, steelmaker Acindar, had unloaded US$700 million of its debts in this way). Moreover, Cavallo subjected payments covered by these exchange rate guarantees to indexation; this latter stipulation was dropped by his successor, Julio González del Solar.

==Beginnings in politics==
His involvement in politics began when he was elected as a student representative to the highest government body of the Economics School (1965–1966). He acted as Undersecretary of Development of the provincial government (1969–1970), director (1971–1972) and vice chairman of the board (1972–1973) of the Provincial Bank and Undersecretary of Interior of the national government.

This controversy notwithstanding, upon Argentina&#x27;s return to democracy in December 1983, he became a close economic advisor to Peronist politician José Manuel de la Sota and was elected as a Peronist deputy for Córdoba Province in the 1987 mid-term polls.

Drawing from his &quot;Fundación Mediterránea&quot; think-tank, he prepared an academic team for taking over the management of the economy, and to that end he participated actively in Carlos Menem&#x27;s bid for the presidency in 1989. President Alfonsín&#x27;s efforts to control hyperinflation (which reached 200% a month in July 1989) failed, and led to food riots and Alfonsín&#x27;s resignation.

==Minister of Foreign relations==
As Foreign Minister, in 1989 he met with British Foreign Secretary John Major, this being the first such meeting since the end of the Falklands War seven years earlier.

As Menem initially chose to deliver the Economy Ministry to senior executives of the firm Bunge y Born, Cavallo had to wait a few more years to put his economic theories into practice. He served as Menem&#x27;s foreign minister, and was instrumental in the realignment of Argentina with the Washington Consensus advanced by U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Finally, after several false starts, and two further peaks of hyperinflation, Menem put Cavallo at the helm of the Argentine Economy Ministry in February, 1991.

==Minister of Economy at the Menem administration==

In May 1989, amid the worst economic crisis in the country&#x27;s history, Carlos Menem was elected President of Argentina.

Hyperinflation forced him to abandon peronist orthodoxy in favour of a fiscally conservative, market-oriented economic policy.

Domingo Cavallo was appointed in 1991, and deepened the liberalization of the economy. He liberalized trade (by removing export taxes and reducing import duties, removing non-tariff barriers to imports, and removing restrictions on foreign investment).

He reformed the State and recreated a market economy based on a reduction in public spending and the fiscal deficit (through the privatization of state companies; the elimination of price controls, wage controls and currency controls; and the elimination of trade subsidies).

He reformed the tax policy to simplify taxes and reduce non-social government spending, and reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to achieve the path towards adherence to a Brady Plan a plan about the debt restructuring.

These reforms were a success: the capital flights ended, interest rates were lowered, inflation fell to single digits, and economic activity increased; in that year alone, the gross domestic product grew at a rate of 10,5%.

He was the ideologist behind the Convertibility Plan, which created a currency board that fixed the dollar-peso exchange rate at 1 peso per US dollar; he signed his plan into law on April 1, 1991. Cavallo thus succeeded in defeating inflation, which had averaged over 220% (1975–1988), had leapt to 5000% (1989) and remained at 1300% (1990).
President Menem had already privatized the state telecom concern and national airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, &quot;Aerolíneas Argentinas&quot;, which was later almost run into the ground). The stability Cavallo&#x27;s plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than ever. Going on to total over 200 state enterprises, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000 km (6000 mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking a page from the Chile pension system privatization, the mandatory National Pension System was opened to choice through the authorization of private pension schemes.

GDP, long stuck at its 1973 level even with a growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. Fixed investment, depressed since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period.

Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo&#x27;s insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994.

The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s). Confidence and the economy recovered relatively quickly; but, the consequences of double-digit unemployment soon created a crime wave that to some extent continues to this day. Unemployment and poverty eased only very slowly after the return to growth in early 1996.

==Independent==
In mid-1995, Cavallo denounced the existence of presumed &quot;mafias&quot; entrenched within the circles of power. After his first public accusations, relations between Cavallo, President Menem and his colleagues became progressively strained.

In 1996, shortly after Menem&#x27;s reelection, the flux of money from privatisation ceased, and Cavallo was ousted from the cabinet, due to his volatile personality and fights with other cabinet members, coupled with staggering unemployment and social unrest caused by his economic policies and the Mexican crisis. Following months of speculation, Menem asked for his resignation on July 26, 1996.

Cavallo founded a political party, &quot;Action for the Republic&quot;, which allowed him to return to Congress since 1997, this time as a National Deputy for the City of Buenos Aires.

Cavallo ran for president in 1999, but was defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. Cavallo came in third place and received 11% of the vote, far behind both de la Rúa and the other main candidate, Peronist Eduardo Duhalde.

He also ran for Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2000, got second place and lost to Aníbal Ibarra.

==Minister of Economy with de la Rúa and during the crisis==
Cavallo was called by President de la Rúa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, in the face of a weakened coalition government and two years of recession.

He attempted to restore business confidence by renegotiating the external debt with the International Monetary Fund and with bondholders, but the growing country risk and spiraling put options by large investors and foreign holdings led to a bank run and a massive capital flight. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the &quot;corralito&quot; (&quot;financial corral&quot;). The anger of those Argentines with the means to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class protest termed the &quot;cacerolazo&quot;.

Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the December 2001 riots. This critical situation finally forced Cavallo, and then de la Rúa, to resign.

A series of Peronist presidents came and left in the next few days, until Eduardo Duhalde, the opponent of De la Rua and Cavallo in the 1999 presidential election, took power on January 2, 2002. Soon afterwards the government decreed the end of peso-dollar convertibility, devalued the peso and soon afterwards let it float, which led to a swift depreciation (the exchange rate briefly reached 4 pesos per dollar in July 2002) and inflation (about 40% in 2002).

Cavallo&#x27;s policies are viewed by opponents as major causes of the deindustrialization and the rise of unemployment, poverty and crime endured by Argentina in the late 1990s, as well as the collapse of 2001, the ensuing default of the Argentine public debt.

==After the crisis==
Between April and June 2002, Cavallo was jailed for alleged participation in illegal weapons sales during the Menem administration. He was exonerated of all charges related to this scandal in 2005.

Cavallo served as the Robert Kennedy Visiting Professor in Latin American Studies in the department of economics at Harvard University from 2003 to 2004.

He has also continued to serve as a member of the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty.

As of January 2012, Cavallo is a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University as well as a visiting lecturer at Yale&#x27;s economics department.

Cavallo returned to Córdoba Province in 2013 to run for Chamber of Deputies under the &quot;Es Posible&quot; ticket, led by center-right Peronist Alberto Rodríguez Saá. Winning only 1.28% of the provincial vote, Cavallo failed to reach the required 1.5% threshold in the primaries elections, and was disqualified from the running for the general election in what the local press described as &quot;an emphatic defeat.&quot;

== Criminal sentence ==
On December 1, 2015, Cavallo, ex president Carlos Saul Menem, and ex justice minister Raúl Granillo Ocampo, were found guilty of embezzlement by the court Tribunal Oral Federal 4.

<doc id="195156" wikidata="Q732316" url="?curid=195156" title="Marco Antonio Barrera">
<text>Marco Antonio Barrera Tapia (born January 17, 1974) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1989 to 2011. He held multiple world championships in three weight classes between 1995 and 2007, from super bantamweight to super featherweight.

After a brief retirement after losing twice to Junior Jones, Barrera revived his career with a trilogy against Erik Morales and a win against Naseem Hamed, earning him the &quot;Ring&quot; magazine featherweight title. He lost this title in his first fight against Manny Pacquiao. BoxRec currently Barrera 55th in its list of the greatest boxers of all time, pound for pound, while ESPN ranked Barrera as 43rd on their list of the 50 greatest boxers of all time. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Amateur career==
As an amateur, Barrera had a record of 104–4 and was a five-time Mexican national champion.
Before losing his first amateur contest, Barrera had an undefeated record of 56–0.

==Professional career==

===Super flyweight===
Barrera made his professional debut at 15 when he defeated David Felix by a knockout in round two on November 22, 1989. The victory marked the beginning of a 43 fight win streak.

In 1990, Barrera had seven fights, including his first rise in quality opposition, when he defeated veteran Iván Salazar, by a decision in eight rounds. In 1991, he had seven more fights, defeating boxers Abel Hinojosa, Javier Díaz and others.

Barrera began 1992 by winning his first professional title, defeating Justino Suárez by a decision in twelve rounds to win the Mexican super flyweight championship. He retained the title three times before the end of the year which helped improved his ranking in the super flyweight division. He defeated Abner Barajas by a decision in ten rounds, and Angel Rosario by a knockout in six rounds.

In 1993, Barrera had six bouts, winning each. He defeated Salazar in a rematch and retained his title against Noe Santillana and among others.

By 1994, Barrera was attending University to become a lawyer and also continued his boxing career. On April 13, he defeated future champion Carlos Salazar by a ten-round decision in Argentina. He also defeated former world champion Eddie Cook before the end of the year.

===Super bantamweight===

====First world title====
Barrera began 1995 by fighting for a world title. On March 31, he became the WBO super bantamweight champion by defeating Puerto Rican boxer Daniel Cobrita Jiménez by a decision in twelve rounds at Anaheim, California. By this time, many boxing journalist were calling Barrera &quot;Mexico&#x27;s next Julio César Chávez.&quot;

He made four defenses before the year was over. On June 2, 1995, he defeated future champion Frank Toledo via second round knock out. Barrera knocked Toledo down twice before the fight was stopped.

On July 15, 1995, Barrera scored a first-round knockout win over Maui Díaz (27–1). In his next bout, he won a twelve-round unanimous decision over future champion Agapito Sánchez.

On February 6, 1996, he fought on the first installment of HBO Boxing&#x27;s spin-off series &quot;HBO Boxing After Dark.&quot; In one of the fights of the year, Barrera stopped Kennedy McKinney in 12 rounds, knocking him down five times whilst suffering one knockdown himself.

After the McKinney fight, he defeated former WBO champion Jesse Benavides by third-round knockout. On July 14, 1996, he defeated another former champion, Orlando Fernandez, by seventh-round TKO.

==== Defeat by Junior Jones====
On November 22, 1996, he suffered his first career loss and lost his title to American boxer Junior Jones, by a disqualification in round five. Barrera was knocked down in Round 5 by Jones, and was declared the loser by disqualification and not by knockout because Barrera&#x27;s cornerman climbed onto the ring to stop the fight as Jones was finishing Barrera.

On April 18, 1997, he was given a chance to regain his title, facing Jones in a rematch in Las Vegas. Barrera was defeated by a unanimous decision that fans thought was controversial, but retired from boxing nonetheless regardless of the opinions of his die-hard fans.

==== Comeback trail ====
Barrera announced a comeback in 1998, a year later, and he started off by defeating Angel Rosario by a knockout in round five. After two more wins, he was given another opportunity to fight for a world title by the WBO. On October 31, he became a two-time world super bantamweight champion by defeating Richie Wenton by a knockout in three rounds, winning the WBO&#x27;s vacant title.

In 1999, he had two title defenses and then he ran into controversy. On December 18, he defeated César Najera in four rounds at California. But upon finding out that Najera had a losing record and was part of Barrera&#x27;s team, the California State Athletic Commission decided to rule the fight a no contest bout.

====Barrera vs. Morales I====

In February 2000, Barrera was defeated by the WBC super bantamweight title holder Erik Morales by a controversial 12 round split decision. It was an intense battle in which both fighters were cut and battered. &quot;The Ring&quot; named it the fight of the year.

After the bout, the WBO reinstated Barrera as their champion and he defended the title three additional times. On June 17, 2000, he defeated Luiz Freitas (19–1–0) by first-round knockout. In his next bout, he defeated José Luis Valbuena (18–1–1) by twelve round unanimous decision. On December 1, 2000, he scored a sixth-round knockout over former world champion Jesús Salud.

=== Featherweight ===

==== Barrera vs. Hamed ====

In 2001, Barrera moved up in weight division. On April 7, he handed British boxer Naseem Hamed his first and only loss for the lineal featherweight championship by a twelve-round decision. Before the fight, Hamed was a 3 to 1 betting favorite in Las Vegas. Hamed could not hit Barrera with his trademark lefts as Barrera circled to his left and worked both head and body. Barrera was not a fan of Hamed&#x27;s antics and responded to Hamed&#x27;s punches during clinches. On one occasion early in the fight, Hamed grabbed Barrera and they both fell to the ground where Barrera threw a right jab, leading to a warning from referee Joe Cortez. In the 12th and final round Barrera trapped Hamed in a full nelson and forced his head into the turnbuckle, resulting in a point deducted by referee Joe Cortez. Ultimately, Barrera threw more, harder punches and more impressive combinations than Hamed throughout the course of the fight. Barrera was awarded the victory via a unanimous decision, with the scorecards reading 115–112, 115–112, 116–111 and won the lineal and IBO featherweight titles. On September 8, 2001, he defeated former champion Enrique Sánchez by sixth-round TKO.

==== Barrera vs. Morales II ====
On June 22, 2002, Barrera defeated Morales in a rematch via a unanimous decision, successfully defending his lineal title and winning the vacant &quot;Ring&quot; magazine title but declined Morales&#x27; the WBC belt. On November 2, he defeated former five-time world champion Johnny Tapia by a 12-round unanimous decision. Barrera then competed in his 60th career fight on 12 April 2003, defeating former WBC title holder Kevin Kelley by knockout in round four.

==== Barrera vs. Pacquiao I ====
On November 16, 2003, Barrera was defeated by Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao in the eleventh round when Barerra&#x27;s corner threw in the towel, earning Pacquiao his third world championship in third weight division (Barrera was the recognized lineal champion and his &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; title was also on the line when he fought Pacquiao).

On June 19, 2004, Barrera defeated former WBA bantamweight title holder Paulie Ayala in Los Angeles by a tenth-round knockout.

===Super featherweight===

====Barrera vs. Morales III====
On November 27, 2004, Barrera fought Morales for the third time and became a three-division world champion by defeating Morales in a majority decision to capture the WBC super featherweight title.

On April 9, 2005, Barrera retained the title with a second-round knockout against future champion Mzonke Fana in El Paso, Texas, this win also marked Barrera&#x27;s 60th career win.

On September 17 of the same year, he unified his WBC super featherweight title with the IBF title by defeating the IBF title holder Robbie Peden by a twelve-round unanimous decision in Las Vegas.

==== Barrera vs. Juárez ====
On May 20, 2006, Barrera defended his title against American boxer Rocky Juárez with what was announced immediately after the fight as a twelve-round draw, which the judges scored 115–113, 113–115 and 114–114. However, tabulation errors were found in the judges&#x27; scorecards, leading to a final score of 115–114, 114–115 and 115–114, a split decision in favor of Barerra. He fought Juárez in a rematch bout on September 16, this time Barrera won by a unanimous decision with scores of (117–111, 115–113, 115–113).

==== Barrera vs. Márquez ====
On March 17, 2007, Barrera lost his WBC super featherweight title to fellow Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Márquez by unanimous decision. Even without counting a knockdown of Marquez that was ruled a slip by referee Jay Nady in the 7th round, Harold Lederman of HBO had the fight in favor of Barrera. Barrera claimed that the judges and referee were wrong.

==== Barrera vs. Pacquiao II ====

Barrera fought Pacquiao in a rematch bout for the WBC International super featherweight title on October 6, 2007, in Las Vegas. Barrera was defeated by a unanimous decision with scores of 118–109, 118–109, 115–112. After the match, Barrera expressed his desire to retire from boxing, however no official confirmation had been given. On February 13, 2008, Barrera announced to the media that he would fight the winner of the Márquez vs. Pacquiao bout on March 15. The winner of this turned out to be Pacquiao, in a split decision. However, Pacquiao&#x27;s move to the lightweight division and subsequent capture of the WBC lightweight title ensured that a third fight between the two would not happen.

=== Lightweight ===
Marco Antonio Barrera, at 35, ended his brief retirement and signed a five-year contract on August 26, 2008, with promoter Don King. He moved up to the lightweight division, his goal to become the first Mexican ever to win a title in 4 different weight divisions.

On November 7, 2008, Barrera marked his return to the ring, in Chengdu, China, by knocking out Sammy Ventura in his first bout in the lightweight division.

==== Barrera vs. Khan ====
It was announced on January 15, 2009, that Barrera would return to the ring against British boxer Amir Khan. Even with Barrera getting on in years, this was seen to be the biggest test of the young Briton&#x27;s career thus far. Frank Warren promoted the fight, which took place on March 14, 2009, at the MEN Arena.

Barrera lost the bout by a fifth-round technical decision. In the first round, the two fighters clashed heads, resulting in a deep gash above Barrera&#x27;s forehead, which bled throughout the bout. Ringside doctors stopped the fight at the beginning of the fifth round due to the severity of the cut. The judges scored the fight 50–45, 50–45 and 50–44 for Khan at the point of stoppage and he was declared the winner by technical decision. However, there was some controversy over the time of the stoppage, as Barrera had sustained the cut during the first round and that it would be constantly examined before the referee officially stopped the fight in the fifth round.

On March 26, 2009, as a result of the controversial stoppage timing, Barrera&#x27;s promoter, Don King, filed a protest with the British Boxing Board of Control, WBA and WBO on behalf of Barrera, claiming the accidental clash of heads should have resulted in the fight being ruled a no-contest. Under the rules governing the bout, had the fight been stopped prior to the end of the fourth round due to the accidental headbutt, the official ruling would have been no contest, requiring an immediate rematch. Referee Dave Parris, however, waited until midway through the fourth round before asking the ringside physician to inspect the wound.

Before this fight, Barrera had fought Freudis Rojas on January 31, 2009, in Zapopan, Jalisco. Rojas was disqualified for a headbutt which left Barrera with a bad cut over his left eye. The cut could have jeopardized Barrera&#x27;s scheduled bout against Khan. Despite this injury, he recovered in time for his bout with Khan and the fight went ahead regardless.

==== Comeback ====
After the loss, Barrera took a period of inactivity. The former three time world champion fought on June 26, 2010, against Adailton de Jesus of Brazil. The 10 round bout took place at the Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas, United States. The match was an undercard of the &quot;Latin Fury 15&quot; event, which featured Julio César Chávez Jr. vs. John Duddy. Barrera dominated De Jesus for 10 rounds, winning via decision. On February 12, 2011, he fought Jose Arias of the Dominican Republic and scored a TKO in the second round; this was to be Barrera&#x27;s final fight.

==Outside boxing==
Barrera&#x27;s fights were promoted by Oscar De La Hoya under the organization of Golden Boy Promotions. He trained at De La Hoya&#x27;s training facility in Big Bear, California.

Since January 2009, Barrera has been a commentator for ESPN Deportes&#x27; weekly boxing show &quot;Golpe a Golpe&quot; (&quot;Blow by Blow&quot;) which airs live on Friday nights on the network. Barrera&#x27;s co-host is SportsCenter anchor Jorge Eduardo Sanchez. &quot;Golpe a Golpe&quot; is the lead-in show to ESPN Deportes&#x27; popular &quot;Viernes de Combates&quot; (&quot;Friday Night Fights&quot;) boxing series and is the first ESPN Deportes show dedicated solely to boxing.

<text>Dame Enid Diana Elizabeth Rigg (20 July 1938 – 10 September 2020) was an English actress of stage and screen. Her roles include Emma Peel in the TV series &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1965–1968); Countess Teresa di Vicenzo, wife of James Bond, in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969); Olenna Tyrell in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2013–2017); and the title role in &quot;Medea&quot; in the West End in 1993 followed by Broadway a year later. 
Rigg made her professional stage debut in 1957 in &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1959. She made her Broadway debut in &quot;Abelard &amp; Heloise&quot; in 1971. Her role as Emma Peel made her a sex symbol. For her role in &quot;Medea&quot;, both in London and New York, she won the 1994 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and became a four-time Laurence Olivier Award nominee. She was appointed CBE in 1988 and a Dame in 1994 for services to drama.

Rigg appeared in numerous TV series and films, playing Helena in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1968); Lady Holiday in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981); and Arlena Marshall in &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1982). She won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for the BBC miniseries &quot;Mother Love&quot; (1989) and an Emmy Award for her role as Mrs Danvers in &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1997). Her other television credits include &quot;You, Me and the Apocalypse&quot; (2015), &quot;Detectorists&quot; (2015), the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Crimson Horror&quot; (2013) with her daughter, Rachael Stirling, and playing Mrs Pumphrey in &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (2020). Her final role was in Edgar Wright&#x27;s 2021 psychological horror film &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot;, completed just before her death.

==Early life and education==
Enid Diana Elizabeth Rigg was born on 20 July 1938 in Doncaster, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (now in South Yorkshire), to Louis and Beryl Hilda Rigg (née Helliwell). She had a brother four years her senior. Her father was born in Yorkshire, worked in engineering, and moved to India to work for the railway to take advantage of the career opportunities there. Her mother moved back to England for Rigg&#x27;s birth. Between the ages of two months and eight years Rigg lived in Bikaner, Rajasthan, India, where her father worked his way up to become a railway executive in the Bikaner State Railway. She spoke Hindi as her second language in those years.

She was later sent back to England to attend a boarding school, Fulneck Girls School, in a Moravian settlement near Pudsey. Rigg hated her boarding school, where she felt like a fish out of water, but believed that Yorkshire played a greater part in shaping her character than India did. She trained as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art from 1955 to 1957, where her classmates included Glenda Jackson and Siân Phillips.

==Theatre career==
Rigg&#x27;s career in film, television and the theatre was wide-ranging, including roles in the Royal Shakespeare Company between 1959 and 1967, including Gwendolen in Jean Anouilh&#x27;s Becket, Cordelia in King Lear and Adriana in The Comedy of Errors.(). Her professional debut was as Natasha Abashwilli in the RADA production of &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; at the York Festival in 1957.

She returned to the stage in the Ronald Millar play &quot;Abelard and Heloïse&quot; in London in 1970 and made her Broadway debut with the play in 1971, in which she appeared nude with Keith Michell. She earned the first of three Tony Award nominations for Best Actress in a Play. She received her second nomination in 1975, for &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. A member of the National Theatre Company at The Old Vic from 1972 to 1975, Rigg took leading roles in premiere productions of two Tom Stoppard plays, Dorothy Moore in &quot;Jumpers&quot; (National Theatre, 1972) and Ruth Carson in &quot;Night and Day&quot; (Phoenix Theatre, 1978).

In 1982 she appeared in the musical &quot;Colette&quot;, based on the life of the French writer and created by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt, but it closed during an American tour en route to Broadway. In 1987 she took a leading role in the West End production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Follies&quot;. In the 1990s she had triumphs with roles at the Almeida Theatre in Islington, including &quot;Medea&quot; in 1992 (which transferred to the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 1993 and then Broadway in 1994, for which she received the Tony Award for Best Actress), &quot;Mother Courage&quot; at the National Theatre in 1995 and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Almeida Theatre in 1996 (which transferred to the Aldwych Theatre in October 1996).

In 2004 she appeared as Violet Venable in Sheffield Theatre&#x27;s production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s play &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot;, which transferred to the Albery Theatre. In 2006 she appeared at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End in a drama entitled &quot;Honour&quot;, which had a limited but successful run. In 2007 she appeared as Huma Rojo in The Old Vic&#x27;s production of &quot;All About My Mother&quot;, adapted by Samuel Adamson and based on the film of the same title directed by Pedro Almodóvar.

She appeared in 2008 in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre, returning there in 2009 to star in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;. In 2011, she played Mrs Higgins in &quot;Pygmalion&quot; at the Garrick Theatre, opposite Rupert Everett and Kara Tointon, having played Eliza Doolittle 37 years earlier at the Albery Theatre.

In February 2018, she returned to Broadway in the non-singing role of Mrs Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. She commented, &quot;I think it&#x27;s so special. When I was offered Mrs Higgins, I thought it was just such a lovely idea.&quot; She received her fourth Tony nomination for the role.

==Film and television career==
From 1965 to 1968 Rigg appeared in the British 1960s television series &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1961–69) opposite Patrick Macnee as John Steed, playing the secret agent Emma Peel in 51 episodes. She replaced Elizabeth Shepherd at very short notice when Shepherd was dropped from the role after filming two episodes. Rigg auditioned for the role on a whim, without ever having seen the programme. Although she was hugely successful in the series, she disliked the lack of privacy that it brought and was not comfortable in her position as a sex symbol. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019, Rigg stated that &quot;becoming a sex symbol overnight had shocked (her)&quot;. Neither did she like the way that she was treated by production company ABC Weekend TV. For her second series she held out for a pay rise from £150 a week to £450; she said in 2019 – when gender pay inequality was very much in the news – that &quot;not one woman in the industry supported me... Neither did Patrick [Macnee, her co-star]... I was painted as this mercenary creature by the press when all I wanted was equality. It&#x27;s so depressing that we are still talking about the gender pay gap.&quot; She did not stay for a third year. Patrick Macnee noted that Rigg had later told him that she considered Macnee and her driver to be her only friends on the set.

On the big screen she became a Bond girl in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), playing Tracy Bond, James Bond&#x27;s only wife, opposite George Lazenby. She said she took the role with the hope that she would become better known in the United States. In 1973–74, she starred in a short-lived US sitcom called &quot;Diana&quot;.
Her other films from this period include &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; (1969), &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1970), &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1971), &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973), &quot;In This House of Brede&quot; (1975), based on the book by Rumer Godden, and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (1977). She appeared as the title character in &quot;The Marquise&quot; (1980), a television adaptation of a play by Noël Coward. She appeared in the Yorkshire Television production of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1981) as Hedda, and as Lady Holiday in the film &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (also 1981). The following year she received acclaim for her performance as Arlena Marshall in the film adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot;, sharing barbs with her character&#x27;s old rival, played by Maggie Smith.

She appeared as Regan, the king&#x27;s treacherous second daughter, in a Granada Television production of &quot;King Lear&quot; (1983), which starred Laurence Olivier in the title role. As Lady Dedlock she costarred with Denholm Elliott in a television version of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot; (BBC, 1985). In 1986 she played Miss Hardbroom in a Central Television adaptation of &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;, starring opposite Tim Curry. The following year, she played the Evil Queen, Snow White&#x27;s evil stepmother, in the Cannon Movie Tales film adaptation of &quot;Snow White&quot; (1987). In 1989, she played Helena Vesey in &quot;Mother Love&quot; for the BBC; her portrayal of an obsessive mother who was prepared to do anything, even murder, to keep control of her son won Rigg the 1990 BAFTA for Best Television Actress. In 1995, she appeared in a film adaptation for television based on Danielle Steel&#x27;s &quot;Zoya&quot; as Evgenia, the main character&#x27;s grandmother. She appeared on television as Mrs Danvers in &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1997), winning an Emmy, as well as the PBS production &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, and as the amateur detective Mrs Bradley in &quot;The Mrs Bradley Mysteries&quot;. In this BBC series, first aired in 2000, she played Gladys Mitchell&#x27;s detective, Dame Beatrice Adela Le Strange Bradley, an eccentric old woman who worked for Scotland Yard as a pathologist. The series was not a critical success and did not return for a second season.

From 1989 until 2003 she hosted the PBS television series &quot;Mystery!&quot;, shown in the United States by PBS broadcaster WGBH, taking over from Vincent Price, her co-star in &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;.

She also appeared in the second series of Ricky Gervais&#x27;s comedy &quot;Extras&quot;, alongside &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Daniel Radcliffe and in the 2006 film &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;, in which she played a nun.

In 2013 she appeared in an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in a Victorian era–based story called The Crimson Horror alongside her daughter, Rachael Stirling, Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Coleman. The episode had been specially written for her and her daughter by Mark Gatiss and aired as part of series 7. It was not the first time mother and daughter had appeared in the same production – that was in the 2000 NBC film &quot;In the Beginning&quot; – but the first time she had worked direct with her daughter and the first time in her career her roots were accessed to find a Doncaster, Yorkshire, accent.

That same year Rigg was cast in a recurring role in the third season of the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, portraying Lady Olenna Tyrell, a witty and sarcastic political mastermind popularly known as the Queen of Thorns, the paternal grandmother of regular character Margaery Tyrell. Her performance was well received by critics and audiences alike, and earned her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2013. She reprised her role in season four of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, and in July 2014 received another Guest Actress Emmy nomination. In 2015 and 2016, she again reprised the role in seasons five and six in an expanded role from the books. In 2015 and 2018, she received two additional Guest Actress Emmy nominations. The character was killed off in the seventh season, with Rigg&#x27;s final performance receiving wide critical acclaim. In April 2019 Rigg said she had never watched &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, before or after her time on the show.

During autumn 2019 Rigg was filming the role of Mrs Pumphrey at Broughton Hall, near Skipton, for &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. Rigg died after the filming of the first season had been completed. Her final performance was in the British psychological horror film &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot;, in which she had a major supporting role. The film was in post-production at the time of her death and is dedicated to her memory.

==Personal life==

In the 1960s, Rigg lived for eight years with director Philip Saville, gaining attention in the tabloid press when she disclaimed interest in marrying the older and already-married Saville, saying that she had no desire &quot;to be respectable&quot;. She was married to Menachem Gueffen, an Israeli painter, from 1973 until their divorce in 1976. 

Rigg had a daughter, actress Rachael Stirling (born 1977), with Archie Stirling, a theatrical producer and former officer in the Scots Guards, and son of Bill Stirling. They married five years later in 25 March 1982, but divorced in 1990 after Archie&#x27;s affair with the actress Joely Richardson. 

Rigg was a patron of International Care &amp; Relief and was for many years the public face of the charity&#x27;s child-sponsorship scheme. She was also chancellor of the University of Stirling, a ceremonial rather than executive role, and was succeeded by James Naughtie when her 10-year term of office ended on 31 July 2008.

Michael Parkinson, who first interviewed Rigg in 1972, described her as the most desirable woman he had ever met and who &quot;radiated a lustrous beauty&quot;. A smoker from the age of 18, Rigg was still smoking 20 cigarettes (one pack) a day in 2009. By December 2017 she had stopped smoking after serious illness led to heart surgery, a cardiac ablation, two months earlier. She joked later, &quot;My heart had stopped ticking during the procedure, so I was up there and the good Lord must have said, &#x27;Send the old bag down again, I&#x27;m not having her yet!&#x27;&quot;

In a June 2015 interview with the website &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Rigg talked about her chemistry with Patrick Macnee on &quot;The Avengers&quot; despite their 16-year age difference: &quot;I sort of vaguely knew Patrick Macnee, and he looked kindly on me and sort of husbanded me through the first couple of episodes. After that, we became equal, and loved each other professionally and sparked off each other. And we&#x27;d then improvise, write our own lines. They trusted us. Particularly our scenes when we were finding a dead body—I mean, another dead body. How do you get round that one? They allowed us to do it.&quot; Asked if she had stayed in touch with Macnee (the interview was published two days before Macnee&#x27;s death and decades after they were reunited on her short-lived American series &quot;Diana&quot;): &quot;You&#x27;ll always be close to somebody that you worked with very intimately for so long, and you become really fond of each other. But we haven&#x27;t seen each other for a very, very long time.&quot;

Rigg was a Christian.

==Death==
Rigg died at her daughter Rachael Stirling&#x27;s home in London on 10 September 2020, at the age of 82. Rigg&#x27;s cause of death was lung cancer, with which she had been diagnosed in March that year.

==Honours==
In 1999, Rigg was appointed as the Cameron Mackintosh Visiting professor of Contemporary Theatre at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford; she held the post for one year.

In 2014, Rigg received the Will Award, presented by the Shakespeare Theatre Company, along with Stacy Keach and John Hurt.

On 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the British Film Institute screened an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;; this was followed by an onstage interview with Rigg about her time in the television series.
