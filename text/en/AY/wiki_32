<text>The Congo Free State, also known as the Independent State of the Congo (), was a large state and absolute monarchy in Central Africa from 1885 to 1908. It was privately owned by King Leopold II, the constitutional monarch of the Kingdom of Belgium. In legal terms, the two separate countries were in a personal union. The Congo Free State was not a part of, nor did it belong to Belgium. Leopold was able to seize the region by convincing other European states at the Berlin Conference on Africa that he was involved in humanitarian and philanthropic work and would not tax trade. Via the International Association of the Congo, he was able to lay claim to most of the Congo Basin. On 29 May 1885, after the closure of the Berlin Conference, the king announced that he planned to name his possessions &quot;the Congo Free State&quot;, an appellation which was not yet used at the Berlin Conference and which officially replaced &quot;International Association of the Congo&quot; on 1 August 1885. The Free State was privately controlled by Leopold from Brussels; he never visited it.

The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo and existed from 1885 to 1908, when the Belgian Parliament reluctantly annexed the state as a colony belonging to Belgium after international pressure.

Leopold&#x27;s reign in the Congo eventually earned infamy on account of the atrocities perpetrated on the locals. Ostensibly, the Congo Free State aimed to bring civilization to the local people and to develop the region economically. In reality, Leopold II&#x27;s administration extracted ivory, rubber, and minerals from the upper Congo basin for sale on the world market through a series of international concessionary companies that brought little benefit to the area. Under Leopold&#x27;s administration, the Free State became one of the greatest international scandals of the early 20th century. The Casement Report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903.

The loss of life and atrocities inspired literature such as Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and raised an international outcry. Debate has been ongoing about the high death rate in this period. The highest estimates state that the widespread use of forced labour, torture, and murder led to the deaths of 50 per cent of the population in the rubber provinces. The lack of accurate records makes it difficult to quantify the number of deaths caused by the exploitation and the lack of immunity to new diseases introduced by contact with European colonists. During the Congo Free State propaganda war, European and US reformers exposed atrocities in the Congo Free State to the public through the Congo Reform Association, founded by Casement and the journalist, author, and politician E. D. Morel. Also active in exposing the activities of the Congo Free State was the author Arthur Conan Doyle, whose book &quot;The Crime of the Congo&quot; was widely read in the early 1900s.

By 1908, public pressure and diplomatic manoeuvres led to the end of Leopold II&#x27;s absolutist rule; the Belgian Parliament annexed the Congo Free State as a colony of Belgium. It became known thereafter as the Belgian Congo. In addition, a number of major Belgian investment companies pushed the Belgian government to take over the Congo and develop the mining sector as it was virtually untapped.

==Background==

===Early European exploration===
Diogo Cão travelled around the mouth of the Congo River in 1482, leading Portugal to claim the region. Until the middle of the 19th century, the Congo was at the heart of independent Africa, as European colonialists seldom entered the interior. Along with fierce local resistance, the rainforest, swamps, malaria, sleeping sickness, and other diseases made it a difficult environment for Europeans to settle. Western states were at first reluctant to colonize the area in the absence of obvious economic benefits.
===Stanley&#x27;s exploration===
In 1876 Leopold II of Belgium hosted the Brussels Geographic Conference, inviting famous explorers, philanthropists, and members of geographic societies to stir up interest in a &quot;humanitarian&quot; endeavour for Europeans in central Africa to &quot;improve&quot; and &quot;civilize&quot; the lives of the indigenous peoples. At the conference, Leopold organized the International African Association with the cooperation of European and American explorers and the support of several European governments, and was himself elected chairman. Leopold used the association to promote plans to seize independent central Africa under this philanthropic guise.

Henry Morton Stanley, famous for making contact with British missionary David Livingstone in Africa in 1871, explored the region in 1876–1877, a journey that was described in Stanley&#x27;s 1878 book &quot;Through the Dark Continent&quot;. Failing to enlist British interest in the Congo region, Stanley took up service with Leopold II, who hired him to help gain a foothold in the region and annex the region for himself.

From August 1879 to June 1884 Stanley was in the Congo basin, where he built a road from the lower Congo up to Stanley Pool and launched steamers on the upper river. While exploring the Congo for Leopold, Stanley set up treaties with the local chiefs and with native leaders. In essence, the documents gave over all rights of their respective pieces of land to Leopold. With Stanley&#x27;s help, Leopold was able to claim a great area along the Congo River, and military posts were established.

Christian de Bonchamps, a French explorer who served Leopold in Katanga, expressed attitudes towards such treaties shared by many Europeans, saying, &quot;The treaties with these little African tyrants, which generally consist of four long pages of which they do not understand a word, and to which they sign a cross in order to have peace and to receive gifts, are really only serious matters for the European powers, in the event of disputes over the territories. They do not concern the black sovereign who signs them for a moment.&quot;
===King Leopold&#x27;s campaign===
Leopold began to create a plan to convince other European powers of the legitimacy of his claim to the region, all the while maintaining the guise that his work was for the benefit of the native peoples under the name of a philanthropic &quot;association&quot;.

The king launched a publicity campaign in Britain to distract critics, drawing attention to Portugal&#x27;s record of slavery, and offering to drive slave traders from the Congo basin. He also secretly told British merchant houses that if he was given formal control of the Congo for this and other humanitarian purposes, he would then give them the same most favoured nation (MFN) status Portugal had offered them. At the same time, Leopold promised Bismarck he would not give any one nation special status, and that German traders would be as welcome as any other.

Leopold then offered France the support of the association for French ownership of the entire northern bank of the Congo, and sweetened the deal by proposing that, if his personal wealth proved insufficient to hold the entire Congo, as seemed utterly inevitable, that it should revert to France. On 23 April 1884, the International Association&#x27;s claim on the southern Congo basin was formally recognized by France on condition that the French got the first option to buy the territory if the Association decided to sell. This may also have helped Leopold to gain recognition for his claim by the other major powers, who thus wanted him to succeed instead of selling his claims to France.

He also enlisted the aid of the United States, sending President Chester A. Arthur carefully edited copies of the cloth-and-trinket treaties that Stanley (a Welsh-American) claimed to have negotiated with various local authorities, and proposing that, as an entirely disinterested humanitarian body, the Association would administer the Congo for the good of all, handing over power to the natives as soon as they were ready for that responsibility.

Leopold wanted to have the United States support his plans for the Congo in order to gain support from the European nations. He had help from American businessman Henry Shelton Sanford, who had recruited Stanley for Leopold. Henry Sanford swayed President Arthur by inviting him to stay as his guest at Sanford House hotel on Lake Monroe while he was in Belgium. On 29 November 1883, during his meeting with the President, as Leopold&#x27;s envoy, he convinced the President that Leopold&#x27;s agenda was similar to the United States&#x27; involvement in Liberia. This satisfied Southern politicians and businessmen, especially Alabama Senator John Tyler Morgan. Morgan saw Congo as the same opportunity to send freedmen to Africa so they could contribute to and build the cotton market. Sanford also convinced the people in New York that they were going to abolish slavery and aid travellers and scientists in order to have the public&#x27;s support. After Henry&#x27;s actions in convincing President Arthur, the United States was the first country to recognize Congo as a legitimate sovereign state. The United States further participated in the process of recognition by sending the &quot;US Navy Congo River Expedition of 1885&quot;, which gave a detailed description of travel along the river.

===Lobbying and claiming the region===
Leopold was able to attract scientific and humanitarian backing for the International African Association (, or AIA), which he formed during a Brussels Geographic Conference of geographic societies, explorers, and dignitaries he hosted in 1876. At the conference, Leopold proposed establishing an international benevolent committee for the propagation of civilization among the peoples of central Africa (the Congo region). The AIA was originally conceived as a multi-national, scientific, and humanitarian assembly, and even invited Gustave Moynier as member of the International Law Institute and president of the International Committee of the Red Cross to attend their 1877 conference. The International Law Institute was supportive of the project under the belief that it was aimed to abolish the Congo Basin slave trade. Nevertheless, the AIA eventually became a development company controlled by Leopold.

After 1879 and the crumbling of the International African Association, Leopold&#x27;s work was done under the auspices of the &quot;Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo&quot; (). The committee, supposedly an international commercial, scientific, and humanitarian group, was in fact made of a group of businessmen who had shares in the Congo, with Leopold holding a large block by proxy. The committee itself eventually disintegrated (but Leopold continued to refer to it and use the defunct organization as a smokescreen for his operations in laying claim to the Congo region).
Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa, Leopold began patronizing a number of leading explorers, including Henry Morton Stanley. Leopold established the International African Association, a charitable organization to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the Congo River, with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilization to the natives. In the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, European leaders officially noted Leopold&#x27;s control over the of the notionally independent Congo Free State.

To give his African operations a name that could serve for a political entity, Leopold created, between 1879 and 1882, the International Association of the Congo (, or AIC) as a new umbrella organization. This organization sought to combine the numerous small territories acquired into one sovereign state and asked for recognition from the European powers. On 22 April 1884, thanks to the successful lobbying of businessman Henry Shelton Sanford at Leopold&#x27;s request, President Chester A. Arthur of the United States decided that the cessions claimed by Leopold from the local leaders were lawful and recognized the International Association of the Congo&#x27;s claim on the region, becoming the first country to do so. In 1884, the US Secretary of State said, &quot;The Government of the United States announces its sympathy with and approval of the humane and benevolent purposes of the International Association of the Congo.&quot;

===Berlin Conference===

In November 1884, Otto von Bismarck convened a 14-nation conference to submit the Congo question to international control and to finalize the colonial partitioning of the African continent. Most major powers (including Austria-Hungary, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and the United States) attended the Berlin Conference, and drafted an international code governing the way that European countries should behave as they acquired African territory. The conference officially recognized the International Congo Association, and specified that it should have no connection with Belgium (beyond a personal union), or any other country, but would be under the personal control of King Leopold.

It drew specific boundaries and specified that all nations should have access to do business in the Congo with no tariffs. The slave trade would be suppressed. In 1885, Leopold emerged triumphant. France was given on the north bank (the modern Congo-Brazzaville and Central African Republic), Portugal to the south (modern Angola), and Leopold&#x27;s personal organization received the balance: , with about 30 million people. However, it still remained for these territories to be occupied under the conference&#x27;s &quot;Principle of Effective Occupation&quot;.

===International recognition===
Following the United States&#x27; recognition of Leopold&#x27;s colony, other Western powers deliberated on the news. Portugal flirted with the French at first, but the British offered to support Portugal&#x27;s claim to the entire Congo in return for a free trade agreement and to spite their French rivals. Britain was uneasy at French expansion and had a technical claim on the Congo via Lieutenant Cameron&#x27;s 1873 expedition from Zanzibar to bring home Livingstone&#x27;s body, but was reluctant to take on yet another expensive, unproductive colony. Bismarck of Germany had vast new holdings in southwest Africa, and had no plans for the Congo, but was happy to see rivals Britain and France excluded from the colony.

In 1885, Leopold&#x27;s efforts to establish Belgian influence in the Congo Basin were awarded with the &quot;État Indépendant du Congo&quot; (CFS, Congo Free State). By a resolution passed in the Belgian Parliament, Leopold became &quot;roi souverain&quot;, sovereign king, of the newly formed CFS, over which he enjoyed nearly absolute control. The CFS (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo), a country of over two million square kilometres, became Leopold&#x27;s personal property, the &quot;Domaine Privé&quot;. Eventually, the Congo Free State was recognized as a neutral independent sovereignty by various European and North American states.

==Government==

Leopold used the title &#x27;Sovereign of the Congo Free State&#x27; as ruler of the Congo Free State. He appointed the heads of the three departments of state: interior, foreign affairs and finances. Each was headed by an administrator-general (&quot;administrateur-général&quot;), later a secretary-general (&quot;secrétaire-général&quot;), who was obligated to enact the policies of the sovereign or else resign. Below the secretaries-general were a series of bureaucrats of decreasing rank: directors general (&quot;directeurs généraux&quot;), directors (&quot;directeurs&quot;), &quot;chefs de divisions&quot; (division chiefs) and &quot;chefs de bureaux&quot; (bureau chiefs). The departments were headquartered in Brussels.

Finance was in charge of accounting for income and expenditure and tracking the public debt. Besides diplomacy, foreign affairs was in charge of shipping, education, religion and commerce. The department of the interior was responsible for defence, police, public health and public works. It was also charged with overseeing the exploitation of the Congo&#x27;s natural resources and plantations. In 1904, the secretary-general of the interior set up a propaganda office, the &quot;Bureau central de la presse&quot; (&quot;Central Press Bureau&quot;), in Frankfurt under the auspices of the &quot;Comité pour la représentation des intérêts coloniaux en Afrique&quot; (in German, &quot;Komitee zur Wahrung der kolonialen Interessen in Afrika&quot;, &quot;Committee for the Representation of Colonial Interests in Africa&quot;).

The oversight of all the departments was nominally in the hands of the Governor-General (&quot;Gouverneur général&quot;), but this office was at times more honorary than real. When the governor-general was in Belgium he was represented in the Congo by a vice governor-general (&quot;vice-gouverneur général&quot;), who was nominally equal in rank to a secretary-general but in fact was beneath them in power and influence. A &quot;Comité consultatif&quot; (consultative committee) made up of civil servants was set up in 1887 to assist the governor-general, but he was not obliged to consult it. The vice governor-general on the ground had a state secretary through whom he communicated with his district officers.

The Free State had an independent judiciary headed by a minister of justice at Boma. The minister was equal in rank to the vice governor-general and initially answered to the governor-general, but was eventually made responsible to the sovereign alone. There was a supreme court composed of three judges, which heard appeals, and below it a high court of one judge. These sat at Boma. In addition to these, there were district courts and public prosecutors (&quot;procureurs d&#x27;état&quot;). Justice, however, was slow and the system ill-suited to a frontier society.

==Leopold&#x27;s rule==

Leopold no longer needed the façade of the &quot;association&quot;, and replaced it with an appointed cabinet of Belgians who would do his bidding. To the temporary new capital of Boma, he sent a governor-general and a chief of police. The vast Congo Basin was split up into 14 administrative districts, each district into zones, each zone into sectors, and each sector into posts. From the district commissioners down to post level, every appointed head was European. However, with little financial means the Free State mainly relied on local elites to rule and tax the vast and hard-to-reach Congolese interior.

In the Free State, Leopold exercised total personal control without much delegation to subordinates. African chiefs played an important role in the administration by implementing government orders within their communities. Throughout much of its existence, however, Free State presence in the territory that it claimed was patchy, with its few officials concentrated in a number of small and widely dispersed &quot;stations&quot; which controlled only small amounts of hinterland. In 1900, there were just 3,000 Europeans in the Congo, of whom only half were Belgian. The colony was perpetually short of administrative staff and officials, who numbered between 700 and 1,500 during the period.

Leopold pledged to suppress the east African slave trade; promote humanitarian policies; guarantee free trade within the colony; impose no import duties for twenty years; and encourage philanthropic and scientific enterprises. Beginning in the mid-1880s, Leopold first decreed that the state asserted rights of proprietorship over all vacant lands throughout the Congo territory. In three successive decrees, Leopold promised the rights of the Congolese in their land to native villages and farms, essentially making nearly all of the CFS &quot;terres domaniales&quot; (state-owned land). Leopold further decreed that merchants should limit their commercial operations in rubber trade with the natives. Additionally, the colonial administration liberated thousands of slaves.

Four main problems presented themselves over the next few years.
# Leopold II ran up huge debts to finance his colonial endeavour and risked losing his colony to Belgium.
# Much of the Free State was unmapped jungle, which offered little fiscal and commercial return.
# Cecil Rhodes, Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (part of modern South Africa), was expanding his British South Africa Company&#x27;s charter lands from the south and threatened to occupy Katanga (southern Congo) by exploiting the &quot;Principle of Effectivity&quot; loophole in the Berlin Treaty. In this he was supported by Harry Johnston, the British Commissioner for Central Africa, who was London&#x27;s representative in the region.
# The Congolese interior was ruled by Arab Zanzibari slavers and sultans, powerful kings and warlords who had to be coerced or defeated by use of force. For example, the slaving gangs of Zanzibar trader Tippu Tip had a strong presence in the eastern part of the territory in the modern-day Maniema, Tanganyika and Ituri regions. They were linked to the Swahili coast via Uganda and Tanzania and had established independent slave states.

===Early economics and concessions===

Leopold could not meet the costs of running the Congo Free State. Desperately, he set in motion a system to maximize revenue. The first change was the introduction of the concept of &quot;terres vacantes&quot;, &quot;vacant&quot; land, which was any land that did not contain a habitation or a cultivated garden plot. All of this land (i.e., most of the country) was therefore deemed to belong to the state. Servants of the state (namely any men in Leopold&#x27;s employ) were encouraged to exploit it.

Shortly after the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference (1889–1890), Leopold issued a new decree mandating that Africans in a large part of the Free State could sell their harvested products (mostly ivory and rubber) only to the state. This law extended an earlier decree declaring that all &quot;unoccupied&quot; land belonged to the state. Any ivory or rubber collected from the state-owned land, the reasoning went, must belong to the state, thus creating a de facto state-controlled monopoly. Therefore, a large share of the local population could sell only to the state, which could set prices and thereby control the income the Congolese could receive for their work. For local elites, however, this system presented new opportunities, as the Free State and concession companies paid them with guns to tax their subjects in kind.

Trading companies began to lose out to the Free State government, which not only paid no taxes but also collected all the potential income. These companies were outraged by the restrictions on free trade, which the Berlin Act had so carefully protected years before. Their protests against the violation of free trade prompted Leopold to take another, less obvious tack to make money.
A decree in 1892 divided the &quot;terres vacantes&quot; into a domainal system that privatized extraction rights over rubber for the state in certain private domains, allowing Leopold to grant vast concessions to private companies. In other areas, private companies could continue to trade but were highly restricted and taxed. The domainal system enforced an in-kind tax on the Free State&#x27;s Congolese subjects. As essential intermediaries, local rulers forced their men, women and children to collect rubber, ivory and foodstuffs. Depending on the power of local rulers, the Free State paid prices below the rising market prices. In October 1892, Leopold granted concessions to a number of companies. Each company was given a large amount of land in the Congo Free State on which to collect rubber and ivory for sale in Europe. These companies were allowed to detain Africans who did not work hard enough, to police their vast areas as they saw fit and to take all the products of the forest for themselves. In return for their concessions, these companies paid an annual dividend to the Free State. At the height of the rubber boom, from 1901 until 1906, these dividends also filled the royal coffers.

The Free Trade Zone in the Congo was open to entrepreneurs of any European nation, who were allowed to buy 10- and 15-year monopoly leases on anything of value: ivory from a district or the rubber concession, for example. The other zone—almost two-thirds of the Congo—became the &quot;Domaine Privé&quot;, the exclusive private property of the state.

In 1893, Leopold excised the most readily accessible portion of the Free Trade Zone and declared it to be the &quot;Domaine de la Couronne&quot;, literally, &quot;fief of the crown&quot;. Rubber revenue went directly to Leopold who paid the Free State for the high costs of exploitation. The same rules applied as in the &quot;Domaine Privé&quot;. In 1896 global demand for rubber soared. From that year onwards, the Congolese rubber sector started to generate vast sums of money at an immense cost for the local population.

===Scramble for Katanga===
Early in Leopold&#x27;s rule, the second problem—the British South Africa Company&#x27;s expansion into the southern Congo Basin—was addressed. The distant Yeke Kingdom, in Katanga on the upper Lualaba River, had signed no treaties, was known to be rich in copper and thought to have much gold from its slave-trading activities. Its powerful &quot;mwami&quot; (King), Msiri, had already rejected a treaty brought by Alfred Sharpe on behalf of Cecil Rhodes. In 1891 a Free State expedition extracted a letter from Msiri agreeing to their agents coming to Katanga and later that year Leopold II sent the well-armed Stairs Expedition, led by the Canadian mercenary William Grant Stairs, to take possession of Katanga one way or another.

Msiri tried to play the Free State off against Rhodes and when negotiations bogged down, Stairs flew the Free State flag anyway and gave Msiri an ultimatum. Instead, Msiri decamped to another stockade. Stairs sent a force to capture him but Msiri stood his ground, whereupon Captain Omer Bodson shot Msiri dead and was fatally wounded in the resulting fight. The expedition cut off Msiri&#x27;s head and put it on a pole, as he had often done to his enemies. This was to impress upon the locals that Msiri&#x27;s rule had really ended, after which the successor chief recognized by Stairs signed the treaty.

===War with Arab slavers===

In the short term, the third problem, that of the African and Arab slavers like Zanzibari/Swahili strongman Tippu Tip (actually Ḥamad ibn Muḥammad ibn Jumʿah ibn Rajab ibn Muḥammad ibn Saʿīd al Murjabī, but much better known by his nickname) was temporarily solved.

Initially the authority of the Congo Free State was relatively weak in the eastern regions of the Congo. In early 1887, Henry Morton Stanley had therefore proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor (wali) of the Stanley Falls District. Both Leopold II and Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar agreed and on 24 February 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.

In the longer term this alliance was indefensible at home and abroad. Leopold II was heavily criticized by the European public opinion for his dealings with Tippu Tip. In Belgium, the Belgian Anti-Slavery Society was founded in 1888, mainly by Catholic intellectuals led by Count Hippolyte d&#x27;Ursel, aimed at abolishing the Arab slave trade. Furthermore, Tippu Tip and Leopold were commercial rivals. Every person that Tippu Tip hunted down and put into chattel slavery and every pound of ivory he exported to Zanzibar was a loss to Leopold II. This, and Leopold&#x27;s humanitarian pledges to the Berlin Conference to end slavery, meant war was inevitable.

Open warfare broke out in late November 1892. Both sides fought by proxy, arming and leading the populations of the upper Congo forests in conflict. By early 1894 the Zanzibari/Swahili slavers were defeated in the eastern Congo region and the Congo Arab war came to an end.

The Belgians freed thousands of men, women and children slaves from Swaihili Arab slave owners and slave traders in Eastern Congo in 1886-1892, enlisted them in the militia &quot;Force Publique&quot; or turned them over as prisoners to allied local chiefs, who in turn gave them as laborers for the Belgian conscript workers; when Belgian Congo was established, chattel slavery was legally abolished in 1910, but prisoners were nevertheless conscripted as force laborers for both public and private work projects.

=== The Lado Enclave ===

In 1894, King Leopold II signed a treaty with the United Kingdom which conceded a strip of land on the Free State&#x27;s eastern border in exchange for the Lado Enclave, which provided access to the navigable Nile and extended the Free State&#x27;s sphere of influence northward into Sudan. After rubber profits soared in 1895, Leopold ordered the organization of an expedition into the Lado Enclave, which had been overrun by Mahdist rebels since the outbreak of the Mahdist War in 1881. The expedition was composed of two columns: the first, under Belgian war hero Baron Dhanis, consisted of a sizeable force, numbering around three-thousand, and was to strike north through the jungle and attack the rebels at their base at Rejaf. The second, a much smaller force of only eight-hundred, was led by Louis-Napoléon Chaltin and took the main road towards Rejaf. Both expeditions set out in December 1896.

Although Leopold II had initially planned for the expedition to carry on much farther than the Lado Enclave, hoping indeed to take Fashoda and then Khartoum, Dhanis&#x27; column mutinied in February 1897, resulting in the death of several Belgian officers and the loss of his entire force. Nonetheless, Chaltin continued his advance, and on 17 February 1897, his outnumbered forces defeated the rebels in the Battle of Rejaf, securing the Lado Enclave as a Belgian territory until Leopold&#x27;s death in 1909. Leopold&#x27;s conquest of the Lado Enclave met with approval from the British government, at least initially, which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with Mahdist Sudan. But frequent raids outside of Lado territory by Belgian Congolese forces based in Rejaf caused alarm and suspicion among British and French officials wary of Leopold&#x27;s imperial ambitions. In 1910, following the Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State as the Belgian Congo in 1908 and the death of the Belgian King in December 1909, British authorities reclaimed the Lado Enclave as per the Anglo-Congolese treaty signed in 1894, and added the territory to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

==Economy during Leopold&#x27;s rule==
While the war against African powers was ending, the quest for income was increasing, fuelled by the aire policy. By 1890, Leopold was facing considerable financial difficulty. District officials&#x27; salaries were reduced to a bare minimum, and made up with a commission payment based on the profit that their area returned to Leopold. After widespread criticism, this &quot;primes system&quot; was substituted for the &quot;allocation de retraite&quot; in which a large part of the payment was granted, at the end of the service, only to those territorial agents and magistrates whose conduct was judged &quot;satisfactory&quot; by their superiors. This meant in practice that nothing changed. Congolese communities in the &quot;Domaine Privé&quot; were not merely forbidden by law to sell items to anyone but the state; they were required to provide state officials with set quotas of rubber and ivory at a fixed, government-mandated price and to provide food to the local post.

In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Berlin Treaty, not only had the state become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but also, Leopold had been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS. In terms of infrastructure, Leopold&#x27;s regime began construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). The railway, now known as the Matadi–Kinshasa Railway, was completed in 1898.

By the final decade of the 19th century, John Boyd Dunlop&#x27;s 1887 invention of inflatable, rubber bicycle tubes and the growing usage of the automobile dramatically increased global demand for rubber. To monopolize the resources of the entire Congo Free State, Leopold issued three decrees in 1891 and 1892 that reduced the native population to serfs. Collectively, these forced the natives to deliver all ivory and rubber, harvested or found, to state officers thus nearly completing Leopold&#x27;s monopoly of the ivory and rubber trade. The rubber came from wild vines in the jungle, unlike the rubber from Brazil (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;), which was tapped from trees. To extract the rubber, instead of tapping the vines, the Congolese workers would slash them and lather their bodies with the rubber latex. When the latex hardened, it would be scraped off the skin in a painful manner, as it took off the worker&#x27;s hair with it.
The &quot;Force Publique&quot; (FP), Leopold&#x27;s private army, was used to enforce the rubber quotas. Early on, the FP was used primarily to campaign against the Arab slave trade in the Upper Congo, protect Leopold&#x27;s economic interests, and suppress the frequent uprisings within the state. The Force Publique&#x27;s officer corps included only white Europeans (Belgian regular soldiers and mercenaries from other countries). On arriving in the Congo, the army included men from Zanzibar, West Africa, and eventually from the Congo itself. In addition, Leopold had been actually encouraging the slave trade among Arabs in the Upper Congo in return for slaves to fill the ranks of the FP. During the 1890s, the FP&#x27;s primary role was to exploit the natives as corvée labourers to promote the rubber trade.

Many of the black soldiers were from far-off peoples of the Upper Congo, while others had been kidnapped in raids on villages in their childhood and brought to Roman Catholic missions, where they received a military training in conditions close to slavery. Armed with modern weapons and the &quot;chicotte&quot;—a bull whip made of hippopotamus hide—the &quot;Force Publique&quot; routinely took and tortured hostages, slaughtered families of rebels, and flogged and raped Congolese people with a reign of terror and abuse that cost millions of lives. One refugee from these horrors described the process:
We were always in the forest to find the rubber vines, to go without food, and our women had to give up cultivating the fields and gardens. Then we starved ... When we failed and our rubber was short, the soldiers came to our towns and killed us. Many were shot, some had their ears cut off; others were tied up with ropes round their necks and taken away.

They also burned recalcitrant villages, and above all, cut off the hands of Congolese natives, including children. The human hands were collected as trophies on the orders of their officers to show that bullets had not been wasted. Officers were concerned that their subordinates might waste their ammunition on hunting animals for sport, so they required soldiers to submit one hand for every bullet spent. These mutilations also served to further terrorize the Congolese into submission. This was all contrary to the promises of uplift made at the Berlin Conference which had recognized the Congo Free State.
==Humanitarian disaster==
===Mutilation===
Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting. As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands. Sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the Force Publique, sometimes by the villages themselves. There were even small wars where villages attacked neighbouring villages to gather hands, since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill. A Catholic priest quotes a man, Tswambe, speaking of the hated state official Léon Fiévez, who ran a district along the river north of Stanley Pool:
One junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested. The officer in command &quot;ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades ... and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross&quot;. After seeing a Congolese person killed for the first time, a Danish missionary wrote: &quot;The soldier said &#x27;Don&#x27;t take this to heart so much. They kill us if we don&#x27;t bring the rubber. The Commissioner has promised us if we have plenty of hands he will shorten our service. In Forbath&#x27;s words:
In theory, each right hand proved a killing. In practice, to save ammunition soldiers sometimes &quot;cheated&quot; by simply cutting off the hand and leaving the victim to live or die. More than a few survivors later said that they had lived through a massacre by acting dead, not moving even when their hands were severed, and waiting till the soldiers left before seeking help. In some instances a soldier could shorten his service term by bringing more hands than the other soldiers, which led to widespread mutilations and dismemberment according to some historians.

===Cannibalism===

Cannibalism was widespread in parts of the Free State area when the State was established, and the colonial administration seems to have done little to suppress it, sometimes rather tolerating it among its own auxiliary troops and allies. During the Congo–Arab war, there were reports of widespread cannibalization of the bodies of defeated combatants by the Batetela allies of the Belgian commander Francis Dhanis. According to Dhanis&#x27;s medical officer, Captain Sidney Langford Hinde, the conquest of Nyangwe was followed by &quot;days of cannibal feasting&quot; during which hundreds were eaten, with only their heads being kept as mementos. During this time, Gongo Lutete, the leader of the Batetela, &quot;hid himself in his quarters, appalled by the sight of thousands of men smoking human hands and human chops on their camp fires, enough to feed his army for many days.&quot;

Soon after, Nyangwe&#x27;s surviving population rose in a rebellion, during whose brutal suppression a thousand rioters were killed by the new government. One young Belgian officer wrote home: &quot;Happily Gongo&#x27;s men ... ate them up [in a few hours]. It&#x27;s horrible but exceedingly useful and hygienic... I should have been horrified at the idea in Europe! but it seems quite natural to me here. Don&#x27;t show this letter to anyone indiscreet&quot;. Hinde too commented approvingly on the thoroughness with which the cannibals &quot;disposed of all the dead, leaving nothing even for the jackals, and thus sav[ing] us, no doubt, from many an epidemic.&quot;

When sending out &quot;punitive expeditions&quot; against villages unwilling or unable to fulfil the government&#x27;s exorbitant rubber quota, Free State officials repeatedly turned a blind eye both to arbitrary killings of those considered guilty as well as to the &quot;cannibal feast[s]&quot; celebrated by native soldiers that sometimes followed. In various cases they even handed captives, including infants and old women, over to their soldiers or local allies, implicitly or even explicitly allowing them to kill and eat them. Particularly infamous were groups of Songye fighters &quot;known as Zappo Zaps after the sound of their rifles&quot; and employed by the Free State to enforce its tax policies: &quot;Whenever a village failed to produce enough rubber, these men would attack, raping and eating their victims before cutting off their hands&quot; (to prove the success of their operations).

Generally, most Free State officials seem to have had little interest in stopping cannibal customs. One of them, Guy Burrows, wrote that when he was stationed near the Mongala River, he and his colleagues &quot;were well aware that scores of slaves were being sold to supply meat to the people on the other side of the river&quot;, but that (to his regret) neither the State nor the private companies active in the area did anything to suppress this deadly trade &quot;in slaves for the shambles&quot;, instead wholly focussing on the profitable rubber extraction.

Similarly, a German missionary reported an open trade in male and female slaves intended for consumption near the mouth of the Aruwimi River. Twice a week, new victims delivered by dugout canoe were &quot;bound to poles [in the river], with their ankles dislocated, and sticking up to their heads in the water. After four days their flesh was tender for the kitchen and they were slaughtered.&quot; The Free State finally stepped in to suppress this operation and execute the responsible trader, but only in 1906, more than 20 years after its foundation. Even afterwards, slaves were still offered fairly openly for eating, with the sellers of slave children pointing out the value of &quot;their meat&quot; when trying to negotiate a good price.

Another time, while stationed in Riba-Riba (today Lokandu) in the eastern Maniema region, Burrows rescued a young slave boy from becoming the &quot;&quot; of a banquet planned by his master. The latter not only freely admitted the plan, but failed to see anything wrong with it. It turned out that the local corporal had been aware of the planned banquet too, but had not considered it worthy of mention because &quot;the same thing had often occurred in the neighbouring villages, and the white men at the post had never bothered about it.&quot; Indeed, &quot;some European officers&quot; working for the Free State themselves &quot;developed a taste for human flesh&quot;, according to Forbath.

===Death toll===
A reduction of the population of the Congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of Leopold&#x27;s control with the beginning of Belgian state rule in 1908, but estimates of the death toll vary considerably. Estimates of some contemporary observers suggest that the population decreased by half during this period. According to Edmund D. Morel, the Congo Free State counted &quot;20 million souls&quot;. Hence, Mark Twain mentioned the number of ten million deaths. According to Irish diplomat Roger Casement, this depopulation had four main causes: &quot;indiscriminate war&quot;, starvation, reduction of births, and disease. Sleeping sickness was also a major cause of fatality at the time. Opponents of Leopold&#x27;s rule stated, however, that the administration itself was to be considered responsible for the spreading of the epidemic.

In the absence of a census providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the Congo Free State (the first was taken in 1924), it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period. Despite this, Forbath in 1977 claimed the loss was at least five million. Adam Hochschild and Jan Vansina use the number 10 million. Hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation, by anthropologist Jan Vansina and others, that examine local sources (police records, religious records, oral traditions, genealogies, personal diaries), which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 Belgian government commission: roughly half the population perished during the Free State period. Since the first official census by the Belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million, these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a total of 10 million dead.

However, Jan Vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline, and revised his earlier position, criticizing Hochschild for extrapolating the 50% death toll from the rubber provinces to the entirety of the Congo. He concluded that the Kuba population (one of the Congolese populations) was rising during the first two decades of Leopold II&#x27;s rule, and declined by 25 per cent from 1900 to 1919, mainly due to sickness. Others argued a decrease of 20 per cent over the first forty years of colonial rule (up to the census of 1924). According to the Congolese historian Isidore Ndaywel è Nziem 13 million died, although he later changed the number down to 10 million after the publication of Leopolds Ghost. To put these population changes in context, sourced references state that in 1900 Africa as a whole had between 90 million and 133 million people.

More recent extensive demographic research agrees with Vansina in his criticism of Hochschild&#x27;s 10 million claim. The current estimate for the population in 1885 is stated at around most likely 11.5 million. The first head count of the population after Leopolds reign put the population at 10 or 10.3 million, which is a population decrease of around 1.2 or 1.5 million people. The causes of the decline were multifactorial and included lower fertility, disease, famine, armed violence and mass emigration.
However, no verifiable complete records exist. Louis and Stengers state that population figures at the start of Leopold&#x27;s control are only &quot;wild guesses&quot;, while calling E. D. Morel&#x27;s attempt and others at coming to a figure for population losses &quot;but figments of the imagination&quot;. However, authors that point out the lack of reliable demographic data are questioned by others calling the former minimalists and agnosticists, proving that these questions remain the object of heated debate.

==International criticism==

Leopold ran up high debts with his Congo investments before the beginning of the worldwide rubber boom in the 1890s. Prices increased throughout the decade as industries discovered new uses for rubber in tires, hoses, tubing, insulation for telegraph and telephone cables and wiring. By the late-1890s, wild rubber had far surpassed ivory as the main source of revenue from the Congo Free State. The peak year was 1903, with rubber fetching the highest price and concessionary companies raking in the highest profits.

However, the boom sparked efforts to find lower-cost producers. Congolese concessionary companies started facing competition from rubber cultivation in Southeast Asia and Latin America. As plantations were begun in other tropical regions around the world, the global price of rubber started to dip. Competition heightened the drive to exploit forced labour in the Congo in order to lower production costs. Meanwhile, the cost of enforcement was eating away at profit margins, along with the toll taken by the increasingly unsustainable harvesting methods. As competition from other areas of rubber cultivation mounted, Leopold&#x27;s private rule was left increasingly vulnerable to international scrutiny.

Missionaries carefully documented and exposed atrocities committed. Eye-witness reports from missionaries portrayed actions by the State that broke laws set by the European nations. As rumours circulated Leopold attempted to discredit them, even creating a Commission for the Protection of the Natives. In January 1908, William Henry Sheppard published a report on colonial abuses in the American Presbyterian Congo Mission (APCM) newsletter, and both he and William Morrison were sued for libel against the Kasai Rubber Company (Compagnie de Kasai), a prominent Belgian rubber contractor in the area. When the case went to court in September 1909, the two missionaries had support from the CRA, American Progressives, and their lawyer Emile Vandervelde. The judge acquitted Sheppard (Morrison had been acquitted earlier on a technicality) on the premise that his editorial had not named the major company, but smaller charter companies instead. However, it is likely that the case was decided in favour of Sheppard as a result of international politics; the U.S., socially in support of the missionaries, had questioned the validity of King Leopold II&#x27;s rule over the Congo.

Sheppard&#x27;s documented cases of cruelty or violence were in direct violation of the Berlin Act of 1885, which gave Leopold II control over the Congo as long as he &quot;care[d] for the improvements of their conditions of their moral and material well-being&quot; and &quot;help[ed] in suppressing slavery.&quot; However, historians have noted that he and other missionaries have traditionally received little recognition for their contributions and reports.

===Congo Reform Association===

Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, originally published in 1899 as a three-part series in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, inspired by his service as a captain on a steamer on the Congo 12 years before, sparked an organized international opposition to Leopold&#x27;s exploitational activities. In 1900, Edmund Dene Morel, a part-time journalist and head of trade with Congo for the Liverpool shipping firm Elder Dempster, noticed that ships that brought vast loads of rubber from the Congo only ever returned there loaded with guns and ammunition for the &quot;Force Publique&quot;. Morel became a journalist and then a publisher, attempting to discredit Leopold&#x27;s regime. In 1902, Morel retired from his position at Elder Dempster to focus on campaigning. He founded his own magazine, &quot;The West African Mail&quot;, and conducted speaking tours in Britain. His writing included condemnations of his former employer Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, who was engaged in consular duties representing Leopold and the Congo Free State. Jones had initially offered the paper his financial backing, apparently in a final attempt to moderate Morel&#x27;s criticism of the company, but soon discontinued his support.

Increasing public outcry over the atrocities in the CFS moved the British government to launch an official investigation. In 1903, Morel and those who agreed with him in the House of Commons succeeded in passing a resolution calling on the British government to conduct an inquiry into alleged violations of the Berlin Agreement. Roger Casement, then the British Consul at Boma (at the mouth of the Congo River), was sent to the Congo Free State to investigate. Reporting back to the Foreign Office in 1900, Casement wrote:
The root of the evil lies in the fact that the government of the Congo is above all a commercial trust, that everything else is orientated towards commercial gain ...

E. D. Morel was introduced to Roger Casement by their mutual friend Herbert Ward just before the publication of Casement&#x27;s 1904 detailed eyewitness report—known as the Casement Report—in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question, the Congo Reform Association. With Casement&#x27;s and Dr. Guinness&#x27;s assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold&#x27;s control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Congo Reform movement&#x27;s members included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, Booker T. Washington, and Bertrand Russell.

The mass deaths in the Congo Free State became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in the last years of the 19th century. The Congo reform movement led a vigorous international movement against the maltreatment of the Congolese population. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the 14 signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the king&#x27;s Congolese policy, forced Leopold to set up an independent commission of inquiry, and despite the king&#x27;s efforts, in 1905 it confirmed Casement&#x27;s report.

One of the main ways Britain was involved in ending Leopold&#x27;s rule in the Congo, was by making Belgium, as a whole, more aware of the brutality present in the Congo. E. D. Morel was one of the key British activists for a Congo free from Belgian rule. Once the US became aware of the occurrences in the Congo, Morel began the Congo Reform Association. One of the methods Morel used to make the world more aware of the atrocities in the Congo during Leopold&#x27;s rule was through the press. Articles were published in both magazines and newspapers in order to make the people of these powerful countries, such as the US and Great Britain, more aware of what truly was being done in this part of Africa. With this newfound unwanted publicity, the Belgian government was pressured in assuming control of the Congo from Leopold.

Individuals such as George Washington Williams also had a significant impact on the Congo Free State propaganda war. In his famous letter, &quot;An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Léopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo&quot;, sent on 18 July 1890, Williams described in great detail the crimes committed against the residents of the Congo and their overall mistreatment. This letter was a key factor in the propaganda struggle over conditions in the Congo.

==Belgian annexation of the Congo Free State as the Belgian Congo==

Leopold II offered to reform his Congo Free State regime, but international opinion supported an end to the king&#x27;s rule, and no nation was willing to accept this responsibility. Belgium was the obvious European candidate to annex the Congo Free State. For two years, it debated the question and held new elections on the issue.

Yielding to international pressure, the parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration on 15 November 1908, as the colony of the Belgian Congo. The governance of the Belgian Congo was outlined in the 1908 Colonial Charter. Despite being effectively removed from power, the international scrutiny was no major loss to Leopold II—who died in Brussels on 17 December 1909—or to the concessionary companies in the Congo. By then Southeast Asia and Latin America had become lower-cost producers of rubber. Along with the effects of resource depletion in the Congo, international commodity prices had fallen to a level that rendered Congolese extraction unprofitable. Just prior to releasing sovereignty over the CFS, Leopold had all evidence of his activities in the CFS destroyed, including the archives of the departments of finance and of the interior. Leopold II lost the absolute power he had had there, but the population now had a Belgian colonial regime, which had become heavily paternalistic, with church, state, and private companies all instructed to oversee the welfare of the inhabitants.

==Legacy==

The Order of the Crown, originally created in 1897, rewarded heroic deeds and service achieved while serving in the Congo Free State. The Order was made a decoration of the Belgian state with the abolition of the Congo Free State in 1908 and is still awarded today.

Between 1886 and 1908 the Free State issued a number of postage stamps. These typically showed scenes of wildlife, landscapes, and natives.

Coins were minted from 1887 to 1908, using the Belgian standard. They ranged from a copper 1 Centime through a silver 5 Francs. The lower values showed a star on the obverse and were holed, the higher ones had a bust of Leopold II.

===Genocide question===
In the aftermath of the 1998 publication of &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot; by Adam Hochschild, where he had written &quot;the killing in the Congo was of genocidal proportions&quot;, but &quot;it was not strictly speaking a genocide&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Brussels would finance an investigation into some of the claims made by Hochschild. An investigatory panel announced in 2002, likely to be headed by Professor Jean-Luc Vellut, was scheduled to report its findings in 2004. Robert G. Weisbord stated in the 2003 &quot;Journal of Genocide Research&quot; that attempting to eliminate a portion of the population is enough to qualify as genocide under the UN convention. In the case of the Congo Free State, the unbearable conditions would qualify as a genocide.

In the aftermath of the report, an exhibition was held at the Royal Museum for Central Africa entitled &quot;The Memory of Congo&quot;. Critics, including Hochschild, claimed that there were &quot;distortions and evasions&quot; in the exhibition and stated: &quot;The exhibit deals with this question in a wall panel misleadingly headed &#x27;Genocide in the Congo?&#x27; This is a red herring, for no reputable historian of the Congo has made charges of genocide; a forced labor system, although it may be equally deadly, is different.&quot;

An early day motion presented to the British Parliament in 2006 described &quot;the tragedy of King Leopold&#x27;s regime&quot; as genocide and called for an apology from the Belgian government. It received the signature of 48 members of parliament.

<text>Sir John Kenneth Tavener (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of choral religious works. Among his best known works are &quot;The Lamb&quot; (1982), &quot;The Protecting Veil&quot; (1988), and &quot;Song for Athene&quot; (1993).

Tavener first came to prominence with his cantata &quot;The Whale&quot;, premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the musical discovery of the year&quot;, while &quot;The Times&quot; said he was &quot;among the very best creative talents of his generation&quot;. During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for &quot;The Protecting Veil&quot;, which as recorded by cellist Steven Isserlis became a best-selling album, and &quot;Song for Athene&quot; which was sung at the funeral of Princess Diana. &quot;The Lamb&quot; featured in the soundtrack for Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s film &quot;The Great Beauty&quot;. Tavener wrote the composition &quot;A New Beginning&quot; to commemorate the Millennium celebrations on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1999, during the opening of the Millennium Dome in London. Tavener was knighted in 2000 for his services to music and won an Ivor Novello Award, and was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by Sarum College in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Tavener was born on 28 January 1944 in Wembley, London. His parents ran a family building firm and his father was also an organist at St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Frognal, Hampstead. At the age of 12, Tavener was taken to Glyndebourne to hear Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, a work he loved for the rest of his life. That same year he heard Stravinsky&#x27;s most recent work, &quot;Canticum Sacrum&quot;, which he later described as &quot;the piece that woke me up and made me want to be a composer&quot;.

Tavener became a music scholar at Highgate School (where a fellow pupil was John Rutter). The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys&#x27; voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony and Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto and, in 1961 with the National Youth Orchestra, Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2. He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Church), a post he held for 14 years.

Tavener entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1962, where his tutors included Sir Lennox Berkeley. During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.

==&quot;The Whale&quot; and early operas==
Tavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata &quot;The Whale&quot;, based on the Old Testament story of Jonah. It was premièred at the London Sinfonietta&#x27;s début concert, which was also the opening concert of the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Tavener&#x27;s younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on Ringo Starr&#x27;s home and, gaining the musician&#x27;s interest, persuaded the Beatles to have &quot;The Whale&quot; recorded by Apple Records and released in 1970. The following year Tavener began teaching at Trinity College of Music, London. Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his &quot;A Celtic Requiem&quot;, which impressed Benjamin Britten enough to persuade Covent Garden to commission an opera from Tavener. The ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright Gerard McLarnon, was &quot;Thérèse&quot;: when staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.

Tavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou. His chamber opera &quot;A Gentle Spirit&quot; (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed &quot;far superior to &quot;Thérèse&quot;, with the internal drama more suited to the stage&quot;. Significantly, it also touched on Russian Orthodoxy, to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.

==Conversion to Orthodox Christianity==
Tavener converted to the Orthodox Church in 1977. Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its mysticism, studying and setting to music the writings of Church Fathers and completing a setting of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener&#x27;s first directly Orthodox-inspired music.

==Later career==

Tavener&#x27;s subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in &quot;Akhmatova Requiem&quot;: this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its Proms&#x27; performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished. Of more lasting success was Tavener&#x27;s short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lamb&quot;, written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon&#x27;s third birthday. This simple homophonic piece is usually performed as a Christmas carol. Later prominent works include &quot;The Akathist of Thanksgiving&quot; of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; &quot;The Protecting Veil&quot;, first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the London Symphony Orchestra at the 1989 Proms; and &quot;Song for Athene&quot; (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by Mother Thekla, a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener&#x27;s long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011. &quot;Song for Athene&quot; in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.

Tavener&#x27;s &quot;Fall and Resurrection&quot;, first performed in 2000, used instruments such as ram&#x27;s horn, Ney flute and kaval. It was dedicated to the then Prince of Wales, with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship. His work &quot;Ikon of Eros&quot; (2003) was commissioned for violinist Jorja Fleezanis, then concertmaster of the Minnesota Orchestra, with vocal soloists and the Minnesota Chorale and recorded at the Cathedral of St. Paul, conducted by Paul Goodwin. Also in 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work &quot;The Veil of the Temple&quot; (which was premièred at the Temple Church, London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as &quot;the supreme achievement of my life&quot;, it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours. &quot;Prayer of the Heart&quot;, written for and performed by Björk, was premiered in 2004. In 2007 Tavener composed &quot;The Beautiful Names&quot;, a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in Arabic.

It had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left Orthodox Christianity to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including Hinduism and Islam, and became a follower of the Traditionalist philosopher Frithjof Schuon. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, conducted by British music journalist Michael White, Tavener said: &quot;I reached a point where everything I wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the Orthodox Church, and I felt the need, in my music at least, to become more universalist: to take in other colors, other languages.&quot; The interviewer also reported at the time that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian.&quot; Speaking on the BBC Four television programme &quot;Sacred Music&quot; in 2010, Tavener described himself as &quot;essentially Orthodox&quot;. He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on &quot;Start the Week&quot;, recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11 November 2013.

In 2020 Sir David Pountney, former artistic director of the Welsh National Opera, announced that Tavener&#x27;s final opera, &quot;Krishna&quot; (which was completed in 2005 but had remained in manuscript form) would be staged by Grange Park Opera. Pountney himself will be directing the production. It will premiere in 2026.

==Personal life ==
In 1974 he married the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou. They were married for eight months. In 1991 he married Maryanna Schaefer with whom he had three children, Theodora, Sofia and Orlando. He had considerable health problems throughout his life. He had a stroke in his thirties, heart surgery and the removal of a tumour in his forties, and had two successive heart attacks which left him frail. He was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in 1990. Lady Tavener broadcast a charity appeal on BBC Radio 4 in October 2008 on behalf of the Marfan Trust.

Tavener had an interest in classic cars, owning an Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire, a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, a Jaguar XJ6 and a white Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. He was also noted for wearing a white suit.

==Death and legacy==
Tavener died, aged 69, on 12 November 2013 at his home in Child Okeford, Dorset. Among those in the music world who paid tribute were composers John Rutter and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, cellist Steven Isserlis, Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, oboist Nicholas Daniel, Roger Wright (controller of BBC Radio 3 and director of the Proms), and soprano Patricia Rozario. A tribute was also received from Charles, Prince of Wales.
Tavener&#x27;s funeral was held at Winchester Cathedral on 28 November 2013. The service was conducted in the Orthodox rite and was presided over by Archbishop Gregorios of Thyateira, representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch and the most senior Orthodox bishop in the UK. About 700 mourners attended.

Rutter describes Tavener as having the &quot;very rare gift&quot; of being able to &quot;bring an audience to a deep silence.&quot; According to Isserlis: &quot;He had his own voice. He wasn&#x27;t writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write.&quot;

==Musical style==
While Tavener&#x27;s earliest music was influenced by Igor Stravinsky and Olivier Messiaen – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular &quot;Canticum Sacrum&quot;, and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide registral space and was usually diatonically tonal. Tavener recognised Arvo Pärt as &quot;a kindred spirit&quot; and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.

<text>Sir Cecil Maurice Bowra, (; 8 April 1898 – 4 July 1971) was an English classical scholar, literary critic and academic, known for his wit. He was Warden of Wadham College, Oxford, from 1938 to 1970, and served as vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1951 to 1954.

==Early life and education==

===Birth and boyhood===
Bowra was born in Jiujiang, China, to English parents. His father, Cecil Arthur Verner Bowra (1869–1947), who worked for the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs, had been born in Ningbo, and his paternal grandfather, Edward Charles Bowra, had also worked for the Chinese Customs, after serving in the Ever Victorious Army under &quot;Chinese Gordon&quot;. Soon after Bowra&#x27;s birth his father was transferred to the treaty port of Niuzhuang, and the family lived there for the first five years of Bowra&#x27;s life, except during the Boxer Rebellion, in the summer of 1900, when Bowra was evacuated to Japan along with his mother, his elder brother, Edward, and other women and children of the European community.

The family returned to Britain in 1903, travelling via Japan and the United States, and settled in the Kent countryside. Bowra later said he had been fluent in Mandarin, but forgot the language after settling in Britain. Bowra&#x27;s parents went back to China in February 1905, leaving their children in the care of their paternal grandmother, who, having been widowed, lived with her second husband, a clergyman, in Putney. During this time the boys received tuition from Ella Dell, sister of the writer Ethel M. Dell. The boys also attended a preparatory school in Putney, where Maurice came first in all classes except arithmetic. During his time at this school Bowra began his classical education with lessons from Cecil Botting, a master at St Paul&#x27;s School and father of the writer Antonia White.

In 1909 the Bowra brothers journeyed across Europe and Russia by train to visit their parents in Mukden. They also visited the site of the Battle of Mukden and encountered Lord Kitchener. Their return journey, which they made in the company of their father, took them through Hong Kong, Colombo, Suez, Naples and Algiers.

===Cheltenham College===
Bowra boarded at Cheltenham College from April 1910. He did not enjoy such features of the school as outdoor games or the OTC, but he won a scholarship in the internal exams held in June 1911. It became clear that he had a particular aptitude for classics, for which the school laid a thorough grounding in Greek and Latin. During his final two years, in the sixth form, Bowra became bored with his school work, acquired sufficient French to read Verlaine and Baudelaire, studied a bilingual edition of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;, and began to learn German. Bowra maintained a connection with the school in later life, being instrumental in the appointment of Cecil Day-Lewis as a master there and serving on its governing body from 1943 to 1965.

==World War I==
By 1916 Bowra&#x27;s father was Chief Secretary of the Chinese Customs and resided in Beijing in a household with thirty servants. In January that year Bowra&#x27;s mother came to England to visit her sons, who were both about to see active service in the Army. In May Bowra departed with his mother for China, travelling through Norway, Sweden and Russia. In Beijing he visited the Great Wall of China and the Ming Tombs, and witnessed the funeral of Yuan Shikai.

Bowra departed from Beijing in September and on his way home spent three weeks in St Petersburg (then called Petrograd) as a guest of Robert Wilton. During this time he attained a working knowledge of Russian and attended operas in which Feodor Chaliapin performed.

After his return to Britain he began training with the OTC in Oxford before being called up and sent to the Royal Army Cadet School in March 1917. He served in the Royal Field Artillery on active service in France from September 1917. He saw action at Passchendaele and Cambrai, and in 1918 he participated in the resistance to the Ludendorff Offensive and the Allied counter-offensive. During this time he continued to read widely, including both contemporary poets and Greek and Latin authors.

Bowra was left with a lifelong hatred of war and military strategists, and seldom mentioned the war afterwards. He later told Cyril Connolly, &quot;Whatever you hear about the war, remember it was far worse: inconceivably bloody – nobody who wasn&#x27;t there can imagine what it was like.&quot; Anthony Powell wrote that Bowra&#x27;s wartime experiences &quot;played a profound part in his thoughts and inner life&quot;, and records that when a cruise ship they were travelling on held a ceremony to place a wreath in the sea as it passed the Dardanelles Bowra was so affected that he retired to his cabin. Following the Second World War he was accommodating to returning servicemen who wished to study at Oxford, telling one applicant who was worried about his deficiency in Latin, &quot;No matter, war service counts as Latin.&quot;

==Undergraduate years==
In 1919 Bowra took up a scholarship he had won to New College, Oxford. He took a first class in Honour Moderations in 1920 and a first class, with formal congratulations, in Literae Humaniores in 1922. Bowra was very sociable as an undergraduate, and his circle included Cyril Radcliffe (with whom he shared lodgings), Roy Harrod, Robert Boothby, L. P. Hartley, Lord David Cecil, J. B. S. Haldane and Christopher Hollis. He also became a friend of Dadie Rylands. The teachers who influenced him included Gilbert Murray and Alic Smith. The treatment he received from one of his tutors in philosophy, H. W. B. Joseph, was said by Isaiah Berlin to have &quot;undermined his faith in his own intellectual capacity&quot;.

==Academic career==

In 1922 Bowra was elected a fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, with the support of the Regius Professor of Greek, Gilbert Murray, and appointed Dean of Wadham shortly afterwards. When Murray vacated his chair in 1936 Bowra and others believed that Bowra himself was most likely to succeed him, but Murray recommended E. R. Dodds as his successor, rejecting Bowra because of &quot;a certain lack of quality, precision and reality in his scholarship as a whole&quot;. Some believed that the real reason was a whispering campaign over Bowra&#x27;s &quot;real or imagined homosexuality&quot;.

Bowra became a Doctor of Letters of the University of Oxford in 1937. In 1938 the Wardenship of Wadham fell vacant and Bowra, still the Dean, was elected to the post, keeping it until 1970 (when he was succeeded by Stuart Hampshire). Bowra was supported in the election by his colleague Frederick Lindemann. Lindemann had initially opposed Bowra&#x27;s election as a fellow of Wadham, proposing that a scientist should be preferred, but had warmed to Bowra because of his vociferous opposition to the Nazi regime in Germany and the policy of appeasement. The election was held on 5 October 1938, and coincided with the Oxford by-election campaign, in which Bowra lent his support to the anti-appeasement candidate, Sandy Lindsay.

During the Second World War Bowra served in the Oxford Home Guard and was not offered any war work. When Berlin canvassed to find Bowra a position the file was sent back to him stamped &quot;unreliable&quot;.

Bowra was Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1946 to 1951. He wrote of the election for the post that &quot;The campaign was very enjoyable and C. S. Lewis was outmanoeuvred so completely that he even failed in the end to be nominated, and I walked over without opposition. Very gratifying to a vain man like myself.&quot;

Bowra spent the academic year 1948–49 at Harvard as the Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry and gave the 1955 Andrew Lang lecture. He delivered the 1957 Earl Grey Lecture in Newcastle on &quot;The Meaning of a Heroic Age&quot; and the 1963 Taylorian Lecture on &quot;Poetry and the First World War&quot;. In 1966 he gave the Romanes Lecture.

Bowra was at Harvard when the post of vice-chancellor fell unexpectedly vacant in 1948, on the sudden accidental death of William Stallybrass. When the most senior head of house, J. R. H. Weaver, declined the post, Bowra could have succeeded to it, but he chose to stay in the United States and Dean Lowe filled the post until 1951, when Bowra served his three-year term. As chair of the Hebdomadal Council he dealt with the business of meetings that customarily occupied a whole afternoon in as little as fifteen minutes. When T. S. R. Boase was indisposed by an eye problem in 1959 Bowra returned to chair the committee and privately remarked that &quot;jokes about his &quot;beaux yeux&quot; are not thought funny&quot;.

Bowra was President of the British Academy from 1958 to 1962. His tenure was marked by two achievements: he chaired the committee that produced the &quot;Report on Research in the Humanities and the Social Sciences&quot;, which resulted in a grant for those purposes from HM Treasury; and he helped to establish the British Institute of Persian Studies in Tehran.

In his long career as an Oxford don Bowra had contact with a considerable portion of the English literary world, either as students or as colleagues. The character of Mr Samgrass in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; is said to have been modelled on Bowra. Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Anthony Powell and Kenneth Clark knew Bowra quite well when they were undergraduates. Clark called Bowra &quot;the strongest influence in my life&quot;. Waugh marked his friend&#x27;s election as Warden of Wadham by presenting him with a monkey-puzzle tree for his garden.

John Betjeman recorded his appreciation of Bowra in his verse autobiography &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot;, in which he evokes an evening spent dining with Bowra in a passage that concludes: &quot;I wandered back to Magdalen, certain then,/ As now, that Maurice Bowra’s company / Taught me far more than all my tutors did.&quot;

Though he was not in any sense religious, Bowra signed the petition (in favour of the Tridentine Catholic Mass) that became informally known as the Agatha Christie indult and regularly attended the Church of England services in his college&#x27;s chapel.

==Verse==
Bowra had learned the value of verse during the First World War. Cyril Connolly wrote that Bowra &quot;saw human life as a tragedy in which great poets were the heroes who fought back and tried to give life a meaning&quot;. Bowra was an important champion of Boris Pasternak, lecturing on his work and nominating him repeatedly for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

However, Bowra was never able to fulfil his wish to be accepted as a serious poet himself. His output consisted of &quot;sharp satires, in verse, on his friends (and sharper still on his enemies)&quot;. His friend and literary executor, John Sparrow, once commented that Bowra had cut himself off from posterity &quot;as his prose was unreadable and his verse was unprintable&quot;. This was set half-right by the publication in 2005 of &quot;New Bats in Old Belfries&quot;, a collection of satires on friends and enemies written between the 1920s and the 1960s. Bowra wrote a satire on John Betjeman, who had become choked with emotion on being presented by Princess Margaret with the Duff Cooper Prize on 18 December 1958. The judges on that occasion were Lord David Cecil, Harold Nicolson and Bowra himself as chairman. Duff Cooper&#x27;s widow Lady Diana Cooper observed that &quot;Poor Betch was crying and too moved to find an apology for words.&quot; (Philip Ziegler, &quot;Diana Cooper: The Biography of Lady Diana Cooper&quot;, Hamish Hamilton 1981, p. 310.)

Green with lust and sick with shyness, 
Let me lick your lacquered toes. 
Gosh, oh gosh, your Royal Highness, 
Put your finger up my nose, 
Pin my teeth upon your dress, 
Plant my head with watercress. 
Only you can make me happy. 
Tuck me tight beneath your arm. 
Wrap me in a woollen nappy; 
Let me wet it till it&#x27;s warm. 
In a plush and plated pram 
Wheel me round St James&#x27;s, Ma&#x27;am. 
Let your sleek and soft galoshes 
Slide and slither on my skin. 
Swaddle me in mackintoshes 
Till I lose my sense of sin. 
Lightly plant your plimsolled heel 
Where my privy parts congeal.

The &quot;Telegraph&quot;, echoing Cecil Day-Lewis on the man himself, warned that the book, like strychnine, was best taken in small doses.

Two poems on Patrick Leigh Fermor were omitted from the book, in deference to their subject&#x27;s wishes, but were published after his death in the &quot;Wadham Gazette&quot; in December 2011.

==Sexuality==
Bowra was homosexual. As an undergraduate in Oxford in the 1920s, Bowra was known to cruise for sex. He used the term &quot;the Homintern&quot; and privately referred to his leading position in it, also calling it &quot;the Immoral Front&quot; or &quot;the 69th International&quot;.

==Retirement and death==

Bowra retired in 1970, but continued to live in rooms in the college that had been granted to him in exchange for a house he owned. He became an honorary fellow of Wadham and was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law. He died of a sudden heart attack in 1971 and his cremated remains were buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.

==Honours==

In addition to his Oxford degrees, Bowra received honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin, Hull, Wales, Harvard, Columbia, St Andrews, Paris and Aix.

Bowra was knighted in 1951 and was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1971. He was also a &quot;Commandeur &quot; of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in France, a Knight Commander of the Royal Order of the Phoenix in Greece and a recipient of the order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; in West Germany.

In 1992 Wadham College named its new Bowra Building in his honour.

==Quotations==
*&quot;Buggers can&#x27;t be choosers&quot; (explaining his engagement, later called off, to a &quot;plain&quot; woman, poet and Somerville alumna Audrey Beecham, niece of the conductor)
*&quot;I am a man more dined against than dining&quot; (parodying King Lear&#x27;s &quot;more sinned against than sinning&quot;)
*&quot;Buggery was invented to fill that awkward hour between Evensong and cocktails&quot; or was &quot;useful for filling that awkward time between tea and cocktails&quot;
*&quot;Splendid couple—slept with both of them&quot; (on hearing of the engagement of a well-known literary pair)
*&quot;Though like Our Lord and Socrates he does not publish much, he thinks and says a great deal and has had an enormous influence on our times&quot; (about Isaiah Berlin)
*&quot;I don&#x27;t know about you, gentlemen, but in Oxford I, at least, am known by my face&quot; (allegedly after being observed bathing naked at Parson&#x27;s Pleasure and covering his face rather than his privates)
* &quot;Where there&#x27;s death, there&#x27;s hope.&quot;
* When asked by an undergraduate for help with translating a passage by Apollinaire, whom Bowra had met whilst in France during the First World War: &quot;Can’t help you. Pity. Slept with him once—should have asked him then.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; (BB-5), was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy and lead ship of her class of battleships. She was named after the sloop-of-war , famous for sinking the , and was the only United States Navy battleship not named after a state.

Her keel was laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Virginia, on 30 June 1896. She was launched on 24 March 1898, sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth Winslow (née Maynard), the wife of Rear Admiral Herbert Winslow, and commissioned on 20 February 1900.

Between 1903 and 1907 &quot;Kearsarge&quot; served in the North Atlantic Fleet, and from 1907 to 1909 she sailed as part of the Great White Fleet. In 1909 she was decommissioned for modernization, which was finished in 1911. In 1915 she served in the Atlantic, and between 1916 and 1919 she served as a training ship. She was converted into a crane ship in 1920, renamed &quot;Crane Ship No. 1&quot; in 1941, and sold for scrap in 1955.

== Design ==
The &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense. They had a displacement of , an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines and five Scotch boilers, connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of , and gave a maximum speed of . &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; had two double turrets, with two /35 caliber guns and two /40 caliber guns each, stacked in two levels. The guns and turret armor were designed by the Bureau of Ordnance, while the turret itself was designed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair. This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large. Admiral William Sims claimed that as a result, a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below, disabling the guns. In addition to these guns, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; carried fourteen /40 caliber guns, twenty 6-pounder () guns, eight 1-pounder () guns, four machine guns, and four  torpedo tubes. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; had a very low freeboard, which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armor belt was thick and the main gun turrets were protected by of armor, while the secondary turrets had of armor. The barbettes were thick, while the conning tower had of armor. The armor was made of harveyized steel.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; carried 16 smaller boats. A steam cutter, with a capacity of 60 men, together with a steam cutter, were used for general carrying from and to port, and could tow the other boats if needed. Two 33-foot launches, each capable of carrying 64 men, were the &quot;working boats&quot;. There were ten boats: four cutters, each with a capacity of 45 men, the Admiral&#x27;s barge, two whaleboats (which served as lifeboats), and the Captain&#x27;s gig. Four smaller boats completed &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s small fleet: two dinghies and two catamarans.

== Construction ==

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was authorized on 2 March 1895, the contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896, and the keel of the vessel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company in Virginia. The total cost was US$5,043,591.68. She was soon named after the American Civil War sloop-of-war , and was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named by act of Congress. She was the only US battleship not named after a state. She was christened on 24 March 1898 (the same day as her sister ship, &quot;Kentucky&quot;) by Mrs. Elizabeth Winslow (née Maynard), the wife of Captain Herbert Winslow, daughter-in-law of Captain John Ancrum Winslow, the commander of the original &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. She was commissioned on 20 February 1900, under the command of Captain William M. Folger.

== Service history ==
=== Early career ===
As flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; sailed along the Atlantic seaboard and the Caribbean Sea. In May 1901 Captain Bowman H. McCalla assumed command of &quot;Kearsarge&quot;, although by May 1902 the ship was being commanded by Captain Joseph Newton Hemphill. Reassigned as flagship of the European Squadron, she sailed from Sandy Hook on 3 June 1903, on her way to Kiel, Germany. She was visited by Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany on 25 June, and by the Prince of Wales – who would later become King George V of the United Kingdom – on 13 July.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; returned to Bar Harbor, Maine, on 26 July, and resumed her position as flagship. On 1 December the ship sailed from New York for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where she was present as the United States took formal possession of the Guantanamo Naval Reservation on 10 December. On 26 March 1904 Captain Raymond P. Rodgers assumed command of the ship. Following maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; left with the North Atlantic Squadron for Lisbon, Portugal, where she met King Carlos I of Portugal on 11 June 1904. Independence Day was celebrated in Phaleron Bay, Greece, with King George I of Greece and his son and daughter-in-law, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. The squadron visited Corfu, Trieste, and Fiume before returning to Newport, Rhode Island, on 29 August 1904.

On 31 March 1905, replaced &quot;Kearsarge&quot; as flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet, although she remained with the fleet. Captain Herbert Winslow took command of the ship during December. On 13 April 1906, while participating in an exercise off Cape Cruz, Cuba, the gunpowder in a 13-inch gun ignited accidentally, killing two officers and eight men.

=== Great White Fleet ===
Attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and under command of Captain Hamilton Hutchins, she sailed on 16 December 1907 with the Great White Fleet. The fleet left from Hampton Roads, passed by Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and then passed through the Straits of Magellan. From there she passed by the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later the warships sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, and from there to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving 9 August. The fleet made Sydney, Australia, on 20 August, and after a week sailed for Melbourne.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; departed Albany, Western Australia, on 18 September for ports in the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, and Ceylon before transiting the Suez Canal. The fleet split at Port Said, with &quot;Kearsarge&quot; leaving on 10 January 1909 for Malta, and arriving in Algiers on 24 January, before reforming with the fleet at Gibraltar on 1 February. She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February, and was inspected by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.

=== World War I ===
As with most of the Great White Fleet ships, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was modernized on her return. She was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 4 September 1909, and the modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of US$675,000. The ship received cage masts, new water-tube boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915, and operated along the Atlantic coast. On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of US Marines at Veracruz, Mexico, remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916. She then carried the Marines to New Orleans, Louisiana, before joining the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 4 February. Until the United States joined World War I, she trained naval militia from Massachusetts and Maine. During the war she was used to train Armed Guard crews and naval engineers during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard. On 18 August 1918 &quot;Kearsarge&quot; rescued 26 survivors of the Norwegian barque &quot;Nordhav&quot; which had been sunk by , bringing them to Boston.

=== Inter-war period ===
Between 29 May and 29 August 1919, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; trained United States Naval Academy midshipmen in the Caribbean. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; sailed from Annapolis, Maryland to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she decommissioned on either 10 May or 18 May 1920.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was converted into a crane ship, and was given hull classification symbol IX-16 on 17 July 1920, but it was changed to AB-1 on 5 August. Her turrets, superstructure, and armor were removed, and were replaced by a large revolving crane with a lifting capacity of 250 tons (230 tonnes), as well as blisters, which improved her stability. The crane ship was utilized often over the next 20 years, including the raising of in 1939.

=== World War II ===
On 6 November 1941, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was renamed &quot;Crane Ship No. 1&quot;, allowing her name to be given to , and later to . She continued her service, however, handling guns, turrets, armor, and other heavy lifts for vessels such as , , , , and .

She was transferred to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in 1945, where she participated in the construction of &quot;Hornet&quot; and and the re-construction of . One of her last projects was performing heavy lifts during the reassembly of another crane vessel, YD-171 (ex-&quot;Schwimmkran nr. 1&quot;) on Terminal Island. In 1948 she left the West Coast for the Boston Naval Shipyard. On 22 June 1955 her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was sold for scrap on 9 August.

<text>USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;, a &quot;Mohican&quot;-class sloop-of-war, is best known for her defeat of the Confederate commerce raider off Cherbourg, France during the American Civil War. 

==Hunting Confederate raiders==
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was built at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, under the 1861 American Civil War emergency shipbuilding program. The new steam sloop-of-war was launched on 11 September 1861; she was sponsored by Mrs. McFarland, the wife of the editor of the &quot;Concord Statement&quot;, and was commissioned on 24 January 1862, with Captain Charles W. Pickering in command. Soon after, she was hunting for Confederate raiders in European waters.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was the only ship of the United States Navy named for Mount Kearsarge in New Hampshire. Subsequent ships were later named &quot;Kearsarge&quot; in honor of the ship.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 5 February 1862 for the coast of Spain. She then sailed to Gibraltar to join the blockade of Confederate raider , forcing the ship&#x27;s abandonment there in December 1862. However, &quot;Sumter&quot;″s captain, Raphael Semmes, having returned to England for reassignment, was soon recommissioning off the Azores, in international waters, the newly-built British sloop &quot;Enrica&quot; as . From there, &quot;Alabama&quot; went on to become one of the most successful commerce raiders in naval history.

From Cádiz in November of 1862 until March 1863 &quot;Kearsarge&quot; prepared for her engagement with &quot;Alabama&quot;. She searched for the raider, ranging along the coast of Northern Europe all the way to the Canaries, Madeira, and the Outer Hebrides. In early May 1864, she ran aground near Oostende. She was then repaired in the dry dock of Vlissingen, Netherlands until 10 May. On 14 June 1864, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; arrived at Cherbourg and found &quot;Alabama&quot; in port. The raider had returned there for much needed repairs after a very long, multiple ocean cruise at the expense of 65 Union merchant ships. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; took up station at the harbor&#x27;s entrance to await Semmes&#x27; next move.

==Battle of Cherbourg==
On 19 June, &quot;Alabama&quot; stood out of Cherbourg Harbor for her last action. Mindful of French neutrality, &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s new commanding officer, Capt. John A. Winslow, took the sloop-of-war clear of territorial waters, then turned to meet the Confederate cruiser.


 &quot;Alabama&quot; was the first to open fire, while &quot;Kearsarge&quot; held her reply until she had closed to less than . Steaming on opposite courses, the ships moved in seven spiraling circles on a southwesterly course, as each commander tried to cross his opponent&#x27;s bow to deliver deadly raking fire. The battle quickly turned against &quot;Alabama&quot;, due to her poor gunnery and to the quality of her long-stored (and deteriorated) powder, fuses, and shells. Unknown at the time to Captain Semmes aboard the Confederate raider, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; had been given added protection for her vital machinery, by chain cable, mounted in three separate vertical tiers, along the port and starboard of her midsection.

This hull armor had been installed more than a year before (in just three days), while &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was in port at the Azores. It was made using of single-link iron chain, and covered hull spaces long by deep. This was stopped up and down in three layers to eye-bolts with marlines, and secured by iron dogs, then concealed behind deal-boards, painted black to match the upper hull″s color. This chain cladding was placed along &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s port and starboard midsection down to her waterline, for protection of her engines and boilers, when the upper portions of the cruiser&#x27;s coal bunkers were empty. This armor belt was hit twice during the fight: first, in the starboard gangway by one of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s 32-pounder shells, which cut the chain armor, denting the hull planking underneath, and by a second shell of the same warhead-rating exploded, breaking a link of the chain, and tearing away a portion of the deal-board covering. Even if the shells had been delivered by &quot;Alabama&quot;″s more powerful 100-pounder Blakely pivot rifle, the impacts were more than above the waterline and would therefore have missed her vital machinery.

One hour after she fired her first salvo, &quot;Alabama&quot; had been reduced to a sinking wreck by &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s more accurate gunnery, and by its powerful Dahlgren smoothbore pivot guns. &quot;Alabama&quot; went down by the stern shortly after Semmes struck his colors, threw his sword into the sea to avoid its capture, and sent one of his two remaining longboats to &quot;Kearsarge&quot; with a message of surrender, and a rescue appeal for his surviving crew. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; finally sent ship&#x27;s boats for the majority of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s survivors, but Semmes and 41 others were instead rescued by the nearby British yacht &quot;Deerhound&quot;, and escaped to the United Kingdom.
The battle between &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot; is commemorated by the United States Navy with a battle star on the Civil War campaign streamer. In addition, 17 of &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s crew received the Medal of Honor for valor during this action:
* Michael Aheam
* John F. Bickford
* William S. Bond
* James Haley
* Mark G. Ham
* George H. Harrison
* John Hayes
* James H. Lee
* Charles Moore
* Joachim Pease
* Thomas Perry
* William B. Poole
* Charles A. Read
* George E. Read
* James Saunders
* William Smith
* Robert Strahan
The medals were awarded on 31 December 1864.

==Home for repairs==
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; then sailed along the French coast in an unsuccessful search for the commerce raider , then proceeded to the Caribbean before turning northward for Boston, Massachusetts, where she was decommissioned for repairs on 26 November. She was recommissioned four months later on 1 April 1865 and sailed for the coast of Spain on 14 April in an attempt to intercept . The Confederate ram eluded Federal warships and surrendered to Spanish authorities at Havana, Cuba on 19 May. After cruising the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel south to Monrovia, Liberia, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was decommissioned on 14 August 1866 in the Boston Navy Yard.

==Post-war service==

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was recommissioned on 16 January 1868 and sailed on 12 February to serve in the South Pacific, operating out of Valparaíso, Chile. On 22 August, she landed provisions for destitute earthquake victims in Peru. She continued to watch over American commercial interests along the coast of South America until 17 April 1869. Then she sailed to watch over American interests among the Marquesas, Society Islands, Navigators Islands, and Fiji Islands. She also called at ports in New South Wales and New Zealand before returning to Callao, Peru on 31 October. She resumed duties on the South Pacific Station until 21 July 1870, then cruised to the Hawaiian Islands before being decommissioned in the Mare Island Navy Yard on 11 October 1870.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was recommissioned on 8 December 1873 and departed on 4 March 1874 for Yokohama, Japan, arriving there on 11 May. She cruised on Asiatic Station for three years, protecting American citizens and commerce in China, Japan, and the Philippines. From 4 September to 13 December, she carried Professor Asaph Hall&#x27;s scientific party from Nagasaki, Japan, to Vladivostok, Russia, to observe the transit of Venus. She departed Nagasaki on 3 September 1877, and via the Suez Canal, she visited Mediterranean ports before returning to Boston on 30 December. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 15 January 1878.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was recommissioned on 15 May 1879 for four years of duty in the North Atlantic ranging from Newfoundland to the Caribbean Sea and the coast of Panama. The warship took part in dedication ceremonies for the Brooklyn Bridge on 24 May 1883. She departed New York on 21 August 1883 to cruise for three years in the Mediterranean, then Northern European waters, and finally along the west coast of Africa. She returned to Portsmouth on 12 November and was decommissioned in the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 1 December 1886.

==Wreck==


&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was recommissioned on 2 November 1888 and largely spent her remaining years protecting American interests in the West Indies, off Venezuela, and along the Central Americas. In October 1889 she carried famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass to Haiti, where Douglass was to be minister and consul general. On President Harrison&#x27;s orders, she sailed to Navassa Island in 1891 to investigate labor conditions there. She departed Haiti on 20 January 1894 for Bluefields, Nicaragua, but she wrecked on a reef off Roncador Cay on 2 February. Her officers and crew made it safely ashore.

Congress appropriated $45,000 to tow &quot;Kearsarge&quot; home, but a salvage team of the Boston Towboat Company found that she could not be refloated. Some artifacts were saved from the ship, including the ship&#x27;s Bible. The salvaged items, along with a damaged section of her stern post with an unexploded shell from CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; still embedded in it, are now stored or on display at the Washington Navy Yard. According to the US Naval Academy Museum, after the battle with &quot;Alabama&quot; the shell was removed and the stern post was replaced. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1894.

==Popular culture==
Liverpool writer Jimmy McGovern&#x27;s 2007 play, &quot;King Cotton&quot;, culminates with the battle between &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot;. It premiered at The Lowry.

Clive Cussler, an American adventure novelist and marine archaeologist, wrote the 2001 novel &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot;, in which &quot;Kearsarge&quot; is attacked by a submerged vessel and run aground, causing her wreck.

Harry Turtledove, American alternate history novelist, wrote the 1992 novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; in which time-traveling South African white nationalists successfully re-arm the Confederate States Army with AK-47 assault rifles in early 1864, thus enabling the Confederacy to rout Union forces in every land campaign of the year. When Washington is captured by the Army of Northern Virginia, Abraham Lincoln reluctantly concedes the Confederacy&#x27;s independence. The war is implied to end in mid-June, as USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; is mentioned as having been waiting for CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; to emerge from the French port city of Cherbourg when word of the war&#x27;s end reached Europe. In this alternate scenario, the USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; never met the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; in battle. Instead, each warship sailed for its home country.

<doc id="190297" wikidata="Q7754208" url="?curid=190297" title="The Nine Nations of North America">
<text>The Nine Nations of North America is a 1981 book by Joel Garreau, in which the author suggests that North America can be divided into nine nations, which have distinctive economic and cultural features. He also argues that conventional national and state borders are largely artificial and irrelevant, and that his &quot;nations&quot; provide a more accurate way of understanding the true nature of North American society. The work has been called &quot;a classic text on the current regionalization of North America&quot;.

==The nine nations==
*New England – an expanded version including not only Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut (although omitting the southwestern portion of Connecticut within the New York metropolitan area), but also the Canadian Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Capital: Boston.
*The Foundry – the by-then-declining industrial areas of the northeastern United States and Great Lakes region stretching from New York City to northeast Wisconsin and down to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., in Northern Virginia, and including Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Toledo, Philadelphia, and Southern Ontario. Capital: Detroit.
*Dixie – the former Confederate States of America (today the southeastern United States) centered on Atlanta, and including most of eastern Texas. While northern Virginia and Maryland are culturally not part of Dixie, he includes most of Virginia and West Virginia in &quot;Dixie&quot; as well as Kentucky; southern and southeastern portions of Missouri, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana; and the &quot;Little Dixie&quot; region of southeastern Oklahoma. Finally, the region also includes most of Florida, as far south as the cities of Fort Myers and Naples. Capital: Atlanta.
*The Breadbasket – most of the Great Plains states and part of the Prairie provinces: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, the Dakotas, almost all of Oklahoma, parts of Missouri, western Wisconsin, eastern Colorado, the eastern edge of New Mexico, central Illinois, a portion of Indiana, and North Texas. Also included are some of Northern Ontario and southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Capital: Kansas City.
*The Islands – The South Florida metropolitan area, the Everglades and Florida Keys, and the Caribbean. Capital: Miami.
*Mexamerica – the southern and Central Valley portions of California as well as southern Arizona, the portion of Texas bordering on the Rio Grande, most of New Mexico, northern Mexico, and the Baja California Peninsula. Capital: Los Angeles.
*Ecotopia – the Pacific Northwest coast west of the Cascade Range and the Coast Mountains, as well as several Alaskan Pacific Coast Ranges, stretching from Alaska down through coastal British Columbia, Washington state, Oregon, and into California just north of Santa Barbara. Capital: San Francisco.
*The Empty Quarter – most of Alaska, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and Colorado from Denver west, as well as the eastern portions of Oregon, California, Washington, all of Alberta and Northern Canada (including what is now Nunavut), northern Arizona, parts of New Mexico (mainly the area controlled by the Navajo Nation), and British Columbia east of the Coast Ranges. Its capital is Denver, close to the border with The Breadbasket.
*Quebec – the primarily French-speaking province of Canada, which held unsuccessful referendums on secession in 1980 and 1995. Capital: Quebec City.

Garreau also discussed several areas that he termed &quot;aberrations&quot;:
* Washington, D.C., and its surrounding area, specifically referring to the area &quot;inside the Beltway&quot;.
* Manhattan south of Harlem (he placed Harlem, and by extension the Manhattan neighborhoods to its north, clearly within The Foundry), along with Connecticut&#x27;s Fairfield County.
* Hawaii, which the author considered an Asian aberration as much as a North American aberration.
* Northern Alaska, despite its categorization on the front cover as part of the Empty Quarter, was listed in the aberrations section of the book.

Despite their presence within North America, Garreau did not assign the central and southern regions of the country of Mexico to any of his nine nations.

==Reception==
Paul Meartz of Mayville State University called &quot;The Nine Nations of North America&quot; &quot;a classic text on the current regionalization of North America&quot;. In &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Michael Matza wrote that &quot;it is Garreau&#x27;s affection for the easy observation -- the serviceable cliché -- that undercuts &quot;Nine Nations&quot;, a book that tells much that we already know in language that is entertaining and sometimes refreshing. It is, perhaps, more like Coca-Cola than Garreau lets on: effervescent, short of intoxicating.&quot;

<text>Ecotopia: The Notebooks and Reports of William Weston is a utopian novel by Ernest Callenbach, published in 1975. The society described in the book is one of the first ecological utopias and was influential on the counterculture and the green movement in the 1970s and thereafter. The author himself claimed that the society he depicted in the book is not a true utopia (in the sense of a perfect society), but, while guided by societal intentions and values, was &quot;im&quot;perfect and in-process.

Callenbach said of the story, in relation to Americans: &quot;It is so hard to imagine anything fundamentally different from what we have now. But without these alternate visions, we get stuck on dead center. And we’d better get ready. We need to know where we’d like to go.&quot;

==Context==
Callenbach wove his story using the fiber of technologies, lifestyles, folkways, and attitudes that were common in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. The &quot;leading edges&quot; (his main ideas for Ecotopian values and practices) were patterns in actual social experimentation taking place in the American West. To draw an example, Callenbach&#x27;s fictional Crick School was based on Pinel School, an alternative school located outside Martinez, California, and attended for a time by his son.

Callenbach placed the genesis of Ecotopia with an article he researched and wrote titled &quot;The Scandal of Our Sewage&quot;. Besides the important social dimensions of the story, he talked publicly about being influenced, during work on the novel, by many streams of thought: scientific discoveries in ecology and conservation biology; the urban-ecology movement, concerned with a new approach to urban planning; and the soft-energy movement, championed by Amory Lovins and others. Much of the environmentally benign energy, home building and transportation technology described by the author was based on his reading of research findings published in such journals as &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;.

Callenbach&#x27;s concept does not reject high technology (or &quot;any&quot; technology) as long as it does not interfere with the Ecotopian social order and serves the overall objectives. Members of his fictional society prefer to demonstrate a &quot;conscious selectivity&quot; toward technology, so that not only human health and sanity might be preserved, but also social and ecological wellbeing. For example, Callenbach&#x27;s story anticipated the development and liberal usage of videoconferencing.

During the 1970s when &quot;Ecotopia&quot; was written and published, many prominent counterculture and New Left thinkers decried the consumption and overabundance that they perceived as characteristic of post-World War II America. The citizens of Ecotopia share a common aim: a balance between themselves and nature. They were &quot;literally sick of bad air, chemicalized food, and lunatic advertising. They turned to politics because it was finally the only route to self-preservation.&quot; In the mid-20th century as &quot;firms grew in size and complexity citizens needed to know the market would still serve the interests of those for whom it claimed to exist&quot;. Callenbach&#x27;s &quot;Ecotopia&quot; targets the fact that many people did not feel that the market or the government were serving them in the way they wanted them to. This book could be interpreted as &quot;a protest against consumerism and materialism, among other aspects of American life.&quot;

The term &quot;ecotopian fiction&quot;, as a subgenre of science fiction and utopian fiction, makes implicit reference to this book.

==Plot summary==
The book is set in 1999 (25 years in the future from 1974) and consists of diary entries and reports of journalist William Weston, who is the first American mainstream media reporter to investigate Ecotopia, a small country that broke away from the United States in 1980 following an economic collapse. Prior to Weston&#x27;s reporting, most Americans had been barred from entering the new country, which is depicted as being on continual guard against revanchism. The new nation of Ecotopia consists of Northern California, Oregon, and Washington; it is hinted that Southern California is a lost cause, and was most likely destroyed. The novel takes its form as a narrative from Weston&#x27;s diary in combination with dispatches that he transmits to his publication, the fictional &quot;Times-Post&quot;.

At the beginning, Weston is skeptically curious about, not yet sympathetic to the Ecotopians. He describes details of the Ecotopian transportation system and the preferred lifestyle. This includes a wide range of gender roles, sexual freedom, and acceptance of non-monogamous relationships. Liberal cannabis use is evident. Televised passive, mass-media, spectator sports have been displaced in favor of local arts coverage, local participatory sports, and general fitness. A large fraction of young male Ecotopians participate voluntarily in a decidedly male ritual of mock warfare using wooden spears but no guns or arrows. The games are not re-enactments. Physical injuries, occasionally serious, are considered part of the game. Ecotopians on the whole value the benefits to young males over the accidental injuries. Ecotopia also tolerates the voluntary separatism of many people of African descent who have, in fact, chosen to live in a mini-nation in the San Francisco East Bay area in order to protect themselves from racism.

Ecotopian society has favored decentralized and renewable energy production and green building construction. The citizens are technologically creative, while remaining involved with and sensitive to nature. Thorough-going education reform is described, along with a highly localized system of universal medical care. (The narrator discovers that Ecotopian healing practices may include sexual stimulation.) The national defense strategy has focused on developing a highly advanced arms industry, while also allegedly maintaining hidden WMD within major US population centers to discourage conquest and annexation.

Through Weston&#x27;s diary we learn of observations he does not include in his columns, such as his personally transformative love affair with an Ecotopian woman. The book&#x27;s parallel narrative structures allow the reader to see how Weston&#x27;s internal reflections, as recorded in his diary, are diffracted in his external pronouncements to his readers. Despite Weston&#x27;s initial reservations, throughout the novel Ecotopian citizens are characterized as clever, technologically resourceful, emotionally expressive, and even occasionally violent – but also socially responsible, patriotic. They often live in extended families, and tend to live by choice in ethnically separated localities. Their economic enterprises are generally employee-owned and -controlled. The current governmental administration is that of a woman-led (but not exclusively female) party, and government structures are highly decentralized.

The novel concludes with Weston&#x27;s finding himself enchanted by Ecotopian life and deciding to stay in Ecotopia as its interpreter to the wider world.

==Values exemplified in the novel==
The values embodied by those Ecotopians depicted in the novel reflect the values espoused by its author. Callenbach said that his Ecotopians attach fundamental importance to environmental and social stability within which variety can flourish. They value creativity. They ensure equality for women. They implement the protection and restoration of natural systems. They promote food production in their cities.

As well, they treasure personal quality-of-life values, such as health and friendliness, and both meaningful discussion and play.

Callenbach began writing the novel by depicting the recycling of valuable materials and substances by the society; he saw a much-expanded role for recycling of all sorts, and this is key to many concepts underpinning Ecotopia.

==Anticipation of emerging realities==
Worth mentioning is Callenbach&#x27;s speculation on the roles of TV in his envisioned society. The author espoused the fly on the wall genre of direct political-process broadcasts, deeming them valuable to the citizenry. In some ways anticipating C-SPAN, which would first be broadcast in 1979, &quot;Ecotopia&quot; mentions that the daily life of the legislature and some of that of the judicial courts is televised in Ecotopia. Even highly technical debates are televised, addressing the needs and desires of Ecotopian viewers.

Another interesting detail in the story is &quot;print on demand&quot; (POD) publishing. Ecotopian customers could choose selected print media from a jukebox-like device that would then print and bind the book. In the 21st century, POD services that print, bind and ship books for customers who order on-line have become commonplace.

==Impact==
The importance of this book is not so much its literary style as in the lively imagination of an alternative and ecologically sound lifestyle on a greater scale, presented more or less realistically. It expressed on paper the dream of an alternative future held by many in the movements of the 1970s and later. Even the names of the two characters most reflective of their respective viewpoints—&quot;Will West(on)&quot;, the representative for materialist American culture and &quot;Vera Allwen&quot; (= &quot;All women + all men&quot;), the President and spokeswoman for Ecotopia—suggest the degree to which the author intended the book to be a reflection of what he saw as American ecological and cultural deficiencies.

However, in contrast to much of the Green movement in contemporary America, with its preference for regulation, Callenbach&#x27;s Ecotopia has relatively laissez-faire economic tendencies, guided by intense moral pressure toward sustainable practices both in private life and in business.

In 1981, Callenbach published &quot;Ecotopia Emerging&quot;, a multi-strand &quot;prequel&quot; suggesting how the sustainable nation of Ecotopia could have come into existence.

In 1990, Audio Renaissance released a partial dramatization of &quot;Ecotopia&quot; on audiocassettes in the form of recordings of a radio network broadcast (the &quot;Allied News Network&quot; replacing the &quot;Times-Post&quot;). The tape-recorded diaries of William Weston were read by the book&#x27;s author, Ernest Callenbach. Weston&#x27;s reports were read by veteran news reporter Edwin Newman.

In the online &quot;Earth Island Journal&quot;, &quot;Ecotopia&quot; was reviewed by Brian Smith, identifying himself as a child not of the 1960s but the 1980s. He read the novel 30 years after it was first published, and said of it: &quot;I felt great affinity for the details of the world Callenbach predicted. Even better, I was impressed by how many of his ideas came to pass.&quot; influenced the identity of the West Coast in an interesting way and influenced the rise of bioregionalism and started the desire for West Coast unity in the form of Cascadia.

&quot;Ecotopia&quot; is now required reading in a number of colleges.

==Reception==
Don Milligan in the British magazine &quot;Peace News&quot; gave &quot;Ecotopia&quot; a negative review, stating &quot;&quot;Ecotopia&quot; is a shoddy amalgam of Swedish social democracy, Swiss neutrality, and Yugoslav workers&#x27; co-ops cobbled together with the authoritarianism of &quot;A Blueprint for Survival&quot;...&quot;Ecotopia&quot; is a flawed vision of a flawed future.&quot;

In marked contrast, Ralph Nader praised the book, noting that &quot;None of the happy conditions in Ecotopia are beyond the technical or resource reach of our society.&quot;

According to Scott Timberg, quoting University of Nevada environmental-literature professor Scott Slovic in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Ecotopia&#x27; [the concept] became almost immediately absorbed into the popular culture. You hear people talking about the idea of Ecotopia, or about the Northwest as Ecotopia.&quot;

In &quot;bolo’bolo&quot;, P.M. criticizes Callenbach by saying:

<text>The Bad Examples is an indie alternative pop-rock group formed by songwriter, acoustic guitarist, and vocalist Ralph Covert in 1987 in Chicago, Illinois. The band has had significant changes in the line-up over the years but the core of the group (Covert, electric guitarist Tom O&#x27;Brien, bassist Tom &quot;Pickles&quot; Piekarski) have worked consistently together since 1990 with electric guitarist Steve Gerlach (ex-Phantom Helmsmen) joining in 1994 and still performing live and occasionally serving as co-producer. Founding drummer Terry Wathen was still making live appearances as late as 2008 but is now officially drummer emeritus with Larry Beers (ex-Way Moves, Charming Beggars) now an official member. Interim drummers included John Richardson, Ron Barnes, David Thornton and currently Bean Weng.

The Bad Examples are limited in performing and putting out new albums largely due to Ralph Covert&#x27;s success as creator of the family music rock band, Ralph&#x27;s World. Musically it is similar to The Bad Examples but the lyrics and themes are oriented towards young children, approximately ages 2 to 7. The sixth Ralph&#x27;s World album, &quot;Green Gorilla, Monster &amp; Me&quot; was nominated for a Grammy award as &quot;Best Musical Album For Children.&quot; Ralph&#x27;s World was originally signed to &quot;Mini Fresh&quot;, a division of the &quot;Minty Fresh&quot; label, and subsequently signed to &quot;Disney Sound&quot; for a hits compilation, several videos, and one all-new project along with the re-release of the previous six albums. The most recent Ralph&#x27;s World album is on BarNone Records.

Lead guitarist of the Bad Examples, John Duich, who was on their most successful album, &quot;Bad Is Beautiful&quot;, and the band&#x27;s most extensive US tours but left in 1994 to return to Chicago&#x27;s blues scene, died of heart failure in 1998.

Aside from one 12&quot; single and some isolated benefit tracks, The Bad Examples have released all their music on Waterdog Records, a label now exclusively owned by Ralph Covert. While the original releases are credited solely to The Bad Examples, beginning with the Two-Meter Sessions billing is to Ralph Covert &amp; The Bad Examples both to help include his solo work (which also features players from the band) and to differentiate them internationally from a German band with the same name.

While &quot;MEAT:&quot; was originally released on cassette in 1987, Bad Is Beautiful was their first compact disc, in 1991. It features the song &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot; which received extensive commercial airplay on Chicago radio stations WXRT and WLUP and remains an active part of the former&#x27;s library. Styx also covered &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot; on their 1990 release &quot;Edge of the Century&quot; and performed the song in concert for that album&#x27;s tour. The song is also featured in an episode of season three of Six Feet Under (&quot;The Trap&quot;) and has been arranged by Tom Wallace for marching band. The Bad Examples had three chart singles in the Netherlands in 1991 and toured there several times.

The band&#x27;s newest album, &quot;Smash Record&quot;, was released on January 11, 2011.

Bassist Tom &quot;Pickles&quot; Piekarski died of a heart attack in August 2013. Ralph&#x27;s World bass player Brian Sheridan currently plays bass for The Bad Examples.

<text>Christian Identity (also known as Identity Christianity) is an interpretation of Christianity which advocates the belief that only Celtic and Germanic peoples, such as the Anglo-Saxon, Nordic nations, or the Aryan race and kindred peoples, are the descendants of the ancient Israelites and are therefore God&#x27;s &quot;chosen people&quot;. It is a racial interpretation of Christianity and is not an organized religion, nor is it affiliated with specific Christian denominations. It emerged from British Israelism in the 1920s and developed during the 1940s–1970s. Today it is practiced by independent individuals, independent congregations, and some prison gangs.

No single document expresses the Christian Identity belief system, and some beliefs may vary by group. However, all Identity adherents believe that Adam and his offspring were exclusively White. They also believe in Two House theology, which makes a distinction between the Tribe of Judah and the Ten Lost Tribes, and that ultimately, European people represent the Ten Lost Tribes. This racialist view advocates racial segregation and opposes interracial marriage. Other commonly held beliefs are that usury and banking systems are controlled by Jews, leading to opposition to the Federal Reserve System and use of fiat currency, believing it to be part of &quot;the beast&quot; system. Christian Identity&#x27;s eschatology is millennialist.

Christian Identity is characterized as racist, antisemitic, and white supremacist by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.

, estimates of the number of adherents in the United States range from two thousand to fifty thousand.

==Origins==

===Relationship to British Israelism===

The Christian Identity movement emerged in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of British Israelism. While early British Israelites such as Edward Hine and John Wilson were philo-Semites, Christian Identity emerged in sharp contrast to British Israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology. British Israelism originally viewed modern Jews as descendants of the ancient Israelites; but in the United States, British Israelism began to evolve as anti-Semitism began to permeate the movement. Traditional British Israelites were advocates of philo-Semitism which paradoxically changed to anti-Semitism and racism under Christian Identity. In fact, British Israelism had several Jewish adherents, and it also received support from rabbis throughout the 19th century. Within British politics it supported Benjamin Disraeli, who was descended from Sephardic Jews. The typical form of the British Israelite belief held that modern-day Jews were only descended from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, while the British and other related Northern European peoples were descended from the other ten tribes. However, as Christian Identity took shape during the 1940s to 1970s, it began to turn antisemitic by teaching that contemporary Jews were either descendants of Eurasian Khazars or literal descendants of Satan.
===Early influences===
British Israelism can be traced back to Great Britain in the 1600s, but in terms of its relationship to Christian Identity, a key text was &quot;Lectures on Our Israelitish Origin&quot; by John Wilson (1840). Wilson was the first to formalize a distinction between the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel. Although Wilson&#x27;s views were not originally antisemitic, they came to have great significance for modern Christian Identity adherents who believe that the northern tribes were carried off by the Assyrians and remained racially pure as they migrated into modern Europe, while the southern kingdom eventually became allied with Satan.

In the 1920s, the writings of Howard Rand (1889–1991) began to have an influence. Considered a transitional figure from British Israelism to Christian Identity rather than its actual founder, Rand is known for coining the term &quot;Christian Identity&quot;. Raised as a British Israelite, his father introduced him to J. H. Allen&#x27;s work &quot;Judah&#x27;s Sceptre and Joseph&#x27;s Birthright&quot; (1902) at an early age by offering him five dollars if he would read it and write a report on it. Around 1924, Rand began to claim that the Jews are descended from Esau or the Canaanites rather than the tribe of Judah, although not going so far as to advocate the &quot;serpent seed&quot; doctrine.

During the late 1920s, Anglo-Saxon writers began to compile research from 19th century writers Dominick McCausland, Alexander Winchell, and Ethel Bristowe, using them to develop five basic beliefs that would become the core tenets of Christian Identity doctrine. These were that Adamites represented Aryans as the chosen, that nonwhites were tainted through race-mixing, that the serpent in the story of the Fall was not a reptile, but the Devil himself, that the seedline of Cain came through a union of Satan (the serpent) and Eve, and that the Jews were descended from this unholy line and thus had a natural propensity for evil.

In 1933, Rand founded the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America, an organization which began to promote the view that the Jews are not descended from Judah. Beginning in May 1937, there were key meetings of British Israelites in the United States who were attracted to this theory, and these meetings provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of Christian Identity. By the late 1930s, the group&#x27;s members considered Jews to be the offspring of Satan and demonized them, and they also demonized non-Caucasian races. Rand, however, rejected the satanic origin theories. This doctrine came to confirm the explicit separation between British-Israelism and Christian Identity.

Links between Christian Identity and the Ku Klux Klan were also forged in the late 1930s, but by then, the KKK was past the peak of its early twentieth-century revival.

===Emergence as a separate movement===
Christian Identity began to emerge as a separate movement in the 1940s, primarily over issues of racism and anti-semitism rather than over issues of Christian theology. Wesley Swift (1913–1970) is considered the father of the movement; so much so that every Anti-Defamation League publication which addresses Christian Identity mentions him. Swift was a minister in the Angelus Temple Foursquare Church during the 1930s and 1940s before he founded his own church in Lancaster, California and named it the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation, reflecting the influence of Howard Rand. In the 1950s, he was Gerald L. K. Smith&#x27;s West Coast representative of the Christian Nationalist Crusade. In addition, he hosted a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s, through which he was able to proclaim his ideology to a large audience. Due to Swift&#x27;s efforts, the message of his church spread, leading to the founding of similar churches throughout the country.

Eventually, the name of his church was changed to the Church of Jesus Christ–Christian, today this name is used by Aryan Nations. One of Swift&#x27;s associates was retired Col. William Potter Gale (1917–1988). Gale became a leading figure in the anti-tax and paramilitary movements of the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the California Rangers and the Posse Comitatus, and he also helped found the American militia movement.

The future Aryan Nations founder Richard Girnt Butler, who was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, was introduced to Wesley Swift by William Potter Gale in 1962. Swift quickly converted Butler to Christian Identity. When Swift died in 1971, Butler fought against Gale, James Warner, and Swift&#x27;s widow for control of the church. Butler eventually gained control of the organization and moved it from California to Hayden Lake, Idaho in 1973.

Lesser figures participated as Christian Identity theology took shape in the 1940s and 1950s, such as San Jacinto Capt, a Baptist minister and California Klansman, who claimed that he had introduced Wesley Swift to Christian Identity; and Bertrand Comparet (1901–1983), a one-time San Diego Deputy City Attorney and associate of Gerald L. K. Smith. Later Identity figures of the 1970s and 1980s include Sheldon Emry, Thomas Robb, and Peter J. Peters.

The Christian Identity movement first received widespread attention from the mainstream media in 1984, when The Order, a neo-Nazi terrorist group, embarked on a murderous crime spree before it was suppressed by the FBI. The movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the deadly Ruby Ridge confrontation, when newspapers discovered that right-wing separatist Randy Weaver had a loose association with Christian Identity believers.

These groups are estimated to have two thousand members in the United States and an unknown number of members in Canada and the rest of the British Commonwealth. Due to the promotion of Christian Identity doctrines through radio and later through the Internet, an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold Christian Identity beliefs.

While most of the Identity groups of the 1960s and 1970s relied on mailing lists, publications, and cassette recordings to disseminate their teachings, later figures promoted their ministries using radio and television. Today, Christian Identity is promoted through the internet by using blogs, podcasts, and other means. The most prominent teacher today is William Finck.

==Beliefs==
Christian Identity is a theology that promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Some Christian Identity churches preach with more violent rhetoric than others, but all of them believe that Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Scandinavian, and other European peoples are the true Israelites and that modern Jews have dispossessed them of their identity as God&#x27;s chosen race. Identity beliefs are conspiratorial, believing that all of history represents a great cosmic war between the forces of good and evil. It is all part of a Satanic plot to take control of creation.

Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered Europeans to be the chosen people and considered Jews to be the cursed offspring of Cain, the serpent seed, a belief which is known as the dual-seedline or two-seedline doctrine. Wesley Swift formulated the doctrine which states that non-Caucasian peoples have no souls and therefore they can never earn God&#x27;s favor or be saved.

No single document expresses the Christian Identity belief system; there is much disagreement over the doctrines which are taught by those who ascribe to Identity beliefs, since there is no central organization or headquarters for the Identity sect. However, all Identity adherents believe that Adam and his offspring were exclusively White and they also believe that all non-white races are pre-Adamite races because they belong to separate species, a doctrinal position which implies that they cannot be equated with or derived from the Adamites. Identity adherents cite passages from the Old Testament, including , , and , which they claim contain Yahweh&#x27;s injunctions against interracial marriages.

Christian Identity adherents assert that the white people of Europe in particular or Caucasians in general are God&#x27;s servant people, according to the promises that were given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It further asserts that the early European tribes were really the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and therefore the rightful heirs to God&#x27;s promises, and God&#x27;s chosen people. Colin Kidd wrote that in the United States, Christian Identity exploited &quot;the puzzle of the Ten Lost Tribes to justify an openly anti-Semitic and virulently racist agenda.&quot; According to Michael McFarland and Glenn Gottfried, they developed their racist interpretation of Christianity because of its status as a traditional religion of the United States, which allowed them to advocate the belief that white Americans have a common identity, and because of the variety of possible interpretations of the Bible in the field of hermeneutics.

While they seek to introduce a state of racial purity in the US, Christian Identitarians do not trust the Congress or the government, allegedly controlled by Jews, to support their agenda. In their view, this means that political changes can only be made through the use of force. However, the failed experience of the terrorist group The Order has forced them to acknowledge the fact that they are currently unable to overthrow the government by staging an armed insurrection against it. Thus, the Christian Identity movement seeks an alternative to violence and government change with the creation of a &quot;White Aryan Bastion&quot; or a White ethnostate, such as the Northwest Territorial Imperative.

===Adamites and pre-Adamites===
Much of the racism in Christian Identity is the result of the pre-Adamite hypothesis, which is a cornerstone of Identity theology. Christian Identity adherents believe that Adam and Eve were only the ancestors of white people. In this view, Adam and Eve were preceded by lesser, non-Caucasian races which are often (although not always) identified as &quot;beasts of the field&quot; (, ) who took human form as a result of mating with Adamites.

To support their theory on the racial identity of Adam, Christian Identity proponents point out that the Hebrew etymology of the word &#x27;Adam&#x27; translates as &#x27;be ruddy, red, to show blood (in the face)&#x27; often quoting from James Strong&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew Dictionary&quot; and from this they conclude that only Caucasians or people with light white skin can blush or turn rosy in the face (because hemoglobin is only visible under pale skin).

An influence on the Christian Identity movement&#x27;s views on pre-Adamism was Charles Carroll&#x27;s 1900 book &quot;The Negro a Beast or In the Image of God?&quot; In his book, Carroll sought to revive the ideas which were previously presented by Buckner H. Payne, he described the Negro as a literal ape rather than a human being. He claimed the pre-Adamite races such as blacks did not have souls and that race mixing was an insult to God because it spoiled his racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of atheism and evolutionism.

===Serpent seed===
Dual Seedline Christian Identity proponents –those who believe that Eve bore children with Satan as well as with Adam – believe that Eve was seduced by the Serpent (Satan), shared her fallen state with Adam by having sex with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: Satan&#x27;s son Cain and Adam&#x27;s son Abel. This belief is referred to as the serpent seed doctrine. According to the &quot;dual seedline&quot; form of Christian Identity, Cain then became the progenitor of the Jews in his subsequent matings with members of the non-Adamic races.

===Scientific racism===
Scientific racism, sometimes termed biological racism or racialism, the pseudoscientific belief that empirical evidence exists to support or justify racism, is the core tenet of Christian Identity, and most CI adherents are white nationalists who advocate racial segregation and the imposition of anti-miscegenation laws. Some CI adherents also believe that Jews are genetically compelled to carry on a conspiracy against the Adamic seedline by their Satanic or Edomite ancestry and they also believe that the Jews of today have achieved almost complete control of the Earth through their claim to hold the white race&#x27;s status as God&#x27;s chosen people.

Identity adherents also assert that disease, addiction, cancer, and sexually transmitted infections (herpes and HIV/AIDS) are spread by human &quot;rodents&quot; via contact with &quot;unclean&quot; persons, such as &quot;race-mixers&quot;. The apocrypha, particularly the first book of Enoch, is used to justify these social theories; the fallen angels of Heaven sexually desired Earth maidens and took them as wives, resulting in the birth of abominations, which God ordered Michael the Archangel to destroy, thus beginning a cosmic war between Light and Darkness. The mixing of separate things (e.g., people of different races) is seen as defiling all of them, and it is also considered a violation of God&#x27;s law.

=== Two House theology ===
Like British Israelites, Christian Identity adherents believe in Two House theology, which makes a distinction between the Tribe of Judah and the Ten Lost Tribes. &quot;Israel&quot; was the name given to Jacob after he wrestled with the angel at Penuel as described in Genesis 32:26–32. Israel then had twelve sons which began the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Around 931 BC the unified kingdom was split into the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. After northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered by Assyria at , the ten tribes disappeared from the Biblical record.

According to British-Israel doctrine, 2 Esdras 13:39–46 then records the history of the nation of Israel journeying over the Caucasus Mountains, along the Black Sea, to the Ar Sereth tributary of the Danube in Romania (&quot;But they formed this plan for themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the nations and go to a more distant region, where no human beings had ever lived. ... Through that region there was a long way to go, a journey of a year and a half; and that country is called Arzareth&quot;). The tribes prospered, and eventually colonised other European countries. Israel&#x27;s leading tribe, the Tribe of Dan, is attributed with settling and naming many areas which are today distinguished by place names derived from its name – written ancient Hebrew contains no vowels, and hence &quot;Dan&quot; would be written as DN, but would be pronounced with an intermediate vowel dependent on the local dialect, meaning that &quot;Dan&quot;, &quot;Den&quot;, &quot;Din&quot;, &quot;Don&quot;, and &quot;Dun&quot; all have the same meaning. Various modern place names are said to derive from the name of this tribe:
* Macedonia – Mace&quot;don&quot;ia – derived from Moeshe-don-ia (Moeshe being &quot;the land of Moses&quot;)
* Danube – &quot;Dan&quot;-ube, Dniester – &quot;Dn&quot;-, Dnieper – &quot;Dn&quot;-ieper, Donetz – &quot;Don&quot;-etz, Danzig – &quot;Dan&quot;-zig, Don – &quot;Don&quot;

The following peoples and their analogous tribes are believed to be as follows:

While British Israelites believe that modern Jews are descended from the tribe of Judah, Christian Identitarians believe that the true lineal descendants of Judah are &quot;not&quot; contemporary Jews, but are instead the modern-day Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Germanic, Nordic, and kindred peoples.

Some followers claim that the Identity genealogy of the Davidic line can be traced to the royal rulers of Britain and Queen Elizabeth II. Thus, Anglo-Saxons are the true Israelites, God&#x27;s chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the Second Coming of Christ.

Identity adherents reject the label &quot;antisemitic&quot; by stating that they cannot be antisemitic because the true Semites &quot;today are the great White Christian nations of the western world&quot;, with modern Jews being considered the descendants of the Canaanites.

===Views on homosexuality===

Identity preachers proclaim that, according to the Bible, &quot;the penalties for race-mixing, homo-sexuality, and usury are death.&quot;

===Views on racial politics and economics===
The first documents which advocated Christian Identity&#x27;s views on racial politics and economics were written by Howard Rand and William J. Cameron after the Great Depression. In 1943, Rand published the article &quot;Digest of the Divine Law&quot; which discussed the political and economic challenges which existed at that time. An excerpt from the article states: &quot;We shall not be able to continue in accord with the old order. Certain groups are already planning an economy of regimentation for our nation; but it will only intensify the suffering and want of the past and bring to our peoples all the evils that will result from such planning by a group of men who are failing to take into consideration the fundamental principles underlying the law of the Lord.&quot;

While Rand never formally named the groups which he was specifically referring to, his hatred of Jews, racial integration, and the country&#x27;s economic state at that time made the direction of his comments obvious. Identifying specific economic problems was not the only goal which Rand had in mind. He began to analyze how these changes could be made to happen through legal changes; thus, making strategic plans to integrate the Bible into American law and economics. The first goal was to denounce all man-made laws and replace them with laws from the Bible. The second goal was to create an economic state which would reflect the teachings of the Bible.

While William Cameron agreed with Rand&#x27;s initial argument, he specifically focused his writings on changing American economics. One of Cameron&#x27;s articles, &quot;Divine System of Taxation&quot;, spoke of the Bible supporting individualism and social justice with regard to economics. He also believed that the government had no right to tax land or other forms of property. In accordance with this doctrine, tax refunds should be applied to family vacation trips or they should be applied to national festivals which are observed by adherents of Christian Identity. Also, for the betterment of the United States&#x27; economic future, no interest should be charged on debts which are paid with credit, and no taxes should be collected during the traveling time of goods from a manufacturer to a consumer.

The mutual point which Rand and Cameron both agreed upon, was that while they may have disagreed with how the government was operating, neither of them resisted the government&#x27;s current tax policies. Gordon Kahl was the first CI believer to study the founding principles of Rand and Cameron, and apply them in order to take action against the government. Kahl believed that they were on the right track with regard to what needed to be accomplished in order to change public policies. However, he felt that if no actions were taken against violators, no real changes would be made. In 1967, he stopped paying taxes because he felt he was paying &quot;tithes to the Synagogue of Satan&quot;. Kahl killed two federal marshals in 1983. Before he was caught for the murders, Kahl wrote a note in which he said &quot;our nation has fallen into the hands of alien people. ... These enemies of Christ have taken their Jewish Communist Manifesto and incorporated it into the Statutory Laws of our country and thrown our Constitution and our Christian Common Law into the garbage can.&quot;

===Opposition to the banking system===

Identity doctrine asserts that the &quot;root of all evil&quot; is paper money (particularly Federal Reserve Notes), and that both usury and banking systems are controlled by Jews. Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:35–37 and Deuteronomy explicitly condemn usury. Ezekiel 18:13 states &quot;He who hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him&quot; and it is quoted as a justification for killing Jews.

Christian Identity advocates the belief that the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 shifted the control of money from Congress to private institutions and violated the Constitution and the monetary system encourages the Federal Reserve to take out loans, creating trillions of dollars in government debt, and allowing international bankers to control the United States. Credit/debit cards and computerised bills are seen as the fulfillment of the Biblical scripture which warns against &quot;the beast&quot; (i.e., banking) as quoted in Revelation 13:15–18.

Identity preacher Sheldon Emry stated that &quot;Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern European (Jewish) ancestry and connected with the (Jewish) Rothschild European banks&quot;, thus, according to Identity doctrine, the global banking conspiracy is led and controlled by Jewish interests. Emry used the radio airwaves to promote his Christian Identity message and his book &quot;Billions for the Bankers, Debts for the People&quot;. Emry promoted abolishing the banks, which he suggested would solve most of society&#x27;s ills, including unemployment, divorce, and women working outside the home.

===Eschatology===

Christian Identity eschatology is dispensational premillennialist, including a physical return of Christ to earth and the final battle of Armageddon. However, in contrast with dispensationalism and some other millennialist forms of fundamentalist Christianity, Christian Identity adherents reject the notion of a rapture. Their predictions vary, and some include a race war or a Jewish-backed United Nations takeover of the US, and that they should wage a physical struggle against individuals and groups which serve the forces of evil. While the Soviet Union has disappeared as a vital threat in their rhetoric, many Christian Identity adherents believe that Communists are secretly involved in international organizations like the United Nations, or the so-called &quot;New World Order&quot;, in order to destroy the United States.

Along with teaching that America is the true Israel, some Identity preachers teach that America is the Zion of Bible prophecy and will be the seat of Christ&#x27;s earthly, millennial kingdom.

Modern Identity proponents such as Mark Downey and William Finck teach a historicist view of eschatology.

== Organizations ==
Rather than being an organized religion, Christian Identity is diverse and decentralized. It is an ideology which is adhered to by a variety of groups. Some of these groups are churches and congregations, such as the Church of Jesus Christ–Christian, Church of Israel, LaPorte Church of Christ, Elohim City, Kingdom Identity Ministries, and The Shepherd&#x27;s Chapel. Others are activist groups and paramilitary organizations such as Aryan Nations, Aryan Republican Army, Assembly of Christian Soldiers, Christian Defense League, The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, and White Patriot Party. Other organizations that are not strictly Identity based, but have members who believe in Identity or have affiliations with believers in Identity are the Aryan Freedom Network and the Posse Comitatus. Members of the prison gang Aryan Brotherhood adhere to Identity, but it prioritizes criminal enterprise over ideology. 

== Revolutionary violence ==
While most Identitarians have lived within the dominant culture, some Christian Identity groups on the fringe of the movement have been associated with revolutionary violence. According to the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism, &quot;Christian Identity has developed a deep accelerationist current as a result of an active desire among CI adherents to expedite the Battle of Armageddon.&quot;

James Mason, the inspirational leader of the neo-Nazi accelerationist &quot;siege culture&quot;, is a Christian Identity minister. Mason is considered to be an advisor to the Atomwaffen Division, an international far-right and neo-Nazi terrorist network responsible for at least 8 murders.

Tax resister and militia movement organizer Gordon Kahl had connections to the Christian Identity movement. His death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities inspired the founders of The Order. The Order, whose main objective was to start a white supremacist revolution against the United States, was almost entirely made up of individuals who were associated with various Christian Identity groups.

Robert Millar&#x27;s Elohim City, a white separatist community in Oklahoma which is associated with Christian Identity, is also associated with several violent acts. Chevie Kehoe spent time there following the Mueller family murders. Timothy McVeigh called the compound prior to the Oklahoma City bombing and he is linked to community resident Andreas Strassmeir. Richard Wayne Snell is buried there. Midwest Bank bandit Kevin McCarthy was a resident.

The Ozarks-based compound of The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord was the site of an FBI raid, which ultimately ended without shots fired as the result of CSA member Kerry Noble negotiating a surrender by CSA leader James Ellison.

Within Christian Identity circles, the Phineas Priesthood is made up of individuals who have committed a &quot;Phineas action&quot;; a term which is broadly used in reference to murders of interracial couples, murders of same-sex couples, antisemitic acts, and violent acts against members of other non-white ethnic groups. According to Houston-area writer John Craig, mass shooter Larry Gene Ashbrook had ties to the Phineas Priesthood. Byron De La Beckwith, the assassin of NAACP and Civil rights movement leader Medgar Evers, was also linked to the Phineas Priesthood. Immediately prior to entering prison, De La Beckwith was ordained as a minister in the Temple Memorial Baptist Church, a Christian Identity congregation in Knoxville, Tennessee by Reverend Dewey &quot;Buddy&quot; Tucker.

<text>Synthetic Socks is a very early recording by Gene Ween, released on TeenBeat Records in 1987. It is almost entirely the product of Gene Ween making personal recordings in his bedroom (Dean Ween appears only a few times on this cassette).
The cover of the album is a close up of a child (possibly Gene himself) holding a frog. Alternate versions of the cover crop the image so only the frog and the child&#x27;s hand can be seen

Instruments include Synsonic Drums, Korg Poly-800, piano, and reel-to-reel. Scott Lowe assisted in post production using delay and additional keyboards.

Long time friend of Gene Ween, Scott Lowe, assisted in production of the album, adding effects to some of the songs.

Credited as Synthetic Sox (not &quot;Socks&quot; as in the album title), three of the TeenBeat tracks; Tree, Sea of Mellichis and Investigating Tornadoes, were released on vinyl as part of Shadow Mouth: Compilation One, released on the Shadow Mouth Record label based in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

&quot;Synthetic Socks&quot; features a very embryonic version of Ween&#x27;s trademark sound.

<doc id="190383" wikidata="Q368806" url="?curid=190383" title="Jean Talon">
<text>Jean Talon, Count d&#x27;Orsainville (; January 8, 1626 – November 23, 1694) was a French colonial administrator who served as the first Intendant of New France. Talon was appointed by King Louis XIV and his minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, to serve as the Intendant of Justice, Public Order and Finances in Canada, Acadia and Newfoundland for two terms: 1665 to 1668 and 1670 to 1672.

Talon attempted to change the economic base of the colony from fur trading to agriculture, but found this could not be accomplished without a larger population. Talon arranged for settlers to come to New France, including over 800 women known as the King&#x27;s Daughters. These were young orphans that came to New France to marry men present there. He encouraged population growth through marriage grants and baby bonuses, which were financial compensation given to a couple when they married, and again when they had children.

Talon tried to diversify the economy of New France by introducing new crops such as flax and hops for making beer, by starting a shipyard and lumber industry, and by encouraging mining. He started the first commercial brewery in Canada, &quot;La Brasserie du Roy&quot;, in Québec City in 1668. Talon also worked to increase the population, the agricultural production, and the private sector of the burgeoning colony.

==Weak and destitute New France==

Prior to Jean Talon&#x27;s arrival to the French colony in 1665, the colony, founded by Samuel de Champlain and situated along St. Lawrence River, was in a state of weakness and destitution despite its existence for more than half a century. Its failure in progress had been due to several key factors, including poor governance of the colony by trading companies, forgetfulness on the part of France, and the horrors caused by the wars between the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat clans.

The progress of the colony had been stifled by trading companies, because the companies valued money and profit rather than the survival of the colony, which did not really matter because most of the residents were coureurs des bois and could fend for themselves. 

The French minister in charge of New France&#x27;s affairs back in France was Cardinal Richelieu. At first he was involved in improving the colony&#x27;s situation through attempts to increase the population of the colony, but he had been unsuccessful. Later on, his attention shifted to European politics, and New France&#x27;s affairs were left ignored.

For 25 years, the colonists had been living with the effects of engaging in a violent war against the native inhabitants of the land, the Iroquois. In New France, no adequate military force existed to battle the Haudenosaunee. Other situations added to the degrading of the colony, included internal strife among the leaders in New France over questions of liquor traffic, lack of immigration from France, dying fur trade, and poor agriculture. The colonists of New France, the governor and the bishop petitioned to France for assistance.

==Early life==

Jean Talon was born in Châlons-en-Champagne to Philippe Talon and Anne Marie de Bury, where he was baptized on January 8, 1626. His family was related to the Parisian Talons, who held in succession the high office of attorney-general of France. After studying at the Jesuits&#x27; College of Clermont, Talon was employed in a commissariat. His abilities soon became apparent, and when he was 30, he was promoted to the position of Intendant for New France. When an Intendant was needed for the task of bringing the dying New France back to life, Colbert, an administrator of France, thought immediately of Talon and recommended him to the king. Talon&#x27;s commission is dated March 23, 1665.

==Rescue of New France==
Louis and his minister decided in 1663 to give New France a new constitution. The charter of the Company of One Hundred Associates was cancelled and the old Council of Quebec, which was formed in 1647, reorganized and became the Sovereign Council. The Sovereign Council was composed of the governor, the bishop, the intendant, an attorney-general, a secretary, and five councilors. Its functions included general jurisdiction for the administration of justice in civil and criminal matters, and the questions of police, roads, finance, and trade.

In 1665, the King sent the Carignan-Salières Regiment, a new governor, a new intendant, settlers and labourers, and supplies to New France. The Lieutenant Général of the Americas, Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy, was dispatched to deal with the threat of the Iroquois. On September 12, 1665, the ship &quot;Saint Sebastien&quot; arrived in New France with Daniel de Rémy de Courcelle, the governor, and Jean Talon, the intendant of justice, police and finance.

A long letter of instructions was drafted by Colbert to guide Jean Talon in his mission to New France. The instructions dealt with mutual relations of Church and State, discussed the question of assistance to the recently created West India Company, and contemplated the war against the Iroquois and how it could be carried out successfully. Other instructions included the following: the establishment of the Sovereign Council and the administration of justice; the settlement of the colony and the advisability of concentrating the population; the importance of fostering trade and industry; the question of tithes for the maintenance of the Church; the establishment of shipbuilding yards; and the encouragement of agriculture.

==Promoting colonization, agriculture, shipbuilding and commerce==

It was up to Tracy and Courcelle to protect the colony from Iroquois attacks. Once Talon arrived in New France, his first task was to organize transportation of provisions, ammunition, tool, and supplies for the maintenance of the troops and to take care of incoming soldiers and laborers, making sure that those who contracted disease, received proper nursing and medical attention.

Tracy had led a successful attack against the Iroquois and won peace for the colony, restoring order and harmony. He left Canada on August 28, 1667; Courcelle remained as governor and Talon remained as the Intendant.

Now that peace was restored, Talon could carry out his works of colonization. In 1665, he had taken back the land granted to the Jesuits to establish about forty dwellings in preparation for new settlers, who would arrive the following year. These dwellings were to be grouped in three adjacent villages named Bourg-Royal, Bourg-la-Reine, and Bourg-Talon.

One of the most important historical documents of this period was carried out by Talon. A general census of New France was taken during the winter of 1666–67 to gather information about the colony. This the first Canadian census of which we have any record. It did not include the king&#x27;s troops, which formed a body of 1200 men.

Talon was highly organized in his establishment of settlements. New villages were established as close as possible to the capital and the settlers were grouped around a central point to encourage mutual help and defense. Proper dwellings were made ready to receive the newcomers. Talon proceeded to fill these dwellings with settlers, trying to have some skilled artisans, such as carpenters, shoemakers, and masons in each village.

Talon&#x27;s colonization policy was to give grants of settlements to soldiers and habitants. They took possession of the land and received an ample supply of food and tools required. They would receive payment in clearing and tilling the first two acres. In return, they had to clear and prepare another two acres in three or four years so that the two acres could be given to the next round of incoming settlers.

Under Talon&#x27;s successful colonization policy, the settlement of the country progressed rapidly. A census taken in 1668 gave very satisfactory figures. While in 1667 there had been under cultivation, in 1668 were now under cultivation, and wheat production amounted to 130,978 bushels.

Talon&#x27;s activity showed great zeal for the public good. In terms of promoting agriculture, he erected a brewery near the St. Charles River in 1668 to support cultivation of wheat. Furthermore, hemp was highly needed in the colony for making coarse cloth. To promote the production of hemp, he created a monopoly of thread. He seized all the thread on the shops, and gave notice that to acquire thread, they had to exchange it with hemp.

Talon promoted commerce through his introduction of the shipbuilding industry. Through encouragement of shipbuilding, he had in mind the extension of the colony&#x27;s trade with the West Indies and France. He also encouraged the development of the fishing industry along St.Lawrence River.

To further encourage the growth of the colony, Talon established various policies to promote marriage and bearing of children. To young women who married, the intendant gave 50 livres in household supplies and some provisions. According to the king&#x27;s decree, each youth who married at or before the age of twenty was entitled to 20 livres, called &quot;the king’s gift.&quot; During the years 1665–68, 6000 livres were used to support the marriage of young gentlewomen without means, and another 6000 livres for settlement and marriage of four captains, three lieutenants, five ensigns and a few minor officers. Furthermore, families having ten children in their household were entitled to a pension of three hundred livres annually and four hundred livres were given to family with twelve children.

To balance the number of men and women living in the colony and to promote further marriage, girls were carefully selected from France to be taken to Canada. Some of them were orphans, who grew up under the king&#x27;s protection in charitable institutions. They were known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Daughters&quot;. The rest of the girls belonged to honest families, whose parents were willing to send them to a new country where they would be well provided for. When these young women arrived in Canada, they immediately married or were placed for a time in good families.

Strenuous efforts of Talon gave great impulse to population. In 1665, there were 3,215 settlers, and 533 families. Three years later, the population now contained 6,282 settlers and 1,139 families. Jean Talon was hard at work in laying the foundation of an economic and political system and making commercial, industrial progresses.

==Providing administration and internal order==
Talon designed the main government buildings, especially the palace, paying special attention to the administration of justice. Under his commission, Talon had the right to &quot;judge alone and with full jurisdiction in civil matters,&quot; to &quot;hear all cases of crimes and misdemeanours, abuse and malversation, by whomsoever committed&quot; to &quot;proceed against all persons guilty of any crime, whatever might be their quality or condition, to pursue the proceedings until final completion, judgment and execution thereof.&quot;

Talon wished to make justice speedy, accessible to all and inexpensive. He proposed a three level system. In each parish, judges would be established to hear all civil cases involving not more than ten livres. Appeals for decisions given by the local judges could be taken to four judges based in Quebec. Final appeal was made to the Sovereign Council, which acted as a court. In 1669 Talon wrote a memorandum in which we find these words:
&quot;Justice is administered in the first instance by judges in the seigneuries; then by a lieutenant civil and criminal appointed by the company in each of the jurisdictions of Quebec and Three Rivers; and above all by the Sovereign Council, which is the last instance decides all cases where an appeal lies&quot;
Talon attempted to establish a method of settlement out of court. He also introduced an equitable system of land registration.

At that time, the Sovereign Council functioned as the legislature, the executive, the courts of justice and various commissions. One of the most important laws established by the Sovereign Council under Talon&#x27;s guidance was that concerning the importation of liquor and the establishment of the brewing industry. The decree stated that immoral self-indulgence was caused by importation of great quantity of liquor from France. Talon thought that establishment of breweries in the colony would solve the problem of immoderate use of alcohol. The breweries would also support colony&#x27;s agriculture in wheat.

In 1667, the Sovereign Council inspired by Talon discussed the formation of a company of Canadians to secure the exclusive privilege of trading. The charter granted the commercial monopoly to the West India Company. In 1668, the council sent a letter asking for freedom of trade to Colbert. The colonists had suffered from high prices and lack of availability in necessary goods. This was detrimental to the colony.

The sale of liquor to the Native Americans had always been prohibited in the colony. In 1657, the prohibition had been renewed and ratified under a decree of the King&#x27;s State Council. In 1663, the Sovereign Council established a law prohibiting indirect or direct selling or giving of brandy to Native Americans. Jean Talon supported the Sovereign Council&#x27;s decisions in the beginning. However, he was becoming more and more impressed by the material benefits and less convinced of its moral danger. He came to consider prohibition of the liquor traffic as a mistake, damaging to the trade and progress of the colony and to French influence over the Native Americans tribes. His earnest desire for the prosperity of the colony misled him to make the wrong judgment and brandy trafficking was accepted and approved.

The climate was severe and Talon&#x27;s health was deteriorating. Talon asked twice for his recall back to France. He had family matters to take care of and he wanted relief from his difficulties with the governor and the spiritual authorities. Louis XIV gave him leave to return to France and Claude de Bouteroue was appointed to take over his duties. Talon left Quebec in November 1668.

==Return to New France==

Back in France, Jean Talon continued to support the Canadian colony. The king and Colbert readily approved his plans for strengthening the Canadian colony. Troops, laborers, women, settlers, and supplies were sent in response to Talon&#x27;s requests. Talon&#x27;s stay in France was only brief. On May 10, 1669, the king signed Talon&#x27;s new commission to return to Canada. On August 18, after an absence from New France for a year and nine months, he landed once more at Quebec.

During his second term as the intendant of new France, he focused on external affairs of the colony. He wanted to extend French influence to the north, south and west. On October 10, 1670, he wrote to the king:
&quot;Since my arrival, I have sent resolute men to explore farther than has ever been done in Canada, some to the west, and north-west, others to the south-west and south.&quot;

His policy of exploration and discovery was directed towards increasing France&#x27;s reputation, developing trade; and therefore, preparing the way for the future greatness of Canada.

Furthermore, through promotion of the development of Acadia, he tried to strengthen Canada on the border with New England and the alliance with the northern tribes opened up trade opportunities with the wide area extending from Lake St. John to Lake Mistassini and to Hudson Bay.

Under the authority of a decree of the King&#x27;s Council of State, Talon gave a large number of seigneuries as grants. From October 10 to November 8 he granted about sixty seigneuries to officers and others settlements. On November 3 alone, he made 31 grants. It is true, seigneurial grants had been made in Canada before, but it was made without any preconceived plan or well-defined object. Talon organized the system of seigneuries with a well-defined object, which was to protect and to colonize the country.

==Legacy==

Jean Talon had saved the colony from destitution through the implementation of policies that cultivated agriculture, colonization, trade, industry and naval construction. He strengthened the foundation on which justice and government was placed. With strong outlook into the future, he prepared the way for the future extension and growth of New France.

Jean Talon left Canada in November 1672. The king had made a barony of his estate in recognition of his services and created him Baron des Islets. Later on he became Comte d’Orsainville and was appointed Captain of the Mariemont Castle.

After a time, he became &quot;Premier Valet de la garde-robe du Roi&quot; (First Valet of the King&#x27;s wardrobe). Finally, he attained the coveted office of secretary of the king&#x27;s cabinet. Jean Talon died on November 24, 1694, at the age of sixty-eight.

<doc id="190387" wikidata="Q453589" url="?curid=190387" title="Louis-Joseph de Montcalm">
<text>Lieutenant-General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Gozon, Marquis de Montcalm de Saint-Veran (; 28 February 1712 – 14 September 1759) was a French Royal Army officer best known for his unsuccessful defence of New France during the French and Indian War.

Montcalm was born in Vestric-et-Candiac near Nîmes to an aristocratic family, and joined the French army at a young age. He served in the War of the Polish Succession and the War of the Austrian Succession, where his service resulted in a promotion to brigadier general. In 1756, King Louis XV sent him to New France to lead its defence against the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Montcalm met with notable successes in 1756, 1757 and 1758, but British mobilisation of large numbers of troops against New France led to military setbacks in 1758 and 1759 (when, in January, he was promoted to lieutenant general), culminating in Montcalm&#x27;s death at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

Montcalm&#x27;s service in New France was marked by conflict between himself and the Governor General of the colony, Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial. These men were the leaders of the war effort in New France during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Montcalm has been much memorialized, especially in France, Quebec and parts of New York and Lower Michigan. Military historians have praised and criticized his decisions in defending Quebec.

==Early life==
Louis-Joseph was the son of Marie-Thérèse de Pierre and Louis-Daniel de Montcalm, of the House of Montcalm, a family of the Noblesse de Robe of Nîmes, at the family residence, the Chateau de Candiac, near Nîmes in southern France. He joined the French Royal Army in 1721, as an ensign in the Régiment d&#x27;Hainault. On the death of his father in 1735, he became the Marquis de Saint-Veran, inheriting the honours, rights, and debts of that position. His finances improved soon after by his marriage to Angelique Louise Talon du Boulay. Despite their marriage being initially arranged for money and influence, they were a devoted couple. They made their home at Candiac and had a large number of children of whom five survived to adulthood.

His father purchased a captaincy for him in 1729 and he served in the War of the Polish Succession, seeing action at the 1733 Siege of Kehl and the 1734 Siege of Philippsburg. When the War of the Austrian Succession broke out in 1740, his regiment was stationed in France, so Montcalm, seeking action, took a position as an aide-de-camp to Philippe Charles de La Fare. Montcalm and François Gaston de Lévis (who later served under him in New France) were both in the Siege of Prague. He was promoted to colonel of the Régiment d&#x27;Auxerrois in 1743. He took part in Marshal de Maillebois&#x27; Italian campaigns, where he was awarded the Order of Saint Louis in 1744 and taken prisoner in the 1746 Battle of Piacenza after receiving five sabre wounds while rallying his men. He was released on parole after several months&#x27; imprisonment, and promoted to Brigadier for his actions during the 1746 campaign. After prisoner exchanges made possible his return to active service, he joined the Italian campaign again in 1747. He was wounded again by a musket ball in the Battle of Assietta, and assisted in raising the Siege of Ventimiglia in October. When Marshal Belle-Isle retired that winter, his army was left under the command of its brigadiers, including Montcalm. The war came to an end in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1749 he was awarded a rare opportunity to raise a new regiment in peacetime; the Regiment de Montcalm was a cavalry regiment that Montcalm occasionally inspected.

==Defence of New France==
When the Seven Years&#x27; War spread to New France, King Louis XV sent Brigadier General Montcalm to the colonies as Commander-in-Chief, with Colonel Chevalier de Levis now as his second-in-command and Capitaine Louis Antoine de Bougainville as his new aide-de-camp.

===Battle of Fort Oswego===
Upon Montcalm&#x27;s arrival in Montreal, he was immediately apprised of the situation along the border with British North America. Concerned by the number of British troops amassing near the border, Montcalm left to visit Fort Carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, began to prepare troops at Fort Frontenac for a potential assault on Oswego, a British fort across Lake Ontario. Montcalm&#x27;s assemblage of troops at Fort Carillon distracted the attention of the British, and upon receiving positive reports from scouts, Vaudreuil and Montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort. When Montcalm returned to Fort Frontenac, he found a force of 3,500 men assembled, being regular French troops, Canadian militia, and Native Americans. On August 9, the forces crossed the lake and rapidly besieged the British fort. By the morning of August 13, the French had set up nine cannons and began to fire towards the fort while reinforcements surrounded the opposite side. The British commander was killed during the offensive, and the fort was quickly surrendered soon thereafter. 1,700 prisoners were taken, including 80 officers, as well as money, military correspondence, food provisions, guns, and boats, and the fort burnt and razed to the ground. Upwards of 100 prisoners were massacred in the wake of the surrender by Montcalm&#x27;s Indian allies. Montcalm&#x27;s first victory in North America came relatively quickly and easily, and signified to the British that the French now had a capable general heading their army. Despite the victory, Montcalm held reservations concerning the offensive strategy employed by Vaudreuil, and questioned the military value of the Canadian militias. This marked the beginning of the increasingly antagonistic relationship between Vaudreuil and Montcalm, which would prove to be crucial later on.

===Battle of Fort William Henry===
The following year, Montcalm achieved his greatest military success to date with the taking of Fort William Henry. Vaudreuil drew up plans for Montcalm that ordered him to march south and take the British bases south of Lake Champlain, Fort William Henry and Fort Edward a few miles further south. From Fort Carillon, Montcalm and a force of 6,200 regulars and militia, along with 1,800 natives set upon Fort William Henry on 3 August 1757. The fort was besieged for three days before surrender. Under the terms of the surrender, the garrison was to be escorted by French troops back to Fort Edward, where they would be barred from serving against the French for 18 months, and all British prisoners were to be returned to the French, who also kept all the stores and ammunition. As the garrison left Fort William Henry, however, they were attacked by Montcalm&#x27;s native allies, and around 200 of the 2,000 prisoners were killed, breaching the terms of surrender. Montcalm decided not to advance on to Fort Edward despite the demoralization of the British forces and the proximity of the fort, claiming the road was too bad for his heavy guns and that the garrison would be reinforced before they arrived. This decision infuriated Vaudreuil, furthering the deterioration of their relationship.

===Battle of Carillon===

In July 1758, Vaudreuil sent Montcalm to block a British push near Fort Carillon, on Lake Champlain. The British force gathering under Major-General James Abercrombie was much larger than expected, with 6,000 British regulars and 9,000 provincial militiamen. On July 5, the British began to set upon the fort, but the killing of the British second-in-command held them up long enough for Canadian reinforcements to arrive and bring Montcalm&#x27;s total force to over 3,600. Despite the relative insecurity of this particular fort and the overwhelming number of enemy troops, the French were able to hold the garrison due to a series of costly errors by the British general Abercrombie. By not waiting to bring up his heavy guns to blast the weak wooden defenses and failing to capitalize on a major flaw in the French lines, which would have allowed the British troops to easily outflank the garrison, Abercrombie enabled the French to sustain steady musket fire and hold off the attack. The battle was a major success for the French and a major setback for the British, and greatly added to the reputation of Montcalm, who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to France while disparaging the efforts of the Canadian and native fighters. Montcalm also accused Vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops, and Montcalm specifically, into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces, a claim quickly refuted by Vaudreuil, who subsequently requested that Montcalm be recalled to France and that the Chevalier de Lévis be appointed to succeed him.

===Quebec===

In the second half of 1758, the British began to take the upper hand in North America, due in part to the massive resources they organized against the French and in part to the lack of reinforcements and supplies from France to support its colony, which was already on the brink of starvation following a catastrophic harvest. Louis XV therefore ordered the colony to reduce its defensive perimeter to the valley of the Saint Lawrence River, evacuating all forts in Ohio along with those around Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. The French Minister of War nonetheless expressed his full support to Montcalm, confident that despite the odds, he would find a way to frustrate the enemy&#x27;s plans, as he had done at Fort Carillon. This news, along with the threat of impending attack by the British, crushed Montcalm&#x27;s spirit, who had lost all hope of holding the city in case of a siege.

Wolfe&#x27;s forces reached Quebec in late June, 1759, and taking position on the opposite shore, started bombarding the city on July 12, reducing the city to rubble over the course of two months. Montcalm, on many occasions, managed to repel attempted landings by the British forces, most notably at the Battle of Beauport, on 31 July 1759. After spending the month of August ravaging the countryside, the British would once again attempt a landing on September 13, this time at l&#x27;Anse au Foulons, catching the French off guard. Before Montcalm could react, Wolfe&#x27;s forces had already reached the plains outside the city, and were ready for battle.

In a decision largely considered to be Montcalm&#x27;s greatest mistake, the general decided to attack the British with what forces he had rather than wait for the forces garrisoned along the shore to come and bolster his numbers. The marquis believed that if he allowed the British to fortify their position, he would not be able to defeat them, and the attack therefore could not wait. In the ensuing Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the French forces were defeated.

==Death and burial==

While riding back towards the city, General Montcalm was hit in the back by musket shot. Assisted by three soldiers, he regained the city, where he was taken before a surgeon, who announced Montcalm would not live through the night. During the afternoon, the general drew on his last reserves of strength and signed his last official act as commander of the French army in Canada. In a letter addressed to General Wolfe, who unbeknownst to him had also fallen in battle, Montcalm attempted to surrender the city, despite the fact he did not hold the authority to do so. He died at around 5:00 am on 14 September 1759. At 8:00 am, he was buried in a shell hole under the choir of the Ursuline church. On October 11, 2001, the remains of Montcalm were removed from the Ursuline convent and placed into a newly built mausoleum in the cemetery of the Hôpital-Général de Québec.

== Conflict between Montcalm and Vaudreuil ==
Montcalm&#x27;s service in New France was marked by conflict with the Governor General of the colony, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial. The sources of the conflict were twofold.

===Personal conflict===
Firstly, Montcalm and Vaudreuil represented distinct martial services. Montcalm was a soldier in the army (&quot;troupes de terres&quot;), while Vaudreuil was a marine in the navy (&quot;compagnies franches de la marine&quot;). That meant that the former reported to the Ministry of War, but the latter reported to the Naval Ministry. According to the historian Christian Crouch, &quot;Separate ministries meant separate career networks, separate routes to power, and separate patrons... Jealously protective of their spheres of influence, the leaders of the war effort…were soon at odds.&quot; That led Montcalm to keep writing to the Minister of War, Comte d&#x27;Argenson, to complain about Vaudreuil&#x27;s relative inexperience as a military strategist, among other things, in the hope of replacing him as chief strategist. Similarly, Vaudreuil would consistently write to the minister of the navy to complain about Montcalm&#x27;s insubordination in the hope of having him replaced; Montcalm having been made subordinate to the former by the royal council in the hope of avoiding any disagreements over strategy, despite otherwise holding equivalent ranks. Thus, the first source of conflict between Montcalm and Vaudreuil was very much personal.

===Societal conflict personified===
However, the historian Guy Frégault, on the conflict between Montcalm and Vaudreuil, has said, &quot;The conflict has been the subject of much debate. But the division that split the high command was more than a personal quarrel. It involved societies – and what it is that causes societies to arm themselves to endure.&quot; Thus, the second source of conflict between Montcalm and Vaudreuil was that they represented distinct societies and martial cultures. Montcalm represented the culture of the French metropolitan officer, and Vaudreuil represented that of the Canadian colonial officer. The culture of the French metropolitan officer led Montcalm and others like him to see the Seven Years&#x27; War in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom&#x27;s honour, regardless of what it meant for New France. Conversely, the culture of the Canadian colonial officer led Vaudreuil and others like him to interpret the war in terms of a defence of the territorial integrity of New France and thus its very existence.

The differences in interpretation led to differences in opinion about how the war should be waged. Montcalm was of the opinion that &quot;colonial methods had had their day, and now war was established &#x27;on a European footing, with planned campaigns, armies, artillery, sieges, battles...&#x27;&quot; Waging the war that way would ensure the preservation and extension of French military honour, which was of particular importance to the king and his government after the loss of Fort Beauséjour at the outset of the war. Conversely, Vaudreuil was of the opinion that the war should be waged as based on established &quot;colonial methods,&quot; which meant extending fortifications, consistently repelling British incursions, &quot;defending the soil of our frontiers foot by foot against the enemy,&quot; fighting defensively, raiding extensively, and (most importantly) securing and relying heavily on Native participation. Montcalm was particularly disparaging of the last method since he thought that it would diminish French honour. Some French metropolitan officers saw Native military methods as boundlessly cruel and scalping as particularly revolting. After his victory at Carillon, he even went as far as saying to a delegation of Native leaders, &quot;You have come at a time when I have no more need of you. Have you only come to see dead bodies? Go behind the fort and you will find them. I do not need you to defeat the English.&quot;

The conflict between Montcalm and Vaudreuil would be largely solved or at least rendered irrelevant when, in 1758, the former was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, thus outranking the latter, and acquiring a virtually free hand in the determination of military strategy.

<text>Anna Maria Magnani (; 7 March 1908 – 26 September 1973) was an Academy Award-winning Italian actress. She was known for her explosive acting and earthy, realistic portrayals of characters.

Born in either Rome or Alexandria and raised in Rome, she worked her way through Rome&#x27;s Academy of Dramatic Art by singing at night clubs. During her career, her only child was stricken by polio when he was 18 months old and remained disabled. She was referred to as &quot;La Lupa&quot;, the &quot;perennial toast of Rome&quot; and a &quot;living she-wolf symbol&quot; of the cinema. &quot;Time&quot; described her personality as &quot;fiery&quot;, and drama critic Harold Clurman said her acting was &quot;volcanic&quot;. In the realm of Italian cinema, she was &quot;passionate, fearless, and exciting&quot;, an actress whom film historian Barry Monush calls &quot;the volcanic earth mother of all Italian cinema.&quot; Director Roberto Rossellini called her &quot;the greatest acting genius since Eleonora Duse&quot;. Playwright Tennessee Williams became an admirer of her acting and wrote &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1955) specifically for her to star in, a role for which she received an Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first Italian – and first non-native English speaking woman – to win an Oscar.

After meeting director Goffredo Alessandrini, she received her first screen role in &quot;The Blind Woman of Sorrento&quot; (&quot;La cieca di Sorrento&quot;, 1934) and later achieved international attention in Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (1945), which is seen as launching the Italian neorealism movement in cinema. As an actress, she became recognized for her dynamic and forceful portrayals of &quot;earthy lower-class women&quot; in such films as &quot;L&#x27;Amore&quot; (1948), &quot;Bellissima&quot; (1951), &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1955), &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mamma Roma&quot; (1962). As early as 1950, &quot;Life&quot; had already stated that Magnani was &quot;one of the most impressive actresses since Garbo&quot;.

==Early years==
Magnani&#x27;s parentage and birthplace are uncertain. Some sources suggest she was born in Rome, others suggest Egypt. Her mother was Marina Magnani. Film director Franco Zeffirelli, who claimed to know Magnani well, states in his autobiography that she was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to an Italian-Jewish mother and Egyptian father, and that &quot;only later did she become Roman when her grandmother brought her over and raised her in one of the Roman slum districts.&quot; Magnani herself stated that her mother was married in Egypt, but returned to Rome before giving birth to her at Porta Pia, and did not know how the rumor of her Egyptian birth got started. She was enrolled in a French convent school in Rome, where she learned to speak French and play the piano. She also developed a passion for acting from watching the nuns stage their Christmas plays. This period of formal education lasted until the age of 14.

She was a &quot;plain, frail child with a forlornness of spirit&quot;. Her grandparents compensated by pampering her with food and clothes. Yet while growing up, she is said to have felt more at ease around &quot;more earthly&quot; companions, often befriending the &quot;toughest kid on the block&quot;. This trait carried over into her adult life when she proclaimed, &quot;I hate respectability. Give me the life of the streets, of common people.&quot;

At age 17, she went on to study at the Eleonora Duse Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in Rome for two years. To support herself, Magnani sang in nightclubs and cabarets; leading to her being dubbed &quot;the Italian Édith Piaf&quot;. However, her actor friend Micky Knox writes that she &quot;never studied acting formally&quot; and started her career in Italian music halls singing traditional Roman folk songs. &quot;She was instinctive&quot; he writes. &quot;She had the ability to call up emotions at will, to move an audience, to convince them that life on the stage was as real and natural as life in their own kitchen.&quot; Film critic David Thomson wrote that Magnani was considered an &quot;outstanding theatre actress&quot; in productions of &quot;Anna Christie&quot; and &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;.

==Early acting career==
In 1933, Magnani was acting in experimental plays in Rome when she was discovered by Italian filmmaker Goffredo Alessandrini. The couple married the same year.
Nunzio Malasomma directed her in her first major film role in &quot;The Blind Woman of Sorrento&quot; (&quot;La Cieca di Sorrento&quot;, 1934).Goffredo Alessandrini directed her in &quot;Cavalry&quot; (&quot;Cavalleria&quot;, 1936).
For director Vittorio De Sica, Magnani starred in &quot;Teresa Venerdì&quot; (1941). De Sica called this Magnani&#x27;s &quot;first true film&quot;. In it, she plays Loletta Prima, the girlfriend of De Sica’s character, Pietro Vignali. De Sica described Magnani&#x27;s laugh as &quot;loud, overwhelming, and tragic&quot;.

==Italian stardom==
Magnani became a major star in post-War Italian cinema, coming to international prominence in the films of Roberto Rossellini and other Italian directors. 

===&quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (1945)===
Magnani gained international renown as Pina in Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s neorealist &quot;Rome, Open City&quot; (&quot;Roma, città aperta&quot;, 1945). In a film about Italy&#x27;s final days under German occupation during World War II, Magnani&#x27;s character dies fighting to protect her husband, an underground fighter against the Nazis.

===&quot;L&#x27;Amore: The Human Voice and The Miracle&quot; (1948)===
Other collaborations with Rossellini include &quot;L&#x27;Amore&quot; (1948), a two-part film which includes &quot;The Miracle&quot; and &quot;The Human Voice&quot; (&quot;Il miracolo&quot;, and &quot;Una voce umana&quot;). In the former, Magnani, playing a peasant outcast who believes the baby she is carrying is Christ, plumbs both the sorrow and the righteousness of being alone in the world. The latter film is based on Jean Cocteau&#x27;s play about a woman desperately trying to salvage a relationship over the telephone.

===&quot;Volcano&quot; (1950)===
After &quot;The Miracle&quot;, Rossellini promised to direct Magnani in a film he was preparing, which he told her would be &quot;the crowning vehicle of her career&quot;. However, when the screenplay was completed, he instead gave the role for &quot;Stromboli&quot; to Ingrid Bergman, later Rossellini&#x27;s lover. This permanently ended Magnani&#x27;s personal and professional association with Rossellini.

As a result, Magnani took on the starring role of &quot;Volcano&quot; (1950), which was said to have been produced to invite a comparison. Both films were shot in similar locales of Aeolian Islands, only 40 kilometres apart; both actresses played independent-minded roles in a neorealist fashion; and both films were shot simultaneously. &quot;Life&quot; wrote &quot;in an atmosphere crackling with rivalry... Reporters were accredited, like war correspondents, to one or the other of the embattled camps...Partisanship infected the Via Veneto (boulevard in Rome), where Magnaniacs and Bergmaniacs clashed frequently.&quot; However, Magnani still considered Rossellini the &quot;greatest director she ever acted for&quot;.

===&quot;Bellissima&quot; (1951)===
In Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Bellissima&quot; (1951), she plays Maddalena, a blustery, obstinate stage mother who drags her daughter to Cinecittà for the &#x27;Prettiest Girl in Rome&#x27; contest, with dreams that her plain daughter will be a star. Her emotions in the film went from those of rage and humiliation to maternal love.

===&quot;The Golden Coach&quot; (1952)===
Magnani then went on to star as Camille (stage name: Columbine) in Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;The Golden Coach&quot; (&quot;Le Carrosse d&#x27;or&quot;, 1952). She played a woman torn with desire for three men - a soldier, a bullfighter, and a viceroy. Renoir called her &quot;the greatest actress I have ever worked with&quot;.

==American Films==

===&quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1955)===
She played the widowed mother of a teenaged daughter in Daniel Mann&#x27;s 1955 film, &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;, based on the play by Tennessee Williams. It co-starred Burt Lancaster, and was Magnani&#x27;s first English-speaking role in a mainstream Hollywood movie, winning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. Lancaster, who played the role of a &quot;lusty truck driver&quot;, said, &quot;if she had not found acting as an outlet for her enormous vitality, she would have become a great criminal&quot;.

Film historian John DiLeo has written that Magnani&#x27;s acting in the film &quot;displays why she is inarguably one of the half dozen greatest screen actresses of all time&quot;, and added:&quot;Whenever Magnani laughs or cries (which is often), it&#x27;s as if you&#x27;ve never seen anyone laugh or cry before: has laughter ever been so burstingly joyful or tears so shatteringly sad?

Tennessee Williams wrote the screenplay and based the character of Serafina on Magnani as Williams was a great admirer of her acting abilities, and he even stipulated that the movie &quot;must star what &quot;Time&quot; described as &quot;the most explosive emotional actress of her generation, Anna Magnani.&quot; In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Williams described why he insisted on Magnani playing this role:&quot;Anna Magnani was magnificent as Serafina in the movie version of &quot;Tattoo&quot;...She was as unconventional a woman as I have known in or out of my professional world, and if you understand me at all, you must know that in this statement I am making my personal estimate of her honesty, which I feel was complete. She never exhibited any lack of self-assurance, any timidity in her relations with that society outside of whose conventions she quite publicly existed...[s]he looked absolutely straight into the eyes of whomever she confronted and during that golden time in which we were dear friends, I never heard a false word from her mouth.&quot;

It was originally staged on Broadway with Maureen Stapleton, as Magnani&#x27;s English was too limited at the time for her to star. Magnani won other Best Actress awards for her role, including the BAFTA Film Award, Golden Globes Award, National Board of Review, USA, and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. 
When her name was announced as the Oscar winner, an American journalist called her in Rome to tell her the news; he had difficulty convincing her he wasn&#x27;t joking.

===&quot;Wild is the Wind&quot;===
Magnani worked again in the United States, speaking both English and Italian, in George Cukor&#x27;s drama &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; (1957), in which she played the Italian bride of sheep farmer Anthony Quinn who falls for his surrogate son Tony Franciosa. Both Magnani and Quinn were nominated for Oscars for their performances.

Magnani and Quinn would later star in the less successful &quot;The Secret of Santa Vittoria&quot; (1969).

===&quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot;===
She then appeared in another Tennessee Williams property, the 1960 film &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot;, which originally was titled &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; after the play on which it was based). Directed by Sidney Lumet, she co-starred with Marlon Brando, for whom this also was a reunion with Williams, whose &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; vaulted him to stardom. In the film, she played Lady Torrance, a woman &quot;hardened by life&#x27;s cruelties and a grief that will not fade.&quot; It also co-starred a young Joanne Woodward in one of her early roles. 

In an article he wrote for &quot;Life&quot;, Williams discussed why he chose Magnani for the part:&quot;Anna and I had both cherished the dream that her appearance in the part I created for her in &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; would be her greatest triumph to date...She is simply a rare being who seems to have about her a little lightning-shot cloud all her own...In a crowded room, she can sit perfectly motionless and silent and still you feel the atmospheric tension of her presence, its quiver and hum in the air like a live wire exposed, and a mood of Anna&#x27;s is like the presence of royalty.&quot;

The production was troubled, as Magnani and Brando did not get along. David Thomson has written:Rumors had it that Magnani (fifty-one at the time) assumed in advance that there would be a sexual encounter with Brando (thirty-six), and when that failed to materialize, she became aggressive and insecure; and that Brando believed she refrained from washing to goad him,

The movie received mixed reviews and was a failure at the box office.

==Other Italian films==
Magnani continued to work in Italian movies. &quot;...And the Wild Wild Women&quot; (&quot;Nella Città L&#x27;Inferno&quot;, 1958) paired her as an unrepentant streetwalker with Giulietta Masina, Federico Fellini&#x27;s wife and star, in a women-in-prison film.

===&quot;Mamma Roma&quot; (1962)===
In Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Mamma Roma &quot;(1962), Magnani is both the mother and the whore, playing an irrepressible prostitute determined to give her teenaged son a respectable middle-class life. &quot;Mamma Roma&quot;, while one of Magnani&#x27;s critically acclaimed films, was not released in the United States until 1995, deemed too controversial 33 years earlier. By now, she was frustrated at being typecast in the roles of poor women. Magnani in 1963 commented, &quot;I’m bored stiff with these everlasting parts as a hysterical, loud, working-class woman&quot;.

===&quot;The Secret of Santa Vittoria&quot; (1969)===

In one of her last film roles, &quot;The Secret of Santa Vittoria&quot; (1969), she co-starred with Anthony Quinn, with whom she had appeared with a decade before in &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot;. They played husband and wife in what &quot;Life&quot; called &quot;perhaps the most memorable fight since Jimmy Cagney smashed Mae Clarke in the face with a half a grapefruit.&quot;

In real life as well as in their reel life, Magnani and Quinn feuded in private outside view of the cameras, and their animosity spilled over into their scenes:&quot;By the time the movie makers were ready to shoot the fight scene, the stars were ready, too. 

Magnani not only went for Quinn with the pasta and with a rolling pin, but [also] with her foot; she kicked so hard she broke a bone in her right foot. She also bit him in the neck. &#x27;That&#x27;s not in the script&#x27;, Quinn protested. Magnani snarled, &#x27;I&#x27;m supposed to win this fight, remember?&quot;

===Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Roma&quot; (1972) ===

She later played herself (within a dramatic context) in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Roma&quot; (1972). Towards the end of her career, Magnani was quoted as having said, &quot;The day has gone when I deluded myself that making movies was art. Movies today are made up of…intellectuals who always make out that they’re teaching something&quot;. 

==Acting style==
According to film critic Robin Wood, Magnani&#x27;s &quot;persona as a great actress is built, not on transformation, but on emotional authenticity... [she] doesn&#x27;t portray characters but expresses &#x27;genuine&#x27; emotions.&quot; Her style does not display the more obvious attributes of the female star, with neither her face or physical makeup being considered &quot;beautiful&quot;, wrote Wood. However, she possesses a &quot;remarkably expressive face,&quot; and for American audiences, at least, she represents &quot;what Hollywood had consistently failed to produce: &#x27;reality&#x27;&quot;. She was the atypical star, the &quot;nonglamorous human being&quot;, as her genuine style of acting became a &quot;rejection of glamour&quot;.

Her most distinguished work in Hollywood is in &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;, according to Wood. Directed by George Cukor, &quot;the American cinema&#x27;s greatest director of actresses,&quot; he was able to draw out the &quot;individual essence&quot; of Magnani&#x27;s &quot;sensitive and inward performance.&quot;

==Personal life==
During Benito Mussolini&#x27;s rule, Magnani was known to make jokes about the Italian Fascist Party.
She married Goffredo Alessandrini, her first film director, in 1935, two years after he discovered her on stage. After they married, she retired from full-time acting to &quot;devote herself exclusively to her husband&quot;, although she continued to play smaller film parts. They separated in 1942.

Magnani had a love affair with actor Massimo Serato, by whom she had her only child, a son named Luca, who was born on 29 October 1942 in Rome, after her separation from Alessandrini. At the age of 18 months, Luca contracted polio and subsequently lost the use of his legs due to paralysis. As a result, Magnani spent most of her early earnings for specialists and hospitals. After once seeing a legless war veteran drag himself along the sidewalk, she said, &quot;I realize now that it&#x27;s worse when they grow up&quot;, and resolved to earn enough to &quot;shield him forever from want&quot;.
In 1945, she fell in love with director Roberto Rossellini while working on &quot;Roma, Città Aperta&quot; (&quot;Rome, Open City&quot;). &quot;I thought at last I had found the ideal man... [He] had lost a son of his own and I felt we understood each other. Above all, we had the same artistic conceptions.&quot; Rossellini could be violent, volatile and possessive, however, and they would argue about films or out of jealousy. &quot;In fits of rage they threw crockery at each other.&quot; As artists, though, they complemented each other well while working on neorealist films. The two split up when Rossellini had an affair with Ingrid Bergman, whom he married after she conceived a child.

Magnani was mystically inclined and consulted astrologers, as well as believing in numerology. She also claimed to be clairvoyant. She ate and drank very little and could subsist for long periods on nothing more than black coffee and cigarettes. However, these habits often affected her sleep: &quot;My nights are appalling,&quot; she said. &quot;I wake up in a state of nerves and it takes me hours to get back in touch with reality.&quot;

==Death==
On 26 September 1973, Magnani died at the age of 65 in Rome from pancreatic cancer. Huge crowds gathered for the funeral. She was provisionally laid to rest in the family mausoleum of Roberto Rossellini; but then subsequently interred in the Cimitero Comunale of San Felice Circeo in southern Lazio.

<text>The Plains of Abraham () is a historic area within the Battlefields Park in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. It was established on 17 March 1908. The land is the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, which took place on 13 September 1759, but hundreds of acres of the fields became used for grazing, housing, and minor industrial structures. Only in 1908 was the land ceded to Quebec City, though administered by the specifically created and federally-run National Battlefields Commission. The park is today used by 4 million visitors and tourists annually for sports, relaxation, outdoor concerts, and festivals.

==Plains of Abraham Museum==

The Plains of Abraham Museum serves as the park&#x27;s information and reception centre. It features a multi-media exhibition about the siege of Quebec and the 1759 and 1760 battles of the Plains of Abraham. Other displays feature the history of the site through archaeological artifacts found in the park. Open year-round and located at 835 Wilfrid-Laurier Avenue, the museum serves as the starting point for tours and includes a gift shop.

==Name and features==
 The plains are likely named after Abraham Martin (also known as L&#x27;Écossais) (1589–1664), a fisherman and river pilot called &quot;The Scot&quot;. Martin moved to Quebec City in 1635 with his wife Marguerite Langlois and received of land divided between the lower town and promontory from the Company of New France. Abraham&#x27;s name appears in the toponymy of Quebec City at the time of the French regime, the deeds of the 17th and 18th centuries referring to the coast of Abraham, and a 1734 plan even precisely locating an Abraham Street. Later, the journals of the Chevalier de Levis and the Marquis de Montcalm referred to the &quot;Heights of Abraham&quot;, as did the diaries of British soldiers, who also employed the phrase &quot;Plains of Abraham&quot;.
The park itself currently occupies an area approximately long by , that extends westward from the Citadelle of Quebec and the walls of Quebec City along a plateau above the Saint Lawrence River, and forms a part of The Battlefields Park. An interpretive centre and walking trails have been built on the site, and monuments commemorate the Battle of Sainte-Foy and James Wolfe, the latter being an astronomic meridian marker raised in 1790 by the Surveyor-General of Canada, Major Holland, on the site where Wolfe was said to have died.

In 1913, the National Battlefields Commission placed a column identical to one that had been built on the site in 1849, and a replica Cross of Sacrifice was constructed on the plains to commemorate soldiers who were lost in World War I; it continues to be the location of Remembrance Day ceremonies every year.

==History==
On September 13, 1759, the area was the scene of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, part of the French and Indian War (1754–63), which preceded, then became a theatre of, the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63). On that date, British soldiers under the command of General Wolfe, climbed the steep cliff under the city in darkness, surprising and defeating the French, through a single deadly volley of musket fire, causing the battle to be over within 30 minutes. Both Wolfe and the French commander, the Marquis de Montcalm, died of their wounds, but the battle left control of Quebec City to the British, eventually allowing them to take control of Canada the following year.

The plains thereafter remained nondescript fields, with only a monument to Wolfe as a reminder of the events that took place. As Quebec City grew, development of the plains took place unabated, and hundreds of acres were built over. Only in 1901 did government intervention come, when the proposed subdivision of of the area was halted by the purchase of the land by the Dominion Crown. At the same time, however, another area of the plains was taken and, despite public protest, covered by a Ross rifle factory, which included a water tank built upon an existing Martello tower. A movement to preserve the site continued, nonetheless, and by 1904, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec was permitted by the federal government to put up plaques at various significant spots around the vicinity. The following year, a proposal for the establishment of an Historic Landmarks Association was placed before the Royal Society of Canada and Governor General the Earl Grey initiated his plan to preserve the battlefields, having visited the site and stating that he &quot;would never rest until such sacred ground became the heirloom of all Canada and the Empire.&quot;
The Mayor of Quebec City, Jean-Georges Garneau, in 1908 appointed a landmark commission under the chairmanship of Chief Justice of the Quebec Superior Court François Langelier. Amongst its recommendations for permanently recording the celebrations for the 300th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City, the group called for a nationalization of the Quebec battlefields and the construction of a museum of Canadian history. The federal prime minister at the time, Wilfrid Laurier, suggested, however, that a preservation of the plains themselves would be a more fitting tribute, thus falling in line with the desires of the Earl Grey, who in January had travelled to Quebec to see whether the site could be dedicated as a part of the tercentenary celebrations. By 17 March, the park was created, becoming the first National Historic Site in Canada and was placed under the auspices of the newly and specifically formed National Battlefields Commission, a group that, following the lead of Edward VII, began to collect historical data relating to the plains and the battles that took place on them. Finally, on 24 July 1908, the King&#x27;s eldest son, Prince George, Prince of Wales (later George V), dedicated the Quebec Battlefields Park at the Plains of Abraham, then presenting the title deeds of the lands to the Governor General. The events were popular with Quebec residents, leading Laurier to opine that Quebecers were &quot;monarchical by religion, by habit, and by the remembrance of past history.&quot; The official memorial record of the anniversary was titled &quot;The King&#x27;s Book of Quebec&quot;; with the assent of the King (by then George V), the volume was published in 1911.
The site has become an urban park within Quebec City; the National Battlefields Commission has compared its use to that of Central Park in New York City and Hyde Park in London. It has thus seen various events staged on it, most regularly during the &quot;Fête nationale du Québec&quot;, the Quebec Winter Carnival, and the Quebec City Summer Festival.

<text>Dido Florian Cloud de Bounevialle O&#x27;Malley Armstrong (born 25 December 1971), known professionally as Dido ( ), is an English singer and songwriter. She attained international success with her debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; (1999); hit singles from the album include &quot;Here with Me&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;. It sold over 21 million copies worldwide and won her several awards, including two Brit Awards; additionally, she won Best British Album and Best British Female as well as the MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act. The first verse of &quot;Thank You&quot; is sampled in &quot;Stan&quot;, a critically acclaimed collaboration with American rapper Eminem. Her next album, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; (2003), continued her success with the hit singles &quot;White Flag&quot; and &quot;Life for Rent&quot;. In 2004, Dido performed with other British and Irish artists in the Band Aid 20 version of the charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

Dido&#x27;s first two albums are among the best-selling albums in UK chart history, and both are in the top 10 best-selling albums of the 2000s in the UK. Her third studio album, &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot; (2008), received critical acclaim but failed to achieve the commercial success of her previous efforts. Dido was ranked No. 98 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart of the top &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 artists of the 2000s (2000–2009) based on the success of her albums in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2011, Dido&#x27;s duet with A. R. Rahman, &quot;If I Rise&quot;, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards.

Dido made a comeback in 2013, releasing her fourth studio album, &quot;Girl Who Got Away&quot;, which reached the top 5 in the UK. Having taken time out of the music industry to raise her son, she reappeared on stage at the 2013 Reading and Leeds festival where she reunited with Eminem. Dido released her fifth studio album, &quot;Still on My Mind,&quot; on 8 March 2019 and embarked on her first tour in 15 years in support of the new album. In May 2019, Dido received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2020, Dido co-released &quot;The Last Summer (Deluxe Edition)&quot;, a studio album in collaboration with her brother R Plus (Rollo Armstrong).

==Early life==

Dido was born Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong, at St. Mary Abbot&#x27;s Hospital in Kensington, London, on Christmas Day in 1971. As she was born on Christmas Day, she also celebrates an &quot;official birthday&quot; on 25 June, following the example of Paddington Bear. Her mother, Clare (née Collins), is a poet of French ancestry, and her father, William O&#x27;Malley Armstrong (1938–2006), was an Irish publisher and former managing director of Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. Her elder brother, Rowland Constantine O&#x27;Malley Armstrong, is better known as record producer Rollo, part of the British electronica trio Faithless.

Despite their birth names, the pair were known from childhood by the names Dido and Rollo. Dido considers this as her real name, not simply a stage name or nickname. As a child, she had to deal with her birth name&#x27;s ambiguous and unusual nature, which led to her being bullied and even to her pretending to have an ordinary name. In a 2001 interview, she said &quot;To be called one thing and christened another is actually very confusing and annoying. It&#x27;s one of the most irritating things that my parents did to me. ... Florian is a German man&#x27;s name. That&#x27;s just mean. To give your child a whole lot of odd names. They were all so embarrassing. ... I thought it was cruel to call me Dido and then expect me to just deal with it.&quot; The name &quot;Dido&quot; derives from the legendary Queen of Carthage.

Dido was educated at Thornhill Primary School in Islington, Dallington School, City of London Girls&#x27; and Westminster School, where she was taught by the contemporary musician and Head of Academic Music, Sinan Savaskan. After she stole a recorder from school at the age of five, her parents enrolled her at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. By the time she reached her teens, she had learned to play the piano, recorder, and the violin. She later studied law at Birkbeck, University of London, while working as a literary agent. She never completed the degree, deciding instead to take up music full-time.

==Career==

===1995–1996: Early recordings===
In 1995, Dido began recording 10 demo tracks which were put together on a collection entitled &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot; and sent out by Nettwerk management. Nettwerk had signed her after she was brought to their attention by her collaborations with Faithless, the UK dance act spearheaded by her brother, Rollo Armstrong (Dido co-wrote and provided vocals for album tracks, such as &quot;Flowerstand Man&quot; and &quot;Hem of His Garment&quot;). The collection was released by Nettwerk on CD-R and acetate disc in 1995 and featured a mixture of finished productions and demo versions which she later considered for release on her 1999 debut album, &quot;No Angel&quot;. &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot; brought her to the attention of A&amp;R Peter Edge at Arista Records, who signed her in the US in late 1996, and negotiated a co-sign deal with her brother&#x27;s independent record label, Cheeky Records. Of the tracks included on &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot;, &quot;Take My Hand&quot; was included on all editions of &quot;No Angel&quot; as a bonus track; &quot;Sweet Eyed Baby&quot; was remixed and renamed to &quot;Don&#x27;t Think of Me&quot;, while &quot;Worthless&quot; and &quot;Me&quot; were released exclusively on the Japanese edition. Peter Leak became Dido&#x27;s manager during the recording of &quot;No Angel&quot; after Edge played some of the in-progress recordings and been &quot;blown away&quot; by them.

===1998–2002: &quot;No Angel&quot; and breakthrough===

In 1998, the music producer for the film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; selected her track &quot;Thank You&quot; for the soundtrack. Cheeky Records, to which Dido was signed, was sold to BMG records in 1999. This delayed the release of the album &quot;No Angel&quot; in the United Kingdom, but also allowed her to concentrate on promoting &quot;No Angel&quot; in the United States, including a slot on Sarah McLachlan&#x27;s Lilith Fair tour. Through touring, both before and after the album was available, Dido&#x27;s music began to receive more exposure. The first official single chosen by Dido and her label, &quot;Here with Me&quot;, initially struggled to make an impact on radio, but while the label were considering switching to an alternative track, the song made a breakthrough as a result of its use in television programme &quot;Roswell&quot;. The song was used as the theme music of the show, but it was actually when it was played in its entirety during the season finale that it really made an impact with audiences.

Manager Peter Leak told HitQuarters that sales jumped from 2,000 to 9,000 units during the week of the show&#x27;s transmission. Arguably it was this, as well as the airplay on MTV throughout Europe of the single&#x27;s video, which brought her mass attention. Subsequently, the song was used in the British romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot;. &quot;No Angel&quot; was released in 1999, and Dido toured extensively to promote the record.

American rapper Eminem helped introduce Dido to a US audience in 2000 when he received permission from Dido herself to sample the first verse of &quot;Thank You&quot; in his hit single &quot;Stan&quot;. Dido also appeared in the music video as Stan&#x27;s pregnant girlfriend. She did not want to do the video at first, as she was uncomfortable with the scene in the video where she had to be tied up and have her mouth covered with duct tape, but later agreed to it and got along well with Eminem and the crew on set. In North America, the video usually aired with the trunk scene censored. Interest soared in her debut album, leading it to hit charts in Europe on import sales alone, charting in the top five on the UK Albums Chart before its official UK re-release.

&quot;No Angel&quot; went on to become the top-selling album of 2001 worldwide, debuting at, and returning to, number one in the official UK Albums Chart many times throughout the year. It spawned two top ten hit singles, &quot;Here with Me&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;, a further top twenty hit, &quot;Hunter&quot; and a fourth and final single release &quot;All You Want&quot; which reached the top 25. It was certified platinum in over thirty-five countries, and is estimated to have sold over 21 million copies worldwide. In America, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think of Me&quot; was released as the second single, peaking at number 35 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Top 40 in May 2000.

Dido&#x27;s widely emulated hairstyle at this time became known as the &quot;Dido flip&quot;. Her sold-out worldwide tour featured hip-hop artist Pete Miser as her live band&#x27;s DJ. &quot;No Angel&quot; claimed No. 97 according to the Decade-end Album Chart by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

===2003–2005: &quot;Life for Rent&quot; and Live 8===
&quot;Life for Rent&quot; was released in 2003. Produced by her brother Rollo Armstrong and American songwriter Rick Nowels, work on the album began in mid-2002. It was certified 9× Platinum by the BPI, and sold over 12 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling album worldwide of 2003. The album became the seventh best-selling album of the 2000s in the United Kingdom, making Dido the only singer to have two albums in the top 10 list. Preceded by the hit single &quot;White Flag&quot;, the album sold over 152,000 copies in the first day alone in the UK, and went on to sell over 400,000 in the first week. Three further singles—&quot;Life for Rent&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Home&quot; and &quot;Sand in My Shoes&quot;—were lifted from the album, with Dido embarking on a worldwide tour in support of the album (a DVD of footage from the tour was released in 2005 entitled &quot;Live at Brixton Academy&quot;). As of 2015, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is the 34th best-selling album in UK chart history. In 2019 it was listed the 15th best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK. 

Following her sold-out world tour of 2004, Dido was asked to perform at three of the Live 8 concerts on 2 July 2005—performing in London, then at the Eden Project in Cornwall, before flying over to Paris, performing both solo (&quot;White Flag&quot;) and duetting with Youssou N&#x27;Dour (&quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Seven Seconds&quot;). Also in 2005, Dido provided vocals for her brother&#x27;s side project Dusted on the album &quot;Safe from Harm&quot;. She sings on the tracks: &quot;Time Takes Time&quot;, &quot;Hurt U&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot; and she co-wrote three tracks on the album: &quot;Always Remember to Respect &amp; Honour Your Mother, Part 1&quot;, &quot;The Biggest Fool in the World&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;.

===2006–2008: &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot; and hiatus===
Dido&#x27;s third album, &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot;, was released in November 2008. The album, which Dido began work on in October 2005, was produced by Jon Brion and Dido herself and features contributions from Brian Eno, Questlove, Mick Fleetwood, Rollo Armstrong, and Matt Chamberlain. Recording sessions were held at London&#x27;s Abbey Road and at Jon Brion&#x27;s home studio in Los Angeles. During production of the album, Dido attended evening classes in music and English at the University of California, Los Angeles. The first single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe in Love&quot;, was released in October 2008, and a track titled &quot;Look No Further&quot; was made available to download from her official website for a limited time. The album failed to sell as well as &quot;No Angel&quot; or &quot;Life for Rent&quot;, and Dido opted not to tour in support of the album due to her difficulties with performing the material that was written about the death of her father. It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

In December 2008, Dido&#x27;s &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot; song &quot;Let&#x27;s Do the Things We Normally Do&quot;, was criticised by Gregory Campbell, MP for East Londonderry and Minister for Sports, Arts and Leisure for Northern Ireland, for referencing lyrics from a song, &quot;The Men Behind the Wire&quot;, which was written in the aftermath of the introduction of detention without trial for persons accused of being members of paramilitary groups. Campbell described &quot;The Men Behind the Wire&quot; as &quot;written about people who were murderers, arsonists and terrorists&quot;, and suggested &quot;she [Dido] should clarify her position so that her fans and the wider public knows where she stands on these things&quot;. The album&#x27;s artwork features a photograph of astronaut Bruce McCandless II during a spacewalk, as part of space shuttle mission STS-41-B; McCandless sued Dido, Sony Music Entertainment, and Getty Images Inc for unauthorised use of this photo in September 2010. The case was settled under undisclosed terms on 14 January 2011.

===2009–2018: &quot;Girl Who Got Away&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
Shortly after the release of &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot;, Dido returned to the studio to start recording new material for inclusion on her fourth studio album. In July 2009, Dido said that the album would have an electronic approach, in an attempt to take it in a totally different direction to her previous albums. In September 2010, Dido released the single &quot;Everything to Lose&quot; via digital download, following its appearance on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (released in May 2010).

In January 2011, Dido released &quot;If I Rise&quot;, a collaboration with producer A.R. Rahman, for which an official music video was released. &quot;If I Rise&quot; was written for &quot;127 Hours&quot;, a thriller film directed by Danny Boyle. The soundtrack features a mix of electric guitars with orchestral arrangements and sound loops, and &quot;If I Rise&quot; is featured in the climax of the film. The song was nominated for Satellite Award, Houston Film Critics Society Awards and Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award, as well as the 83rd Academy Award for Original Song. It won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song.

Dido&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Girl Who Got Away&quot;, was released by Sony Music Entertainment in March 2013. &quot;No Freedom&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in January 2013. The album was recorded in London and California and features production from Rollo Armstrong, Sister Bliss, Lester Mendez, A. R. Rahman, Rick Nowels, Greg Kurstin, Brian Eno, and Jeff Bhasker. Dido appeared on the second series of televised singing competition &quot;The Voice UK&quot; in May 2013, serving as an advisor to coach Danny O&#x27;Donoghue during the show&#x27;s battle rounds.

In November 2013, Dido released the album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, a compilation of previous material and remixes that also included a new track, &quot;NYC&quot;. The release of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; completed Dido&#x27;s contractual obligations with RCA Records, and she spoke of her plans to release her music independently. By late 2013, she was writing material for a fifth studio album.

===2018–present: &quot;Still on My Mind&quot; and &quot;The Last Summer&quot;===
Dido signed to BMG to release her fifth album in early 2019. Dido worked with her brother and long-time collaborator Rollo Armstrong, along with Rick Nowels and Ryan Louder. On 9 November 2018, Dido announced her new album&#x27;s title, &quot;Still on My Mind&quot;, along with its cover. It was released on 8 March 2019 and charted at number 3 on the UK Albums chart, number 1 on the UK Indie Album chart and sold over 60,000 copies in the UK. The teaser single &quot;Hurricanes&quot; was released on 12 November 2018. The official lead single &quot;Give You Up&quot; was premiered 22 January 2019 on BBC Radio 2. The single peaked at number 32 on the UK Singles Download chart. It peaked at number 1 on the US Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;Give You Up&quot; was followed by edited versions of &quot;Take You Home&quot; (released 5 April 2019) and &quot;Friends&quot; (released 22 July 2019) as singles. Dido toured in support of the album from May 2019, making it her first world tour in 15 years. The deluxe edition of the album was released on 15 November 2019 but failed to chart, despite the release of another single, &quot;Just Because&quot;.

Dido was featured on her brother Rollo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Summer&quot; album, which was released on 11 October 2019, under the alias &quot;R Plus&quot;. The album charted at number 96 on the UK Album Sales Chart. Dido featured on the singles &quot;Summer Dress&quot;, &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; and &quot;My Boy&quot;, with another feature appearing on &quot;Together (In These Times)&quot; and alternate version of &quot;The Last Summer&quot; album track &quot;Together&quot;. The deluxe version of &quot;The Last Summer&quot; was credited to both R Plus and Dido.

In February 2023, Dido appeared on American singer-songwriter Caroline Polachek&#x27;s album &quot;Desire, I Want to Turn Into You&quot; on the track &quot;Fly to You&quot; alongside Polachek and singer Grimes, and is credited as a co-writer. On May 18, 2023, Jason Derulo released the single &quot;When Love Sucks&quot;, which samples &quot;Thank You&quot;, and includes a feature credit for Dido. In December 2023, Belgian-Greek DJ duo Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike released &quot;Thank You (Not So Bad)&quot; alongside Dido, Tiësto and W&amp;W, which was a reimagining of Dido&#x27;s &quot;Thank You&quot;; she re-recorded her vocals for the remake. It peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart, and became Dido&#x27;s first song to place on the main UK singles chart since &quot;No Freedom&quot; in 2013 and her highest charting song since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;.

==Other work==
In addition to her solo work, Dido has co-written and provided vocals for tracks with Faithless, including &quot;One Step Too Far&quot;—which was released in the UK as a limited edition single, where it debuted at number six—and &quot;No Roots&quot;, the title track of the fourth Faithless album. Rollo—Dido&#x27;s brother—co-writes and co-produces much of Dido&#x27;s solo material, including many tracks on &quot;No Angel&quot;, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; and &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot;.

She provided guest vocals for each of the six studio albums by Faithless, from 1996&#x27;s &quot;Reverence&quot; to 2010s &quot;The Dance&quot;. Dido worked with her brother on a CD to accompany the children&#x27;s book he wrote with Jason White, &quot;Safe from Harm&quot;; the CD is also titled &quot;Safe from Harm&quot; and the artist is listed as &quot;Dusted&quot;. She co-wrote Britney Spears&#x27;s worldwide number one hit &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;, soundtrack feature track to Spears&#x27;s first major film debut, and co-wrote the song &quot;Never Ending&quot; on Rihanna&#x27;s 2016 album Anti. Dido&#x27;s song &quot;Thank You&quot; was also sampled by Rihanna for &quot;Never Ending&quot;.

Dido has provided guest vocals to tracks by other artists including &quot;Feels Like Fire&quot; for Carlos Santana&#x27;s 2002 album, &quot;Shaman&quot;, and a duet with Rufus Wainwright entitled &quot;I Eat Dinner (When the Hunger&#x27;s Gone)&quot; for the &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; film soundtrack. A sample of the Dido track &quot;Do You Have a Little Time&quot; is used on the song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Trust Me?&quot; by Tupac, on the album &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot;, which was almost entirely produced by Eminem in 2004.

Dido joined Annie Lennox and 21 other female artists to raise awareness of the issue of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to unborn children in Africa. The collaborative single &quot;Sing&quot; was released on World Aids Day on 1 December 2007, in conjunction with Lennox&#x27;s appearance at the Nelson Mandela 46664 concert in South Africa.

== Personal life ==

After releasing &quot;No Angel&quot; in 1999, and after much time spent promoting the album, Dido broke up with her fiancé, entertainment lawyer Bob Page, after a twelve-year relationship. Dido then married author Rohan Gavin in 2010. They have one son, Stanley, who was born in July 2011.

Dido says she is a &quot;diehard&quot; lifelong supporter of Premier League football club Arsenal.

She holds dual British-Irish citizenship by virtue of having an Irish father.

<text>I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow (1955) is a biopic that tells the story of Lillian Roth, a Broadway star who rebels against the pressure of her domineering mother and struggles with alcoholism after the death of her fiancé. It stars Susan Hayward, Richard Conte, Eddie Albert, Margo, and Jo Van Fleet.

The screenplay was adapted by Helen Deutsch and Jay Richard Kennedy from the 1954 autobiography by Lillian Roth, Mike Connolly and Gerold Frank. It was directed by Daniel Mann.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design for Helen Rose, and had three other Academy Award nominations, including Best Actress for Susan Hayward. It was entered into the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, where Hayward won the prize for Best Actress.

==Plot==
Eight-year-old Lillian Roth (Carole Ann Campbell) constantly is pushed by her domineering stage mother Katie (Jo Van Fleet) to audition and act, even though she is merely a child. One day, Katie secures an opportunity in Chicago, which leads to Lillian, now older (Susan Hayward), to having a successful musical career. Even though 20 years have passed, Katie still is managing Lillian, as well as running her life and career choices.

Although her mother does not tell her, Lillian finds out that her childhood friend David (Ray Danton) tried to get in contact with her. She visits him in the hospital, and they soon fall in love. Because David is an entertainment company lawyer, he is able to secure Lillian shows at some big venues, including one at the Palace Theatre. However, there is latent tension between David and Katie because he feels that Katie is projecting her own ambitions onto Lillian and overworking her, and Katie feels a new man in Lillian&#x27;s life only serves to distract from her high-profile career. When Lillian informs her mother she intends to marry David, Katie is disappointed and sees a repeat of her own life happening—giving up a career to have a husband and children. Suddenly, David falls ill and dies during the opening night of her show, and she is despondent at having lost the love of her life.

Rebelling against her mother&#x27;s domineering ways, Lillian turns to drinking. One night, in a drunken stupor, she goes out with an aviator, Wallie (Don Taylor), and marries him that night but does not remember it. They remain married, but the marriage is loveless from the beginning. The only thing the two have in common is drinking, and both drink to forget the present. Lillian&#x27;s career suffers as a result of her persistent alcoholism, and she spends all her money without booking new shows. The two divorce after Wallie says he is &quot;sick of being Mr. Lillian Roth.&quot;

Two years later, Lillian meets fellow alcoholic Tony Bardeman (Richard Conte) at a dinner party, and she falls for him. However, Lillian goes through alcohol withdrawal when she stops drinking to please her mother, and instead she turns to being a secret drinker. Her drinking gets worse when Tony goes home to California, but when he returns, Lillian begs him to stay with her. They decide to stop drinking together, but once they are married, Tony starts to drink, and Lillian is outraged. When she tries to stop him from drinking and leave, he beats her.

She escapes Tony&#x27;s clutches and goes to New York City to live with her mother, but contemplates suicide after a fight with her mother. Lillian goes to an Alcoholics Anonymous shelter, and suffers bouts of delirium tremens as she goes through withdrawals. She begins to fall for her sponsor Burt McGuire (Eddie Albert), but the crippling effects of childhood polio make him wary of pursuing anything romantic. As she continues her recovery, she is invited to appear on the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; television program to share her story of alcoholism and recovery.

<text>Summertime is a 1955 romantic comedy drama film directed by David Lean, and starring Katharine Hepburn, Rossano Brazzi, Darren McGavin, and Isa Miranda. It follows a lonely middle-aged American secretary and her experiences touring Venice alone for the first time, during which she falls in love with an Italian antiques dealer. Lean co-wrote the screenplay with H. E. Bates, based on the play &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot; by Arthur Laurents.

The film was shot on location in Venice in 1954 on Eastmancolor negative film with processing and prints by Technicolor. A co-production between the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy, &quot;Summertime&quot; was released theatrically by United Artists in the U.S. on June 21, 1955, and premiered in the United Kingdom later that Autumn under the alternative title &quot;Summer Madness&quot;.

==Plot==
Jane Hudson is an unmarried, middle-aged, self-described &quot;fancy secretary&quot; from Akron, Ohio, on her summer vacation, enjoying her lifelong dream of a trip to Venice after having saved money for it over several years. On the vaporetto to her hotel, she meets two fellow Americans, Lloyd and Edith McIlhenny. At the hotel, they are greeted by Signora Fiorini, a widow who has converted her home into a pensione. Also staying at the property are Eddie Yaeger, a young American painter, and his wife Phyl. Jane is pestered off and on during her stay by Mauro, a friendly Italian street urchin.

On her first evening in Venice, Jane walks to the Piazza San Marco, where the sight of so many romantic couples intensifies her loneliness. While seated at an outdoor caffe, she becomes aware of a lone Italian man watching her; panicked, she quickly leaves.

The following day, Jane goes shopping and sees a red glass goblet in an antiques store&#x27;s window. Upon entering the shop, she discovers that the owner, Renato de Rossi, is the man from whom she had fled the night before. He assures her that the goblet is an authentic 18th-century artifact, and she purchases it after he teaches her the art of bargaining. Hoping to see her again, Renato offers to search for a matching goblet. The next morning, Jane returns to the shop with Mauro, and is disappointed to discover that Renato is not there. Jane is humiliated when she accidentally steps backward into a canal while filming de Rossi&#x27;s shop. She begs Mauro to take her home to the Pensione Fiorini.

That evening, de Rossi comes to her pensione and confesses his attraction for her. When Jane resists his advances, he warns her not to waste an opportunity for happiness. She seems on the verge of agreeing to have dinner with him when the McIlhennys return from a shopping trip to Murano where they purchased a set of new red goblets similar to the one Jane bought. Renato realizes that Jane now thinks he has swindled her, but he assures her that the same designs have been used for centuries in Venice and he insists that her goblet is a genuine antique. Jane&#x27;s anger subsides, and the promise of Rossini in the Piazza San Marco convinces her to accept his invitation.

The couple attend the moonlit concert in the piazza, where an orchestra plays the overture to &quot;La gazza ladra&quot;. When a flower seller approaches them, Renato is surprised when Jane chooses a simple gardenia instead of an orchid. Later, as the couple wander through Venice, Jane drops her gardenia into a canal; despite much effort, Renato is unable to retrieve it for her. As they return to the pensione, Renato kisses Jane, and she responds passionately and murmurs, &quot;I love you&quot;, before rushing off to her room. The next day, Jane treats herself to salon treatments and new clothes in anticipation of their date that evening. While she waits for him at the piazza, Renato&#x27;s &quot;nephew&quot; Vito arrives and inadvertently reveals that he is actually Renato&#x27;s son. Stunned to discover Renato is married and has several children, Jane takes refuge in a bar where she encounters Phyl, who confides that her marriage to Eddie is in trouble.

Upon returning to the pensione, Jane discovers that Eddie is having an affair with Signora Fiorini, with Mauro acting as go-between. She is appalled, saying &quot;Something happens to this city at night.&quot; Renato arrives and tells her that in Italy things are different, and the relationship between the Signora and Eddie is none of her business. He admits that he is married, but claims that he and his wife are separated, which he had concealed because he did not want to scare her away. He accuses her of being immature and unwilling to accept what she can have rather than longing for the unattainable. Jane relents. Their date continues at an open-air courtyard night club, where they dance the night away. Afterwards, with fireworks in the distance, Jane and Renato go to Renato&#x27;s home where their affair is consummated.

The couple spend several idyllic days on Burano. Jane, unwilling to remain in a relationship she knows is destined to end unhappily, decides to return home early. Renato begs her to stay, but Jane insists on leaving, arguing that it is better to leave a party before it ends. Although Jane asks Renato not to come to the railway station, she hopes he will ignore her request. Later, on the station platform, Mauro runs up to say goodbye and offers Jane a free trinket as a gift. As the train begins to leave the station, Jane is thrilled to see Renato running down the platform. He tries to hand her a package through the window but the train is moving too quickly. He stops, opens the box and holds up his gift: another gardenia.

==Production==
===Development===
Arthur Laurents had written &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot; specifically for Shirley Booth, who starred in the 1952 Broadway production and won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance. Producer Hal Wallis expressed interest in purchasing the film rights, but felt Booth was too old for the role, and envisioned Katharine Hepburn and Ezio Pinza in the leads. Ilya Lopert ultimately acquired the rights with the intention of casting Booth and hiring Anatole Litvak to direct. It was later reported that she was negotiating with Daniel Mann instead, and Laurents would be adapting his play for the screen. Laurents&#x27; screenplay was allegedly unsatisfactory, and newly hired director David Lean tried to improve it with associate producer Norman Spencer and writers Donald Ogden Stewart and S.N. Behrman, but without success. He finally brought in novelist H.E. Bates to collaborate with him.

Numerous names were mentioned in conjunction with the project before filming finally began. At one point producer Lopert considered casting director-actor Vittorio De Sica as Renato. Roberto Rossellini expressed interest in directing the film with Ingrid Bergman as Jane, and Olivia de Havilland supposedly considered starring in the project.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place on location in Venice in the summer of 1954 on a budget of $1.1 million. It was one of the first British-produced films to be shot entirely on location. Interior sequences set in the Pensione Fiorini were filmed in studio, though the scenes occurring on the Pensione&#x27;s veranda were shot along Venice&#x27;s Grand Canal on a terrace constructed on an empty lot.

Italian government officials initially resisted director David Lean&#x27;s request to allow his crew to film on location during the summer months, the height of the tourist season, especially when local gondolieri, fearful they would lose income, threatened to strike if he was given permission to do so. The problem was resolved when United Artists made a generous donation to the fund established to finance the restoration of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. Lean also was required to promise the cardinal that no short dresses or bare arms would be seen in or near the city&#x27;s holy sites.

In one scene, Jane Hudson falls into a canal as she steps backwards while photographing Di Rossi&#x27;s shop in &quot;&quot;. Leading lady Katharine Hepburn, concerned about her health, was disinclined to do the stunt herself, but Lean felt it would be obvious if he replaced her with a stunt double. He filled the water with a disinfectant that caused it to foam, which added to Hepburn&#x27;s reluctance, then required her to film the scene approximately four times until he was satisfied with the results. To protect her skin, Hepburn was covered with Vaseline. Later that night, Hepburn&#x27;s eyes began to itch and water. She was eventually diagnosed with a rare form of conjunctivitis that plagued her for the rest of her life.

Upon seeing the completed film, Production Code Administration head Geoffrey Shurlock notified United Artists executives that the film would not be approved because of its depiction of adultery. Of particular concern was the scene in which Jane and Renato consummate their relationship. of film were deleted, and the PCA granted its approval. The National Catholic Legion of Decency, however, objected to a line of dialogue that was finally trimmed, and the organisation bestowed the film with a B-rating, designating the film &quot;morally objectionable in part&quot;.

==Release==
===Box office===
Following its premiere at Venice&#x27;s Palace Theatre on May 29, 1955, &quot;Summertime&quot; premiered on June 21, 1955 at the Astor Theatre in New York City. By January 1956, the film had grossed $2 million domestically. This was considered a disappointment but the film performed very well internationally.

The film was released in the United Kingdom in November 1955 under the title &quot;Summer Madness&quot;.

===Censorship===
The film was banned in India in 1955. Lean suspected the Indian film censors objected to the film due to its depiction of an American spinster falling in love with a married Italian man, despite the fact that his character is separated from his wife. In Germany, the film received several cuts, though Lean never divulged exactly what was excised from the original version.

==Critical reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed:

Film scholar Gene Phillips describes &quot;Summertime&quot; as a film that &quot;oscillates between an old-school farce&quot; and a &quot;more knowing, intimate depiction of relationships in modern society.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;stacks up as promising entertainment - with some reservations. There is a lack of cohesion and some abruptness in plot transition without a too-clear buildup. Lesser characterizations, too, are on the sketchy side. ... Rossano Brazzi ... scores a triumph of charm and reserve. Hepburn turns in a feverish acting chore of proud loneliness.&quot; Pauline Kael praised Hepburn&#x27;s performance in the film, deeming her &quot;probably the greatest actress of the sound era.&quot;

In the 21st-century, Laura Bushell of Channel 4 rated the film four out of five stars and commented, &quot;Hepburn made a career out of playing vibrant heroines with a vulnerable side and it&#x27;s her portrayal of Jane&#x27;s insecurity and loneliness that give the film its substance. ... &quot;Summertime&quot;&#x27;s notions of dating etiquette and holiday romance have dated greatly ... but as a coming-of-age story it remains touching. As a showcase for Katharine Hepburn, it is superb.&quot;

==Accolades==
===Home media===
The Criterion Collection released &quot;Summertime&quot; on LaserDisc in 1991, followed by a DVD edition in 1998. A Blu-ray edition was eventually issued by Criterion on July 12, 2022, featuring a new 4K restoration from the original film elements.

==Legacy==
In later years, Lean described &quot;Summertime&quot; as his favourite, and became so enamoured of Venice during filming that he made it his second home. Commenting on the film, Lean said: &quot;I&#x27;ve put more of myself in that film than any other I&#x27;ve ever made.&quot;

Right before his death, filmmaker Hal Ashby had pondered remaking the film. Rosanna Arquette revealed that Ashby had wanted her to play the role of Jane Hudson.

The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Summertime&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="190395" wikidata="Q2271150" url="?curid=190395" title="Louis-Joseph Papineau">
<text>Louis-Joseph Papineau (; October 7, 1786 – September 23, 1871), born in Montreal, Quebec, was a politician, lawyer, and the landlord of the &quot;seigneurie de la Petite-Nation&quot;. He was the leader of the reformist Patriote movement before the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–1838. His father was Joseph Papineau, also a politician in Quebec. Papineau was the eldest of eight children and was the grandfather of the journalist Henri Bourassa, founder of the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot;.

== Childhood and education ==

Papineau was described as an energetic child. He first studied in Montreal, at the Collège Saint-Raphaël from 1796 onwards, then at the Petit Séminaire de Québec, from 1802 to 1804. His arrival at the Petit Séminaire de Québec was highly anticipated, and his reputation preceding him. Upon graduation, he began an apprenticeship under his father with the goal of becoming a blacksmith, but this was quickly abandoned when the young Papineau turned to law, joining his cousin Denis-Benjamin Viger. Viger &quot;was for a time the assembly&#x27;s agent in London and became one of Papineau&#x27;s prominent supporters and close friends, but after the rebellion, he was to follow Lafontaine.&quot;

Papineau&#x27;s later childhood was mainly spent on the seigniory of la Petite Nation, located on the Ottawa river, which was purchased by his father in 1801 from the Quebec Seminary. During his time spent at the seigniory of La Petite-Nation, Papineau was sent to study at the College Saint-Raphaël in Montreal, where he rebelled and was forced to leave college. He was then sent to study at the Petit Seminaire de Québec, where he completed his secondary studies. Jérôme Demers was among his teachers.

In 1808 Papineau was elected member of parliament for Kent (now Chambly, Quebec) before being admitted to the Bar of Lower Canada in 1810. Later, he served as a militia officer in the War of 1812.

In 1822, he was sent to London with John Neilson to present a petition of 60,000 signatures against the Union project. While in the United Kingdom, he was replaced by Joseph-Rémi Vallières de Saint-Réal as Speaker.

In 1826, he was chosen leader of the Patriotes, a reformed and more radical &quot;Parti Canadien&quot;. In 1831, he sponsored a law which granted full equivalent political rights to Jews, 27 years before anywhere else in the British Empire. The events that led to Jews receiving full citizenship rights in Lower Canada in advance of other nations or territories in the British Dominion were due to the involvement of one Ezekiel Hart, a Jew who had proved his dedication to the burgeoning Canadian identity by raising money to support troops in Lower Canada to help in defence against United States invasion from the south.

Papineau was part of the committee that wrote the Ninety-Two Resolutions passed by the Legislative Assembly on February 21, 1834. The resolutions called for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of the people&#x27;s representatives.

== Speaker of the Legislative Assembly ==
Papineau was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada on January 21, 1815. The same year, he replaced Pierre-Stanislas Bédard as leader of the &quot;Parti Canadien&quot;. Under his leadership, the party worked for the reform of Lower Canada&#x27;s political institutions and strongly opposed the abuses of the appointed Legislative Council.

In 1820, he refused a position on the Legislative Council offered by governor Dalhousie.

== Leader of the Patriotes ==
The British government eventually responded to the 92 Resolutions by issuing ten resolutions of their own, the Russell Resolutions (named after the Home Secretary, Lord John Russell). The British government rejected all of the 92 Resolutions. After the arrival of the Russell Resolutions in Lower Canada on March 6, 1837, Papineau led the movement of protest and participated in numerous popular assemblies. He led the committee that organized the boycott of essentially all British imports to Lower Canada. On November 15, he created the &quot;Conseil des Patriotes&quot; with Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan. He and O&#x27;Callaghan fled Montreal for Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu on November 16, after governor Lord Gosford ordered their arrest and that of 25 other Patriot leaders. Papineau and O&#x27;Callaghan went to the home of Wolfred Nelson. He crossed the United States border on November 25.

== In exile ==

On February 8, 1839, he departed to leave New York City for Paris where he hoped to get France involved. In May, he published the &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;insurrection du Canada&quot; (History of the insurrection in Canada) in the magazine &quot;Progrès&quot;. Despite meeting with influential politicians such as Lamartine and Lamennais, the France of Louis-Philippe also remained neutral. After his wife left in 1843 &quot;he spent a large part of his leisure in the main archival repositories in Paris, where he copied documents relating to French rule in Canada&quot;.

His role in the 1837 rebellions against British rule forced him into a period of exile, during which he visited Italy and Switzerland. In 1845, three years after he was granted amnesty by the colonial government, he returned to Montreal in what was now the united Province of Canada.

== Return to politics ==

In 1848, he was elected member of the new united Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in the riding of Saint-Maurice. In severe disagreement with the emerging French Canadian Liberal Party, he sat as an independent member. A convinced republican after a long exile in the United States and France, Papineau supported the Montreal Annexation Manifesto that called for Canada to join the United States of America.

Papineau, along with John Molson Jr., the son of John Molson, and Horatio Gates, served as the first Vice-Presidents of the Montreal Mechanics&#x27; Institute. He participated in the creation of the &quot;Parti rouge&quot;. He was defeated in 1851 but elected in a by-election in 1852. He did not present himself again in the elections of 1854. He retired from public life and reappeared only once to hold a conference at the &quot;Institut Canadien de Montréal&quot; in December 1867. He died at his manor in Montebello, Quebec near the modern Château Montebello on September 23, 1871.

== Memorials ==
Both Papineau&#x27;s manor house in Montebello and his house in Montreal are National Historic Sites, and both are units of the national park system. The one in Montreal, designated in 1968, is closed to the public, but the Montebello property, designated in 1986, is open seasonally, from May to October. Papineau, himself, was named a National Historic Person in 1937. A federal plaque reflecting that status was finally unveiled in 2022, with plans to install it at Montebello.

On October 21, 2012, a monument to his memory was unveiled at Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu by Quebec Premier Pauline Marois.

Papineau is commemorated by a public artwork installed in the metro station, Papineau that serves the street named for his father Joseph Papineau. L&#x27;École Secondaire Louis-Joseph Papineau in Montreal was named after him.

== Family ==

<doc id="190398" wikidata="Q1889498" url="?curid=190398" title="Interrupted Melody">
<text>Interrupted Melody is a 1955 American musical biopic film starring Eleanor Parker, Glenn Ford, Roger Moore, and Cecil Kellaway. Directed by Curtis Bernhardt, it was filmed in CinemaScope and Eastman Color, and produced for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Jack Cummings. With a screenplay by Lawrence, Sonya Levien, and William Ludwig, the operatic sequences were staged by Vladimir Rosing, and Eileen Farrell provided the singing voice for Parker. It tells the story of Australian soprano Marjorie Lawrence&#x27;s rise to fame as an opera singer and her subsequent triumph over polio with her husband&#x27;s help.

==Plot==

The story traces Marjorie&#x27;s long, hard road to the top, her success on two continents, and her turbulent marriage to American doctor Thomas King. While touring South America in 1941, Lawrence is stricken with polio, which not only abruptly stops her career but briefly robs her of the will to live. With her husband&#x27;s help, she makes a triumphant return to opera and the concert stage, beginning by singing for hospitalized soldiers and troops overseas. She returns to the Metropolitan Opera, appearing in a full production of Wagner&#x27;s Tristan und Isolde.

==Cast==
* Glenn Ford as Dr. Thomas King
* Eleanor Parker as Marjorie Lawrence
* Roger Moore as Cyril Lawrence
* Cecil Kellaway as Bill Lawrence
* Peter Leeds as Dr. Ed Ryson
* Evelyn Ellis as Clara
* Walter Baldwin as Jim Owens
* Ann Codee as Mme. Cécile Gilly
* Leopold Sachse as himself
* Stephen Bekassy as Comte Claude des Vignaux

==Production==
===Development===
In 1947, it was reported that Marjorie Lawrence was writing her memoirs, titled &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;, and that she wanted Greer Garson to play her in a film. The book was published in 1950. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;engrossing&quot;.

In June 1951, MGM, which had just had a huge success with &quot;The Great Caruso&quot;, another biopic of an opera star, announced that it had bought the screen rights to the book. Jack Cummings was going to produce, and Kathryn Grayson was a possible star. Other possible leads were Greer Garson and Deborah Kerr, who would use Lawrence&#x27;s voice. Lawrence flew to Hollywood in July to have discussions with Cummings and Sonya Levien, who was to do the script. In December, MGM announced Lana Turner would play the lead with filming to begin in February. However, filming did not proceed. In July 1952, MGM said Garson would be playing the lead and William Ludwig was working on the script. By February 1953, the studio had postponed production again. In December 1953, the film was put back on MGM&#x27;s schedule with Garson still attached.

On April 7, 1954, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that Eleanor Parker would play the part because all the other candidates, with the exception of Lana Turner, had left MGM. The article reported that Lawrence had recorded the songs for the film. Filming started in September 1954. According to Parker, the filmmakers could not use Marjorie Lawrence&#x27;s voice, because she had lost her upper register. Parker could read music and had a firm soprano voice with perfect pitch. She prepared for the singing aspect of her role by listening to the numbers for weeks, and she sang them during the filming in full voice instead of lip-synching. The singing was dubbed by Eileen Farrell, who appears on screen early in the film, as a student struggling to hit a high note in a scene with the singing teacher Mme. Gilly (Ann Codee) .

Glenn Ford would only appear in the film if he got top billing. Parker says: &quot;I wanted to do what was right for the picture, so I said: &#x27;Let him have the top billing.&#x27; Glenn was a kind of a difficult man, but he was right for the picture and a very fine actor.&quot;

A key supporting role was given to Roger Moore, who had just made &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; for MGM and had been put under contract to the studio.

Filming had finished by November 1954. The film was previewed in January 1955.

In February 1955, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a photo spread showing scenes from the film.

==Reception==
According to MGM records, the film cost $2,367,000 to produce, and made $1,801,000 in the US and Canada and $2,227,000 overseas.

In a contemporary review of the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther described it as &quot;tender and moving,&quot; &quot;a stirring drama, plus a handsome and melodious one,&quot; and &quot;a tale of personal triumph and recovery that is rendered the more eloquent and taut by the ample production of gorgeous music.&quot; Film critic Derek Winnert wrote in 2013 that the film &quot;is still an extremely enjoyable old-style heart-lifter and spirit-raiser. It is Parker’s show all the way but Glenn Ford is on top form too as the husband,&quot; and noted that &quot;Eileen Farrell performs Parker’s vocals in eight beautiful arias – from Verdi, Puccini, Richard Wagner and Bizet’s Carmen. Amusingly, Farrell [also] plays a singing student of Mme Gilly (Ann Codee) who cannot seem to hit the right notes.&quot;

<doc id="190405" wikidata="Q486591" url="?curid=190405" title="Anastasia (1956 film)">
<text>Anastasia is a 1956 American historical drama film directed by Anatole Litvak and starring Ingrid Bergman, Yul Brynner and Helen Hayes. The screenplay written by Arthur Laurents is adapted from a 1952 play of the same title by French dramatist Marcelle Maurette, which is in turn inspired by the story of Anna Anderson, the best known of the many Anastasia impostors who emerged after the Imperial family were murdered in July 1918.

Set in interwar France, the film follows a plot related to rumors that the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the youngest daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, survived the execution of her family in 1918. Russian General Bounine (Brynner), former leader of the White Army during the Russian Revolution, along with his associates plot to swindle an inheritance of £10 million from the Grand Duchess using an amnesiac (Bergman) who looks remarkably like the missing Anastasia. The exiled émigrés of the Russian aristocracy, in particular the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna (Hayes), must be convinced that their handpicked claimant is legitimate if the plotters are to get her money.

The film represented a Hollywood comeback for its star Ingrid Bergman, after several years working exclusively in Europe following her much-publicized affair with Roberto Rossellini. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress for her performance.

==Plot==
Though the last Russian Tsar and his family were executed in 1918, rumors persisted that his youngest daughter, the Grand Duchess Anastasia, somehow survived. In 1928 Paris, Anna Koreff, an ailing woman resembling Anastasia, is brought to the attention of former White Russian General Bounine, now the proprietor of a successful Russian-themed nightclub. Bounine knows that while Anna was in a mental asylum being treated for amnesia, she told a nun that she was Anastasia. When approached by Bounine and addressed as the grand duchess, she refuses to have anything to do with him. She flees and tries to throw herself into the River Seine, but is stopped.

Bounine meets with his associates Boris Chernov and Piotr Petrovin. Bounine has already repeatedly raised funds from stockholders (eager to gain a share of £10 million belonging to Anastasia held by an English bank) based on his claim that he had found Anastasia. Privately he admits it is a scam. But the stockholders have lost their patience and given him eight days to produce her.

Bounine arranges for Anna to be intensively trained to pass as Anastasia. During this time, she and Bounine begin to develop feelings for one another. Later, in a series of carefully arranged encounters with former familiars and members of the imperial court, Anna begins to display a confidence and style that astonish her skeptical interlocutors.

Anna has to go to Copenhagen, where she has to convince the highly skeptical dowager empress, Anastasia&#x27;s grandmother, that she is Anastasia Romanov. Meanwhile, Bounine becomes increasingly jealous of the attentions that Prince Paul, another fortune hunter, pays to Anna. At a grand ball in Copenhagen at which Anna/Anastasia&#x27;s engagement to Paul is to be announced, the dowager empress has a final private conversation with her. Although aware of Bounine&#x27;s machinations, Empress Marie Feodorovna believes that Anna is truly her granddaughter. Realizing that Anna has fallen in love with Bounine, she helps her run away with him. The empress then makes it known to those around her that Anna is not Anastasia, although it is left ambiguous if she accepts that notion.

== Background ==

=== Historical basis ===

The play and film are both inspired by the phenomenon of Anastasia impostors, who appeared in the years following the Russian Imperial Romanov family&#x27;s death in July 1918. Due to the disposal method of the remains and later Soviet government attempts to downplay the killings, claims of surviving Romanov family members would percolate for years to come. The location of Anastasia&#x27;s remains would not be confirmed until 2007.

Anna Anderson (born: Franziska Schanzkowska) was arguably the best known of the Anastasia impersonators. In February 1920 she was institutionalized in a Berlin mental hospital after a suicide attempt. She initially refused to identify herself, later going by &quot;Anna Tchaikowsky&quot;. Over the next few years, the woman was identified by several White Russian émigrés as Anastasia. She lived with a succession of émigrés and exiled White Russian nobles, with varying degrees of belief or skepticism in her identity as Anastasia. She eventually died in the United States in 1984. 

=== Literary and stage adaptation ===
Anderson&#x27;s supposed identity was a popular sensation from the early-to-mid 1920s, with various books and pamphlets repeating her claims published throughout the years. 

Two such books, the pro-Anderson Harriet von Rathlef&#x27;s &quot;Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe&quot; (&quot;Anastasia, a Woman&#x27;s Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe&quot;) and the anti-Anderson Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch&#x27;s &quot;La Fausse Anastasie&quot; (&quot;The False Anastasia&quot;) were adapted into a play by French dramatist Marcelle Maurette, which toured Europe and America with Viveca Lindfors in the title role. 

While the play and film depict Tsarina Marie Feodorovna as privately accepting Anna&#x27;s legitimacy, the actual Tsarina publicly denounced the Anderson as an imposter in 1928. The Copenhagen Statement, as it would come to be known, explained: &quot;Our sense of duty compels us to state that the story is only a fairy tale. The memory of our dear departed would be tarnished if we allowed this fantastic story to spread and gain any credence.&quot; 

The play and film do not reveal whether Anna is the Romanov princess, but suggests through subtle hints that she is. The gradual realization of her true identity is juxtaposed against Bounine&#x27;s growing romantic interest in Anna. In one speech, he says to Anna/Anastasia that he cares for who she is and not what her name is.

==Production==

=== Casting ===
The film marked Bergman&#x27;s return to working for a Hollywood studio after several years of working in Italy with her husband, Roberto Rossellini. (Their marriage had caused a scandal, as he divorced his then current wife, Marcella DeMarchis to be with her.)

The film was also a comeback for Helen Hayes. She had suspended her career for several years due to the death of her daughter Mary, and her husband&#x27;s failing health.

=== Filming ===

&quot;Anastasia&quot; was primarily filmed on-location in Paris, with a second unit capturing location footage of Copenhagen. The studio interiors were shot at MGM-British Studios at Borehamwood, England. The Alexander Nevsky Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Paris, which was a center of worship for Russian aristocrats and other émigrés from St. Petersburg in the city, is featured in one of the early scenes. Knebworth House was used to represent the Empress Marie’s palace.

== Reception ==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 15 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 61 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Mae Tinee of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called the film &quot;Beautifully balanced with history and fantasy woven into a background of searing sorrow and royal pomp, this is one of the year&#x27;s most enjoyable films. It is presented with wit, warmth, delicacy, and skill.&quot;

Many critics emphasized the film&#x27;s status as Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s comeback vehicle. Jean Yothers of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; wrote &quot;After an absence of seven years from American-made films, beauteous Ingrid Bergman returns triumphantly.&quot; Moira Walsh of &quot;America&quot; wrote &quot;Given a chance, Miss Bergman looks as lovely as ever and gives an effective high-tension performance.&quot;

Some critics believed the film was bound too much to the static settings and theatrical &quot;scenes&quot; of the play, but additional, essentially decorative, ball scenes were added to open up the action.

=== Awards and nominations ===
=== Twin film ===
A West German film based on Anna Anderson, &quot;The Story of Anastasia&quot; (German: &quot;Anastasia, die letzte Zarentochter&quot;) was released the same year. Both films star Ivan Desny. (see: twin films)

<text>, born Eijirō Oguri, was a Japanese author and an important mystery novelist in pre-war Japan.
==Biography==
Oguri was born in Kanda, Tokyo. His father died in 1911, and the family managed to support themselves financially thanks to the support of the main family branch and the income from renting a house.

In September 1922, Oguri began working at a printing press. During this period, he took interest in literature, and during the four years he worked there, he wrote a series of detective novels and stories: &quot;Aru Kenji no Isho&quot;, &quot;Gen&#x27;naiyaki Rokuju Kazuhisa&quot;, &quot;Benigara Rakuda no Himitsu&quot; and &quot;Madōji&quot;. These last three works would later be published in 1936 (&quot;Aru Kenji no Isho&quot; was published in 1927).

==Major works==
Oguri&#x27;s major works include:
*&quot;Black Death Hall Murders&quot; (Kokushikan Satsujinjiken, 黒死館殺人事件)
*&quot;Perfect Crime&quot; (Kanzen Hanzai, 完全犯罪)

According to researcher Sari Kawana, he was one of the authors involved in writing &quot;mad scientist murders,&quot; a subgenre within the larger stream of Japanese detective fiction during the 1920s and 1930s. He used the motif of the &quot;mad scientist&quot; and his uncompromising attitude toward his work to criticize the widespread overconfidence in the possibilities of science and to highlight the potential incompatibility between science and ethics. Other writers involved in that genre were Kozakai Fuboku, Yumeno Kyusaku, and Unno Juza.

<text>was a novelist of the &quot;Buraiha&quot; genre in Shōwa period Japan. His name was also pronounced &quot;Tanaka Eiko&quot; on occasion.

== Biography ==
Tanaka was born in the uptown Akasaka district of Tokyo as the son of a historian; however, he was listed under his mother&#x27;s maiden name of “Tanaka” in the family register rather than his father&#x27;s surname of Iwasaki. He grew up in Kamakura and was a graduate of Waseda University’s School of Political Science and Economics. While still a student, he was influenced by his newspaper journalist brother towards a literary career, and towards membership in the Japan Communist Party. However, he was discouraged by the corruption of the senior leadership of the party, and left before graduation. Shortly after graduation, he met Dazai Osamu, who became his mentor.

Also while still a university student, Tanaka was a member of the Japanese Olympic team to the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, where he participated as a rower. Although he competed in eight events, he was eliminated during the qualifying round. This experience led to two novels: &quot;Orinposu no Kajitsu&quot; (&quot;The Fruit of Olympus&quot;, 1940) and &quot;Tantei Soshu&quot; (&quot;The Boat Rower&quot;, 1944).

In 1935, he was hired by the Yokohama Rubber Company and was sent to Keijo, or today&#x27;s Seoul, Korea under the Japanese rule. He was used by Japanese authorities in Korea to organize Korean writers for a Greater East Asia Writer&#x27;s Conference, the events of which he portrayed with bitterness and cynicism in his post-war novel &quot;The Drunken Ship&quot;.

He married Kiyo Kojima in 1937. He returned to Japan in 1944, and lived in Shizuoka Prefecture. In 1947, leaving his wife in Shizuoka, he moved to Shinjuku, Tokyo with his mistress.

After World War II, Tanaka re-joined the Japan Communist Party, but was so critical of its leadership that he was later expelled. He was greatly shocked by the suicide of his mentor Dazai Osamu. In his later years, he suffered from alcoholism, drug abuse and mental instability. He committed suicide at the grave of Dazai Osamu in 1949 by cutting his wrists after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in central Tokyo.

<doc id="190412" wikidata="Q336437" url="?curid=190412" title="John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham">
<text>John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, (12 April 1792 – 28 July 1840), also known as &quot;Radical Jack&quot; and commonly referred to in Canadian history texts as Lord Durham, was a British Whig statesman, colonial administrator, Governor General and high commissioner of British North America.

A leading reformer, Lord Durham played a major role in the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832. He later served as ambassador to Russia. He was a founding member and chairman of the New Zealand Company that played a key role in the colonisation of New Zealand.

George Woodcock wrote Lord Durham was &quot;proud, wayward, immensely rich, with romantic good looks and an explosive temper&quot;, one of those &quot;natural rebels who turn their rebellious energies to constructive purposes. Both at home and abroad he became a powerful exponent of the early nineteenth-century liberal spirit.&quot;

==Background and education==
Lambton was born 12 April 1792 in the house of his father William Henry Lambton at 14 Berkeley Square in St George Hanover Square (now within the City of Westminster). His mother was Lady Anne Barbara Frances, daughter of George Bussy Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey. He was christened with the names of his grandfathers, John Lambton and George Villiers. At the time of his birth, his father was taking part in the formation and chairing of the Society of the Friends of the People.

After attending Eton College, Lambton joined the army in 1809 as a cornet in the 10th Hussars, but resigned in 1811. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1797, he inherited an immense fortune, derived largely from mining on lands surrounding Lambton Castle, the ancestral family home in County Durham, which formed the basis of Lambton Collieries. Other properties in County Durham included Dinsdale Park and Low Dinsdale Manor..

In 1821, Lambton earned the epithet &quot;Jog Along Jack&quot; after he was asked what he considered an adequate income for an English gentleman and replying that &quot;a man might jog along comfortably enough on £40,000 a year&quot;.

Lambton supported educational projects such as the Mechanics&#x27; Institutes and the newly founded University of London.

==New Zealand==
In 1825 Lambton took the chairmanship of the New Zealand Company, a venture that made the first attempt to colonise New Zealand, with his interest being philanthropic. The venture failed at colonisation.

== Political career ==
Lambton was first elected to Parliament for County Durham in the general election of 1812, a seat he held until 1828, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Durham, of the City of Durham and of Lambton Castle in the County Palatine of Durham. In Parliament he supported liberal causes, from the defence of Queen Caroline to the removal of political disabilities on Dissenters and Roman Catholics. When his father-in-law Lord Grey became prime minister in 1830, he was sworn into the Privy Council and appointed Lord Privy Seal. Along with Lord Russell he was a leading promoter of reform. He helped draft the famous Reform Bill of 1832. It reformed the electoral system by abolishing tiny districts, gave representation to cities, gave the vote to small landowners, tenant farmers, and shopkeepers and to householders who paid a yearly rental of £10 or more and some lodgers.

Lord Durham resigned from the cabinet in 1833. Later that year he was further honoured, made Viscount Lambton and Earl of Durham. Between 1835 and 1837, he served as Ambassador to Russia. While in Russia, he was invested as a Knight of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, of the Order of St. Andrew and of the Order of St. Anna. In 1837, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

==Canada==
In 1838, Lord Durham was named Governor General and High Commissioner for British North America (several North American colonies administered collectively by the Colonial Office, including: the Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Cape Breton and Bermuda). A main task set for him was to investigate the political situation there after the Rebellions of 1837 in Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec) and recommendations as to necessary reforms.

Lord Durham and his longtime colleague Edward Gibbon Wakefield arrived in Lower Canada on 29 May 1838. One of his tasks as governor general was to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Lower Canada Rebellion of Louis-Joseph Papineau and the Upper Canada Rebellion of William Lyon Mackenzie, which had occurred in 1837. His decisions with regard to the Rebellion prisoners encountered stiff opposition at Westminster. He lost the support of the Prime Minister, Melbourne, whereupon he published his repudiation and resignation 9 October 1838 and set sail for London on 1 November.

Lord Durham&#x27;s detailed &quot;Report on the Affairs of British North America&quot; (London, January 1839) recommended a modified form of responsible government and a legislative union of Upper Canada, Lower Canada and the Maritime Provinces in order to assimilate the French Canadians, whom he considered inferior.

Lord Durham is lauded by some Canadian historians for his recommendation to introduce responsible government, which the British government did not accept. It took ten more years before a responsible parliament was established in the colonies. Colonial legislatures had existed in the two Canadas since 1791 but were toothless compared to appointed colonial administrators. Lord Durham is less well regarded for recommending the union of Upper and Lower Canada, which resulted in the creation of the united Province of Canada.

As early as 1844, Lord Durham&#x27;s intended policy of assimilation faced setbacks, as Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine&#x27;s party in the House forced &quot;de facto&quot; reestablishment of French as a language of Parliament. Once responsible government was achieved (1848), French Canadians in Canada East succeeded by voting as a bloc in ensuring that they were powerfully represented in any cabinet, especially as the politics of Canada West was highly factional. The resulting deadlock between Canada East and West led to a movement for federal rather than unitary government, which resulted in the creation of confederation, a federal state known as the Dominion of Canada, incorporating New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and dividing the United Canadas into two provinces, Ontario (Canada West) and Quebec (Canada East), in 1867.

==Family==

Lord Durham was twice married. He fell in love with Harriet Cholmondeley, the illegitimate daughter of the 4th Earl of Cholmondeley, but then aged under 21 and refused the required permission by his guardians to marry her, they married at Gretna Green on 1 January 1812, then in an Anglican ceremony at her father&#x27;s estate of Malpas, Cheshire, on 28 January that year. They had three daughters, who all predeceased him:

*Lady Frances Charlotte (16 October 1812 – 18 December 1835), married the Hon. John Ponsonby (later 5th Earl of Bessborough), but died a few months later of consumption.
*The Hon. Georgiana Sarah Elizabeth (2 March 1814 – 3 January 1833)
*The Hon. Harriet Caroline (30 May 1815 – 12 June 1832)
After Harriet&#x27;s death in July 1815, he married secondly Lady Louisa Grey, daughter of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, on 9 December 1816 at Lord Grey&#x27;s estate, Howick, Northumberland. She was an amateur artist. They had two sons and three daughters:

*The Hon. Charles William (16 January 1818 – 24 September 1831) – see &quot;The Red Boy&quot;
*Lady Mary Louisa (8 May 1819 – 9 March 1898), married James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin
*Lady Emily Augusta (17 May 1823 – 2 November 1886), married Henry Cavendish, son of the Hon. Henry Cavendish
*The Hon. George Frederick D&#x27;Arcy (5 September 1828 – 27 November 1879), later 2nd Earl of Durham
*Lady Alice Anne Caroline (16 April 1831 – 15 January 1907), married Sholto Douglas, Lord Aberdour (later 18th Earl of Morton)

Lord Durham died at Cowes on the Isle of Wight in July 1840, aged 48, and was buried at St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street. He was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son, George. The Countess of Durham only survived her husband by a year and died aged 44 on 26 November 1841 at Genoa from a serious cold.

==In literature==
In one of her occasional political forays, Letitia Elizabeth Landon in her poetical illustration to Sir Thomas Lawrence&#x27;s portrait, &#x27;The Right Honourable Lord Durham. Now on an Embassy at the Court of Russia&#x27; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833&#x27;, expresses her hopes that Lord Durham be able to persuade the Russians to return to Poland its lost freedom and sovereignty.
==Legacy==

Names given in honour of the Earl include Lambton County, Ontario, Lambton, Toronto (including Lambton Mills, Lambton Mills Cemetery and Lambton House), Lambton Avenue in Toronto, Lord Durham Public School (Ajax, Ontario, closed), Lambton, Québec, Lambton Quay, Lambton Ward and Lambton Harbour in Wellington in New Zealand, and Durham Heights and Cape Lambton (both in the southern tip of Banks Island in the Northwest Territories). The Penshaw Monument in County Durham, on a hill west of Sunderland, was built in his honour.

<text>Carroll Baker (born May 28, 1931) is an American retired actress. After studying under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, Baker began performing on Broadway in 1954. From there, she was recruited by director Elia Kazan to play the lead in the adaptation of two Tennessee Williams plays into the film &quot;Baby Doll&quot; in 1956. Her role in the film as a coquettish but sexually naïve Southern bride earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Baker had other early film roles in &quot;Giant&quot; (1956) and the romantic comedy &quot;But Not for Me&quot; (1959). In 1961, she appeared in the controversial independent film &quot;Something Wild&quot;, directed by her then husband Jack Garfein, playing a traumatized rape victim. She went on to star in several critically acclaimed Westerns in the 1950s and 1960s such as &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958), &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), and &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964).

In the mid-1960s, as a contract player for Paramount Pictures, Baker became a sex symbol after appearing as a hedonistic widow in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964). The film&#x27;s producer, Joseph E. Levine, cast her in &quot;Sylvia&quot; before giving her the role of Jean Harlow in the biopic &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965). Despite significant prepublicity, &quot;Harlow&quot; was a critical failure, and Baker relocated to Italy in 1966 amid a legal dispute over her contract with Paramount and Levine&#x27;s overseeing of her career. In Europe, she spent the next 10 years starring in hard-edged &quot;giallo&quot; and horror films, including Romolo Guerrieri&#x27;s &quot;The Sweet Body of Deborah&quot; (1968), a series of four films with Umberto Lenzi beginning with &quot;Orgasmo&quot; (1969) and ending with &quot;Knife of Ice&quot; (1972), and Corrado Farina&#x27;s &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; (1973). She re-emerged for American audiences as a character actress in the Andy Warhol–produced dark comedy &quot;Bad&quot; (1977).

Baker appeared in supporting roles in several acclaimed dramas in the 1980s, including the true-crime drama &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983) as the mother of murder victim Dorothy Stratten, and the racial drama &quot;Native Son&quot; (1986), based on the novel by Richard Wright. In 1987, she had a supporting part in &quot;Ironweed&quot; (1987). Through the 1990s Baker had guest roles in several television series, such as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, and &quot;Roswell&quot;. She also had supporting parts in several big-budget films, such as &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990) and the David Fincher–directed thriller &quot;The Game&quot; (1997). She formally retired from acting in 2003. In addition to acting, Baker is also the author of two autobiographies and two novels.

==Early life and education==
Baker was born and raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania into a Catholic family, the daughter of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, a traveling salesman. Baker is of Irish and Polish descent, which has given rise to a rumor that her birth name was Karolina Piekarski, though this currently cannot be substantiated by known records. Her parents separated when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and younger sister, Virginia, to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania.

According to Baker, her mother struggled as a single parent, and the family was poor for much of her upbringing.

Baker attended Greensburg Salem High School in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where she was a debate team member and active in the marching band and school musicals. At 18, she moved with her family to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg Junior College (now St. Petersburg College). After her first year in college, she began working as a magician&#x27;s assistant on the vaudeville circuit and joined a dance company, working as a professional dancer. In 1949, Baker won the title of Miss Florida Fruits and Vegetables. In 1951, Baker moved to New York City, where she rented a dirt-floor basement apartment in Queens. She worked as a nightclub dancer and also had stints as a chorus girl in traveling vaudeville shows, which took her to Windsor, Detroit, and New Jersey.

Baker studied acting at HB Studio. In 1952, she enrolled at the Actors Studio and studied under Lee Strasberg. There, she was a classmate of Mike Nichols, Rod Steiger, Shelley Winters, and Marilyn Monroe; she also became a close friend of James Dean for the rest of his life.

==Career==
===1952–1957: Beginnings===

After appearing in television commercials for Winston cigarettes and Coca-Cola, Baker was featured in an episode of &quot;Monodrama Theater&quot; performing a monodramatic piece, which was broadcast in 1952 on the DuMont Network. The following year, she made her film debut with a small walk-on part in the musical &quot;Easy to Love&quot; (1953). This led to her landing roles in two Broadway productions: Roger MacDougall&#x27;s &quot;Escapade&quot; in the fall of 1953, and Robert Anderson&#x27;s &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, opposite Ed Begley, which ran from September to mid-November 1954. In 1955, she screen tested and auditioned for the lead role in &quot;Picnic&quot;, but lost the part to Kim Novak. She was also considered for the lead in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955) after James Dean recommended her for the part to director Nicholas Ray, which she turned down.

Baker&#x27;s first major screen role was the supporting part of Luz Benedict II in &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), opposite Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean, in his final role. According to Baker, she had been offered numerous leading parts in feature films before that point, but chose to debut in a supporting role in &quot;Giant&quot; because she was &quot;insecure&quot; and &quot;wanted to start out a little less &#x27;profile. &quot;Giant&quot; was largely filmed in the small town of Marfa, Texas, in 1955; Baker recalled her experience on set, saying that James Dean and she were both enamored of Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor while filming.

Simultaneously, Baker was cast as the title character in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1956), a role initially intended for Marilyn Monroe. Tennessee Williams, who had written and developed the screenplay based on two of his one-act plays, wanted Baker to play the part after seeing her perform a scene from his script at the Actors Studio; likewise, Kazan had been impressed by her performance in &quot;All Summer Long&quot; on Broadway the year prior. Shot in Benoit, Mississippi, directly after Baker had completed &quot;Giant&quot;, her role in the film as a sexually repressed teenaged bride to a failed middle-aged cotton gin owner brought Baker overnight fame and a level of notoriety even before the film&#x27;s release. In the fall of 1956, artist Robert Everheart, under contract with Warner Bros., constructed a billboard in Times Square promoting the film, depicting the now-iconic image of a scantily clad Baker lying in a crib sucking her thumb. The controversial advertising campaign for the film caused a pre-emptive backlash from religious groups, and on December 16, 1956, Cardinal Francis Spellman of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral denounced the film and advised his parish against seeing it. A formal condemnation by the Roman Catholic National Legion of Decency ensued, which considered it &quot;grievously offensive to Christian and traditional standards of morality and decency&quot;.

In spite of this, &quot;Baby Doll&quot; opened to strong box-office receipts, grossing $51,232 in its first week at the Victoria Theater. In support of Baker, Marilyn Monroe appeared at the film&#x27;s premiere, working as an usherette to help bolster ticket sales, the proceeds of which were donated to the Actors Studio. Baker received immense critical praise for her performance. &quot;Variety&quot; said that her performance &quot;captures all the animal charm, the naivete, the vanity, contempt and rising passion of Baby Doll&quot;, while Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Baker&#x27;s ability to exhibit &quot;a piteously flimsy little twist of juvenile greed, inhibitions, physical yearnings, common crudities and conceits&quot;. &quot;Baby Doll&quot; established Baker as an A-list actress and would remain the film for which she is best remembered. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and won a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer, which she shared with Jayne Mansfield and Natalie Wood. The performance also earned her a Film Achievement Award from &quot;Look&quot;, as well as the title &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; in 1957 from Harvard University&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Club. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Life Magazine&quot; in June 1956.

===1958–1963: Contract disputes and independent films===

After the success of &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, Baker was subsequently offered parts in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1958), &quot;Too Much, Too Soon&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1959). She refused to make &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot;, so Warner Bros. put her on suspension, which prevented her from starring in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1958) at MGM. Baker was also chosen by MGM for the lead in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958) and by Twentieth Century Fox for &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot; (1957), but her contract with Warner Bros. again prevented her from accepting the roles. Tensions between Baker and the studio escalated further when she went against their wishes by appearing in &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; on stage. Baker commented on the effect of the system on her career, saying: &quot;I came in at the end of the big studio system. I still had a slave contract and they were willing to put you in almost anything they had.&quot;

After her suspension with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker appeared in William Wyler&#x27;s Western epic &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot was described as &quot;problematic&quot;: Baker was four months pregnant at the time and had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her on the verge of tears after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed &quot;The Big Country&quot; with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in &quot;The Miracle&quot; (1959), co-starring Roger Moore, and in &quot;But Not for Me&quot; (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Baker&#x27;s performance in &quot;But Not for Me&quot;, saying: &quot;Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks, but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time.&quot; She disliked &quot;The Miracle&quot; so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. &quot;But Not for Me&quot; was made at Paramount.

Baker went on to make the experimental film &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1961), directed by her then-husband Jack Garfein. In this independent production, she plays a young college student from the Bronx who is raped one night in St. James Park, and later held captive by a Manhattan mechanic (Ralph Meeker), who witnessed her subsequent suicide attempt. In preparation for her role, Baker lived alone in a boarding house in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, and gained employment as a department-store salesgirl; her Method approach to the role was profiled in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1960. Critical reaction to the film was largely negative, though &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; cited it as &quot;the most interesting American film of its quarter&quot;, and the most underrated film of 1961. However, its controversial depiction of rape led to critical backlash and public criticism, and the film has been credited by historians as nearly halting Baker&#x27;s career. The same year, she portrayed Gwen Harold in &quot;Bridge to the Sun&quot; (1961), a production by MGM based on the 1957 best-selling autobiography of a Tennessee-born woman who married a Japanese diplomat (portrayed by James Shigeta) and became one of the few Americans to live in Japan during World War II. While only a modest success at the box office, the film was well received by critics and was America&#x27;s entry at the Venice International Film Festival.

After this, Baker appeared in the independent British-German film &quot;Station Six-Sahara&quot; (1962) as a woman who provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), opposite James Stewart and Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin&#x27;s &quot;Come on Strong&quot; in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film &quot;Mister Moses&quot; (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of &quot;Life&quot;s July 1964 issue.

===1964–1966: Sex symbol roles===
Baker portrayed a pacifist Quaker schoolteacher in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964), and received critical acclaim for the role. She then had a supporting role as Saint Veronica in George Stevens&#x27; &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), and portrayed a cynical, alcoholic movie star in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964), which brought her a second wave of notoriety in spite of the film&#x27;s lackluster reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a sickly sour distillation&quot; of the source novel, but said Baker&#x27;s performance &quot;brought some color and a sandpaper personality as the sex-loaded widow.&quot; The film was the top moneymaker of that year, with domestic box-office receipts of $13,000,000, and marked the beginning of a tumultuous relationship with the film&#x27;s producer, Joseph E. Levine.

Based on her &quot;Carpetbaggers&quot; performance, Levine began to develop Baker as a movie sex symbol, and she appeared posing in the December 1964 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. She was subsequently cast by Levine in the title roles of two 1965 potboilers— &quot;Sylvia&quot;, as an ex-prostitute and con artist, and as Jean Harlow in &quot;Harlow&quot;. Baker appeared on the cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on their November 2, 1963, issue dressed as Harlow, promoting the film&#x27;s upcoming production. In 1965, she became an official celebrity spokesperson for Foster Grant sunglasses and appeared in advertisements for the company. Baker likened this era of her career to &quot;being a beauty contest winner [as opposed to] an actress&quot;.

Despite much prepublicity, &quot;Harlow&quot; received a lukewarm response from critics: &quot;Variety&quot; referred to Baker&#x27;s portrayal of Harlow as &quot;a fairly reasonable facsimile, although she lacks the electric fire of the original.&quot; Relations between Baker and Levine soured; in a 1965 interview, Baker sardonically commented: &quot;I&#x27;ll say this about Joe Levine: I admire his taste in leading ladies&quot;, which led the press to suspect a rift between the actress and producer. Baker sued Levine in 1966 over her contract with Paramount Pictures, and was ultimately fired by Paramount and had her paychecks from &quot;Harlow&quot; frozen amid the contentious legal dispute; this left Baker hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt (however, she was eventually awarded $1 million in compensation).

In an interview with Rex Reed in his book &quot;People Are Crazy Here&quot; (1974), Baker revealed that she had felt pressure in both her working relationship with Levine, and her domestic life with her husband who she said wanted to maintain an expensive lifestyle: &quot;We&#x27;d been very poor when we started out at the Actors Studio in New York&quot;, she told Reed. &quot;I was under contract to Joe Levine, who was going around giving me diamonds and behaving like he owned me. I never slept with him or anything, but everyone thought I was his mistress.&quot; In the spring of 1966, Baker returned to theatre, performing in a production of &quot;Anna Christie&quot; at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. The production was directed by Garfein. The production was heralded as the &quot;theatre event of the week&quot; in Los Angeles, though its reception was middling. Cecil Smith of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote of the production: &quot;The beautiful Miss Baker&#x27;s vehicle becomes a hearse.&quot; The play was also performed at the Tappan Zee Playhouse in Nyack, New York in June 1966.

===1967–1975: European films===

Baker separated from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children to pursue a career there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Baker became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged giallo, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, Baker had been invited to the Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in &quot;Her Harem&quot; (1967). This was followed with the horror films &quot;The Sweet Body of Deborah&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Devil Has Seven Faces&quot; (1971). Baker also starred in &quot;So Sweet... So Perverse&quot; (1969), &quot;Orgasmo&quot; (1969), &quot;A Quiet Place to Kill&quot; (1970), and &quot;Il coltello di ghiaccio&quot; (&quot;Knife of Ice&quot;) (1972), all giallo films directed by Italian filmmaker Umberto Lenzi.

Many of these films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing to do at the time. Baker became a favorite of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned &quot;Paranoia&quot;, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of &quot;Paranoia&quot;, Roger Ebert said: &quot;Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in &quot;Paranoia&quot;. I think maybe she was saying &#x27;the hell with it&#x27;, and having a good time.&quot; As with &quot;Paranoia&quot;, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: &quot;I think I made more films [there] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might ... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It&#x27;s wonderful to know about a different world.&quot;

She followed her roles in Lenzi&#x27;s films with a leading role in Corrado Farina&#x27;s &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; (1973) as the titular witch, alongside Isabelle De Funès and George Eastman. &quot;TV Guide&quot; referred to the film as an &quot;exceptionally handsome example of 1970s Italian pop-exploitation filmmaking sweetened by Piero Umilani&#x27;s lounge-jazz score&quot;, and praised Baker&#x27;s performance, but noted that she was &quot;physically wrong for the role; her elaborate lace-and-beribboned costumes sometimes make her look more like a fleshy Miss Havisham than a sleekly predatory sorceress&quot;.

===1976–1987: Return to American films; theater===

Baker&#x27;s first American film in over 10 years came in the Andy Warhol–produced black comedy &quot;Bad&quot; (1977), in which she plays the lead role of a Queens beauty salon owner who provides hitmen with jobs, starring alongside Susan Tyrrell and Perry King. &quot;You can hardly call making an Andy Warhol movie a &#x27;comeback&#x27;&quot;, said Baker. &quot;It&#x27;s more like going to the moon! The subject is totally unique.&quot;

She followed &quot;Bad&quot; with a part in the low-budget surrealist thriller &quot;The Sky Is Falling&quot; (1979) with Dennis Hopper, playing a washed-up actress living among expatriates in a Spanish village. The 1970s also had a return to the stage for Baker, where she appeared in British theater productions of &quot;Bell, Book, and Candle&quot;; &quot;Rain&quot;, an adaptation of a story by W. Somerset Maugham; &quot;Lucy Crown&quot;, an adaptation of the novel by Irwin Shaw; and &quot;Motive&quot;. In 1978, while touring England and Ireland in productions of &quot;Motive&quot;, Baker met stage actor Donald Burton, who became her third husband. She also appeared in American stage productions of Georges Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;13 Rue de l&#x27;Amour&quot;, &quot;Forty Carats&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot;.

By the 1980s Baker had largely become a character actress, and was based in London. She starred in a supporting role in the 1980 Walt Disney-produced horror film &quot;The Watcher in the Woods&quot;, alongside Bette Davis, after having been asked by British director John Hough, a longtime admirer of her work. After an appearance in the British television film &quot;Red Monarch&quot; (1983), she played the mother of murdered &quot;Playboy&quot; model Dorothy Stratten (played by Mariel Hemingway) in the biopic &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983). She also appeared as the mother of Sigmund Freud in the historical comedy &quot;The Secret Diary of Sigmund Freud&quot; (1984) with Carol Kane and Klaus Kinski.

Baker featured in &quot;Hitler&#x27;s SS: Portrait in Evil&quot; (1985), a coming-of-age drama set against Nazi Germany, as well as in the drama &quot;Native Son&quot; (1986), based on the novel by Richard Wright, which featured Matt Dillon, Geraldine Page, and a young Oprah Winfrey. In the latter Baker plays a 1930s Chicago housewife, mother of a teenage girl accidentally killed by an African American chauffeur, who attempts to cover up the accident. Critic Roger Ebert praised Baker&#x27;s performance, noting her &quot;powerful&quot; scene with Winfrey during the film&#x27;s finale.

Following &quot;Native Son&quot;, Baker had a critically acclaimed lead role as the wife of a schizophrenic drifter (played by Jack Nicholson) in &quot;Ironweed&quot; (1987), alongside Meryl Streep. Her performance in the film was praised by Ebert, who said: &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s homecoming [in the film] is all the more effective because Carroll Baker is so good as his wife ... she finds a whole new range. It may seem surprising to say that Baker holds the screen against Jack Nicholson, and yet she does&quot;.

===1988–2003: Later roles and retirement===
In 1990, Baker played the role of Eleanor Crisp—described by Roger Ebert as &quot;an effective bitch on wheels&quot;—in Ivan Reitman&#x27;s comedy &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which she filmed in Astoria, Oregon, in the summer of 1990. The film was a huge financial success, grossing over $200 million worldwide. Her film and television work continued throughout the &#x27;90s, and she acted in many made-for-television movies, including the true-crime story &quot;Judgment Day: The John List Story&quot; (1993), &quot;Witness Run&quot; (1996), and &quot;Dalva&quot; (1996) with Farrah Fawcett.

In 1997, Baker was cast in a supporting role in David Fincher&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Game&quot;, in which she plays a housekeeper to a billionaire San Francisco banker (played by Michael Douglas) who becomes embroiled in a sadistic game by his antagonistic brother, played by Sean Penn. In an interview with the &quot;New York Post&quot; following the film&#x27;s release, Baker commented on her role, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s an important movie and I&#x27;m honored to be in it. Of course, I&#x27;d like to be the romantic lead, and I&#x27;m actually closer to Michael&#x27;s [Douglas] age than Deborah Kara Unger is, [but] I think it&#x27;s always worked that way in Hollywood. When I was in my 20s, I played opposite Jimmy Stewart, Robert Mitchum, and Clark Gable, all of whom were old enough to be my father.&quot; &quot;The Game&quot; proved to be a major success among Baker&#x27;s later films, performing successfully at the box office and garnering widespread critical acclaim.

In addition to her work in big-budget productions, Baker also appeared in small, independent films, such as &quot;Just Your Luck&quot; (1996) and &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot; (1997). The 1990s also had Baker more frequently appearing on television series, including episodes of &quot;Grand&quot; (1990), &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1991, opposite Teri Garr in a segment directed by Michael J. Fox), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot; (both 1993); &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1995), and &quot;Roswell&quot; (1999). In 2000, she appeared in the Lifetime film &quot;Another Woman&#x27;s Husband&quot;. In 2002, Baker appeared in the documentary &quot;Cinerama Adventure&quot;, and guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot;, playing the mother of Rob Lowe&#x27;s character. Her role in &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot; was Baker&#x27;s last screen appearance before she formally retired from acting in 2003. Her acting career spanned 50 years, and more than 80 roles in film, television, and theater.

She has, however, sometimes participated in retrospective documentaries, including an interview for the 2006 DVD release of &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, which includes a documentary featuring Baker reflecting on the film&#x27;s impact on her career. Baker has also been featured in documentaries about several of her co-stars, including Clark Gable, Roger Moore, Sal Mineo, and James Dean, including the 1975 &quot;James Dean: The First American Teenager&quot;, and a 1985 BBC Radio 2 tribute marking the 30th anniversary of the actor&#x27;s death. Her memories of James Dean at the Actors Studio and later in &quot;Giant&quot; were recalled on BBC Radio 2 in 1982, when she guested on &quot;You&#x27;re Tearing Me Apart&quot;, Terence Pettigrew&#x27;s documentary which commemorated the 25th anniversary of Dean&#x27;s death in a car accident in 1955. Also on the program were singer-actor Adam Faith and the screenwriter Ray Connolly.

==Writing==
In 1983, Baker published an autobiography titled &quot;Baby Doll: An Autobiography&quot;, which detailed her life and career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to write an autobiography ... but I wanted to write, and I knew that would be the easiest thing to get published.&quot; She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: &quot;I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I&#x27;ve always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, &#x27;Yes, I&#x27;m an actress,&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t really say &#x27;I&#x27;m a writer.&#x27;&quot; In spite of Baker&#x27;s misgivings, &quot;Baby Doll: An Autobiography&quot; was well received. She later wrote two other books, &quot;To Africa with Love&quot; (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled &quot;A Roman Tale&quot; (1987).

==Personal life==

Baker has been married three times. She first married 54-year-old Louie Ritter, owner of the Weylin Hotel, in 1953. The marriage ended within a year, after which she enrolled at the Actors Studio in New York City. Baker alleged that Ritter had raped her when she was still a virgin in the early stages of their relationship. Her second was to director Jack Garfein, a Holocaust survivor she met at the Studio and for whom she converted to Judaism (having been raised a Catholic). They had one daughter, Blanche Baker (born 1956), also an actress, and a son, Herschel Garfein (born 1958), who is a composer and faculty member at the Steinhardt School of Music at New York University. Garfein and Baker divorced in 1969. Baker also has six grandchildren.

Baker married her third husband, British theater actor Donald Burton, on March 10, 1982, and resided in Hampstead, London, in the 1980s. The couple remained together until Burton&#x27;s death from emphysema at their home in Cathedral City, California, on December 8, 2007.

After leaving Hollywood in the mid-1960s, Baker traveled with Bob Hope&#x27;s Christmas USO troupe entertaining soldiers in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, an experience which she described as reformative: &quot;In the hospitals I held the hands of damaged young men, and I realized that my pain was not exclusive: that in this world there was suffering much more terrible than mine.&quot;

Baker resided mainly in New York City and Los Angeles throughout the 1950s and 1960s before relocating to Rome to pursue her career there. Baker was mainly based in Palm Springs, California, throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. , she resides in New York City. In February 2014, she served as maid of honor at longtime friend, psychologist, and former actor, Dr Patrick Suraci&#x27;s wedding to his partner, Tony Perkins, in New York.

==Legacy==

Baker&#x27;s role in &quot;Baby Doll&quot; was one that would come to be career-defining, and her association with both the film and character remained consistent throughout her career. In a 1983 article by &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;Baby Doll&quot; was referred to as Baker&#x27;s &quot;middle name&quot;. The film, adapted originally from Tennessee Williams&#x27; one-act play &quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot;, has been performed on stage into the 21st century: it had its theatrical debut in 2000, and has been performed numerous times since. Baker&#x27;s performance of the role was credited in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; as marking a significant cultural interest in the ingénue in American cinema.

In 2011, Baker attended the Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival in celebration of Williams&#x27; centenary. There, she participated in a panel with Rex Reed, where she discussed her experiences with Williams and performing in &quot;Baby Doll&quot;. In 2011 and 2012, she was awarded Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Hoboken and Fort Lauderdale International Film Festivals.

A 1956 photograph by Diane Arbus depicts Baker onscreen in &quot;Baby Doll&quot; with a passing silhouette during a New York City theater screening of the film. She was also photographed by Andy Warhol in 1975 as part of his Polaroid portrait series, and is mentioned in his published diaries.

Baker has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1725 Vine Street, which was erected on February 8, 1960. In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was also dedicated to her.

<doc id="190416" wikidata="Q797849" url="?curid=190416" title="Baby Doll">
<text>Baby Doll is a 1956 American black comedy film directed by Elia Kazan and starring Carroll Baker, Karl Malden and Eli Wallach. It was produced by Kazan and Tennessee Williams, and adapted by Williams from two of his own one-act plays: &quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot; and &quot;The Unsatisfactory Supper&quot;. The plot focuses on a feud between two rival cotton gin owners in rural Mississippi.

Filmed in Mississippi in late 1955, &quot;Baby Doll&quot; was released in December 1956. It provoked significant controversy, mostly because of its implied sexual themes, and the National Legion of Decency condemned the film.

Despite the moral objections, &quot;Baby Doll&quot; enjoyed a mostly favorable response from critics and earned numerous accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for Kazan and nominations for four other Golden Globe awards, four Academy Awards and four BAFTA Awards. Wallach won the BAFTA award for Most Promising Newcomer.

&quot;Baby Doll&quot; has been listed by some film scholars as among the most notorious films of the 1950s, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; included it in its &quot;Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;.

==Plot==
In the Mississippi Delta, bigoted, middle-aged cotton gin owner Archie Lee Meighan has been married to pretty, naïve 19-year-old &quot;Baby Doll&quot; Meighan for nearly two years. Archie Lee impatiently waits for her 20th birthday, when, by prior agreement with her now-deceased father, the marriage can finally be consummated. In the meantime, she sleeps in a crib, because the only other bedroom furniture in the house is the bed in which Archie sleeps; Archie, an alcoholic, spies on her through a hole in a wall. Baby Doll&#x27;s senile Aunt Rose Comfort lives in the house as well, much to Archie&#x27;s chagrin.

After Archie defaults on payments to a furniture-leasing company due to his failing cotton gin, virtually all the furniture in the house is repossessed, and Baby Doll threatens to leave. Archie&#x27;s competitor, a Sicilian-American named Silva Vacarro—who is manager of a newer, more modern, and more profitable cotton gin—has taken away all of Archie&#x27;s business. Archie retaliates by burning down Vacarro&#x27;s gin that night. Suspecting Archie as the arsonist, Vacarro visits the farm the following day with truckloads of cotton, offering to pay Archie Lee to gin for him.

Archie asks Baby Doll to entertain Vacarro while he supervises the work, and the two spend the day together. Vacarro explicitly inquires about Archie&#x27;s whereabouts the night before and makes sexual advances toward her. When Vacarro outright accuses Archie of burning down his gin, Baby Doll goes to find Archie, who slaps her in the face and leaves for town to purchase new parts for his gin. Vacarro comforts Baby Doll, and after becoming friendly, Vacarro forces her to sign an affidavit admitting Archie&#x27;s guilt. He then takes a nap in Baby Doll&#x27;s crib, and is invited for supper at Baby Doll&#x27;s request as a storm approaches.

Archie, drunk and jealous of Baby Doll&#x27;s romantic interest in Vacarro, angrily tells Aunt Rose she needs to move out of the house; Vacarro immediately offers to let her live with him as his cook, and Baby Doll and he flirt with each other and taunt Archie. After Vacarro confronts Archie with the affidavit, Archie retrieves his shotgun and chases Vacarro outside while Baby Doll calls the police.

The police arrive, and Archie is arrested when Vacarro presents them with the affidavit. Vacarro then leaves the farm, telling Baby Doll he will be back the following day with more cotton. As Archie is taken away by the police, remarking that it is Baby Doll&#x27;s birthday, Baby Doll and her Aunt Rose return inside the house to await Vacarro&#x27;s return.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===

Although the film&#x27;s title card reads &quot;Tennessee Williams&#x27; Baby Doll&quot; and the film is based on Williams&#x27; one-act play &quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot;, Elia Kazan claimed in his autobiography that Williams was only &quot;half-heartedly&quot; involved in the screenplay and that Kazan actually wrote most of it.

===Casting===
Kazan cast &quot;Baby Doll&quot; using numerous alumni of the Actors Studio, including each of the principal cast members. Carroll Baker was Kazan&#x27;s first choice for the title role, although Williams had considered Marilyn Monroe for the part. Williams favored Baker after she performed a scene from his script at the Actors Studio. Kazan had been impressed by her performance in &quot;All Summer Long&quot; on Broadway the year prior.

Eli Wallach was cast in his first screen role but was hesitant, as he was unfamiliar with film acting and lacked confidence in his ability.

Although racial segregation was still present in Mississippi at the time, several local black actors appear in bit parts.

Actors Studio alumnus Rip Torn appears in an uncredited role as a dentist.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in October 1955 in Benoit, Mississippi at the J.C. Burrus house, an 1848 antebellum home in Bolivar County. Kazan asked the actors to dress the home&#x27;s interiors with props that they felt reflected their characters&#x27; personalities. Other shooting locations included nearby Greenville, Mississippi and New York City. According to Kazan, Williams did not stay long while the film was shooting in Benoit because of the way in which locals looked at him. Some locals were used for minor roles, and one called &quot;Boll Weevil&quot; acted and also served as the production unit&#x27;s utility man.

The working titles for the film included the name of the play and &quot;Mississippi Woman&quot;. Baker claims that Kazan changed the title to &quot;Baby Doll&quot; as a present to her.

==Release==
===Critical response===
Reviews from critics were mostly positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a generally favorable review that Tennessee Williams &quot;has written his trashy, vicious people so that they are clinically interesting...But Mr. Kazan&#x27;s pictorial compositions, got in stark black-and-white and framed for the most part against the background of an old Mississippi mansion, are by far the most artful and respectable feature of &#x27;Baby Doll.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Kazan &quot;probably here turns in his greatest directing job to date&quot; and praised the &quot;superb performances,&quot; concluding that the film &quot;ranks as a major screen achievement and deserves to be recognized as such.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;one of the finest films of this or many another year, a chilling expose of what ignorance does to human beings...and an excellent example of why the Motion Picture Association should follow Britain&#x27;s lead in classifying films into distinct categories for children and adults.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the cast as &quot;uniformly commendable&quot; and wrote that the plot machinations &quot;add up to some hilarious French-style farce, and it is only at the conclusion of the piece, when Mr. Kazan starts moving his camera around in a preternaturally solemn way, that one&#x27;s interest in &#x27;Baby Doll&#x27; briefly wanes.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote &quot;Kazan has often fallen afoul of his own cleverness, but in &quot;Baby Doll&quot; he responds to a brilliant and astute scenario by Tennessee Williams with a great invention and the most subtle insight...There are no bad performances, and those of Carroll Baker as Baby Doll and Eli Wallach as the Sicilian are outstanding.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive. Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;offers an experience so basically sordid, and so trying besides, that if one does not manage to laugh at its fantastic ribaldry, he will think that he has spent two hours in bedlam.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;thoroughly unpleasant and distasteful screen fare, in spite of the fact that it is expertly directed and finely acted.&quot;

The film holds a score of 83% on the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews.
===Claims of indecency===

&quot;Baby Doll&quot; courted controversy before its release with the display of a promotional billboard in New York City that depicted Baker lying in a crib and sucking her thumb. Cardinal Spellman urged both Catholics and non-Catholics to avoid the film, deeming it a moral danger.

Although &quot;Baby Doll&quot; received a seal of approval from the MPAA, &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; criticized the approval, noting: &quot;Both the general principles of the Code and several specific stipulations are tossed aside in granting the film a Code seal. Among these, the law is ridiculed, there are sexual implications, vulgarity, and the words &#x27;wop&#x27; and &#x27;nigger.&#x27;&quot; Religious groups continued to apply pressure following the film&#x27;s December 18, 1956 premiere, and the Catholic Legion of Decency rated the film as a &quot;C&quot; (&quot;Condemned&quot;) and deemed it &quot;grievously offensive to Christian and traditional standards of morality and decency.&quot; The group succeeded in having the film withdrawn from numerous theaters. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that it was the first time in years that the Legion of Decency had condemned a major American film that had been approved by the MPAA.

Response to the film from Catholic laity was mixed, and Episcopal bishop James A. Pike argued that &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; contained more &quot;sensuality&quot; than did &quot;Baby Doll&quot;.

According to Baker, the cast and crew were unaware that the material would be perceived as controversial. The main reason for the backlash was believed to be the seduction scene between Baker and Wallach. Speculation arose among some audiences that during their scene together on a swinging chair, Wallach&#x27;s character was fondling Baby Doll underneath her dress because his hands are not visible in the frame. According to both Baker and Wallach, the scene was intentionally filmed as such because Kazan had placed heaters all around them in the cold weather.

The film was banned in many countries, because of &quot;exaggerated sexual content.&quot; It also was condemned by &quot;Time&quot;, which called it &quot;just possibly the dirtiest American-made motion picture that has ever been legally exhibited.&quot; Such heated objections and the ensuing publicity earned &quot;Baby Doll&quot; a reputation as one of the most notorious films of the 1950s.
===Box office===
In its review of the film &quot;Variety&quot; wrote the film &quot;should make a barrell of dough.&quot; &quot;Baby Doll&quot; premiered in New York City on December 18, 1956, opening the following week in Los Angeles on December 26 before receiving an expanded release on December 29. During its opening week at New York&#x27;s Victoria Theater, the film earned promising box-office returns, totaling $51,232.

However the film struggled to receive bookings in the wake of Catholic opposition (discussed below). In May 1957 Kazan claimed that the film would ultimately earn $5 million world wide and had already grossed $3 million, and estimated his production company, Newtown, would make $1 million from the film. However according to &quot;Variety&quot; the film earned rentals of $2.3 million at the North American box office in 1957. Kazan later wrote in his memoirs, &quot;People were reading that the film was breaking box office records. This was not true; the cardinal&#x27;s attack hurt us. There&#x27;d be one good week, then a quick slide down. I never made a profit.&quot;

&quot;Filmink&quot; argued this box office failure was in part because Carroll Baker&#x27;s character &quot;clearly doesn’t want to have sex with anyone. Baby Doll is basically a child who Eli Wallach seduces through manipulation and guile. Maybe if Wallach had been played by a conventionally sexy actor... and/or Baker was more knowing, there would be an entirely different reading of the movie. As it is, &quot;Baby Doll&quot; is basically a film about a victim. The film was marketed as something titillating but when you watch it, the end result is far more complex.&quot;
===Accolades===
==Stage play==
In the 1970s, Williams wrote the full-length stage play &quot;Tiger Tail&quot;, based on his screenplay for &quot;Baby Doll&quot;. The screenplay and stage play have been published in one volume. In 2015, the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey, premiered a stage version of &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, adapted by Emily Mann, the theater&#x27;s artistic director, and Pierre Laville, who had written an earlier version that premiered at the Théâtre de l’Atelier in Paris in 2009. The latest adaptation supplemented parts of the film script with material based on several others of Williams&#x27; works, including &quot;Tiger Tail.&quot;

<doc id="190419" wikidata="Q521081" url="?curid=190419" title="Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine">
<text>Sir Louis-Hippolyte Ménard &quot;dit&quot; La Fontaine, 1st Baronet, KCMG (October 4, 1807 – February 26, 1864) was a Canadian politician who served as the first Premier of the United Province of Canada and the first head of a responsible government in Canada. He was born in Boucherville, Lower Canada in 1807. A jurist and , La Fontaine was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in 1830. He was a supporter of Papineau and member of the &quot;Parti canadien&quot; (later the &quot;Parti patriote&quot;). After the severe consequences of the Rebellions of 1837 against the British authorities, he advocated political reforms within the new Union regime of 1841.

Under this Union of the two Canadas he worked with Robert Baldwin in the formation of a party of Upper and Lower Canadian liberal reformers. He and Baldwin formed a government in 1842 but resigned in 1843. In 1848 he was asked by the Governor-General, Lord Elgin, to form the first administration under the new policy of responsible government. The La Fontaine-Baldwin government, formed on March 11, battled for the restoration of the official status of the French language, which was abolished with the Union Act, and the principles of responsible government and the double-majority in the voting of bills.

While Baldwin was reforming Canada West (Upper Canada), La Fontaine passed bills to abolish the &quot;tenure seigneuriale&quot; (seigneurial system) and grant amnesty to the leaders of the rebellions in Lower Canada who had been exiled. The bill passed, but it was not accepted by the loyalists of Canada East who rioted and burned down the Parliament in Montreal.

La Fontaine retired to private life in 1851 but was appointed Chief Justice of Canada East in 1853. In 1854 he was created a baronet by Queen Victoria and a knight commander in the pontifical Order of St. Sylvester by Pope Pius IX in 1855.

His last name is often written in one word (Lafontaine or LaFontaine); his own signature was one word.

== Province of Canada: The fight for responsible government ==

Following the rebellion in Lower Canada, and the similar rebellion in 1837 in Upper Canada (now Ontario), the British government decided to merge the two provinces into a single province, as recommended by Lord Durham in the Durham Report. The &quot;Union Act, 1840&quot;, passed by the British Parliament, abolished the two provinces and their separate parliaments. It created the Province of Canada, with a single Parliament for the entire province, composed of an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council. The Governor General initially retained a strong position in the government.
LaFontaine had been a member of the &quot;Parti patriote&quot; and a supporter of Louis-Joseph Papineau leading up to the Rebellion, but after the Rebellion failed he re-examined his political views. He decided to switch to a system of working within the existing constitutional order to achieve the political rights of French-Canadians. He adopted the cause of responsible government, where the Governor General would appoint the members of the Executive Council from the groups which controlled a majority in the elected Legislative Assembly. Anticipating that he would stand for election in the riding of Terrebonne, with a large majority population of French-Canadians, LaFontaine set out his new political approach in an &quot;Address to the Electors of Terrebonne&quot;.

At that time, it was not uncommon for there to be election violence. Voting was by open-ballot, where each voter publicly declared their vote at the poll. One common tactic was for the supporters of one candidate to try to control the poll and prevent the voters for the other candidate from voting. In the run-up to the Terrebonne election in March 1841, LaFontaine began to hear rumours that Sydenham and the supporters for the government candidate, Michael McCulloch, planned to bring in large numbers of men from outside the riding to control the poll and prevent his supporters from voting. One of LaFontaine&#x27;s supporters wrote to him and suggested that they could hold the poll, if he was able to organise one thousand men to support his position. 

One of the English-language newspapers in Montreal expressly stated that the goal was to prevent French-Canadians from voting in the poll:

The poll was located at New Glasgow, one of the few towns in the riding with an English-speaking majority, and located on the outskirts of the riding, away from the major population centres. The day of the election, LaFontaine led a group of his supporters in a march to New Glasgow, where they would vote. Fearing violence, many of them were armed with clubs and pitchforks, which was not uncommon in contested elections. As they neared New Glasgow, they found the road blocked by groups of men supporting McCulloch, perhaps six or seven hundred in total. They too were armed, many with clubs, but some with firearms. Small fights began to break out, and there was blood on the snow. LaFontaine, fearing for the safety of his supporters, abandoned the march to New Glasgow. Since only McCulloch&#x27;s supporters voted for him, the returning officer declared McCulloch the elected candidate.

At first, LaFontaine thought there was no point in continuing in politics and announced his retirement from public life. But then a surprising event occurred. Robert Baldwin, a leading Reformer in Canada West, contacted LaFontaine. Following the elections in Canada West, there was a vacant seat, York 1st, where the Reformers were in strength. Baldwin offered to nominate LaFontaine as the candidate for the riding in the upcoming by-election, with the support of the local Reform party members. Before making the offer to LaFontaine, Baldwin had obtained the agreement of David Willson, leader in York 1st of the Children of Peace, a Quaker religious group which were strong Reformers, and Willson had agreed. 

LaFontaine gratefully accepted the offer, and with the support of Baldwin and the local Reformers, was elected in the by-election. The concept of a French-Canadian winning a seat in Canada West was remarkable. It was a strong indicator to French-Canadians that they had allies in their quest for popular control of the provincial government. A leading French-Canadian journalist and political writer, Étienne Parent, had accompanied LaFontaine to Canada West and reported back on their reception: and reported on their reception from the reformers: &quot;Ils élisent M. Lafontaine pour montrer, disent-ils, leur sympathie envers les Bas-Canadiens, et leur détestation des mauvais traitements et des injustices auxquelles nous avons été exposés.&quot;

The episode was the beginning of the alliance between reformers in Canada East and Canada West that LaFontaine had argued for in his &quot;Address to the Electors&quot;.

Baldwin also insisted that Sydenham include La Fontaine in the reformed Executive Council, or he would resign as Solicitor General. Their alliance allowed La Fontaine to have a seat in the assembly in 1841 and for Baldwin to win the by-election in 1843.

During the 1840s, Willson continued his association with the Reform Party; he was, for example, the campaign manager in the area for both Robert Baldwin and LaFontaine, the &quot;Fathers of Responsible Government&quot; and first elected premiers of the province. It was the Children of Peace who ensured the election of Montreal lawyer Louis La Fontaine as their representative in Upper Canada. Willson argued that this was an opportunity, as he said, &quot;to show our impartial respect to the Canadian people of the Lower province.&quot; Here, Willson is expressing a clear Canadian identity that overcame differences in the language and religion. It was a vision of Canadian citizenship that was ultimately successful, as La Fontaine was elected in the 4th Riding of York. Subsequently, they elected Baldwin in their riding. The band of the Children of Peace was a familiar sight at Baldwin&#x27;s campaign rallies. In 1844, they held a campaign rally for Baldwin concurrently with the illumination of the Temple. Over 3000 people attended, an event that helped end the reign of Orange Order electoral violence.

On 3 September 1841, the Children of Peace held a campaign rally for Baldwin and La Fontaine in their Temple, where they rejoiced &quot;to say that we have it in our power to show our impartial respect to the Canadian people of the Lower Province.&quot; Despite threats of Orange Order violence, La Fontaine was elected as representative of 4th York.

However, before La Fontaine could take up his seat, Governor Sydenham died. His replacement, Sir Charles Bagot, was not able to form a mixed cabinet of Reformers and Tories, and so he was forced to include the &quot;Canadien party&quot; under La Fontaine. La Fontaine refused to join the Executive Council unless Baldwin was also included. Bagot was finally forced to accede in September, 1842, and when he became severely ill thereafter, Baldwin and La Fontaine became the first real premiers of the Province of Canada. However, in order to take office as ministers, the two had to run for re-election. While La Fontaine was easily re-elected in 4th York, Baldwin lost his seat in Hastings as a result of Orange Order violence. It was now that the pact between the two men was completely solidified, as La Fontaine arranged for Baldwin to run in Rimouski, Canada East. This was the union of the Canadas they sought, where La Fontaine overcame linguistic prejudice to gain a seat in English Canada, and Baldwin obtained his seat in French Canada.

==Family==

He first married on July 9, 1831, to Adèle Berthelot (1813–1859). Their union produced no children. His real family name is Ménard. He is the son of Antoine Ménard.
The Hon. Sir Louis Hypolite Ménard, Bart., then Chief Justice of Lower Canada then married Montreal, January 30, 1861, the widowed Jane Élisabeth Geneviève Morrison, (1822–1905) daughter of Charles Morrison, on January 30, 1861. Julie had married in Montreal, December 18, 1848, Thomas Kinton, of the Royal Engineers Department. This second marriage produced two sons who died in infancy; Louis-Hippolyte (born July 11, 1862) and Charles François Hypolite Lafontaine, born April 13, 1864, who died the following year. The elder son succeeded to the baronetcy at eighteen months old in February, 1864, but died in 1867. The family residence was Saint Denis Street, Montreal.
==Death==
Lafontaine died on February 26, 1864. He was buried at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.
== Memorials==

=== The Louis Hippolyte Ménard Monument in La Fontaine Park Montreal ===

The city authorities of Montreal named Louis-Hippolyte La Fontaine park as a tribute to Chief Justice Lafontaine&#x27;s memory. The unveiling of the La Fontaine Monument in Parc La Fontaine Montreal was a tremendous event to honour such a great man, who is considered the father of responsible Government in Canada. In a book published by Le Comité Du Monument LaFontaine in 1930 titled &quot;Hommage à LaFontaine&quot;. The book is a compilation of letters sent to various people about the unveiling of the monument in Montreal. In these letters and speeches, people expressed their sentiments about the unveiling of the LaFontaine Monument and it is clear they saw him as a great man. Mayor. C.Houde explained how . The crowd was extremely large at the unveiling and Mayor. Houde explained how the monument was erected . The Chief Justice for Sir Wilfrid Laurier was also present the day of the unveiling and he spoke very highly of the monument and LaFontaine as he said &quot;It is a grateful joy to be allowed to laud and magnify LaFontaine&#x27;s imperishable name. I would fain do it, excluding in a rise of Canada from colonial inferiority to international equality, wherein La Fontaine bore so great a part.

=== The Louis Hippolyte Ménard Monument in Boucherville ===
La Fontaine was born in Boucherville and moved to Montreal to begin his political career. A monument was unveiled in Boucherville after his demise as well as a commemorative plaque, placed upon his birth home. Evidence of this is given by Dr. Eudore Dubeau a doctor of the town who explained, . He goes further to explain how on La Fontaine&#x27;s birth home they placed a bronze plaque which . Once again he is referenced as not only the father of responsible government, but also the defender of the French language. LaFontaine refused to speak English in the Assembly and fought to use his mother tongue. It was not that he was incapable of speaking English, he just believed people should be able to speak their mother tongue and supported the French Canadians right to do so.

=== The Louis-Hippolyte-La Fontaine Bridge-Tunnel ===

More about the Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine Tunnel, a highway bridge–tunnel running over and beneath the Saint Lawrence River connecting Montreal to the south shore of the river at Longueuil, Quebec, can be found here. In brief construction began in 1963 and they named it after LaFontaine in order to preserve his memory for future generations.
=== Louis-Hippolyte Ménard Hospital ===
The Louis-Hippolyte-La Fontaine Hospital opened its doors in 1873 under the name &quot;d&#x27;Hospice Saint-Jean-De-Dieu...La congrégation des Soeurs de la Providence&quot;. It was and still is a psychiatric hospital, although it speculated that they also took care of orphans who they wrongly labeled as mentally ill to conduct medical experiments, they are called the Duplessis Orphans. The name was changed because of letters from patients, although the reason they chose La Fontaine&#x27;s name over others is not documented.
==== The Baldwin and La Fontaine Monument on Parliament Hill ====
Created by Walter Seymour Allward who is best known for his design of the &quot;mammoth Canadian Battlefields Memorial in Vimy, France (1922–36), that commemorated the important battle of Vimy Ridge.&quot; Allward created the statue of La Fontaine and Baldwin which rests on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. The &quot;La Fontaine-Baldwin administration throughout the years 1849 and 1850 remained in a position of exceptional power&quot;. Under this regime La Fontaine fought to see the seigneurial system &quot;abolished, but wished to find means to respect the interests of the seigniors by a proper compensation&quot;. Baldwin and La Fontaine fought hard to build unity in the government of Canada and build a true responsible government. If you would like to learn more about Baldwin and La Fontaine a Canadian Historical minute has been made concerning their rise into leadership which can be viewed at Baldwin and La Fontaine Historical Minute.

=== Awaiting Designations ===
The house Louis-Hippolyte La Fontaine lived in as a politician in Montreal is still standing today and is located on 1395 Overdale, Montreal, Quebec. However, the City of Montreal has not yet designated the building into a historical site. It was discovered in July 1987 by Senator Serge Joyal that this home was once the former home of Louis Hippolyte La Fontaine. During the Rebellion for the Losses Bill in which Parliament was burned this home was also the target of many rioters. Since it was rediscovered in 1987 its facade has been left to be battered by the elements. Heritage Montreal has been lobbying for the Sir Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine House for many years and they are hoping that the City comes forward to help. Heritage Montreal and other advocates hope this home can be renovated and built into something such as an interpretive museum exploring the development of responsible government in Canada.

<text>The Rainmaker is a 1997 American legal drama film written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola based on John Grisham&#x27;s 1995 novel of the same name. It stars Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Mary Kay Place, Mickey Rourke, Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, Roy Scheider, Virginia Madsen, and Teresa Wright in her final film role.

==Plot==
Recent Memphis State University Law School grad Rudy Baylor has no high-paying work prospects lined up. He takes a job at a Memphis bar where he meets the bar&#x27;s owner, J. Lyman &quot;Bruiser&quot; Stone, who is also a ruthless but successful ambulance chaser. He hires Rudy as an associate.

Bruiser&#x27;s associates only get paid by finding cases and working them up for trial. Rudy says he has cases, including an insurance bad faith matter he boasts could be worth several million in damages. Interested, Bruiser introduces Rudy to office paralegal Deck Shifflet, a former insurance adjuster of questionable ethics who has a law degree but has failed the bar exam six times. Bruiser employs him because he is resourceful, finds cases, is adept at gathering information, and has useful knowledge of the insurance industry.

Rudy has passed the Tennessee bar exam, but is not yet properly licensed to stand as an attorney. When Bruiser fails to show up for court, Rudy attempts to argue the case, but Judge Harvey Hale scolds Rudy and tells him to first get his license. Defense attorney Leo F. Drummond offers to stand for Rudy as Rudy is sworn in before the judge. Afterwards, Rudy discovers that the FBI has raided Bruiser&#x27;s office, and Bruiser has disappeared.

Before fleeing, Bruiser gave Rudy and Deck $5500 each. They pool their money to open a practice. They file suit for middle-aged couple Dot and Buddy Black, whose 22-year-old son, Donny Ray, is terminally ill with leukemia but could have been saved with a bone marrow transplant that their insurance carrier Great Benefit denied.

Rudy, having never argued a case in court before, now faces experienced lawyers led by Drummond, from the prestigious firm, Tinley Britt. In chambers, Hale tells Rudy and Drummond that he is set to dismiss the case, seeing it as a &quot;lottery&quot; case that slows down the judicial process. However, Hale suffers a fatal heart attack before he grants the petition for dismissal. A more sympathetic Judge Tyrone Kipler, a former civil rights attorney, replaces Hale. Kipler, known by Deck as disliking Tinley Britt, immediately denies Great Benefit&#x27;s petition for dismissal. He agrees to fast-track the case so Donny Ray Black&#x27;s testimony can be recorded before he dies.

While seeking new clients at the hospital, Rudy meets Kelly Riker, a battered wife whose husband Cliff has beaten her numerous times causing her to require hospitalization. Rudy and Kelly become romantically involved. Rudy persuades Kelly to file for divorce. This eventually leads to a bloody confrontation with Cliff, resulting in Rudy nearly beating him to death. To keep Rudy from being implicated, Kelly orders Rudy to leave the house. She then kills Cliff herself, then tells the police it was self-defense. Based on Cliff&#x27;s long history of domestic abuse, the district attorney declines to prosecute Kelly.

Donny Ray dies days after giving a video deposition. The case goes to trial, where Drummond gets the vital testimony of Rudy&#x27;s key witness, Jackie Lemanczyk, stricken from the record as it is based on a stolen manual disallowed as evidence. Nevertheless, thanks to Rudy&#x27;s determination and some clandestine reference help from now Caribbean-based fugitive Bruiser (with whom Deck is connected by intermediaries), Jackie&#x27;s testimony and the Great Benefit Employee Manual are finally admitted into evidence, to Drummond&#x27;s dismay.

Rudy skillfully cross-examines Great Benefit&#x27;s CEO, Wilfred Keeley, leading to the jury finding for Donny Ray&#x27;s family for both actual damages and enormous punitive damages that Great Benefit cannot pay. It is a great triumph for Rudy and Deck, with Keeley being arrested by the FBI and investigation proceedings into Great Benefit launched in multiple jurisdictions. The insurance company declares bankruptcy, allowing it to avoid paying punitive damages. There is no payout for the grieving parents and no fee for Rudy or Drummond. Dot expresses satisfaction at putting Great Benefit out of business, leaving the company unable to victimize other families.

As this success will create unrealistic expectations for future clients, Rudy decides to abandon his new practice and teach law. He and Kelly leave town together, heading out for an uncertain, but bright future together.

==Production==
In January 1995, prior to its publication, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; was already attracting substantial interest due to the $6 million sale for the rights to John Grisham&#x27;s &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; from the previous year. Later that same month, an early version of the manuscript had leaked to Hollywood studios sparking a rumor that a junior executive tasked with reading the book advised the studio to pass on acquiring the rights. Grisham and his literary agent, Jay Garon, were both infuriated by the leak with Garon saying &quot;If there is a script floating around, then it is unauthorized, illegal, highly unethical, and we don’t want to deal with people who sneak scripts.&quot; The rights for &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; were acquired by producer Steven Reuther at Paramount Pictures. While waiting for a flight, Francis Ford Coppola read &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; and was impressed by its inspirational story which lead to Coppola and Fred Fuchs of American Zoetrope approaching Reuther and voicing their interests in working on the film. Reportedly Coppola worked directly with Grisham on the first cut of the film.

==Release==

===Box office===
On its opening weekend, the film ranked third behind &quot;Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, earning $10,626,507. The film grossed $45,916,769 in the domestic box office, exceeding its estimated production budget of $40 million, but still was considered a disappointment for a film adaptation of a Grisham novel, particularly in comparison to &quot;The Firm&quot;, which was made for roughly the same amount but grossed more than six times its budget.

===Critical reception===
The film received generally positive reviews from critics, earning an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Invigorated by its talented cast and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s strong direction, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; is a satisfying legal drama—and arguably the best of Hollywood&#x27;s many John Grisham adaptations.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 72 out of 100 ratings based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally positive reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; three stars out of four, remarking: &quot;I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels ... but I&#x27;ve usually seen the storyteller&#x27;s craft rather than the novelist&#x27;s art being reflected. ... By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer&#x27;s life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer.&quot; James Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that &quot;the intelligence and subtlety of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; took me by surprise&quot; and that the film &quot;stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation&quot;.

In 2024, Francis Ford Coppola revealed during an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that, following the release of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, he chose to &quot;sort of retire&quot; from being a professional director and instead become a student who could discover what making movies consisted by self-financing &quot;very small, low-budget&quot; films like &quot;Youth Without Youth&quot; (2007) and &quot;Tetro&quot; (2009), even organizing unusual rehearsals during which he learned a lot about acting. This was in order for Coppola to prepare himself for the development of his longtime passion project &quot;Megalopolis&quot; (2024).

<doc id="190424" wikidata="Q1992247" url="?curid=190424" title="Heterodoxy">
<text>In religion, heterodoxy (from Ancient Greek: , &#x27;other, another, different&#x27; + , &#x27;popular belief&#x27;) means &quot;any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position&quot;.

&quot;Heterodoxy&quot; is also an ecclesiastical jargon term, defined in various ways by different religions and churches. For example, in some groups, heterodoxy may describe beliefs that differ from strictly orthodox views but that fall short either of formal or of material heresy.

==Christianity==
===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the term is used primarily in reference to Christian churches and denominations not belonging to the communion of Eastern Orthodox churches and espousing doctrines contrary to the received Holy Tradition.

===Protestantism===
Charles Spurgeon said:

[Y]ou shall find spiritual life in every church. I know it is the notion of the bigot, that all the truly godly people belong to the denomination which he adorns. Orthodoxy is my doxy; heterodoxy is anybody else&#x27;s doxy who does not agree with me.

==Islam==
The Arabic word is used by Shia Muslims for beliefs perceived as being extremely heterodox (more in line with the Christian use of the word &quot;heresy&quot;). In particular, the term is used to describe the beliefs of minority Muslim groups who ascribe divine characteristics to a member of Muhammad&#x27;s family (especially Ali) or the early companions of the Prophet such as Salman the Persian. The assumption is that the groups thus described have gone too far and have come to associate them with God ().

Sunni and Shia Muslims see each other as heterodox, differing in practice mainly on matters of jurisprudence or , splitting historically on the matter of the succession of Ali to the caliphate by Muawiyah. A third and much smaller movement is Ibadi, which differ from both of these groups on a few key points. Several ultra-orthodox groups such as the Wahhabis, in turn, see themselves as the only truly orthodox groups within Islam.

According to Philip Hitti, during the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates there was a marked tendency among several quite unrelated heterodox groups to affiliate themselves with the Shiites, particularly the Ismailis, in a general feeling of heterodox solidarity in a Sunni-controlled empire. The cause of the Alids thus became a rallying point for a diverse range of heterodox Islamic movements. The view that Ali was divine, though never mainstream within Shiism, is attested in the early centuries of Islam.

==Hinduism==
The main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the absoluteness of the Vedas, including Buddhism and Jainism, were regarded as heterodox by Hinduism. In 2015, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Hinduism cannot be narrowed down to particular beliefs or doctrine, saying that it &quot;incorporates all forms of belief without mandating the selection or elimination of any one single belief&quot;.

==China==
In late 1999, legislation was created in China to outlaw &quot;heterodox religions&quot;. This was applied retroactively to Falun Gong, a spiritual practice introduced to the public in China by Li Hongzhi () in 1992.

==Economics==
Heterodox economics refers to schools of economic thought considered outside of mainstream economics, referred to as orthodox economics, often represented by expositors as contrasting with or going beyond neoclassical economics.

Heterodox economics refers to the consideration of a variety of economic schools and methodologies, which can include neoclassical or other orthodox economics in part. Heterodox economics refers to a variety of separate unorthodox approaches or schools such as institutional, post-Keynesian, socialist, Marxian, feminist, Georgist, Austrian, ecological, and social economics, among others.

<doc id="190431" wikidata="Q251634" url="?curid=190431" title="Nancy Kelly">
<text>Nancy Kelly (March 25, 1921 – January 2, 1995) was an American actress in film, theater, and television. A child actress and model, she was a repertory cast member of CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;The March of Time&quot;, and appeared in several films in the late 1920s. She became a leading lady upon returning to the screen in the late 1930s, while still in her teens, and made two dozen movies between 1938 and 1946, including portraying Tyrone Power&#x27;s love interest in the classic &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939), which also featured Henry Fonda, and playing opposite Spencer Tracy in &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot;, later that same year. After turning to the stage in the late 1940s, she had her greatest success in a character role, the distraught mother in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, receiving a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the 1955 stage production and an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress for the 1956 film adaptation, her last film role. Kelly then worked regularly in television until 1963, then took over the role of Martha in the original Broadway production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; for several months. She returned to television for a handful of appearances in the mid-1970s.

==Biography==

Of Irish descent, Kelly was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, into a theatrical family. Her mother was silent film actress Nan Kelly, who coached her and managed her career. As a child actress, Kelly appeared in 52 films made on the East Coast by the age of 17. Her younger brother was actor Jack Kelly, most noted for playing the role of Bart Maverick, one of the leads (alongside James Garner, Roger Moore or Robert Colbert) in the ABC television series &quot;Maverick&quot; (1957-1962). The Kelly siblings, who resembled each other, are not currently known to have worked together in film or television. 

Kelly was educated at Bentley School for Girls, Immaculate Conception Academy, and Saint Lawrence Academy.

As a child model, her image had appeared in so many different advertisements by the time she was nine years old that &quot;Film Daily&quot; commented, &quot;Nancy has been referred to as &#x27;the most photographed child in America,&#x27; largely because of her commercial posing.&quot;

Kelly worked extensively in radio in her adolescent years. She played Dorothy Gale in a 1933–34 NBC Radio Network show, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, based on &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Kelly was the first ingenue on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;The March of Time&quot; series, with a vocal versatility that made it possible for her to portray male parts as well as female. She also portrayed Eleanor Roosevelt.
As an adult, Nancy Kelly was a leading lady in 27 movies in the 1930s and &#x27;40s, including director John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Submarine Patrol&quot; (1938) with Preston Foster, &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot; (1939) with Randolph Scott as Wyatt Earp, &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939) with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda, &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; (1939) with Spencer Tracy, the comedy &quot;He Married His Wife&quot; (1940) with Joel McCrea, &quot;Parachute Battalion&quot; (1941) with Robert Preston, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Harry Carey, and Buddy Ebsen, and &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Desert Mystery&quot; (1943) with Johnny Weissmuller. She also starred in the 1949 Broadway play &quot;The Big Knife&quot; by Clifford Odets. Kelly was subsequently a two-time winner of the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatrical productions as well as a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play winner for her performance in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, which she followed up by starring in the 1956 film version, receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She also starred on television, including leading roles in &quot;The Storm&quot; (1961) episode of &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;The Lonely Hours&quot; (1963) episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. In 1957 she was nominated at the 9th Primetime Emmy Awards for an Emmy Award for Best Single Performance by an Actress for the episode &quot;The Pilot&quot; in &quot;Studio One&quot;.

Kelly was a Republican who supported Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election.

==Marriages==
Kelly was married to actor Edmond O&#x27;Brien briefly from 1941–1942, and then to Fred Jackman, Jr., son of silent Hollywood cameraman and director Fred Jackman, from 1946 to 1950. She was married to theater director Warren Caro from 1955 to 1968. She and Caro had a daughter, Kelly Caro, in 1957.

==Death==
Kelly died at her Bel Air, California, home on January 2, 1995, from complications of diabetes at the age of 73. She was survived by a daughter and three granddaughters. She was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Walk of Fame==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. She was inducted on February 8, 1960.

<text>Marjorie Florence Lawrence CBE (17 February 190713 January 1979) was an Australian dramatic soprano, particularly noted as an interpreter of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas. She was the first Metropolitan Opera soprano to perform the immolation scene in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; by riding her horse into the flames as Wagner had intended. She was afflicted by polio from 1941. Lawrence later served on the faculty of the School of Music at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

Her life story was told in the 1955 film &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;, in which she was portrayed by Eleanor Parker, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Lawrence.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born at Deans Marsh, south west of Melbourne. She was the fifth of six children of William Lawrence, the local butcher, and Elizabeth (née Smith) Lawrence, church organist. Her mother died when Lawrence was two and she was raised by her father&#x27;s mother. Lawrence attended local schools, joined the choir at St Pauls Church of England and was a soloist by age ten. Her interest in opera was sparked by gramophone records of Nellie Melba and Clara Butt. She won a number of vocal competitions when aged in her teens, and at the age of 18 she travelled to Melbourne for work. She received voice lessons from Ivor Boustead but had to return home due to financial hardship. Lawrence failed to gain a place at the Royal South Street competitions in Ballarat but went on to win the Sun Aria at Geelong in 1928. Australian baritone John Brownlee advised her to study in Paris with Cécile Gilly. Lawrence boarded with a French family and, under Gilly&#x27;s tuition, was able to extend her voice&#x27;s upper range.

==Career==
In January 1932, Lawrence made her operatic debut in Monte Carlo as Elisabeth in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. On 25 February 1933, she made her first appearance at the Opera Garnier in Paris, singing Ortrud in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, and in the same year she sang in the world premiere of Joseph Canteloube&#x27;s &quot;Vercingétorix&quot;.

On 18 December 1935, she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City singing Brünnhilde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and the following year performed the immolation scene in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; by riding her horse into the flames as Wagner had intended, the first Metropolitan Opera soprano to do so. She had been an athletic child and learned to ride in Australia. In this famous performance, Lauritz Melchior was her Siegfried. The performance was recorded and is the only complete &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; with Melchior as Siegfried on record.

Lawrence&#x27;s physicality and beauty made her popular with audiences – she performed the &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot; in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; more convincingly than most other sopranos. Just as Lawrence&#x27;s great compatriot Florence Austral had been able to alternate the role of Brünnhilde with Frida Leider, she herself was able to alternate the role with Kirsten Flagstad at the Metropolitan in 1937.
un a
She turned down a small role in the premiere of George Enescu&#x27;s opera &quot;Œdipe&quot; in 1938, which caused her fellow Australian (by adoption) Hephzibah Menuhin (a close friend of Enescu&#x27;s) to consider the soprano &quot;snobbish and petty&quot;.

Lawrence returned to Australia periodically from 1939, where English critic Neville Cardus wrote of the &quot;&#x27;unselfconscious pathos&#x27; and &#x27;intimate poetry&#x27; in her performances, of the &#x27;superb range&#x27; of her powerful voice, &#x27;rich in vocal splendour&#x27; throughout&quot;.

In 1939 it was announced she would play Dame Nellie Melba in the film &quot;The Life of Melba&quot; for Australia&#x27;s Cinesound Productions. However the film never materialised due to the war.

On 29 March 1941, at New York City&#x27;s City Hall, she married Dr. Thomas King, an osteopath and Christian Scientist.

During a performance in 1941 in Mexico, Lawrence found herself unable to stand—she had polio. She undertook the Sister Kenny treatment of muscle stimulation for paralysis in both legs. She returned to the stage 18 months later, performing in a chair, reclining or on a special platform; although hampered by her lack of mobility, she continued to perform until 1952. In 1944, during World War II, she performed in charity concerts to entertain troops in Australia, seated in a chair. A performance as Amneris in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; in Paris in 1946 was well received as were concert appearances of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot; in December 1947 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Artur Rodziński, but Lawrence left the stage, and instead began to work as a teacher. She retired to her ranch, Harmony Hills, in Hot Springs, Arkansas where she taught international students. She later accepted students from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock from the late 1970s until her death in 1979.

Although best known for her Wagnerian interpretations, Lawrence sang a range of other works, including &quot;Salome&quot; and Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. She made a number of excellent recordings, mainly of works by Wagner. She received many good reviews throughout her career. She had a solid career in France, Mexico, Australia and throughout South America, as well as the US. However, she was unable to build a substantial career in other parts of the world due to World War II, when her voice was prime. In 1946 she was awarded the cross of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; for her work in France.

In 1949, Lawrence wrote her autobiography &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;; by February 1950, Hollywood was interested in making a film and Lawrence indicated &quot;If a film is made I will do the singing&quot;. In 1955, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the film version, &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;, starring Eleanor Parker as Lawrence; Parker loved opera and learned to sing all of the arias, although her singing was later dubbed in by soprano Eileen Farrell. Lawrence criticised the film as being untrue to her life.

Lawrence died, aged 71, of heart failure on 13 January 1979 at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas, and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Hot Springs, where she had made her home for many years.

==Honours==
In 1946 she was awarded the cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur for her work in France. In 1976 she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on the recommendation of the Government of Australia.

<text>The Bad Seed is a 1954 horror novel by American writer William March, the last of his major works published before his death.

Nominated for the 1955 National Book Award for Fiction, &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; tells the story of a mother&#x27;s realization that her young daughter is a murderer. Its enormous critical and commercial success was largely realized after March&#x27;s death only one month after publication.

In 1954, the novel was adapted into a successful and long-running Broadway play by Maxwell Anderson and into an Academy Award-nominated 1956 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy.

==Plot==
Eight-year-old Rhoda Penmark is the only child of Christine and Kenneth Penmark. While she is cherished by the adults in her life for her sweet and intelligent nature, her classmates at Fern Grammar School avoid her, sensing something “isn’t quite right” about her.

After her husband leaves on a business trip, Christine notices Rhoda’s callous attitude regarding the sudden death of her classmate, Claude Daigle — while the his death was deemed accidental, he had unexplainable crescent-shaped marks imprinted on his face. Christine learns that, before Claude&#x27;s death, Rhoda quarreled with him over a medal award for perfect penmanship that he won, but which Rhoda believed she deserved.

Rhoda’s chilling indifference to the boy’s death causes Christine to reevaluate troubling incidents from the past, such as the mysterious deaths of her pet dog and Rhoda’s elderly babysitter. Disturbed by the idea that her daughter might be the one behind all these tragedies, Christine begins investigating and discovers she was actually adopted by her own parents: her birth mother, Bessie Denker, was a notorious serial killer who died in the electric chair. As her mental state deteriorates, Christine begins writing letters to her husband discussing Rhoda, blaming herself for passing the “bad seed” gene to their daughter. She never mails the letters out of fear someone will read them and call the authorities.

The only other adult aware of Rhoda’s true nature is Leroy Jessup, the maintenance man who works and lives at the Penmarks’ apartment complex, who relentlessly teases the girl regarding Claude’s death. She’s indifferent to his teasing until Leroy insinuates Rhoda must have used her cleated shoes to beat Claude, explaining the crescent-shaped marks left on the boy&#x27;s face. Afraid he will expose her, she waits until Leroy is asleep before lightning his mattress ablaze and locking him inside his shed; a horrified Christine witnesses the murder from afar.

Christine confronts Rhoda, who confesses to the murders while expressing no remorse. Not wanting her daughter to suffer the same fate as Denker, Christine secretly gives Rhoda an overdose of sleeping pills; after destroying the unsent letters, Christine shoots herself in the head. The gunshot is heard by a neighbor, who breaks into the apartment and saves Rhoda. Christine dies in the hospital while a heartbroken Kenneth returns home. With all evidence of her actions destroyed, Rhoda is free to kill again.

==Characters==
===Main===
*Rhoda Penmark: a high-functioning sociopath, although the term wasn&#x27;t popularized at the time the book was written. She has no conscience, and will not hesitate to harm or kill whoever stands in her way at achieving her goal. She sees murder as something that is necessary if she believes her target to be a potential threat. An adept manipulator, Rhoda can easily charm and mislead adults, while eliciting fear and revulsion from other children, who can sense that something is wrong with her. It is implied that she inherited these traits from her maternal grandmother Bessie Denker, who was a famous convicted serial killer. By the time her mother Christine puts the facts together, Rhoda has already killed at least two people and a dog. She also kills Leroy Jessup, the apartment building&#x27;s live-in gardener. When Christine uncovers Rhoda&#x27;s dark secret, she attempts murder-suicide by Rhoda by giving her enough pills to cause an overdose and shooting herself; however, this proves to be unsuccessful when their landlady saves Rhoda&#x27;s life. Rhoda is indifferent to her mother&#x27;s suicide and it is implied she will follow in the footsteps of her infamous grandmother.
*Christine Penmark: The young and empathetic mother of Rhoda Penmark. Christine is described as very beautiful. She has Nordic feminine features that are traced to her biological father. She is well-groomed, intelligent, and despite being a traditional 1950s homemaker, she is very independent. She slowly pieces together that Rhoda is a killer. Christine doesn&#x27;t know whether she should love or hate her daughter, but knows that Rhoda will kill again if something is not done. She discovers that her own biological mother was Bessie Denker, an infamous serial killer who was executed. In the end, Christine finally attempts to kill Rhoda to stop her, then shoots herself in the head.
*Leroy Jessup: The crude maintenance man who works for the elderly landlady, Monica Breedlove. He is a depraved individual and sees Rhoda as a kindred spirit. Due to his crude mind and dark sense of humor, he is the only adult character, other than Christine, who notices that Rhoda is unlike other children and enjoys teasing her. Rhoda only reacts to his teasing when he claims to have the shoes with which she killed Claude. When the realization sets in that she actually did kill Claude, he denies ever having them. Shortly thereafter, he is locked inside his makeshift shed by Rhoda, who sets the shed on fire, leaving him inside to die.
*Monica Breedlove: The Penmarks&#x27; landlady and Christine&#x27;s confidante, she is an older pretentious woman who considers herself to be somewhat of a psychotherapist and claims she was once examined by Sigmund Freud. Monica adores Rhoda, whom she believes to be extraordinary, even wishing the child were hers. Monica knows that Christine is upset but suspects she is either ill, or that her marriage with Kenneth is under strain. Monica never discovers the truth about Rhoda and is confused as to why Christine would kill herself.
*Reginald Tasker: A writer and friend to Monica, he provides Christine with information about an infamous serial killer, Bessie Denker. He becomes friends with, and later is to attracted to, Christine. He informs Christine that the man she has known as her biological father, Richard Bravo, worked diligently on the Denker case. Tasker mentions that Bessie Denker&#x27;s youngest daughter was her only surviving family.
*Claude Daigle: The only child of Hortense and Dwight Daigle, he is described as a timid and sensitive boy who rarely stood up to others. He is shown being fussed over by his anxious mother at the start of the novel and was last seen running away from Rhoda towards the lake at the school picnic. It turns out that when he refused to give Rhoda the penmanship medal award he won, she repeatedly hit him so hard with her shoe that she knocked him unconscious. He then fell off the pier and quickly drowned.
*Hortense Daigle: Mother of Claude Daigle, presented as smothering and over-attentive. A plain, large woman who believes that the Fern sisters and others look down on her for having once been a hairdresser and marrying late in life, she is devastated by her son&#x27;s death and turns to alcohol as a source of comfort. She senses that Rhoda knows something about or had something to do with her son&#x27;s death and seeks her out twice to cajole answers.
*Bessie Denker: A well-known (fictional) serial killer. She is the biological mother of Christine Penmark and the grandmother of Rhoda Penmark. Christine faintly remembers living with her biological family and escaping from her mother. Denker never makes a physical appearance in the novel, having long ago been executed. The character&#x27;s life and murderous history is thoroughly described in the notes of Reginald Tasker. Denker&#x27;s career is based very roughly on the real-life careers of Belle Gunness and Jane Toppan. The description of her execution in the electric chair is based on that of Ruth Snyder.

===Minor characters===

*Kenneth Penmark:The father of Rhoda and husband of Christine. Kenneth is away on business when the novel begins and he does not return until the very end, after his wife&#x27;s suicide. Kenneth never discovers the truth about Rhoda or the reasoning behind Christine&#x27;s suicide and attempted murder of Rhoda as his wife neglected to leave him any information, even confidentially, and had destroyed her earlier unsent letters.
*Emory Wages: Monica Breedlove&#x27;s brother, who lives with his sister. He flirts with Christine at different social gatherings.
*Claudia Fern: The Fern sister who reprimands Rhoda for harassing Claude the day of the picnic. She describes the events the day of the picnic to Christine along with her two other sisters. She informs Christine that Rhoda will not be welcome to attend their school the following term.
*Octavia Fern: Fern sister who explains to Christine why the sisters did not ask the Penmarks to donate money for a flower arrangement to be presented at Claude&#x27;s funeral.
*Burgess Fern: Fern sister in charge of enrollment at the Fern School. She would not hold the penmanship medal for Claude Daigle on the fateful day of the school picnic.
*Richard Bravo: Christine&#x27;s adopted father, who was killed in an airplane crash during World War II. He was a well-known columnist and war correspondent, performing great research in the &quot;Bessie Denker&quot; case. He never told Christine she was adopted or that Bessie Denker was her biological mother.
*Dwight Daigle: Father of Claude Daigle. He tries to help his anguished wife and keep her under control as she suffers from the death of their son. The character&#x27;s forename was changed from Dwight in the novel to Henry for the 1956 play and film, and to Fred for the 1985 television adaptation.
*Mrs. Forsythe: An elderly woman said to have been a great beauty in her youth. She is thought by Monica to be a bit simple-minded. Like most of the other adults, she is enchanted by Rhoda, and she often babysits her (and even offers to take in Rhoda after Christine&#x27;s death). Rhoda never harms Mrs. Forsythe because she does not have anything Rhoda wants.
*Thelma Jessup: The wife of Leroy Jessup. She is described as big and dull, yet she is astute enough to warn Leroy that he is asking for trouble if he continues to tease Rhoda.
*Belle Blackwell: Teacher of the Sunday school Rhoda attends who gives Rhoda a copy of &quot;Elsie Dinsmore&quot;.
*Clara Post: The elderly woman who lived with her daughter Edna in the same apartment house as the Penmarks in Baltimore, Maryland. She was charmed by Rhoda, then six years old, and befriended her, promising that when she died Rhoda could have her floating opal ball pendant. She fell to her death in Rhoda&#x27;s presence when Edna was out. Edna was skeptical of Rhoda&#x27;s story about her mother&#x27;s death and did not invite the Penmarks to the funeral or speak to them afterwards.

==Primary theme==
===Nature versus nurture===
In the decade the novel was published, juvenile delinquency began to be far more common, or at least more extensively reported and documented. Compared to earlier history, the idea of child crimes was a new phenomenon. A controversy about nature vs nurture arose as psychiatric explanations were proposed for juvenile delinquency, with the debate being whether inborn tendencies (&quot;nature&quot;) are more or less important than environmental factors (&quot;nurture&quot;) in explaining deviant behavior.

Supporters of the “nature” side suggested that some people are born evil or with malicious tendencies. The idea that nature prevails over nurture is implied in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;. March incorporates the notion that a murderous genetic trait is being passed down through the generations. Within the plot of the story, Rhoda is a serial murderer just like her grandmother, having inherited the murderous gene. Rhoda had been brought up as a privileged child; she was nurtured emotionally and physically and thus a broken home life was not to blame for her actions. Tasker hints and suggests at the idea of nature taking effect when he quotes that &quot;some people are just born evil&quot;, when discussing Denker with Christine.

Psychologist Robert D. Hare, who argues that the evidence suggests psychopathy is an inborn trait, discusses &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; in his 1993 non-fiction book &quot;Without Conscience&quot;. A lengthy quote from the novel opens Hare&#x27;s book, describing in March&#x27;s words how most decent individuals are not by nature suspicious and thus unable to understand or anticipate the acts of evil and depravity that some people are capable of committing. Later in his book, Hare argues that March&#x27;s novel is a &quot;remarkably true to life&quot; portrayal of the development of psychopathy in childhood, illustrating both Rhoda&#x27;s callous use of others to serve her own ends as well as Christine&#x27;s growing helplessness and desperation as she realizes the extent of her daughter&#x27;s behavior.

==Reviews==
* James Kelly, &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
: &quot;Let it be said quickly: William March knows where human fears and secrets are buried. He announced it in &quot;Company K&quot;, a novel published twenty years ago and equaled only by Dos Passos&#x27; &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; as a sampling of men at war. He has proved it again and again in the other novels and short stories, all of them floored and walled in what Clifton Fadiman decided to call &quot;Psychological acumen&quot;. But nowhere is this gift better displayed than in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; — the portrayal of a coldly evil, murderous child and what she does to both victims and family. In the author&#x27;s hands this is adequate material for an absolutely first class novel of moral bewilderments and responsibilities nearest the heart of our decade.&quot;
*Dan Wickenden, &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;:
: &quot;Dark, original, ultimately appalling, William March&#x27;s extraordinary new novel is, on the obvious level, a straightforward, technically accomplished story of suspense. The manner of its telling — the dispassionate, exact, almost starched prose, with its occasional glints of sardonic humor — is an impressive achievement in itself. It lends some credibility to a narrative against which the imagination rebels; and towards the end, as horror is piled upon horror, it saves the book from falling headlong into absurdity... This is a novel bound to arouse strong responses, to generate vehement discussion, and so not easily to be forgotten.&quot;
* August Derleth, &quot;Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot;:
: &quot;&quot;The Bad Seed&quot; would have been a stronger novel without this false premise — the granddaughter of a murderess is no more likely to be a murderess than the granddaughter of a seamstress, or anyone else. Apart from this flaw, however, &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; is a novel of suspense and mounting horror, which the reader who can close his eyes to March&#x27;s unnecessary premise will enjoy as the work of one of the most satisfying of American novelists.&quot;
* L. A. G. Strong, &quot;The Spectator&quot; (UK):
: &quot;&quot;The Bad Seed&quot; is terrifyingly good, not only because its theme is worked out so powerfully, but because every character is convincing. One has to believe that these appalling things took place exactly as the author says they did.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Broadway play===

Maxwell Anderson adapted the book for the stage almost immediately after its publication. Anderson had previously won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award in 1935 and 1936 for his plays &quot;Winterset&quot; and &quot;High Tor&quot;, as well as the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1933 for his play &quot;Both Your Houses&quot;. Reginald Denham directed the play using Anderson&#x27;s script. The play opened on Broadway on December 8, 1954, at the 46th Street Theatre (now the Richard Rodgers Theatre), less than a year after the publication of the novel.

On April 25, 1955, the play transferred to the Coronet Theatre (now the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre), where it completed its successful run of 334 performances on September 27, 1955. Nancy Kelly, the actress who played Christine, won the 1955 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. The audience made claims that Patty McCormack, the child actress who played Rhoda, was the most memorable character.

===1956 film===

Mervyn LeRoy was the director of the 1956 movie. In LeRoy&#x27;s Hollywood career, he produced and or directed over 70 films including &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;Little Women&quot;. Nancy Kelly, Patty McCormack and most of the original cast acted in the 1956 movie. The ending of the 1956 film was changed from that of the novel and the play to comply with the Hollywood Production Code. Rhoda is suddenly struck and killed by lightning when she goes back to the scene of her crime to retrieve the medal (allowing an interpretation of divine intervention), while Christine survives her suicide attempt. During the closing credits, LeRoy added a light-hearted sequence of Nancy Kelly, Christine, holding Patty McCormack, Rhoda, over her leg and spanking her –possibly to remind audiences that this is just a movie.

===1985 film===

&quot;The Bad Seed&quot; was remade as a television movie in 1985, adapted by George Eckstein and directed by Paul Wendkos and kept the novel&#x27;s original ending but changed other details, including some forenames (i.e. Claude Daigle → Mark Daigle, Hortense Daigle → Rita Daigle, Claudia Fern → Alice Fern) and added a scene in which young Christine escapes into a cornfield from her own sociopathic mother, Bessie Denker.

This version starred Blair Brown as Christine, Lynn Redgrave as Monica, David Ogden Stiers as Emory (whose character is hinted to be a closeted homosexual), David Carradine as Leroy, and Chad Allen as Mark Daigle (whose character was never seen before, only referenced). Carrie Wells played the title character, whose name was changed from Rhoda to Rachel. The TV-movie version was considered inferior to both the play and original film by critics.

===2018 film===

In December 2017, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Rob Lowe would direct and star in a television remake for Lifetime network. This version of &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; first ran on Lifetime on September 9, 2018, and was watched by 1.87 million viewers, placing it in the top ten most-watched cable programs on that date. However, the production received mixed reviews.

A sequel, &quot;The Bad Seed Returns&quot;, was released in 2022.

<doc id="190435" wikidata="Q186273" url="?curid=190435" title="Kōbō Abe">
<text>, pen name of , was a Japanese writer, playwright, and director. His 1962 novel &quot;The Woman in the Dunes&quot; was made into an award-winning film by Hiroshi Teshigahara in 1964. Abe has often been compared to Franz Kafka for his modernist sensibilities and his surreal, often nightmarish explorations of individuals in contemporary society. He died aged 68 of heart failure in Tokyo after a brief illness.

==Biography==
Abe was born on March 7, 1924 in Kita, Tokyo, Japan and grew up in Mukden (now Shenyang) in Manchuria. Abe&#x27;s family was in Tokyo at the time due to his father&#x27;s year of medical research in Tokyo. His mother had been raised in Hokkaido, while he experienced childhood in Manchuria. This triplicate assignment of origin was influential to Abe, who told Nancy Shields in a 1978 interview, &quot;I am essentially a man without a hometown. This may be what lies behind the &#x27;hometown phobia&#x27; that runs in the depth of my feelings. All things that are valued for their stability offend me.&quot; As a child, Abe was interested in insect-collecting, mathematics, and reading. His favorite authors were Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Franz Kafka, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Edgar Allan Poe.
Abe returned to Tokyo briefly in April 1940 to study at Seijo High School, but a lung condition forced his return to Mukden, where he read Jaspers, Heidegger, Dostoyevsky, and Edmund Husserl. Abe began to study medicine at Tokyo Imperial University in 1943, partially out of respect for his father, but also because &quot;[t]hose students who specialized in medicine were exempted from becoming soldiers. My friends who chose the humanities were killed in the war.&quot; He returned to Manchuria around the end of World War II. Specifically, Abe left the Tokyo University Medical School in October 1944, returning to his father&#x27;s clinic in Mukden. That winter, his father died of eruptive typhus. Returning to Tokyo with his father&#x27;s ashes, Abe reentered the medical school. Abe started writing novellas and short stories during his last year in university. He graduated in 1948 with a medical degree, joking once that he was allowed to graduate only on the condition that he would not practice.

In 1945 Abe married Machi Yamada, an artist and stage director, and the couple saw successes within their fields in similar time frames. Initially, they lived in an old barracks within a bombed-out area of the city center. Abe sold pickles and charcoal on the street to pay their bills. The couple joined a number of artistic study groups, such as Yoru no Kai (Group of the Night or The Night Society) and &quot;Nihon Bungaku Gakko&quot; (Japanese Literary School). Their daughter, Abe Neri, was born in 1954.

As the postwar period progressed, Abe&#x27;s stance as an intellectual pacifist led to his joining the Japanese Communist Party, with which he worked to organize laborers in poor parts of Tokyo. Soon after receiving the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, Abe began to feel the constraints of the Communist Party&#x27;s rules and regulations alongside doubts about what meaningful artistic works could be created in the genre of &quot;socialist realism.&quot; By 1956, Abe began writing in solidarity with the Polish workers who were protesting against their Communist government, drawing the Communist Party&#x27;s ire. The criticism reaffirmed his stance: &quot;The Communist Party put pressure on me to change the content of the article and apologize. But I refused. I said I would never change my opinion on the matter. This was my first break with the Party.&quot; The next year, Abe traveled to Eastern Europe for the 20th Convention of the Soviet Communist Party. He saw little of interest there, but the arts gave him some solace. He visited Kafka&#x27;s house in Prague, read Rilke and Karel Čapek, reflected on his idol Lu Xun, and was moved by a Mayakovsky play in Brno.

The Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 disgusted Abe. He attempted to leave the Communist Party, but resignations from the party were not accepted at the time. In 1960, he participated in the Anpo Protests against revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty as part of the pan-ideological Young Japan Society. He later wrote a play about the protests, &quot;The Day the Stones Speak&quot;, which was staged several times in Japan and China in 1960 and 1961. In the summer of 1961, Abe joined a group of other authors in criticizing the cultural policies of the Communist Party. He was forcibly expelled from the party the following year. His political activity came to an end in 1967 in the form of a statement published by himself, Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata, and Jun Ishikawa, protesting the treatment of writers, artists, and intellectuals in Communist China. According to translator John Nathan, this statement led to the falling-out between Abe and fellow writer Kenzaburō Ōe.

His experiences in Manchuria were also deeply influential on his writing, imprinting terrors and fever dreams that became surrealist hallmarks of his works. In his recollections of Mukden, these markers are evident: &quot;The fact is, it may not have been trash in the center of the marsh at all; it may have been crows. I do have a memory of thousands of crows flying up from the swamp at dusk, as if the surface of the swamp were being lifted up into the air.&quot; The trash of the marsh was a truth of life, as were the crows, yet Abe&#x27;s recollections of them tie them distinctively. Further experiences with the swamp centered around its use as a staking ground for condemned criminals with &quot;[their] heads—now food for crows—appearing suddenly out of the darkness and disappearing again, terrified and attracted to us.&quot; These ideas are present in much of Abe&#x27;s work.

==Career==
Abe was first published as a poet in 1947 with &quot;Mumei-shishū&quot; (&quot;Poems of an unknown poet&quot;), which he paid for himself, and as a novelist the following year with &quot;Owarishi michi no shirube ni&quot; (&quot;The Road Sign at the End of the Street&quot;), which established his reputation. When he received the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, his ability to continue publishing was confirmed. Though he did much work as an avant-garde novelist and playwright, it was not until the publication of &quot;The Woman in the Dunes&quot; in 1962 that Abe won widespread international acclaim.

In the 1960s, he collaborated with Japanese director Hiroshi Teshigahara on the film adaptations of &quot;The Pitfall,&quot; &quot;Woman in the Dunes,&quot; &quot;The Face of Another,&quot; and &quot;The Man Without a Map&quot;. &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and was released only four months after Abe was expelled from the Japanese Communist Party.

In 1971, he founded the Abe Studio, an acting studio in Tokyo. Until the end of the decade, he trained performers and directed plays. The decision to found the studio came two years after he first directed his own work in 1969, a production of &quot;The Man Who Turned Into A Stick&quot;. The production&#x27;s sets were designed by Abe&#x27;s wife, and Hisashi Igawa starred. Abe had become dissatisfied with ability of the theatre to materialize the abstract, reducing it to a passive medium. Until 1979, he wrote, directed, and produced 14 plays at the Abe Studio. He also published two novels, &quot;Box Man&quot; (1973) and &quot;Secret Rendezvous&quot; (1977), alongside a series of essays, musical scores, and photographic exhibits. The Seibu Theater, an avant-garde theater in the new department store Parco, was allegedly established in 1973 specifically for Abe, though many other artists were given the chance to use it. The Abe Studio production of &quot;The Glasses of Love Are Rose Colored&quot; (1973) opened there. Later, the entirety of the Seibu Museum was used to present one of Abe&#x27;s photographic works, &quot;An Exhibition of Images: I&quot;.

The Abe Studio provided a foil for much of the contemporary scene in Japanese theater, contrasting with the Haiyuza&#x27;s conventional productions, opting to focus on dramatic, as opposed to physical, expression. It was a safe space for young performers, whom Abe would often recruit from the Toho Gakuen College in Chofu City, on the outskirts of Tokyo, where he taught. The average age of the performers in the studio was about 27 throughout the decade, as members left and fresh faces were brought in. Abe &quot;deftly&quot; handled issues arising from difference in stage experience.

In 1977 Abe was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Awards==
Among the honors Abe received were the Akutagawa Prize in 1951 for &quot;The Crime of S. Karuma,&quot; the Yomiuri Prize in 1962 for &quot;The Woman in the Dunes,&quot; and the Tanizaki Prize in 1967 for the play &quot;Friends.&quot; Kenzaburō Ōe credited Abe and other modern Japanese authors for &quot;[creating] the way to the Nobel Prize&quot;, which he himself won. Abe was mentioned multiple times as a possible recipient, but his early death precluded that possibility.

<doc id="190438" wikidata="Q356960" url="?curid=190438" title="Mori Ōgai">
<text>Lieutenant-General , known by his pen name , was a Japanese Army Surgeon general officer, translator, novelist, poet and father of famed author Mari Mori. He obtained his medical license at a very young age and introduced translated German language literary works to the Japanese public. Mori Ōgai also was considered the first to successfully express the art of western poetry in Japanese. He wrote many works and created many writing styles. &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1911–1913) is considered his major work. After his death, he was considered one of the leading writers who modernized Japanese literature.

His continued obstinacy to recognize beriberi as a thiamine deficiency led to the death of more than 27,000 Japanese soldiers.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Mori was born as in Tsuwano, Iwami Province (present-day Shimane Prefecture). His family were hereditary physicians to the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Tsuwano Domain. As the eldest son, it was assumed that he would carry on the family tradition; therefore he was sent to attend classes in the Confucian classics at the domain academy, and took private lessons in &quot;rangaku&quot; (&quot;Dutch learning&quot;, and by extension &quot;Western learning&quot;) and Dutch.

In 1872, after the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the domains, the Mori family relocated to Tokyo. Mori stayed at the residence of Nishi Amane, in order to receive tutoring in German, which was the primary language for medical education at the time. In 1874, he was admitted to the government medical school (the predecessor for Tokyo Imperial University&#x27;s Medical School), and graduated in 1881 at the age of 19, the youngest person ever to be awarded a medical license in Japan. It was also during this time that he developed an interest in literature, reading extensively from the late-Edo period popular novels, and taking lessons in Chinese poetry and literature.

=== Early career ===

After graduation, Mori enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Army as a medical officer, hoping to specialize in military medicine and hygiene. He was commissioned as a deputy surgeon (lieutenant) in 1882. Mori was sent by the Army to study in Germany (Leipzig, Dresden, Munich, and Berlin) from 1884 to 1888. During this time, he also developed an interest in European literature. As a matter of trivia, Mori Ōgai is the first Japanese known to have ridden on the Orient Express. One of his major accomplishments was his ability to create works using a style of &quot;translation&quot; that he obtained from his experience in European culture.

In his stay in Germany, Ogai sometimes encountered situations where he expressed his patriotism. There was this one time that he started a public controversy against a German geologist, Dr Edmund Naumann. Dr. Naumann gave a presentation entitled “Japan” at a lecture in which he criticized Japan. In short, his criticism was that the opening of Japan to international relations was not a voluntary act, but was the result of foreign pressure. After the lecture, Naumann was said to have made a number of jokes critical of Japan in conversation with other scholars. Ogai wrote in his &quot;Doitsu Nikki&quot; that he made a speech to refute Naumann&#x27;s comments shortly. Since it was a social occasion, the controversy seemed to have been settled, but the debate was continued when Dr. Naumann published a column in the newspaper &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung”. According to &quot;Wakaki hi no Mori Ogai&quot; by Keiichiro Kobori, the controversy was focused on eight points including the origin of the Japanese people and the treatment of the Ainu people, food and clothing, public health, manners and customs, the influence of oil painting techniques on Japanese painting, Buddhism and myth, the effectiveness of the modernization movement, and the future of Japan. Of these, &quot;the pros and cons of the modernization movement in Japan&quot; and &quot;the future of Japan&quot; were the major points. Naumann pointed out that Japan opened its door to the international relations from the external forces and had easily and superficially accepted Western civilization. Furthermore, that the Japanese themselves tend to disregard the traditional culture under the justification of the modernization was his argument. Ogai made a counterargument that the introduction of Western civilization was natural, rational, and spontaneous, and important point is to identify what to westernize and what to preserve as traditional Japanese culture. Ogai carried out this controversy all in German.

After four years in Germany, Ogai felt that the realization of the mental revolution of the Japanese was his mission to be accomplished. Pushed by this idea, Ogai at first started to spend time on enlightening the public and other intellectuals by introducing the aesthetic scientific method which he obtained in the West. This took various forms such as journal articles and debates in the newspaper section. His attitude around this time period is often regarded as “belligerent and combative”. This attitude emerged out of his passion to establish the basis for criticism and the principle of induction method. Given the background of the time where a lot of policies and ideas were based on the idealistic theory, Ogai’s enthusiasm could be fully explained. One of the representative examples which reflected the radical westernization took place in the western style building called “Rokumeikan”, located in Chiyoda-ku in Tokyo. Rokumei-kan was established in 1888 by the then minister of foreign affair, Inoue Kaoru for the diplomatic purpose. His policy faced strong criticism by the right-wing nationalists and Ogai was one of those critics to the westernization without solid foundation. Ogai had dealt with various fields including urban planning, dietetics, and also lifestyle itself. His activity was supported by other nationalists and conservatives and he came to play an important role as a public educator.

Upon his return to Japan, he was promoted to surgeon first class (captain) in May 1885; after graduating from the Army War College in 1888, he was promoted to senior surgeon, second class (lieutenant colonel) in October 1889. Now a high-ranking army doctor, he pushed for a more scientific approach to medical research, even publishing a medical journal out of his own funds. His view on the modernization of Japan was distinctive from other intellectuals in the point where he was very critical to the absence of the rationale basis in the scientific field, especially medicine. That the intellectuals kept importing only the fruit of the science, not the scientific method itself was the source of concern for Ōgai because he believed that the understanding of the essence of the Western value, for specifically, the manner and the procedures of the scientific method, was vital so that in the future Japan can produce the original works of science, not the borrowings of it. This view represented his aspiration, the realization of the mental revolution of Japanese, which he had been considering after the abroad experience. As a person who studied in West, he felt the responsibility to foster the process of the modernization as if it was his mission. Another concern regarding the process of the modernization was the potential that the reckless importation of Western culture could bring the destruction to the Japanese traditions, which Ōgai found in a sense unique and original to the West. In this sense, Ōgai was a conservative who knew the value of Japanese culture in contrast to other Japanese who were in favor of radical Westernization. This attitude was reflected in his journal articles. For example, one of his works, &quot;Nihon Kaoku ron&quot; (essay on urban planning), he argued that the urban development shall not be driven by the idealistic theories in which the primary objective was to imitate the Western style, but to be processed based on the scientific evidence. As a result of his contribution, he was considered as a public educator at that time. This was, however, a source of trouble in later stage because his belligerent style was unwelcomed by his superiors. One of the reasons of his transfer to Kokura was of this conflict between a conservative administrative body and a progressive scientist. Meanwhile, he also attempted to revitalize modern Japanese literature and published his own literary journal (&quot;Shigarami sōshi&quot;, 1889–1894) and his own book of poetry (&quot;Omokage&quot;, 1889). In his writings, he was an &quot;anti-realist&quot;, asserting that literature should reflect the emotional and spiritual domain. The short story &quot;The Dancing Girl&quot; (舞姫, &quot;Maihime&quot;, 1890) described an affair between a Japanese man and a German woman.

He married two times. His first wife was Toshiko Akamatsu, a daughter of Admiral Noriyoshi Akamatsu and a close friend of Nishi Amane. The couple married in 1889 and had a son who was born in 1890, Oto (from German &quot;Otto&quot;), before divorcing later that same year. The divorce was under acrimonious circumstances that irreparably ended his friendship with Nishi. His second wife, whom he married in 1902, was Shigeko Arakawa. They had four children: Mari (Marie, 1903-1987), Furitsu (Fritz, 1907-1908), who died in childhood, Annu (Anne, 1909-1998), and Rui (Louis, 1911-1991). Both daughters, Mari and Annu, as well his son Rui, became writers.

In May 1893, Mori was promoted to senior surgeon, first class (colonel).

=== Later career ===

At the start of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, Mori was sent to Manchuria and, the following year, to Taiwan. In February 1899, he was appointed head of the Army Medical Corps with the rank of surgeon major-general and was based in Kokura, Kyūshū. His transfer was because of his responses to fellow doctors and his criticism about their fields of research in the Japanese Medical Journal of which he was editor. In 1902, he was reassigned to Tokyo. He was attached to a division in the Russo-Japanese War, based out of Hiroshima. Although Ogai was a fine artist, it is impossible to understand his thoughts on the war since he did not leave any personal document about it. This is because of his position in the army.

In 1907, Mori was promoted to Surgeon General of the Army (lieutenant general), the highest post within the Japanese Army Medical Corps, and became head of the Imperial Fine Arts Academy, which is now the Japan Art Academy. Under his leadership, an estimated 27,000 soldiers in the army died of beriberi during the Russo-Japanese War; in contrast, almost no sailors died. In 1908, the Diet of Japan appointed Mori as the head of the Beriberi Research Council to investigate the causes of the disease. In this position, he led a faction of doctors from Tokyo Imperial University who asserted that beriberi was an endemic disease caused by an unknown pathogen, ultimately ensuring that the Japanese army lagged significantly behind research worldwide and even within the nation.

In 1884, naval surgeon Takaki Kanehiro concluded his experiments showing that the disease was a thiamine deficiency caused by sailors&#x27; diet of polished white rice; this advice had been adopted by the Japanese Navy by the time of Russo-Japanese War. In 1919, the council conducted its first experiments on vitamins; this was 35 years after Takaki&#x27;s experimentation in the Navy and six years after Edward Bright Vedder convinced the Western scientific community that rice bran could treat beriberi. By 1926, the Nobel Prize had been awarded to Christiaan Eijkman and Sir Frederick Hopkins for research on thiamine deficiency they had conducted in the late 19th century.

He was appointed director of the Imperial Museum when he retired in 1916. Mori Ōgai then died of renal failure and pulmonary tuberculosis six years later, aged 60.

====Literary work====

Mori&#x27;s first notable work is The Dancing Girl&quot; (舞姫, &quot;Maihime&quot;, 1890) a story chronicling the love affair between Ōta Toyotarō, a Japanese law student studying abroad in Berlin, and a German dancer, Elis. Toyotarō, recalling his experiences aboard a boat in Saigon, writes that he came to Germany on a government scholarship, having been a model student in Japan. However, after he meets Elis, Toyotarō becomes subject to rumors from his Japanese colleagues, and is eventually dismissed from his government post. Toyotarō continues an impoverished life with Elis until the arrival of his old friend Aizawa Kenkichi, who is working for the government official Count Amakata. Soon after agreeing to travel to Russia with Aizawa and the Count, he learns of Elis&#x27; pregnancy. Upon Toyotarō&#x27;s return, he decides to return to Japan with Count Amakata, abandoning Elis and their baby. Elis learns of Toyotarō&#x27;s plans through Aizawa, and goes mad. Toyotarō ends his story by expressing resentment toward Aizawa despite his help.

&quot;The Dancing Girl,&quot; according to literary scholar Tomiko Yoda, is generally regarded as one of the first works of Japanese literature to incorporate first-person narration in relation to modern modes of subjectivity. Both Japanese and English-language critics have extensively written on the story, beginning with a critique written by Ishibashi Ningetsu a month after the story&#x27;s publication. Twentieth-century Japanese critiques generally focused on the development of narration of the self in the story, with Maeda Ai analyzing Toyotarō&#x27;s narration in relation to his movement through Berlin&#x27;s urban space. Komori Yōichi writes that Toyotarō, writing in Saigon, develops unique &quot;divided selves&quot; that mediate each other through the act of narration. English-language scholars like Christopher Hill have focused on the themes of nationalism in the story, with Toyotarō torn between returning to Japan and continuing the development of a modern nation-state, or staying in the cosmopolitan city of Berlin with his lover Elis. The story continues to be regarded as a classic work of modern Japanese literature.

Although Mori did little writing from 1892 to 1902, he continued to edit a literary journal (&quot;Mezamashi gusa&quot;, 1892–1909). He also produced translations of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, and Hauptmann. It was during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) that Mori started keeping a poetic diary. After the war, he began holding &quot;tanka&quot; writing parties that included several noted poets such as Yosano Akiko. Mori Ōgai helped found a new magazine called &quot;Subaru&quot; in 1909 with the help of others such as Yosano Akiko and Yosano Tekkan. His later works can be divided into three separate periods. From 1909 to 1912, he wrote mostly fiction based on his own experiences. This period includes &quot;Vita Sexualis&quot; and his most popular novel, , which is set in 1881 Tokyo and was filmed by Shirō Toyoda in 1953 as &quot;The Mistress&quot;.

In 1909, he released his novel &quot;Vita Sexualis&quot;, which was abruptly banned a month later. Authorities deemed his work too sexual and dangerous to public morals. Mori Ōgai, during the period he was writing &quot;Vita Sexualis&quot;, focused on making a statement regarding the current literary trends of modern Japanese literature. He approached the trend on sexuality and individualism by describing them as a link between body and soul. Ōgai points out problems concerning the art and literature world in the 19th century in his work. His writing style, depicted from the Meiji government&#x27;s perspective, derived from naturalism and was implemented with his thoughts that were brought up from writers who focused on the truth. Ogai expressed his concern towards the intellectual freedom after High Treason Incident in 1910 where socialists and anarchists were unfairly executed by the court on suspicion of the assassination of the Japanese Emperor Meiji. Although he was on the side of the government as an elite army doctor, Ogai showed strong concern about the government&#x27;s suppression of thought and academics, and started to call for freedom of speech. His arguments were embedded in some of his works such as “Chinmoku no to” and “Shokudo”.

His later works link his concerns with the Ministry of Education regarding the understanding of &quot;intellectual freedom&quot; and how they police and dictate the potential of literature. During the time from 1912 to 1916 saw a shift in his writing work from fictions to historical stories, influenced by the shocking news of Nogi Maresukea’s death, a general of the Imperial Japanese Army. In this event, Ōgai saw a revival of pre-modern ritual in the world where the individualism was gradually stemming. While the public opinion quickly labeled Nogi’s death as anachronistic, Ōgai, who was closer to Nogi, started the investigation of the spiritual background of his age by narrating the biographies of the past events. The works such as ‘Abe Ichizoku’ and ‘Shibue Chusai’ were the byproducts of his approach to the Japanese history. In these historical biographies, Ōgai depicted the men who committed ritual death, &quot;Junshi&quot; with a realistic prose. Through these works, Ōgai realized that those people who had to die were, to a certain extent, victims of the long-held practice and social expectation. Why Ōgai was inclined to investigate the history, or in other word, the identity of Japan, was partially because of his personal matter in which he was struggling to take a balance between West and East. Another reason was that he wanted to look back at the Meiji era at the very last time. After &quot;Yasui Fujin&quot; in 1914, his style changed from &quot;history as it is,&quot; in which he depicted history as it had been narrated, to &quot;story based on history,&quot; in which he somehow added his own arrangements to historical events. Followed by this change, “Shibue Chusai”, one of his best known works, was come off. From 1916 to 1921, he turned his attention to biographies of three Edo period doctors.
Sansho Dayu was an early Japanese work written in the mid 1600&#x27;s, and Ogai&#x27;s rewrite of it essentially changed some minor details and the ending, wherein which the bailiff&#x27;s punishment is not given as much attention as in the original, and it is not so much violent as it is politically appropriate. There are also numerous supernatural elements removed from the original story, making it palatable to a wider audience. Ogai&#x27;s retelling of Sansho Dayu was made into a film, directed by Kenji Mizoguchi (1954).

== Legacy ==

As an author, Mori is considered one of the leading writers of the Meiji period. In his literary journals, he instituted modern literary criticism in Japan, based on the aesthetic theories of Karl von Hartmann. A house which Mori lived in is preserved in Kokurakita Ward in Kitakyūshū, not far from Kokura Station. Here he wrote &quot;Kokura Nikki&quot; (&quot;Kokura Diary&quot;). His birthhouse is also preserved in Tsuwano. The two one-story houses are remarkably similar in size and in their traditional Japanese style.

Because of his biographical works, most notably Shibui Chusai (1916), Ogai is credited to be the pioneer of modern biographical literature in Japanese culture.

His daughter Mari, who was nineteen years old at the time of his death, wrote extensively about her relationship with her father. Starting with her 1961 novella, , she wrote tragic stories about love affairs between older men and boys in their late teens which influenced the creation of the &quot;Yaoi&quot; genre, stories about male-male relationships, written by women for women, that began to appear in the nineteen seventies in Japanese novels and comics. Mori&#x27;s sister, Kimiko, married Koganei Yoshikiyo. Hoshi Shinichi was one of their grandsons.

==Mori Ōgai former residence in Tsuwano==

The house in Tsuwano where Mori Ōgai was born still exists, and is preserved as a memorial museum. This one-story structure has earthen walls and a tile roof. As the Mori family were doctors, the small room to the left of the entrance was a medicine compounding room, and larger room to the back was for seeing patients. The house faces Nishi Amane&#x27;s former residence across the Tsuwano River, and is in a neighborhood called &quot;Yokobori&quot;, so named because the outer moat of Tsuwano Castle passed to the side of the residence. Mori Ōgai lived in this building for only 11 years, from his birth until he departed for Tokyo in 1872 and the age of 11. He never returned to Tsuwano or visited this house again; however, in his writings he reminisced that his childhood home was in a compound surrounded by earthen walls and had a gate like a samurai residence. The house was relocated to another location within Tsuwano at one point, but in 1954, on the 33rd anniversary of his death, the town of Tsuwano bought it and restored it to its original site. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1969. Due to its deterioration, it was dismantled and completely repaired in the fall of 1984.

<text>Willie Hall (died 1930), best known by his nickname Drive &#x27;Em Down, was a New Orleans blues and boogie woogie piano player. He never recorded, but has had a great influence on blues and rock and roll.

According to Champion Jack Dupree, who called Drive &#x27;Em Down his &quot;father&quot; and cited him as &quot;teaching me his style&quot;, Hall played in barrelhouses. His earthy song, &quot;Junker&#x27;s Blues&quot;, with its stories about needles and reefer and the Angola prison farm was recorded by Dupree in 1940. In 1949 Fats Domino reworked the song as &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, the first of his 35 Top 40 hits. The melody was used by Professor Longhair for &quot;Tipitina&quot; and by Lloyd Price for &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy.&quot; Willy DeVille recorded the song in 1990 on his &quot;Victory Mixture&quot; album. The song also directly inspired the song &quot;Junco Partner&quot;, first recorded in 1951 by James Waynes and later also widely covered by other musicians.

<text>Gao Xingjian (; born January 4, 1940) is a Chinese émigré and later French naturalized novelist, playwright, critic, painter, photographer, film director, and translator who in 2000 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity.&quot; He is also a noted translator (particularly of Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco), screenwriter, stage director, and a celebrated painter.

Gao&#x27;s drama is considered to be fundamentally absurdist in nature and avant-garde in his native China. &quot;Absolute Signal&quot; (1982) was a breakthrough in Chinese experimental theatre. &quot;The Bus Stop&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Other Shore&quot; (1986) had their productions halted by the Chinese government, with the acclaimed &quot;Wild Man&quot; (1985) the last work of his to be publicly performed in China. He left the country in 1987 and his plays from &quot;The Other Shore&quot; onward increasingly centered on universal (rather than Chinese) concerns, but his 1989 play &quot;Exile&quot; angered both the government for its depiction of China and the overseas democracy movement for its depiction of intellectuals. In 1997, he was granted French citizenship.

Gao&#x27;s influences include classical Chinese opera, folk culture, and 20th century European drama such as Antonin Artaud, and he said in 1987 that as a writer he could be placed at the meeting point between Western and Eastern cultures. He is a very private person, however, and later claimed, &quot;No matter whether it is in politics or literature, I do not believe in or belong to any party or school, and this includes nationalism and patriotism.&quot; His prose works tend to be less celebrated in China but are highly regarded elsewhere in Europe and the West, with &quot;Soul Mountain&quot; singled out in the Nobel Prize announcement.

== Early life ==
Born in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, during wartime China in 1940 (Gao&#x27;s original paternal ancestral home town is in Taizhou, Jiangsu with his maternal roots from Zhejiang), his family returned to Nanjing with him following the aftermath of World War II. He has been a French national since 1997. In 1992 he was awarded the Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.

=== Early years in Jiangxi and Jiangsu ===
Gao&#x27;s father was a clerk in the Bank of China, and his mother was a member of YMCA. His mother was once a playactress of Anti-Japanese Theatre during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Under his mother&#x27;s influence, Gao enjoyed painting, writing and theatre very much when he was a little boy. During his middle school years, he read much translated literature from the West, and he studied sketching, ink and wash painting, oil painting and clay sculpture under the guidance of painter Yun Zongying ().

In 1950, his family moved to Nanjing. In 1952, Gao entered the Nanjing Number 10 Middle School (later renamed Jinling High School) which was the Middle School attached to Nanjing University.

=== Years in Beijing and Anhui ===
In 1957 Gao graduated, and, following his mother&#x27;s advice, chose Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU) instead of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, although he was thought to be talented in art.

In 1962 Gao graduated from the Department of French, BFSU, and then he worked for the Chinese International Bookstore (). During the 1970s, because of the Down to the Countryside Movement, he was persecuted as a public intellectual, forced to destroy his early writings, and was sent to the countryside to do hard labor in Anhui Province for six years. He taught as a Chinese teacher in Gangkou Middle School, Ningguo county, Anhui Province for a short time. In 1975, he was allowed to go back to Beijing and became the group leader of French translation for the magazine &quot;China Reconstructs&quot; ().
In 1977 Gao worked for the Committee of Foreign Relationship, Chinese Association of Writers. In May 1979, he visited Paris with a group of Chinese writers including Ba Jin. In 1980, Gao became a screenwriter and playwright for the Beijing People&#x27;s Art Theatre.

Gao is known as a pioneer of absurdist drama in China, where &quot;Signal Alarm&quot; (《絕對信號》, 1982) and &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (《車站》, 1983) were produced during his term as resident playwright at the Beijing People&#x27;s Art Theatre from 1981 to 1987. Influenced by European theatrical models, it gained him a reputation as an avant-garde writer. The production of the former work (the title of which has also been translated as &quot;Absolute Signal&quot;) was considered a breakthrough and trend-setter in Chinese experimental theatre. His book &quot;Preliminary Explorations Into the Art of Modern Fiction&quot; was published in September 1981 and reprinted in 1982, by which point several established writers had applauded it. His plays &quot;Wild Man&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Other Shore&quot; (《彼岸》, 1986) openly criticised the government&#x27;s state policies. The rehearsal of the latter was ordered to stop after one month.

In 1986 Gao was misdiagnosed with lung cancer, and he began a 10-month trek along the Yangtze, which resulted in his novel &quot;Soul Mountain&quot; (). The part-memoir, part-novel, first published in Taipei in 1990 and in English in 2000 by HarperCollins Australia, mixes literary genres and utilizes shifting narrative voices. It has been specially cited by the Swedish Nobel committee as &quot;one of those singular literary creations that seem impossible to compare with anything but themselves.&quot; The book details his travels from Sichuan province to the coast, and life among Chinese minorities such as the Qiang, Miao, and Yi peoples on the fringes of Han Chinese civilization.

=== Years in Europe and Paris ===
By the late 1980s, Gao had shifted to Bagnolet, a city adjacent to Paris, France. His 1989 political drama &quot;Fugitives&quot; (also translated as &quot;Exile&quot;), about three people who escape to a disused warehouse after the tanks roll into Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, resulted in all his works being banned from performance in China and he was officially deemed persona non grata.

===Poetry===
While being forced to work as a peasant – a form of &#x27;education&#x27; under the Cultural Revolution – in the 1970s, Gao Xingjian produced many plays, short stories, poems and critical pieces that he had to eventually burn to avoid the consequences of his dissident literature being discovered. Of the work he produced subsequently, he published no collections of poetry, being known more widely for his drama, fiction and essays. However, one short poem exists that represents a distinctively modern style akin to his other writings:

; 天葬臺
: 宰了 / 割了 / 爛搗碎了 / 燃一柱香 / 打一聲呼哨 / 來了 / 就去了 / 來去都乾乾淨淨

; Sky Burial
: Cut / Scalped / Pounded into pieces / Light an incense / Blow the whistle / Come / Gone / Out and out

(April 13, 1986, Beijing)

== Reception ==

=== In the Eastern Hemisphere ===
Gao first saw success and gained critical recognition with the publication of his novella &quot;Hanye de xingchen&quot; 《寒夜的星辰》 (1980; &quot;Stars on a Cold Night&quot;). When the Chinese Writers&#x27; Association launched two mass meetings to attack &quot;Preliminary Explorations Into the Art of Modern Fiction&quot;, a work which caused national controversy, well-known writers came forward to speak in defense of it. Australian sinologist Geremie Barmé stated in 1983 that the work gave some coherence to Chinese writers&#x27; attempts to understand Western art and literature after World War I, but &quot;reads more like a loose collection of jottings and reflections [...] the only reason that it has become the Bible of Chinese modernists is that there is an absolute paucity of similar material for a non-specialist readership.&quot;

He became a resident playwright with the Beijing People&#x27;s Art Theatre in 1981, and in 1982 he wrote his first play, &quot;Absolute Signal&quot;. A committee appointed by the Ministry of Culture unanimously voted &quot;Absolute Signal&quot; the best play in a compilation of recent plays, though the playwright was by then a controversial figure and it was excluded from above as &quot;ineligible for selection&quot;. His absurdist drama &quot;Chezhan&quot; (1983; Bus Stop) incorporated various European techniques from European Theater. While Cao Yu praised &quot;Bus Stop&quot; as &quot;wonderful&quot;, it was openly condemned by Communist Party officials. He left Beijing and went into self-exile, returning in November 1984. His 1985 play &quot;Yeren&quot; (&quot;Wild Man&quot;) was favorably received, and according to scholar Gilbert C. F. Fong represented &quot;the pinnacle of the development of experimental drama at the time. It also gave notice that drama [...] did not have to be guided by the concerns for socialist education or political usefulness, and that interpretive lacunae in any piece of work [...] would enhance artistic effectiveness.&quot;

Both Western and Chinese critics described &quot;The Bus Stop&quot; as the first play to introduce elements of the Theatre of the Absurd to China, while &quot;Wild Man&quot; was considered to be influenced by Chinese theatrical traditions and praised more for its effort to improve the range of expression open to Chinese performing artists. &quot;Absolute Signal&quot;, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, and &quot;Wild Man&quot; have been described as &quot;both the origin and culmination of the initial phase of the Chinese avant-garde&quot;. In 1986 his play &quot;The Other Shore&quot; was banned, and since then none of his other plays have been performed on the mainland.

=== Response from Zhu Rongji ===
Premier Zhu Rongji of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China delivered a congratulatory message to Gao Xingjian when interviewed by the Hong Kong newspaper &quot;East Daily&quot; ():
* Q.: &quot;What&#x27;s your comment on Gao&#x27;s winning Nobel Prize ?&quot;
* A.: &quot;I am very happy that works written in Chinese can win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Chinese characters have a history of several thousand years, and Chinese language has an infinite charm, (I) believe that there will be Chinese works winning Nobel Prizes again in the future. Although it&#x27;s a pity that the winner this time is a French citizen instead of a Chinese citizen, I still would like to send my congratulations both to the winner and the French Ministry of Culture.&quot; (Original words: 我很高兴用汉语写作的文学作品获诺贝尔文学奖.汉字有几千年的历史, 汉语有无穷的魅力, 相信今后还会有汉语或华语作品获奖.很遗憾这次获奖的是法国人不是中国人, 但我还是要向获奖者和法国文化部表示祝贺.)

=== Comments from Chinese writers ===
Gao&#x27;s work has led to fierce discussion among Chinese writers, both positive and negative.

In his article on Gao in the June 2008 issue of &quot;Muse&quot;, a now-defunct Hong Kong magazine, Leo Ou-fan Lee praises the use of Chinese language in &quot;Soul Mountain&quot;: &#x27;Whether it works or not, it is a rich fictional language filled with vernacular speeches and elegant 文言 (classical) formulations as well as dialects, thus constituting a &quot;heteroglossic&quot; tapestry of sounds and rhythms that can indeed be read aloud (as Gao himself has done in his public readings).&#x27;

Before 2000, a dozen Chinese writers and scholars already predicted Gao&#x27;s winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, including Hu Yaoheng (Chinese: 胡耀恒) Pan Jun () as early as 1999.

Jessica Yeung of Hong Kong Baptist University praised the story &quot;Twenty-Five Years Later&quot; (1982), writing that the manipulation of narrative perspectives creates effective humor and irony.

=== In the western world ===
Gilbert C. F. Fong has called &quot;Preliminary Explorations Into the Art of Modern Fiction&quot; &quot;a rather crude attempt at theory&quot;. His plays &quot;Absolute Signal&quot;, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, and &quot;Wild Man&quot; gave him a positive reputation overseas. A review in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; praised &quot;Wild Man&quot; as &quot;truly amazing&quot;. Deirdre Sabina Knight of Smith College praised Gao&#x27;s &quot;inventiveness&quot; in a review of Fong&#x27;s translations of five of the plays. Each play is followed by notes written by Gao, and John B. Weinstein of Simon&#x27;s Rock College of Bard argues that these notes &quot;combine the practical with the theoretical. As a group, they embody a significant body of dramatic theory.&quot; Weinstein said that &quot;tripartition allows Gao to probe his characters more deeply by presenting multiple perspectives for each one&quot;, and that &quot;Weekend Quartet&quot; (in which characters&#x27; self-analyses are integrated with more realistic settings and everyday situations than those of the other plays Fong translated) is a step toward Gao&#x27;s theories being applied to plays besides his own.
The primary translators of Gao&#x27;s work into English are Mabel Lee (novels and essays from Chinese to English), Gilbert Fong (plays and poetry from Chinese to English), Noel Dutrait (novels and essays from French to English), and Claire Conceison (plays from French to English). English-language scholars who have written books about Gao&#x27;s work include Sy Ren Quah, Letizia Fusini, Todd Coulter, Izabella Labedzka, and Mary Mazzilli.

===Influence of Gao&#x27;s work in other fields===
The work of Gao Xingjian inspired professor Jin Hsu-ren from the Department of Educational Psychology and Counseling at National Taiwan Normal University to create a psychological therapy called &quot;Psychological Displacement Paradigm in Diary-writing&quot; (PDPD) based on the way Soul Mountain was written, using the three pronoun positions of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;he/she&quot;.

== Gao Xingjian Center at National Taiwan Normal University ==
For a long time Gao Xingjian has considered Taiwan his home and has a deep connection with National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU). In 2008, he accepted President Gou Yih-shun&#x27;s invitation to become an honorary chair professor at the university. In 2011, President Chang Kuo-En traveled to France to extend an invitation, resulting in Mr. Gao becoming a chair professor at the Graduate Institute of Performing Arts in 2012, where he has been teaching courses for several years. His exceptional accomplishments and remarkable contributions to society led him being awarded an honorary doctorate in literature from NTNU in 2017.

Since 2012, NTNU has collaborated closely with Professor Gao to organize a series of events and performances. For instance, in 2012, the university arranged the &quot;Encounter Gao Xingjian at NTNU - Commemorating the Visit of Nobel Laureate in Literature Gao Xingjian.&quot; In 2014, NTNU, in conjunction with the National Palace Museum, co-presented the Taiwanese premiere of the cinematic poem &quot;Requiem for Beauty,&quot; alongside the publication of the corresponding art book. Furthermore, Professor Gao himself donated and unveiled the Xingjian Hall, a rehearsal room for the Graduate Institute of Performing Arts. The years following saw additional significant events, including the &quot;Gao Xingjian Art Festival&quot; in 2017, where his ink wash painting &quot;The Thinker&quot; was presented, and the &quot;Gao Xingjian Week&quot; in 2019, which introduced courses such as &quot;The Literature and Art of Gao Xingjian&quot; and &quot;Studies on Plays of Gao Xingjian&quot;, curses currently offered by NTNU each semester. Meanwhile, the Graduate Institute of Performing Arts performed several of his iconic works, including the Mandarin debut of &quot;Nocturnal Wanderer&quot; (2012), the vibrant rock-and-roll musical &quot;Mountains and Seas&quot; (2013, 2017), the dance theater production &quot;Soul Mountain&quot; (2016, 2017), the monologue &quot;Soliloquy&quot; (2019), and the university repertory production &quot;Soliloquy on Soul Mountain&quot; (2019).

In 2020, Professor Gao celebrated his 10th year as an NTNU chair professor, commemorating this milestone by generously donating various manuscripts and pertinent books to the university. As a testament to the academic bond with Professor Gao and to foster research on his works, NTNU established the Gao Xingjian Center on the sixth floor of the NTNU Library. This center serves as a repository for his writings, documents, and relevant research materials. Leveraging its strengths and distinct characteristics in the realm of arts and humanities, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration across the College of Liberal Arts, College of Arts, and College of Music, NTNU aspires to emerge as a pivotal research hub for Gao Xingjian&#x27;s works within the Chinese-speaking world.

<doc id="190445" wikidata="Q123665" url="?curid=190445" title="Gloria Macapagal Arroyo">
<text>Maria Gloria Macaraeg Macapagal-Arroyo (; born April 5, 1947), often referred to as PGMA or GMA, is a Filipino academic and politician who served as the 14th president of the Philippines from 2001 to 2010. She is the longest-serving president since Ferdinand Marcos. Before her presidency, she was the 10th vice president of the Philippines from 1998 to 2001 under President Joseph Estrada, becoming the first female vice president. She was also a senator from 1992 to 1998. After her presidency, she was elected as the representative of Pampanga&#x27;s 2nd district in 2010 and continues to serve in this role. She also served as the speaker of the House from 2018 to 2019, and as deputy speaker from 2016 to 2017 and 2022 to 2023. Alongside former president Sergio Osmeña, she is one of only two Filipinos to hold at least three of the four highest offices: vice president, president, and house speaker.

Arroyo is the first president to succeed the presidency as the child of a previous president; her father was Diosdado Macapagal, the country&#x27;s ninth president from 1961 to 1965. She studied economics at Georgetown University in the United States, where she became friends with her classmate and future U.S. president Bill Clinton. She then became a professor of economics at the Ateneo de Manila University, where her eventual successor, President Benigno Aquino III, was one of her students. She entered government in 1987 as assistant secretary and undersecretary of the Department of Trade and Industry under President Corazon Aquino, Benigno&#x27;s mother.

After Estrada was accused of corruption, Arroyo resigned from her cabinet position as secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development and joined the opposition against the president. Estrada was ousted by the Second EDSA Revolution in 2001, and Arroyo was sworn in as president by Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. on January 20. The Oakwood mutiny occurred in 2003 during her administration. She was elected to a full six-year term in the controversial 2004 presidential election and was sworn in on June 30, 2004. A long-time opponent of the death penalty, she abolished capital punishment in 2006 after commuting the death sentences of over 1,200 prisoners.

On November 18, 2011, Arroyo was arrested and held at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City on charges of electoral sabotage but released on bail in July 2012. These charges were later dropped for lack of evidence. She was rearrested in October 2012 on charges of misuse of $8.8 million in state lottery funds. She was given hospital arrest due to life-threatening health conditions. During the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, the Supreme Court acquitted her by a vote of 11–4. Also, the Supreme Court declared the Department of Justice&#x27;s &#x27;hold departure orders&#x27; unconstitutional. Arroyo&#x27;s lawyers stated afterward that she no longer needed her medical paraphernalia.

Arroyo is a member of the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language and supported the teaching of Spanish in the country&#x27;s education system during her presidency.

==Early life==
Arroyo was born as Maria Gloria Macaraeg Macapagal on April 5, 1947, at St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center Extension Clinic in Ermita, Manila, Philippines, to lawyer Diosdado Macapagal and his wife, Evangelina Guico Macaraeg Macapagal. She is the sister of Diosdado &quot;Boboy&quot; Macapagal Jr. She has two older siblings from her father&#x27;s first marriage with Purita de la Rosa, the sister of Rogelio de la Rosa, Arturo Macapagal and Cielo Macapagal Salgado. She was raised mostly in Lubao, Pampanga and during summer vacations, she lived with her maternal grandmother in Iligan City.

She moved with her family into Malacañang Palace in Manila when her father became president. A municipality was named in her honor, Gloria, Oriental Mindoro. She attended Assumption Convent for her elementary and high school education, graduating valedictorian in 1964. Arroyo then studied for two years at Georgetown University&#x27;s Walsh School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C. where she was a classmate of future United States president Bill Clinton. She then earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from Assumption College San Lorenzo graduating magna cum laude in 1968.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Arroyo married lawyer and businessman Jose Miguel Arroyo of Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. They have three children: including Juan Miguel (born 1969), and Diosdado Ignacio Jose Maria (born 1974). She received a master&#x27;s degree in economics at the Ateneo de Manila University (1978) and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of the Philippines Diliman (1985). From 1977 to 1987, she held teaching positions in several schools, including the University of the Philippines and the Ateneo de Manila University. She became chairperson of the Economics Department at Assumption College.

In 1987, she was invited by President Corazon Aquino to join the government as assistant secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry. She was promoted to undersecretary two years later. In her concurrent position as executive director of the Garments and Textile Export Board, Arroyo oversaw the rapid growth of the garment industry in the late 1980s.

==Senator (1992–1998)==
Arroyo entered politics in the 1992 election, running for senator. At the first general election under the 1987 Constitution, the top twelve vote-getting senatorial candidates would win a six-year term, and the next twelve candidates would win a three-year term. Arroyo ranked 13th in the elections, earning a three-year term. She was re-elected in 1995, topping the senatorial election with nearly 16 million votes.

As a legislator, Arroyo filed over 400 bills and authored or sponsored 55 laws during her tenure as senator, including the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, the Indigenous People&#x27;s Rights Law, and the Export Development Act. The 1995 Mining Act, which allows 100% foreign ownership of Philippine mines, has come under fire from left-wing political groups. Arroyo was also openly against the implementation of capital punishment in the country, advocating instead for better criminal rehabilitation during her time as Senator.

==Vice presidency (1998–2001)==
Arroyo considered a run for the presidency in the 1998 election, but was persuaded by President Fidel V. Ramos and leaders of the administration party Lakas-NUCD to instead seek the vice-presidency as the running mate of its presidential candidate, House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. Though the latter lost to popular former actor Joseph Estrada, Arroyo won the vice presidency by a large margin, garnering more than twice the votes of her closest opponent, Estrada&#x27;s running mate Senator Edgardo Angara.

Arroyo began her term as vice president on June 30, 1998, becoming the first female to hold the post. She was appointed by Estrada to a concurrent position in the cabinet as secretary of social welfare and development. As vice president, she was noted by political observers to continuously take a neutral stance on issues facing the government.

Arroyo resigned from the Cabinet in October 2000, distancing herself from Estrada, who was accused of corruption by a former political supporter, Chavit Singson, Governor of Ilocos Sur. She had initially resisted pressure from allies to speak out against Estrada, but eventually joined calls for Estrada&#x27;s resignation.

==Presidency (2001–2010)==

===First term (2001–2004)===
====Succession====
The last quarter of 2000 up to the first week of January 2001 was a period of political and economic uncertainty for the Philippines. On January 16, 2001, the impeachment trial also took a new direction. Private prosecutors walked out of the trial when pro-Estrada senators prevented the opening of an evidence (a brown envelope) containing bank records allegedly owned by President Joseph Estrada. With the walkout, the impeachment trial was not completed and Filipinos eventually took to the streets in masses to continue the clamor for President Estrada&#x27;s resignation.

From January 17 to 20, 2001, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos gathered at Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), the site of the original People Power Revolution. The clamor for a change in the presidency gained momentum as various sectors of Philippine society – professionals, students, artists, politicians, leftist and rightist groups – joined what became known as EDSA II. Officials of the administration, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP), the latter led by Panfilo Lacson, also withdrew their support for President Estrada.
Days after leaving Malacañang Palace, President Estrada&#x27;s lawyers and allies questioned the legitimacy of Arroyo&#x27;s presidency before the Supreme Court, with Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago among the more outspoken politicians to call for his reinstatement as president. Estrada reiterated that he had not officially resigned as president and that at most, Arroyo was just serving in an acting capacity. The high court, however, voted unanimously to uphold the legitimacy of Arroyo&#x27;s succession. As a consequence, Estrada no longer enjoys immunity from charges being filed against him.

In the last week of April 2001, the Sandiganbayan ordered the arrest of Estrada and his son, then mayor Jinggoy Estrada, for plunder charges. A few days later, Estrada supporters protested his arrest, gathered at the EDSA Shrine, and staged what they called, EDSA III – comparing their actions to the People Power revolution of 1986 and January 2001.

Thousands of protesters demanded the release of Estrada. Eventually, they also called for the ouster of Arroyo and the reinstatement of the former. On May 1, 2001, they marched towards Malacañang to force Arroyo to give in to their demands. Violence erupted when the protesters attempted to storm the presidential palace and the military and police were ordered to use their arms to drive them back. Arroyo declared a state of rebellion because of the violence and prominent political personalities affiliated with Estrada were charged and arrested. The so-called EDSA III was the first serious political challenge to the Arroyo presidency.

====Corruption charges and Oakwood Mutiny====
The Oakwood mutiny occurred in the Philippines on July 27, 2003. A group of 321 armed soldiers who called themselves &quot;Bagong Katipuneros&quot; led by Army Capt. Gerardo Gambala and Navy Lt. Antonio Trillanes IV took over the Oakwood Premier Ayala Center (now Ascott Makati) serviced apartment tower in Makati to show the Filipino people the alleged corruption of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration, believing that the president was going to declare martial law.

====2004 presidential election====

Article VII Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution explicitly states that the president of the Philippines can only serve for one term. However, the same provision also implicitly states that a president&#x27;s successor who has not served for more than four years can still seek a full term for the presidency. Although Arroyo fell under this category, she initially announced on December 29, 2002, that she would not seek the presidency in 2004. She emphasized that she would devote her remaining months in office to serving the people and improving the economy of the Philippines.

In October 2003, Arroyo changed her mind and announced that she will run in the May 2004 presidential elections and seek a direct mandate from the people. She explained, &quot;There is a higher cause — to change society...in a way that flourishes our future&quot;. With her decision, the initial criticisms hurled against Arroyo centered on her lack of word of honor.

As predicted by SWS exit polls, Arroyo won the election by a margin of over one million votes against Poe. However, the congressional canvassing was quite contentious as opposition lawmakers in the National Board of Canvassers argued that there were many discrepancies in the election returns and that insinuations of cheating were raised. On June 23, 2004, Congress proclaimed Arroyo and Noli de Castro as president and vice president, respectively.

===Second term (2004–2010)===
====2004 presidential election rigging allegations====

On June 30, 2004, in a break with tradition, Arroyo first delivered her inaugural speech at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila. She then departed for Cebu City for her oath taking, the first time that a Philippine president took the oath of office outside of Luzon.

Allegations of cheating against Arroyo gained momentum one year after the May 2004 elections. In a press conference held on June 10, 2005, Samuel Ong, former deputy director of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) claimed to have audio recordings of wiretapped conversations between Arroyo and an official of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). Virgilio Garcillano, a former COMELEC commissioner, would later be identified as the official talking to Arroyo. According to Ong, the recordings allegedly proved that Arroyo ordered the rigging of the national elections for her to win by around one million votes against Poe.

The recordings of Ong became known as the Hello Garci controversy and triggered massive protests against Arroyo. Key members of her cabinet resigned from their respective posts and urged Arroyo to do the same. On June 27, 2005, Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to a COMELEC official, claiming it was a &quot;lapse in judgement&quot;. She, however, denied influencing the outcome of the elections and declared that she won the elections fairly. Arroyo did not resign despite the pressures coming from various sectors of society.

The Hello Garci controversy became the basis of the impeachment case filed against Arroyo in 2005; attempts to impeach Arroyo failed later that year. Another impeachment case was filed against Arroyo in 2006 but was also defeated at the House of Representatives.

In October 2007, lawyer Alan Paguia filed an impeachment complaint against Arroyo in connection with the issue of bribery. Paguia&#x27;s complaint was based on the revelation of Pampanga Governor Ed Panlilio that various governors received half a million pesos from Malacañang. The impeachment case, as of the middle of October 2007, has already been referred to the House of Representatives Committee on Justice.

====2006 State of emergency====

On February 24, 2006, a plot to take over the government was uncovered by authorities, allegedly headed by Gen. Danilo Lim and other rightist military adventurists. General Lim and some of his men were arrested. To face the threat posed by enemies of the state, Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation 1017 and used it as basis in declaring a state of emergency throughout the Philippines. According to Arroyo, this declaration was done to quell the military rebellion, stop lawless violence, and promote peace and stability. Presidential Proclamation 1017 also empowered the government to enforce warrantless arrests and take over strategic private utilities companies. Several members of the Senate, including Franklin Drilon, Francis Pangilinan, and Pia Cayetano, condemned the proclamation as it contravenes &quot;the fundamental guarantees of the Constitution, particularly the basic civil liberties enshrined therein.&quot;

The state of emergency existed for about one week with the purpose of curbing further violence, illegal rallies, and public disturbance throughout the Philippines. The police and the military dispersed demonstrators and protesters, especially those along EDSA. Aside from General Lim, prominent personalities were also arrested in connection with their alleged participation in the attempt to overthrow the government.

Presidential Proclamation 1017 was lifted on March 3, 2006, but members of the opposition, private lawyers, and concerned citizens challenged its constitutionality before the Supreme Court. On May 4, the high court declared the proclamation constitutional; however, it also ruled it was illegal for the government to implement warrantless arrests and seize private institutions and companies.

====Charter change====
Arroyo spearheaded a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present unitary and presidential republic with a bicameral legislature into a federal parliamentary government with a unicameral legislature.
====K–12 implementation process====
After decades of surveys, consultations, and studies starting with the Monroe Survey in 1925 during the American period, the 9-year implementation process of K–12 curriculum finally began on May 20, 2008 during the Arroyo administration when Senator Mar Roxas filed the Omnibus Education Reform Act of 2008 (Senate Bill 2294) to strengthen the Philippine education system through timely interventions on the quality of teachers, the medium of instruction used and the evaluation of students&#x27; aptitude, among other aspects. It mandates the effectivity of K–12 four years later on April 24, 2012 during the administration of Arroyo&#x27;s successor Benigno Aquino III which increase in the number of years in basic education, from 10 years to 12 years as consistent with global standards.

On January 7, 2010, senator and presidential candidate Benigno Aquino III adopted the position of SB 2294; he said this will &quot;give everyone an equal chance to succeed&quot; and &quot;have quality education and profitable jobs.&quot;

===Economy===

Arroyo, who earned a master&#x27;s degree and doctorate in economics, made the Philippine economy the focus of her presidency. Annual economic growth in the Philippines averaged 4.5% during the Arroyo administration, expanding every quarter of her presidency. This is higher than in the administrations of her three immediate predecessors, Corazon Aquino (3.8%), Fidel Ramos (3.7%), and Joseph Estrada (3.7%). The Philippine economy grew at its fastest pace in three decades in 2007, with real GDP growth exceeding 7%. The economy was one of the few to avoid contraction during the 2008 global financial crisis, faring better than its regional peers due to minimal exposure to troubled international securities, lower dependence on exports, relatively resilient domestic consumption, large remittances from four-to five-million overseas Filipino workers, and a growing business process outsourcing industry. Arroyo&#x27;s handling of the economy has earned praise from former US president Bill Clinton, who cited her &quot;tough decisions&quot; that put the Philippine economy back in shape. Despite this growth, the poverty rate remained stagnant due to uneven distribution of income.

A controversial expanded value added tax (e-VAT) law, considered the centerpiece of the Arroyo administration&#x27;s economic reform agenda, was implemented in November 2005, aiming to complement revenue-raising efforts that could plug the country&#x27;s large budget deficit. Her administration originally set a target to balance the national budget by 2010. The tax measure boosted confidence in the government&#x27;s fiscal capacity and helped to strengthen the Philippine peso, making it East Asia&#x27;s best performing currency in 2005–06. The peso strengthened by nearly 20% in 2007, making it one of Asia&#x27;s better performing currencies for that year, a fact attributed to a combination of increased remittances from overseas Filipino workers and a strong domestic economy.

Early in her presidency, Arroyo implemented a controversial policy of holiday economics, adjusting holidays to form longer weekends with the purpose of boosting domestic tourism and allowing Filipinos more time with their families.

===Public perception===
The Social Weather Stations public opinion group has conducted quarterly surveys tracking the net satisfaction rating (&quot;satisfied&quot; rating minus &quot;dissatisfied&quot; rating&quot;) of President Arroyo. She began her presidency in the first quarter of 2001 with a net satisfaction rating of +24. Her rating first dipped into the negative in the first quarter of 2003, making Arroyo the only president to achieve a negative net satisfaction rating in SWS opinion polling. Her rating rebounded well into the positive in 2004, in time for the presidential election where she won election to a new six-year term. However, net satisfaction sunk back into negative territory in the fourth quarter of 2004, and has remained negative since, dipping as low as −38 in the second quarter of 2008. Her net satisfaction rating in the first quarter of 2009 was −32.

==Post-presidency (2010–present)==

===House of Representatives (2010–2019)===

In November 2009, Arroyo formally declared her intention to run for a seat in the House of Representatives representing the 2nd district of Pampanga, making her the second Philippine president – after Jose P. Laurel – to pursue a lower office after the expiration of their presidency. A petition seeking to disqualify Arroyo from the race was dismissed by the COMELEC for lack of merit, a decision which was later affirmed by the Supreme Court. With little serious competition, she was elected to Congress in May 2010 with a landslide victory. After receiving final military honors at the inauguration ceremony of incoming President Benigno Aquino III, she headed straight to San Fernando, Pampanga for her own oath-taking as congresswoman.

Despite being considered the strongest contender for speaker of the House, Arroyo declined to seek the position, hoping instead to take on a role similar to Sonia Gandhi, who was influential as merely the head of her party. On her first day as a lawmaker, Arroyo and her son Dato filed a resolution calling for Congress to call a constitutional convention to propose amendments to the existing constitution.

While still confined in the Veterans Memorial Medical Center for hospital arrest, Arroyo successfully earned a second term as congresswoman for Pampanga&#x27;s second congressional district at the conclusion of the 2013 Philippine mid-term elections on May 13, 2013, defeating the ruling Liberal Party&#x27;s Vivian Dabu, who was the provincial administrator under former Governor Ed Panlilio. She was re-elected in 2016 for her third consecutive term, running unopposed.

====2011 spinal surgery====
In early 2011, Arroyo was diagnosed with cervical spondylosis or cervical radiculopathy. She was rushed to the St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center in Taguig on July 25, 2011, minutes after the State of the Nation Address by Benigno Aquino III. Doctors performed a five-hour spine surgery on July 29, 2011. Two more surgeries occurred in August 2011, which aggravated her hypoparathyroidism. The House of Representatives, under the leadership of Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr., issued a travel permit allowing her to have treatment in Germany despite the Department of Justice hold departure order.

====2011 hospital arrest====
Arroyo was arrested on November 18, 2011, after a Pasay court issued a warrant of arrest against her, following the filing of a complaint for electoral sabotage by the COMELEC. The arrest warrant was served at the St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center in Taguig where Arroyo had been confined. Days earlier, the Supreme Court had issued a resolution enjoining attempts by the Department of Justice to prevent her departure from the Philippines to seek medical treatment overseas.

She was transferred to the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City on December 9, 2011. Arroyo was released from hospital arrest on bail on July 25, 2012.

On October 29, 2012, she refused to enter any plea on charges she misused $8.8 million in state lottery funds during her term in office. As of December 2013, she was still in custody at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center. On July 19, 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the corruption charges and ordered her release from the hospital where she had been detained since 2011.

====2014 medical problems and reapplication for bail====
Arroyo was transported to St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center for tests and treatment and returned to confinement at the Veteran&#x27;s Medical Center after medical incidents in May and June 2014. In June, after the second of these incidents, her attorneys renewed application for bail. In September, a third medical incident caused her to be again rushed to St. Luke&#x27;s for treatment and returned to confinement at the Veteran&#x27;s Medical Center.

====2015 United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention====
In a case filed by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared Arroyo&#x27;s hospital detention arbitrary and violative of the international law on human rights. It recognized that the charges against Arroyo were politically motivated since she was detained as a result of her exercise to take part in government and that the detention was arbitrary and illegal under international law because the Sandiganbayan court failed to take into account her individual circumstances when it repeatedly denied her bail.

====2016 Supreme Court acquittal====
On July 19, 2016, a few weeks after Duterte was sworn in as president, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the dismissal of plunder case against Arroyo, gathering a vote of 11–4 which was read by spokesperson Theodore Te.

She would later be assigned by Duterte&#x27;s party, PDP-Laban, as a high-level member of the House of Representatives after winning her third term as congresswoman in the House. She was given committee chairmanships, among many other roles.

===Speaker of the House (2018–2019)===

Arroyo was elected as the first female speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines. The election pushed through on July 23, 2018, due to a controversial majority manifesto and vote that ousted Pantaleon Alvarez. In August 2018, amid rumors that she was gunning to become prime minister under a proposed federal government, which she was advocating in the House, Arroyo stated that she will retire from politics and would not pursue any position after the May 2019 elections.

In January 2019, her speakership passed a House bill which lowered the criminal liability to twelve years old. She had a net satisfaction rating of −4 in September 2018, which further dropped to −21 in January 2019, becoming one of the most unpopular House speakers in Philippine history. Her leadership also spearheaded the changing of House rules in relation to Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALNs), requiring a fee for access, which amounts to for the SALNs of all 291 members of the House of Representatives, making it difficult for the poor to monitor corruption in the House.

In February 2019, Senator Panfilo Lacson accused Arroyo of adding an additional pork barrel of in the national budget.

===Political retirement===
Arroyo, although not holding any elective position, has been participating as a member of Lakas–CMD. As of June 2019, she is working on a memoir narrating her experiences as president, which she plans on limiting to 200 pages for consumption by the general public.

On November 26, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte appointed Arroyo as presidential adviser on Clark programs and projects.

===House of Representatives (2022–present)===

Arroyo came out of retirement to seek a comeback to the House of Representatives in 2022, running unopposed for the 2nd district of Pampanga. Her legal counsel, Peter Paul Magalang, filed the certificate of candidacy on her behalf. She has declared support to the candidacies of Bongbong Marcos for president and new Lakas party-mate Sara Duterte for vice president. She also joined the caravans and campaign sorties of their UniTeam Alliance.

On May 10, 2022, Arroyo was proclaimed as representative of the 2nd district of Pampanga, succeeding her son Mikey once again for a fourth nonconsecutive term. Although she assumed office on June 30, 2022, she took her oath of office on May 26 in Lubao and on June 13 before outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte at the Malacañang Palace. Arroyo said she will join her fellow representatives in passing the legislative agenda of the administration of President Bongbong Marcos and will continue to push for projects aligned with the Pampanga Megalopolis program. She initially aimed to regain the House speakership in the 19th Congress, soon after Marcos was elected, but later rescinded after realizing that Marcos wanted his cousin and her Lakas partymate, Rep. Martin Romualdez (Leyte–1st), to become the next House Speaker. She instead endorsed the speakership bid of Romualdez.

On July 25, 2022, Arroyo was named as Senior Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives under the new speakership of Martin Romualdez in the 19th Congress. 
Arroyo became part of President Bongbong Marcos&#x27;s delegation member of his international trips beginning on his working visit to Thailand in November 2022 for the 2022 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. She has also joined him in his visits to Belgium, China, Davos in Switzerland, Japan, the United States, and Indonesia. Marcos also described her as his &quot;secret weapon.&quot;

Her only daughter, Evangelina Lourdes Arroyo-Bernas, was made the country&#x27;s ambassador to Austria in December 2022. She defended accusations of nepotism noting her daughter&#x27;s qualifications.

On May 17, 2023, she was demoted by the House leadership from senior deputy speaker to a regular deputy speaker to unburden her heavy workload that came with the title. She switched places with fellow Pampanga Representative Aurelio Gonzales Jr. of the 3rd district. Later on November 7, 2023, she was expelled by the House from her position as a deputy house speaker, after she failed to support a resolution that aimed to uphold the House&#x27;s &quot;dignity, integrity and independence&quot; and to support the speakership of Martin Romualdez, as she was abroad when it was signed. This followed the criticism from her political ally, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who objected the House&#x27;s decision to reallocate the confidential funds originally for the offices of his daughter, Vice President and concurrent Education Secretary Sara Duterte. Arroyo was replaced by Representative Tonypet Albano (Isabela–1st).

Arroyo is running unopposed for re-election as Pampanga&#x27;s 2nd district representative in 2025.

==Scouting==
Arroyo was the second chief girl scout of the Girl Scouts of the Philippines.
==Approval ratings==

In July 2008, the Social Weather Stations (SWS) said that Arroyo registered a net satisfaction rating of minus 38 in a survey conducted in the last week of June, making her the most unpopular president in the country since democracy was restored in 1986.

<doc id="190448" wikidata="Q2542" url="?curid=190448" title="Horst Köhler">
<text>Horst Köhler (; 22 February 1943 – 1 February 2025) was a German politician who served as President of Germany from 2004 to 2010. As the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the CDU (of which he was a member) and the CSU, as well as the liberal FDP, Köhler was elected to his first five-year term by the Federal Convention on 23 May 2004 and was subsequently inaugurated on 1 July 2004. He was reelected to a second term on 23 May 2009. Just a year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over a comment on the role of the German Armed Forces in light of a visit to the troops in Afghanistan. During his tenure as president, whose office is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician, with approval rates above those of both Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and later Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Köhler was an economist by profession. Prior to his election as president, Köhler had a distinguished career in politics and the civil service and as a banking executive. He was president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1998 to 2000 and head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2000 to 2004. From 2012 to 2013, Köhler served on the UN Secretary-General&#x27;s High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.

==Early life==
Köhler was born in Skierbieszów (then named Heidenstein), in the General Government area of German-occupied Poland, as the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler, into a family of Bessarabian Germans from Rîșcani in Romanian Bessarabia (near Bălți, present-day Moldova). Horst Köhler&#x27;s parents, ethnic Germans and Romanian citizens, had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940 during the Nazi-Soviet population transfers that followed the invasion of Poland and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which awarded Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. As part of the , they were resettled in 1942 at Skierbieszów, a village near Zamość, Poland (then part of the General Government). The owner and family of house occupied by Kohlers were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp where they were killed by Germans serving in the SS. As the Wehrmacht was pushed back and the first parts of Poland had to be abandoned in 1944, the Köhler family fled to Leipzig. In 1953, they left the Soviet Zone – via West Berlin – to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in refugee camps until 1957, when they settled in Ludwigsburg. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee.

==Studies and military service==
A teacher recommended that the refugee boy Köhler should apply for the Gymnasium, and Köhler took his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1963. After two years of military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen, he left the Bundeswehr as &quot;Leutnant der Reserve&quot; (Reserve Lieutenant). He studied and finally gained a doctorate in economics and political sciences from the University of Tübingen, where he was a scientific research assistant at the from 1969 to 1976.

==Career in the civil service==
Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics. In 1981, he was employed in the &quot;Staatskanzlei des Landes Schleswig-Holstein&quot; (chancellery of the state government of Schleswig-Holstein) under Minister-president Gerhard Stoltenberg. 
On 1 October 1982, Helmut Kohl (CDU) became Chancellor of Germany. He formed the First Kohl cabinet. Upon Stoltenberg&#x27;s recommendation (who was Federal Finance Minister in Kohl&#x27;s first, second and third cabinet until 21 April 1989), Köhler was made head of Stoltenberg&#x27;s office in the Federal Ministry of Finance. 
Köhler rose to Director General for financial policy and federal industrial interests in 1987. In 1989 he became Director General for currency and credit.

==Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance==
A member of the CDU from 1981, Köhler was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993, and as such, the administrative head of the Ministry and the deputy of the Federal Minister of Finance (Theodor Waigel). In that capacity, he served as a &quot;sherpa&quot; (personal representative) for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preparing G7 summits and other international economic conferences. 
As secretary of state, Köhler negotiated both the German–German monetary union and the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from the GDR in 1994. 
In addition, he was chief negotiator for the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union, which led to the creation of the euro as the Union&#x27;s single currency.

Köhler also played a central role in organizing the enormously expensive privatization of state businesses (VEB) in Eastern Germany. He organized the Treuhand, the agency charged with selling 11,000 aged and moribund VEBs.

==Career in banking 1993–2000==
Between 1993 and 1998 he served as president of the association of savings banks in Germany, Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband.

In September 1998 Köhler was appointed president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and settled in London, where the headquarters of the bank is located. The EBRD then was facing annual losses of US$305 million, largely due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis. He took stock of the situation, then began to refocus the EBRD&#x27;s notoriously lax investment policies and tighten up on opulence at the bank itself. 
At the same time, he was widely reputed to clash with his American vice president, Charles Frank, and other EBRD officials reportedly complained about his temper and management style.

==Head of the International Monetary Fund, 2000–2004==

Köhler was appointed managing director and Chairman of the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2000. The government of Gerhard Schröder nominated him after their first nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States. Though respected, Köhler was not a particularly well known or prestigious figure in international financial circles. At the time, he was one of three candidates for the IMF position, with Japan having put forward its former deputy finance minister Eisuke Sakakibara and several African nations backing Stanley Fischer.

In one of his first moves at the IMF, Köhler joined British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown in hosting a gathering of anti-poverty activists to discuss an international campaign to write off billions of dollars in debts that developing nations owe the IMF, World Bank and other government creditors.

Before entering the office of managing director, Köhler had spent time in Indonesia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis and thereafter cited it as an example of the fund&#x27;s tendency towards intrusive micromanagement. Instead, he intended to focus the Fund primarily on broad economic management and to reduce overlapping activity with the World Bank. Shortly after taking office in May 2000, he established the Financial Sector Review Group under the leadership of John Lipsky to provide an independent perspective on the Fund&#x27;s work on international financial markets, In March 2001, on the group&#x27;s recommendations, he created the International Capital Markets Department, a unit to anticipate and head off financial crises in countries to which the fund makes loans.

In 2001, Köhler recommended naming Timothy Geithner to replace Stanley Fischer as deputy managing director; instead, the US government under President George W. Bush successfully pushed for Anne O. Krueger to take the position.

In order to accept his nomination as presidential candidate, Köhler left the IMF a year before his term was scheduled to end in May 2005. Among his accomplishments were overseeing debt crises in Brazil and Turkey and expanding debt relief for the world&#x27;s poorest countries. He had less success resolving the continuing debt problems in Argentina.

He lived in Washington, D.C., from 2000 to 2004.

==9th president of Germany, 2004–2010==

On 4 March 2004, Köhler resigned his post with the IMF after being nominated by Germany&#x27;s conservative and liberal opposition parties (CDU/CSU and FDP) as their presidential candidate. As these parties controlled a majority of votes in the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; (&quot;Federal Assembly&quot;: an electoral college consisting of the membership of the Bundestag and an equal number of delegates appointed by the legislatures of each state), the result of the vote amounted to essentially a foregone conclusion, but was closer than expected. Köhler defeated Gesine Schwan on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580; 20 votes were cast for minor candidates. Köhler succeeded Johannes Rau as president on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term. Germany&#x27;s presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but is also invested with considerable moral authority. From 2004 until early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst Schloss Bellevue was being renovated.

Upon his election, Köhler, a conservative German patriot, said that &quot;Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites.&quot; &quot;Die Welt&quot; wrote, &quot;He appeared an enlightened patriot who genuinely loves his country and is not afraid to say so&quot;. Presenting his visions for Germany, Köhler also said that &quot;Germany should become a land of ideas&quot;, and emphasized the importance of globalization, and that Germany would have to compete for its place in the 21st century. Domestically, President Köhler became concerned with the question of how to preserve and create jobs in an internationally competitive environment.

During his presidency, Köhler gained a reputation for regularly voicing his opinion on foreign policy matters. He called for &quot;globalization with a human face&quot; and became a strong advocate of poverty eradication.
In his inaugural speech, Köhler had set his focus on a &quot;fair partnership with Africa&quot; which he described as a question of European self-respect:

Throughout his six years as president, Köhler &quot;worked hard to put Africa on the top of Germany&#x27;s political agenda&quot;, according to Deutsche Welle. One of his trademark projects was the Partnership with Africa initiative, which brought together heads of state, entrepreneurs, intellectuals and students from Africa and Europe to create a &quot;dialogue of equals&quot;. Through unapologetic criticism of both Europe&#x27;s negligence of the African continent and of sensitive issues in African politics, including corruption, Köhler gained wide popularity across Africa.

On the eve of his resignation, Köhler presented his book &quot;Schicksal Afrika&quot;, an edited volume on the continent&#x27;s future with contributions from 41 authors, including former African presidents Thabo Mbeki and John Kufuor as well as Nobel Prize Literature Laureate Wole Soyinka.

By the summer of 2005, he was Germany&#x27;s most popular political figure, with an approval rating of 72 percent, according to a poll published in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;.

In July 2005, he dissolved the Bundestag at Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s request, after the latter had lost a motion of confidence. This led to an early Bundestag election in September 2005.

In August 2005, Köhler attended the memorial ceremony for Brother Roger, the founder of the Taizé Community, an ecumenical monastic community in Burgundy.
In October 2006, Köhler made a far-reaching decision by vetoing the bill which would transfer Germany&#x27;s Air Safety Administration Deutsche Flugsicherung into private ownership. The Bundestag passed this legislation but as president, Köhler was authorized not to sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravened the constitution. In December 2006 he did not sign the Consumer Information Law (which intended to make information collected by public food safety agencies available to consumers), because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the nation&#x27;s states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany&#x27;s president had chosen to reject bills and in most instances less important legislation had been involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history.

In March 2007, Köhler turned down a politically contentious request for clemency by Christian Klar, a terrorist from the far-left Red Army Faction. His meeting with Klar had drawn protests from conservative politicians, who said Klar had shown no remorse for his crimes. The president also denied clemency to another member, Birgit Hogefeld.

In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government (First Merkel cabinet) to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector (which had led to the loss of 1,000 jobs at Deutsche Post rival PIN Group), stating that &quot;a minimum wage that cannot be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs&quot;.

On 22 May 2008, Köhler announced his candidacy for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009, he was re-elected by the Federal Assembly, and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009.

=== Resignation ===
On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany. This came after German politicians criticized comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:
After coming under criticism for his statements that Germany&#x27;s military missions abroad also served to secure trade, critics accused him of advocating the use of &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot;. He subsequently stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favoring an unconstitutional position. After getting no substantial support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010, issuing a statement saying &quot;I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect.&quot; The resignation was considered a &quot;surprise&quot;, and both pundits and opposition politicians labeled it &quot;an overreaction&quot;. The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position.

As stipulated by the constitution, the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the Bundesrat, Jens Böhrnsen, until Christian Wulff was elected president on 30 June 2010. Wulff himself resigned less than two years later after allegations of corruption were levelled against him. Wulff resigned on 17 February 2012 and was succeeded by Joachim Gauck.

==Post-presidency==
After leaving office, Köhler continued to voice his opinion on selected foreign and domestic policy matters, most notably on Europe–Africa relations, the global fight against poverty and climate change as well as on the need for a new spirit of global partnership.

Between 2010 and 2011, Köhler served as member of the Palais-Royal Initiative, a group convened by Michel Camdessus, Alexandre Lamfalussy and Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa to reform the international monetary system.

From 2012 to 2013, Köhler served on the United Nations&#x27; High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which was co-chaired by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom. The advisory board was established by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to shape the global development agenda beyond 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals. The Panel produced a final report with recommendations and thereby contributed in the making of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by all UN member states in September 2015.

Within Germany, Köhler was widely regarded as one of the country&#x27;s most experienced experts on Africa, although he himself publicly rejected this label, saying in his speech &quot;On the impossibility of speaking of Africa&quot;: &quot;The more I learned about Africa, the more I realized how much there still was to learn&quot;.

On several occasions, Köhler officially represented Germany as former president. Köhler took part in Namibia&#x27;s 25th Independence Day festivities and represented Germany at President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta&#x27;s inauguration ceremony in Mali the same year. Beginning in 2016, Köhler co-chaired, together with former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a Special Panel of the African Development Bank (AfDB).

In 2017, Köhler was appointed by Secretary-General António Guterres as his new special envoy for Western Sahara, in charge of restarting talks between Morocco and the Polisario independence movement over the disputed territory. In that capacity, Köhler invited the foreign ministers of Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania as well as the secretary general of the Polisario Front in late 2018 for a meeting in Geneva to broker a settlement over the territory; this marked the first time in six years that the involved parties met for negotiations. In 2019, he left his post on health grounds.

Köhler also worked for numerous charities and non-profit organizations, and held a honorary professorship at the University of Tübingen, his alma mater. After his retirement from German and European politics, he held a variety of positions, including:
* Scope Foundation, Member of the Honorary Board (as of 2020)
* Aktion Deutschland Hilft (Germany&#x27;s Relief Coalition), Patron
* Club of Madrid, Member
* Deutsche Nationalstiftung, Chairman of the Senate

* Friede Springer Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees (as of 2011)
* Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS), Member of the Board of Trustees
* Wittenberg Center for Global Ethics, Member of the Board of Trustees (as of 2011)

* Emerging Markets Forum (EMF), Co-chair

* Opera Village Africa, Honorary Patron
* Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Patron of the Horst Köhler Fellowship Programme
* Stiftung Weltethos (Global Ethics Foundation), Member of the Board of Trustees*
* Club of Rome, Honorary Member
* University of Tübingen, Honorary Senator

==Personal life and death==
In 1969, Köhler married Eva Köhler (née Bohnet), a teacher. They had two children, a daughter Ulrike (born in 1972) and a son Jochen (born in 1977). Köhler was a member of the Protestant Church in Germany. A passionate swimmer, runner and cross-country skier, Köhler chose to spend much of his time in natural surroundings. Köhler lived with his wife in Berlin and Chiemgau. 

Köhler died in Berlin on 1 February 2025 after a short illness, at 81 years of age.
