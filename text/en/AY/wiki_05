<text>Religious nationalism can be understood in a number of ways, such as nationalism as a religion itself, a position articulated by Carlton Hayes in his text &quot;Nationalism: A Religion,&quot; or as the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, dogma, ideology, or affiliation. This relationship can be broken down into two aspects: the politicisation of religion and the influence of religion on politics.

In the former aspect, a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Another political aspect of religion is the support of a national identity, similar to a shared ethnicity, language, or culture. The influence of religion on politics is more ideological, where current interpretations of religious ideas inspire political activism and action; for example, laws are passed to foster stricter religious adherence.

Ideologically-driven religious nationalism may not necessarily be targeted against other religions &quot;&quot;, but can be articulated in response to modernity and, in particular, secular nationalism. Indeed, religious nationalism may articulate itself as the binary of secular nationalism. Nation-states whose borders are relatively recent or that have experienced colonialism may be more prone to religious nationalism, which may stand as a more authentic or &quot;traditional&quot; rendering of identity. Thus, there was a global rise of religious nationalism in the wake of the end of the Cold War, but also as postcolonial politics (facing considerable developmental challenges, but also dealing with the reality of colonially-defined, and therefore somewhat artificial, borders) became challenged. In such a scenario, appealing to a national sense of Islamic identity, as in the case of Pakistan (see two-nation theory), may serve to override regional tensions.

The danger is that when the state derives political legitimacy from adherence to religious doctrines, this may leave an opening to overtly religious elements, institutions, and leaders, making the appeals to religion more &#x27;authentic&#x27; by bringing more explicitly theological interpretations to political life. Thus, appeals to religion as a marker of ethnicity create an opening for more strident and ideological interpretations of religious nationalism. Many ethnic and cultural nationalisms include religious aspects, but as a marker of group identity, rather than the intrinsic motivation for nationalist claims.

==Buddhist nationalism==
Buddhist Nationalism is mainly prevalent and influential in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, and is also present in Cambodia and Thailand.

Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism is a political ideology that combines a focus on Sinhalese culture and ethnicity with an emphasis on Theravada Buddhism, which is the majority belief system of the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka.

The Patriotic Association of Myanmar and 969 movement have the goal to &quot;organise and protect&quot; the Burman people and their Buddhist religion, which is influenced by Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar.

==Christian nationalism==

Christian nationalists focus more on internal politics, such as passing laws that reflect their view of Christianity. In countries with a state Church, Christian nationalists, in seeking to preserve the status of a Christian state, uphold an antidisestablishmentarian position. They actively promote religious (Christian) discourses in various fields of social life, from politics and history to culture and science; with respect to legislation for example, Christian nationalists advocate Sunday blue laws. Distinctive radicalized forms of religious nationalism or &quot;clerical nationalism&quot; (clero-nationalism or clerico-nationalism) were emerging on the far-right of the political spectrum in various European countries especially during the interwar period in the first half of the 20th century.

*In the Middle Ages, efforts were made to establish a Pan-Christian state by uniting the countries within Christendom. Christian nationalism played a role in this era in which Christians felt the impulse to recover lands in which Christianity flourished. After the rise of Islam, certain parts of North Africa, East Asia, Southern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East lost Christian control. 
*In Poland, nationalism was always characterized by loyalty to the Catholic Church. Groups like the National Revival of Poland use slogans like &quot;Wielka Polska Katolicka&quot; (Great Catholic Poland) and protest vigorously against legalization of gay marriage and abortion. Conservative religious groups connected with Radio Maryja are often accused of harboring nationalist and antisemitic attitudes.
*Religious nationalism which is characterized by communal adherence to Eastern Orthodoxy and national Orthodox Churches is found in many states of Eastern Europe as well as in the Russian Federation and Serbia.

==Hindu nationalism==

Given the extensive linguistic, religious, and ethnic diversity of the Indian population, nationalism in India in general does not fall within the purview of a solitary variant of nationalism. Indians may identify with their nation on account of civic, cultural, or third-world nationalism. Commentators have noted that in modern India, a contemporary form of Hindu nationalism, or Hindutva, has been endorsed by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

Hindutva (meaning &quot;Hinduness&quot;), a term popularised by Hindu nationalist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in 1923, is the predominant form of Hindu nationalism in India. Hindutva is championed by right-wing Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), widely regarded as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s parent organisation, along with its affiliate organisations, notably the Vishva Hindu Parishad.

== Islamic nationalism ==
=== Pakistan ===
Unlike the secular form of nationalism which is espoused in most other countries, Pakistani nationalism is religious in nature, consisting of Islamic nationalism. Religion was the basis of the Pakistani nationalist narrative. (see Secularism in Pakistan) Pakistani nationalism is closely associated with Muslim heritage, the religion of Islam, and it is also associated with Pan-Islamism, as it is described in the Two-nation theory. It also refers to the consciousness and the expression of religious and ethnic influences that help mould the national consciousness. Pakistan has been called a &quot;global center for political Islam&quot;.

Hamas is a party which mixes Palestinian nationalism with Islamism.

Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Islam and Other Rebel Groups mix Syrian nationalism with Islamism

Jaish ul-Adl mixes Baloch nationalism with Islamism.

The Taliban&#x27;s ideology combines Islamism with Pashtunwali and Afghan nationalism

Somali Islamist movement Al-Shabaab incorporates Somali religious nationalism and anti-imperialism into its Salafi Jihadist ideology.

==Jewish nationalism==

Religious Zionism is an ideology that combines Zionism and Orthodox Judaism. Before the establishment of the State of Israel, most Religious Zionists were observant Jews who supported Zionist efforts to rebuild a Jewish state in the Land of Israel. After the Six-Day War, and the capture of the West Bank, right-wing supporters of the Religious Zionist movement integrated themselves into Israeli nationalism and they eventually founded a new movement which evolved into Neo-Zionism, the ideology of Neo-Zionism revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.

==Nationalism in modern paganism==
Paganism resurfaces as a topic of fascination in 18th to 19th-century Romanticism, in particular in the context of the literary Viking revivals, which portrayed historical Celtic, Slavic and Germanic polytheists as noble savages.

Romanticist interest in non-classical antiquity coincided with the rise of Romantic nationalism and the rise of the nation state in the context of the 1848 revolutions, leading to the creation of national epics and national myths for the various newly formed states. Pagan or folkloric topics were also common in the musical nationalism of the period.

Organisations such as the Armanen-Orden represent significant developments in neo-pagan esotericism and Ariosophy after World War II, but they do not all constitute forms of Nazi esotericism. Some northern European neopagan groups, such as Theods, Ásatrúarfélagið, and Viðartrúar, have explicitly stated that neo-Nazism is not common among their members.

==Shinto==

The &quot;State Shinto&quot; term was used to categorize, and promote, Imperial Japanese practices that relied on Shinto to support Japan&#x27;s nationalistic ideology. By refusing to ban Shinto practices outright, Japan&#x27;s post-war constitution was thus able to preserve full freedom of religion.

==Sikh==

The Khalistan movement is a Sikh separatist movement seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing a sovereign state, called &quot;Khālistān&quot; (&#x27;Land of the Khalsa&#x27;), in the Punjab region. The proposed state would consist of land that currently forms Punjab, India, and Punjab, Pakistan.

==Other religious movements and nationalism==
In the Korean peninsula, the &quot;Donghak&quot; movement and its leader, Choe Je-u, were inspired by Korean Catholic missionaries. However, they condemned the &#x27;Western learning&#x27; preached by missionaries and contrasted it with the indigenous &#x27;Eastern learning&#x27;. They started a rebellion in 1894 in Jeolla province in southwestern Korea. The &quot;Donghak&quot; movement served as a template for the later &quot;Daejonggyo&quot; and &quot;Jeungsan-gyo&quot; movements, as well as for other religious nationalist movements. The Buddhist-influenced &quot;Daejonggyo&quot; movement financed guerillas in Manchuria during Japanese colonial rule of both Korea and Manchuria. The North Korean state ideology, &quot;Juche&quot;, is sometimes classified as a religion in the United States Department of State&#x27;s human rights reports.

<text>An anapaest (; also spelled anapæst or anapest, also called antidactylus) is a metrical foot used in formal poetry. In classical quantitative meters it consists of two short syllables followed by a long one; in accentual stress meters it consists of two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable. It may be seen as a reversed dactyl. This word comes from the Greek , &quot;anápaistos&quot;, literally &quot;struck back&quot; and in a poetic context &quot;a dactyl reversed&quot;.

Because of its length and the fact that it ends with a stressed syllable and so allows for strong rhymes, anapaest can produce a very rolling verse, and allows for long lines with a great deal of internal complexity.

Apart from their independent role, anapaests are sometimes used as substitutions in iambic verse. In strict iambic pentameter, anapaests are rare, but they are found with some frequency in freer versions of the iambic line, such as the verse of Shakespeare&#x27;s last plays, or the lyric poetry of the 19th century.

==Examples==
===Trimeter===
Here is an example from William Cowper&#x27;s &quot;Verses Supposed to be Written by Alexander Selkirk&quot; (1782), composed in anapaestic trimeter:

:&quot;I must finish my journey alone&quot;

===Tetrameter===
An example of anapaestic tetrameter is the &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; by Clement Clarke Moore (1823):

:&quot;Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house&quot;

The following is from Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot;:

:&quot;The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold&quot;
:&quot;And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold&quot;
:&quot;And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea&quot;
:&quot;When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.&quot;

===Hexameter===
An even more complex example comes from Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin&quot; (1889). He intersperses anapests and iambs, using six-foot lines (rather than four feet as above). Since the anapaest is already a long foot, this makes for very long lines.

:&quot;Fled foam underneath us and &#x27;round us, a wandering and milky smoke&quot;
:&quot;As high as the saddle-girth, covering away from our glances the tide&quot;
:&quot;And those that fled and that followed from the foam-pale distance broke.&quot;
:&quot;The immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces and sighed.&quot;

The mixture of anapaests and iambs in this manner is most characteristic of late-19th-century verse, particularly that of Algernon Charles Swinburne in poems such as &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot; (1866) and the choruses from &quot;&quot; (1865). Swinburne also wrote several poems in more or less straight anapaests, with line-lengths varying from three feet (&quot;Dolores&quot;) to eight feet (&quot;March: An Ode&quot;).

===Heptameter===
Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s song &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; can be described as mainly being written in anapaestic heptameter, or two dimetric lines followed by a trimetric one. At the end of the verses there is a critic monometer and a line that is a variation of an iambic pentameter.

:&quot;What a beautiful face&quot;
:&quot;I have found in this place&quot;
:&quot;That is circling all &#x27;round the sun&quot;
:&quot;What a beautiful dream&quot;
:&quot;That could flash on the screen&quot;
:&quot;In a blink of an eye and be gone from me&quot;
:Soft and sweet
:&quot;Let me hold it close and keep it here with me&quot;

===Comic poetry===
The anapaest&#x27;s most common role in English verse is as a comic metre: the foot of the limerick, of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; (1876), Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1846), &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; (1939) by T. S. Eliot, a number of Dr. Seuss books, among other examples.

<text>Genesis was a NASA sample-return probe that collected a sample of solar wind particles and returned them to Earth for analysis. It was the first NASA sample-return mission to return material since the Apollo program, and the first to return material from beyond the orbit of the Moon. &quot;Genesis&quot; was launched on August 8, 2001, and the sample return capsule crash-landed in Utah on September 8, 2004, after a design flaw prevented the deployment of its drogue parachute. The crash contaminated many of the sample collectors. Although most were damaged, some of the collectors were successfully recovered.

The &quot;Genesis&quot; science team demonstrated that some of the contamination could be removed or avoided, and that the solar wind particles could be analyzed using a variety of approaches, achieving all of the mission&#x27;s major science objectives.

==Objectives==

The mission&#x27;s primary science objectives were:
* To obtain precise solar isotopic abundances of ions in the solar wind, as essentially no data having a precision sufficient for solving planetary science problems are available;
* To obtain greatly improved solar elemental abundances by factor of 3–10 in accuracy over what is in the literature;
* To provide a reservoir of solar matter for 21st century science to be archived similarly as the lunar samples.

Accordingly, in order to meet the mission science objectives, the &quot;Genesis&quot; spacecraft was designed to collect solar wind ions and return them to Earth for analysis. &quot;Genesis&quot; carried several different solar wind collectors, all of which passively collected solar wind; that is, the collectors sat in space facing the Sun, while the ions in the solar wind crashed into them at speeds over and, on impact, buried themselves in the surface of the collectors. This passive collection is a process similar to that used by the semi-conductor industry to make certain types of devices, and a simulation of the process is given by the free-access program SRIM.

Most of the &quot;Genesis&quot; collectors continuously sampled all of the solar wind which the spacecraft encountered (the &quot;bulk solar wind&quot;). However, the spacecraft also carried three arrays of collectors which were deployed when specific &quot;regimes&quot; (fast, slow, coronal mass ejections) of solar wind were encountered, as determined by the electron and ion monitors on board. These deployable collector arrays were designed to provide data to test the hypothesis that the rock-forming elements keep their relative proportions throughout the processes which form the solar wind.

There was a third type of collector on &quot;Genesis&quot;: the concentrator, which collected bulk solar wind, but was discriminating in that it electrostatically repelled hydrogen and had enough voltage to focus the lighter solar wind elements onto a small target, concentrating those ions by a factor of ~20. The objective of the concentrator was to bring back a sample with enhanced amounts of solar wind ions to make it possible for analysts to precisely measure the isotopes of the light elements.

==Operation==

===Mission profile===
&quot;Genesis&quot; was a Discovery-class mission of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology. The spacecraft was designed and built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems at a total mission cost of .

NASA launched the craft on a Delta II 7326 rocket on August 8, 2001, at 16:13:40 UTC from Cape Canaveral. The development of the trajectory for the mission was led by Martin Lo. Following launch, &quot;Genesis&quot; cruised to the Earth-Sun then performed a Lissajous orbit insertion maneuver, entering an elliptical orbit about on November 16, 2001. &quot;Genesis&quot; exposed its collector arrays on December 3, and began collecting solar wind particles. The collection process ended after 850 days, on April 1, 2004, with the spacecraft completing five halo loops around . &quot;Genesis&quot; began its return to Earth on April 22, 2004. The return phase included an orbital detour toward the Earth so that the craft could be recovered during the daytime, as a direct approach would have forced it to be recovered at night. After completing one halo loop about , the &quot;Genesis&quot; sample return capsule separated from the spacecraft bus and returned to Earth for the planned recovery on September 8, 2004.

===Recovery phase===
Following completion of the collection phase, the collector arrays were stowed in a sample return capsule, and the spacecraft returned to Earth. As the capsule was approaching Earth and at the first stages of re-entry, all appeared well.

Extensive planning had been conducted for the capsule&#x27;s retrieval. A normal parachute landing might have damaged the delicate samples, so the mission design called for a mid-air retrieval of the sample return capsule. About above the ground, a drogue parachute was to be deployed to slow descent. Then, at a height of , a large parafoil was to be deployed to slow descent further and leave the capsule in stable flight. A helicopter, with a second helicopter as a backup, was then to attempt to catch the capsule by its parachute on the end of a five-meter hook. Once retrieved, the capsule would have been soft-landed.

The sample return capsule entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere over northern Oregon at 16:55 UTC on September 8, 2004, with a velocity of approximately . Due to a design flaw in a deceleration sensor, parachute deployment was never triggered, and the spacecraft&#x27;s descent was slowed only by its own air resistance. The planned mid-air retrieval could not be carried out, and the capsule crashed into the desert floor of the Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele County, Utah, at about .

The capsule broke open on impact, and part of the inner sample capsule was also breached. The damage was less severe than might have been expected given its velocity; it was to some extent cushioned by falling into fairly soft ground.

Unfired pyrotechnic devices in the parachute deployment system and toxic gases from the batteries delayed the recovery team&#x27;s approach to the crash site. After all was made safe, the damaged sample-return capsule was secured and moved to a clean room for inspection; simultaneously a crew of trained personnel scoured the site for collector fragments and sampled the local desert soil to archive as a reference by which to identify possible contaminants in the future. Recovery efforts by &quot;Genesis&quot; team members at the Utah Test and Training Range – which included inspecting, cataloging and packaging various collectors – took four weeks.

===Fate of spacecraft bus===
After releasing the sample return capsule on September 8, 2004, the spacecraft bus traveled back toward the Earth-Sun Lagrange Point (). A trajectory correction maneuver was performed on November 6, 2004, permitting the spacecraft bus to eventually leave if it was not used for an extended mission. Final commands were transmitted to the bus on December 2, 2004, placing &quot;Genesis&quot; into hibernation. While in this &quot;safe&quot; mode, it will continue transmitting information about its condition, autonomously pointing its solar arrays toward the Sun. The spacecraft bus left around February 1, 2005, staying in a heliocentric orbit leading the Earth.

==Sample extraction and results==
Initial investigations showed that some wafers had crumbled on impact, but others were largely intact. Desert dirt entered the capsule, but not liquid water. Because the solar wind particles were expected to be embedded in the wafers, whereas the contaminating dirt was thought likely just to lie on the surface, it was possible to separate the dirt from the samples. Unexpectedly, it was not terrestrial desert soil introduced in the crash that proved most difficult to deal with during the sample analysis process, but the craft&#x27;s own compounds such as lubricants and craft-building materials.

The analysis team stated that they should be able to achieve most of their primary science goals. On September 21, 2004, the extraction began, and in January 2005 a first sample piece of an aluminum wafer was sent to scientists at Washington University in St. Louis for analysis.

The &quot;Genesis&quot; solar wind samples are under long-term curation at NASA Johnson Space Center so that as sample analysis techniques evolve, pristine solar wind samples will be available to the scientific community in the decades to come.

===Noble gases===
In 2007, scientists at Washington University published detailed neon and argon isotope findings. The remaining results on the elemental and isotopic composition of the noble gases were reported in 2009. The results agree with data from lunar samples containing &quot;young&quot; (~100 million years) solar wind, indicating that solar wind composition has not changed within at least the last 100 million years.

===Oxygen isotopes===
On April 20, 2005, scientists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston removed the four solar wind collectors from the concentrator and found them in excellent condition. The concentrator&#x27;s targets collected solar-oxygen ions during the mission and would be analyzed to measure solar-oxygen isotopic composition, the highest-priority measurement objective for &quot;Genesis&quot;.

The team announced on March 10, 2008, that analysis of a silicon carbide wafer from the &quot;Genesis&quot; concentrator showed that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 () relative to the Earth, Moon, Mars, and bulk meteorites. This implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 by about 6% from the Sun&#x27;s disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the inner planets and the asteroid belt.

===Nitrogen isotopes===
Nitrogen was a key target element because the extent and origin of its isotopic variations in Solar System materials were unknown. Target material showed that implanted solar wind nitrogen has a ratio of (that is, ≈40% poorer in relative to the terrestrial atmosphere). The ratio of the protosolar nebula was , which is the lowest ratio known for Solar System objects. This result demonstrates the extreme nitrogen isotopic heterogeneity of the nascent Solar System and accounts for the -depleted components observed in Solar System reservoirs.

==Mishap Investigation Board (MIB)==
A 16-member NASA Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) was appointed, including experts on pyrotechnics, avionics, and other specialties. The MIB started its work on September 10, 2004, when it arrived at Dugway Proving Ground. It determined that all scientific hardware meant to be curated by the Johnson Space Center could be released and were not needed for the work of the board. Both JPL and Lockheed Martin began to prepare flight data and other records for the MIB.

It was announced by the MIB on September 20, 2004, that the capsule, having had the science material extracted, would be moved to the Lockheed Martin Space Systems facility near Denver, Colorado, for MIB use.

A first possible root cause of the failed deployment of the parachutes was announced in an October 14 press release. Lockheed Martin had designed the system with an acceleration sensor&#x27;s internal mechanisms wrongly oriented (a G-switch was backwards), and design reviews had not caught the mistake. The accelerometer was installed according to the incorrect design. The intended design was to make an electrical contact inside the sensor at , maintaining it through the maximum expected , and breaking the contact again at 3 &quot;g&quot; to start the parachute release sequence. Instead, no contact was ever made.

The same general parachute concept was also used on the &quot;Stardust&quot; cometary sample return spacecraft, which landed successfully in 2006.

NASA investigation board chair Michael Ryschkewitsch noted that none of the stringent review procedures at NASA had picked up a mistake, saying, &quot;It would be very easy to mix this up.&quot;

This mishap is similar to the original event that inspired Edward A. Murphy Jr. to formulate the now-famous Murphy&#x27;s Law: an accelerometer installed backwards. On January 6, 2006, Ryschkewitsch revealed that a pre-test procedure on the craft was skipped by Lockheed Martin, and he noted that the test could have easily detected the problem.

<text>In mathematics, a self-adjoint operator on a complex vector space &quot;V&quot; with inner product formula_1 is a linear map &quot;A&quot; (from &quot;V&quot; to itself) that is its own adjoint. That is, formula_2 for all formula_3 ∊ &quot;V&quot;. If &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional with a given orthonormal basis, this is equivalent to the condition that the matrix of &quot;A&quot; is a Hermitian matrix, i.e., equal to its conjugate transpose &quot;A&quot;. By the finite-dimensional spectral theorem, &quot;V&quot; has an orthonormal basis such that the matrix of &quot;A&quot; relative to this basis is a diagonal matrix with entries in the real numbers. This article deals with applying generalizations of this concept to operators on Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension.

Self-adjoint operators are used in functional analysis and quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics their importance lies in the Dirac–von Neumann formulation of quantum mechanics, in which physical observables such as position, momentum, angular momentum and spin are represented by self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. Of particular significance is the Hamiltonian operator formula_4 defined by
: formula_5
which as an observable corresponds to the total energy of a particle of mass &quot;m&quot; in a real potential field &quot;V&quot;. Differential operators are an important class of unbounded operators.

The structure of self-adjoint operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces essentially resembles the finite-dimensional case. That is to say, operators are self-adjoint if and only if they are unitarily equivalent to real-valued multiplication operators. With suitable modifications, this result can be extended to possibly unbounded operators on infinite-dimensional spaces. Since an everywhere-defined self-adjoint operator is necessarily bounded, one needs to be more attentive to the domain issue in the unbounded case. This is explained below in more detail.

== Definitions ==
Let formula_6 be a Hilbert space and formula_7 an unbounded (i.e. not necessarily bounded) linear operator with a dense domain formula_8 This condition holds automatically when formula_6 is finite-dimensional since formula_10 for every linear operator on a finite-dimensional space.

The graph of an (arbitrary) operator formula_7 is the set formula_12 An operator formula_13 is said to extend formula_7 if formula_15 This is written as formula_16

Let the inner product formula_17 be conjugate linear on the &quot;second&quot; argument. The adjoint operator formula_18 acts on the subspace formula_19 consisting of the elements formula_20 such that
: formula_21 

The densely defined operator formula_7 is called symmetric (or Hermitian) if formula_23, i.e., if formula_24 and formula_25 for all formula_26. Equivalently, formula_7 is symmetric if and only if
: formula_28
Since formula_29 is dense in formula_6, symmetric operators are always closable (i.e. the closure of formula_31 is the graph of an operator). If formula_18 is a closed extension of formula_7, the smallest closed extension formula_34 of formula_7 must be contained in formula_18. Hence,
: formula_37
for symmetric operators and
: formula_38
for closed symmetric operators.

The densely defined operator formula_7 is called self-adjoint if formula_40, that is, if and only if formula_7 is symmetric and formula_42. Equivalently, a closed symmetric operator formula_7 is self-adjoint if and only if formula_18 is symmetric. If formula_7 is self-adjoint, then formula_46 is real for all formula_47, i.e., 
: formula_48

A symmetric operator formula_7 is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure of formula_7 is self-adjoint. Equivalently, formula_7 is essentially self-adjoint if it has a &quot;unique&quot; self-adjoint extension. In practical terms, having an essentially self-adjoint operator is almost as good as having a self-adjoint operator, since we merely need to take the closure to obtain a self-adjoint operator.

In physics, the term Hermitian refers to symmetric as well as self-adjoint operators alike. The subtle difference between the two is generally overlooked.

== Bounded self-adjoint operators ==
Let formula_6 be a Hilbert space and formula_53 a symmetric operator. According to Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem, if formula_54 then formula_7 is necessarily bounded.
A bounded operator formula_56 is self-adjoint if 
: formula_57
Every bounded operator formula_58 can be written in the complex form formula_59 where formula_60 and formula_61 are bounded self-adjoint operators.

Alternatively, every positive bounded linear operator formula_62 is self-adjoint if the Hilbert space formula_6 is &quot;complex&quot;.

=== Properties ===
A bounded self-adjoint operator formula_56 defined on formula_65 has the following properties: 
* formula_66 is invertible if the image of formula_7 is dense in formula_68
* The operator norm is given by formula_69
* If formula_70 is an eigenvalue of formula_7 then formula_72; the eigenvalues are real and the corresponding eigenvectors are orthogonal. 
Bounded self-adjoint operators do not necessarily have an eigenvalue. If, however, formula_7 is a compact self-adjoint operator then it always has an eigenvalue formula_74 and corresponding normalized eigenvector.

== Spectrum of self-adjoint operators ==

Let formula_75 be an unbounded operator. The resolvent set (or regular set) of formula_7 is defined as
: formula_77
If formula_7 is bounded, the definition reduces to formula_79 being bijective on formula_6. The spectrum of formula_7 is defined as the complement
: formula_82 
In finite dimensions, formula_83 consists exclusively of (complex) eigenvalues. The spectrum of a self-adjoint operator is always real (i.e. formula_84), though non-self-adjoint operators with real spectrum exist as well. For bounded (normal) operators, however, the spectrum is real &quot;if and only if&quot; the operator is self-adjoint. This implies, for example, that a non-self-adjoint operator with real spectrum is necessarily unbounded.

As a preliminary, define formula_85 formula_86 and formula_87 with formula_88. Then, for every formula_89 and every formula_90
: formula_91
where formula_92

Indeed, let formula_93 By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,
: formula_94

If formula_95 then formula_96 and formula_97 is called &quot;bounded below&quot;.
# The operator formula_98 has now been proven to be bijective, so formula_99 exists and is everywhere defined. The graph of formula_99 is the set formula_101 Since formula_102 is closed (because formula_103 is), so is formula_104 By closed graph theorem, formula_99 is bounded, so formula_106

== Spectral theorem ==
In the physics literature, the spectral theorem is often stated by saying that a self-adjoint operator has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Physicists are well aware, however, of the phenomenon of &quot;continuous spectrum&quot;; thus, when they speak of an &quot;orthonormal basis&quot; they mean either an orthonormal basis in the classic sense &quot;or&quot; some continuous analog thereof. In the case of the momentum operator formula_107, for example, physicists would say that the eigenvectors are the functions formula_108, which are clearly not in the Hilbert space formula_109. (Physicists would say that the eigenvectors are &quot;non-normalizable.&quot;) Physicists would then go on to say that these &quot;generalized eigenvectors&quot; form an &quot;orthonormal basis in the continuous sense&quot; for formula_109, after replacing the usual Kronecker delta formula_111 by a Dirac delta function formula_112. 

Although these statements may seem disconcerting to mathematicians, they can be made rigorous by use of the Fourier transform, which allows a general formula_113 function to be expressed as a &quot;superposition&quot; (i.e., integral) of the functions formula_114, even though these functions are not in formula_113. The Fourier transform &quot;diagonalizes&quot; the momentum operator; that is, it converts it into the operator of multiplication by formula_116, where formula_116 is the variable of the Fourier transform.

The spectral theorem in general can be expressed similarly as the possibility of &quot;diagonalizing&quot; an operator by showing it is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator. Other versions of the spectral theorem are similarly intended to capture the idea that a self-adjoint operator can have &quot;eigenvectors&quot; that are not actually in the Hilbert space in question.

=== Multiplication operator form of the spectral theorem ===
Firstly, let formula_118 be a σ-finite measure space and formula_119 a measurable function on formula_120. Then the operator formula_121, defined by
: formula_122
where
: formula_123
is called a multiplication operator. Any multiplication operator is a self-adjoint operator.

Secondly, two operators formula_7 and formula_13 with dense domains formula_126 and formula_127 in Hilbert spaces formula_128 and formula_129, respectively, are unitarily equivalent if and only if there is a unitary transformation formula_130 such that:
* formula_131
* formula_132
If unitarily equivalent formula_7 and formula_13 are bounded, then formula_135; if formula_7 is self-adjoint, then so is formula_13. 
The spectral theorem holds for both bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators. Proof of the latter follows by reduction to the spectral theorem for unitary operators. We might note that if formula_138 is multiplication by formula_139, then the spectrum of formula_138 is just the essential range of formula_139.

More complete versions of the spectral theorem exist as well that involve direct integrals and carry with it the notion of &quot;generalized eigenvectors&quot;.

=== Functional calculus ===
One application of the spectral theorem is to define a functional calculus. That is, if formula_142 is a function on the real line and formula_138 is a self-adjoint operator, we wish to define the operator formula_144. The spectral theorem shows that if formula_138 is represented as the operator of multiplication by formula_139, then formula_144 is the operator of multiplication by the composition formula_148.

One example from quantum mechanics is the case where formula_138 is the Hamiltonian operator formula_4. If formula_4 has a true orthonormal basis of eigenvectors formula_152 with eigenvalues formula_153, then formula_154 can be defined as the unique bounded operator with eigenvalues formula_155 such that:
: formula_156

The goal of functional calculus is to extend this idea to the case where formula_138 has continuous spectrum (i.e. where formula_138 has no normalizable eigenvectors). 

It has been customary to introduce the following notation
: formula_159
where formula_160 is the indicator function of the interval formula_161. The family of projection operators E(λ) is called resolution of the identity for &quot;T&quot;. Moreover, the following Stieltjes integral representation for &quot;T&quot; can be proved:
: formula_162

=== Formulation in the physics literature ===
In quantum mechanics, Dirac notation is used as combined expression for both the spectral theorem and the Borel functional calculus. That is, if &quot;H&quot; is self-adjoint and &quot;f&quot; is a Borel function,
: formula_163
with
: formula_164

where the integral runs over the whole spectrum of &quot;H&quot;. The notation suggests that &quot;H&quot; is diagonalized by the eigenvectors Ψ&quot;E&quot;. Such a notation is purely formal. The resolution of the identity (sometimes called projection-valued measures) formally resembles the rank-1 projections formula_165. In the Dirac notation, (projective) measurements are described via eigenvalues and eigenstates, both purely formal objects. As one would expect, this does not survive passage to the resolution of the identity. In the latter formulation, measurements are described using the spectral measure of formula_166, if the system is prepared in formula_166 prior to the measurement. Alternatively, if one would like to preserve the notion of eigenstates and make it rigorous, rather than merely formal, one can replace the state space by a suitable rigged Hilbert space.

If , the theorem is referred to as resolution of unity:
: formula_168

In the case formula_169 is the sum of an Hermitian &quot;H&quot; and a skew-Hermitian (see skew-Hermitian matrix) operator formula_170, one defines the biorthogonal basis set
: formula_171
and write the spectral theorem as:
: formula_172

(See &quot;Feshbach–Fano partitioning&quot; for the context where such operators appear in scattering theory).

=== Formulation for symmetric operators ===

The spectral theorem applies only to self-adjoint operators, and not in general to symmetric operators. Nevertheless, we can at this point give a simple example of a symmetric (specifically, an essentially self-adjoint) operator that has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Consider the complex Hilbert space &quot;L&quot;2[0,1] and the differential operator
: formula_173
with formula_174 consisting of all complex-valued infinitely differentiable functions &quot;f&quot; on [0, 1] satisfying the boundary conditions 
: formula_175

Then integration by parts of the inner product shows that &quot;A&quot; is symmetric. The eigenfunctions of &quot;A&quot; are the sinusoids
: formula_176
with the real eigenvalues &quot;n&quot;2π2; the well-known orthogonality of the sine functions follows as a consequence of &quot;A&quot; being symmetric.

The operator &quot;A&quot; can be seen to have a compact inverse, meaning that the corresponding differential equation &quot;Af&quot; = &quot;g&quot; is solved by some integral (and therefore compact) operator &quot;G&quot;. The compact symmetric operator &quot;G&quot; then has a countable family of eigenvectors which are complete in . The same can then be said for &quot;A&quot;.

=== Pure point spectrum ===

A self-adjoint operator &quot;A&quot; on &quot;H&quot; has pure point spectrum if and only if &quot;H&quot; has an orthonormal basis {&quot;ei&quot;}&quot;i&quot; ∈ I consisting of eigenvectors for &quot;A&quot;.

Example. The Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator has a quadratic potential &quot;V&quot;, that is
: formula_177

This Hamiltonian has pure point spectrum; this is typical for bound state Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. As was pointed out in a previous example, a sufficient condition that an unbounded symmetric operator has eigenvectors which form a Hilbert space basis is that it has a compact inverse.

== Symmetric vs self-adjoint operators ==
Although the distinction between a symmetric operator and a (essentially) self-adjoint operator is subtle, it is important since self-adjointness is the hypothesis in the spectral theorem. Here we discuss some concrete examples of the distinction.

=== Boundary conditions ===
In the case where the Hilbert space is a space of functions on a bounded domain, these distinctions have to do with a familiar issue in quantum physics: One cannot define an operator—such as the momentum or Hamiltonian operator—on a bounded domain without specifying &quot;boundary conditions&quot;. In mathematical terms, choosing the boundary conditions amounts to choosing an appropriate domain for the operator. Consider, for example, the Hilbert space formula_178 (the space of square-integrable functions on the interval [0,1]). Let us define a momentum operator &quot;A&quot; on this space by the usual formula, setting the Planck constant to 1:
: formula_179

We must now specify a domain for &quot;A&quot;, which amounts to choosing boundary conditions. If we choose
: formula_180

then &quot;A&quot; is not symmetric (because the boundary terms in the integration by parts do not vanish).

If we choose 
: formula_181

then using integration by parts, one can easily verify that &quot;A&quot; is symmetric. This operator is not essentially self-adjoint, however, basically because we have specified too many boundary conditions on the domain of &quot;A&quot;, which makes the domain of the adjoint too big (see also the example below).

Specifically, with the above choice of domain for &quot;A&quot;, the domain of the closure formula_182 of &quot;A&quot; is
: formula_183
whereas the domain of the adjoint formula_18 of &quot;A&quot; is
: formula_185

That is to say, the domain of the closure has the same boundary conditions as the domain of &quot;A&quot; itself, just a less stringent smoothness assumption. Meanwhile, since there are &quot;too many&quot; boundary conditions on &quot;A&quot;, there are &quot;too few&quot; (actually, none at all in this case) for formula_18. If we compute formula_187 for formula_188 using integration by parts, then since formula_142 vanishes at both ends of the interval, no boundary conditions on formula_190 are needed to cancel out the boundary terms in the integration by parts. Thus, any sufficiently smooth function formula_190 is in the domain of formula_18, with formula_193.

Since the domain of the closure and the domain of the adjoint do not agree, &quot;A&quot; is not essentially self-adjoint. After all, a general result says that the domain of the adjoint of formula_194 is the same as the domain of the adjoint of &quot;A&quot;. Thus, in this case, the domain of the adjoint of formula_194 is bigger than the domain of formula_194 itself, showing that formula_194 is not self-adjoint, which by definition means that &quot;A&quot; is not essentially self-adjoint.

The problem with the preceding example is that we imposed too many boundary conditions on the domain of &quot;A&quot;. A better choice of domain would be to use periodic boundary conditions:
: formula_198

With this domain, &quot;A&quot; is essentially self-adjoint.

In this case, we can understand the implications of the domain issues for the spectral theorem. If we use the first choice of domain (with no boundary conditions), all functions formula_199 for formula_200 are eigenvectors, with eigenvalues formula_201, and so the spectrum is the whole complex plane. If we use the second choice of domain (with Dirichlet boundary conditions), &quot;A&quot; has no eigenvectors at all. If we use the third choice of domain (with periodic boundary conditions), we can find an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for &quot;A&quot;, the functions formula_202. Thus, in this case finding a domain such that &quot;A&quot; is self-adjoint is a compromise: the domain has to be small enough so that &quot;A&quot; is symmetric, but large enough so that formula_203.

=== Schrödinger operators with singular potentials ===
A more subtle example of the distinction between symmetric and (essentially) self-adjoint operators comes from Schrödinger operators in quantum mechanics. If the potential energy is singular—particularly if the potential is unbounded below—the associated Schrödinger operator may fail to be essentially self-adjoint. In one dimension, for example, the operator
: formula_204
is not essentially self-adjoint on the space of smooth, rapidly decaying functions. In this case, the failure of essential self-adjointness reflects a pathology in the underlying classical system: A classical particle with a formula_205 potential escapes to infinity in finite time. This operator does not have a &quot;unique&quot; self-adjoint, but it does admit self-adjoint extensions obtained by specifying &quot;boundary conditions at infinity&quot;. (Since formula_4 is a real operator, it commutes with complex conjugation. Thus, the deficiency indices are automatically equal, which is the condition for having a self-adjoint extension.)

In this case, if we initially define formula_4 on the space of smooth, rapidly decaying functions, the adjoint will be &quot;the same&quot; operator (i.e., given by the same formula) but on the largest possible domain, namely
: formula_208

It is then possible to show that formula_209 is not a symmetric operator, which certainly implies that formula_4 is not essentially self-adjoint. Indeed, formula_209 has eigenvectors with pure imaginary eigenvalues, which is impossible for a symmetric operator. This strange occurrence is possible because of a cancellation between the two terms in formula_209: There are functions formula_142 in the domain of formula_209 for which neither formula_215 nor formula_216 is separately in formula_109, but the combination of them occurring in formula_209 is in formula_109. This allows for formula_209 to be nonsymmetric, even though both formula_221 and formula_222 are symmetric operators. This sort of cancellation does not occur if we replace the repelling potential formula_205 with the confining potential formula_224.

=== Non-self-adjoint operators in quantum mechanics===

In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to self-adjoint operators. By Stone&#x27;s theorem on one-parameter unitary groups, self-adjoint operators are precisely the infinitesimal generators of unitary groups of time evolution operators. However, many physical problems are formulated as a time-evolution equation involving differential operators for which the Hamiltonian is only symmetric. In such cases, either the Hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint, in which case the physical problem has unique solutions or one attempts to find self-adjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian corresponding to different types of boundary conditions or conditions at infinity.

Example. The one-dimensional Schrödinger operator with the potential formula_225, defined initially on smooth compactly supported functions, is essentially self-adjoint for but not for .

The failure of essential self-adjointness for formula_226 has a counterpart in the classical dynamics of a particle with potential formula_227: The classical particle escapes to infinity in finite time.

Example. There is no self-adjoint momentum operator formula_116 for a particle moving on a half-line. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian formula_229 of a &quot;free&quot; particle on a half-line has several self-adjoint extensions corresponding to different types of boundary conditions. Physically, these boundary conditions are related to reflections of the particle at the origin.

== Examples ==
=== A symmetric operator that is not essentially self-adjoint ===
We first consider the Hilbert space formula_230 and the differential operator
: formula_231
defined on the space of continuously differentiable complex-valued functions on [0,1], satisfying the boundary conditions
:formula_232

Then &quot;D&quot; is a symmetric operator as can be shown by integration by parts. The spaces &quot;N&quot;+, &quot;N&quot;− (defined below) are given respectively by the distributional solutions to the equation
: formula_233
which are in &quot;L&quot;2[0, 1]. One can show that each one of these solution spaces is 1-dimensional, generated by the functions &quot;x&quot; → &quot;e&quot;&quot;−x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; → &quot;e&quot;&quot;x&quot; respectively. This shows that &quot;D&quot; is not essentially self-adjoint, but does have self-adjoint extensions. These self-adjoint extensions are parametrized by the space of unitary mappings &quot;N&quot;+ → &quot;N&quot;−, which in this case happens to be the unit circle T.

In this case, the failure of essential self-adjointenss is due to an &quot;incorrect&quot; choice of boundary conditions in the definition of the domain of formula_234. Since formula_234 is a first-order operator, only one boundary condition is needed to ensure that formula_234 is symmetric. If we replaced the boundary conditions given above by the single boundary condition
: formula_237,
then &quot;D&quot; would still be symmetric and would now, in fact, be essentially self-adjoint. This change of boundary conditions gives one particular essentially self-adjoint extension of &quot;D&quot;. Other essentially self-adjoint extensions come from imposing boundary conditions of the form formula_238.

This simple example illustrates a general fact about self-adjoint extensions of symmetric differential operators &quot;P&quot; on an open set &quot;M&quot;. They are determined by the unitary maps between the eigenvalue spaces 
: formula_239
where &quot;P&quot;dist is the distributional extension of &quot;P&quot;.

=== Constant-coefficient operators ===
We next give the example of differential operators with constant coefficients. Let
: formula_240
be a polynomial on R&quot;n&quot; with &quot;real&quot; coefficients, where α ranges over a (finite) set of multi-indices. Thus
: formula_241
and
: formula_242

We also use the notation
: formula_243

Then the operator &quot;P&quot;(D) defined on the space of infinitely differentiable functions of compact support on R&quot;n&quot; by
: formula_244
is essentially self-adjoint on &quot;L&quot;2(R&quot;n&quot;).

More generally, consider linear differential operators acting on infinitely differentiable complex-valued functions of compact support. If &quot;M&quot; is an open subset of R&quot;n&quot;
: formula_245
where &quot;a&quot;α are (not necessarily constant) infinitely differentiable functions. &quot;P&quot; is a linear operator
: formula_246

Corresponding to &quot;P&quot; there is another differential operator, the formal adjoint of &quot;P&quot;
: formula_247

u \in L^2(M) \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Spectral multiplicity theory ==
The multiplication representation of a self-adjoint operator, though extremely useful, is not a canonical representation. This suggests that it is not easy to extract from this representation a criterion to determine when self-adjoint operators &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are unitarily equivalent. The finest grained representation which we now discuss involves spectral multiplicity. This circle of results is called the &quot;Hahn–Hellinger theory of spectral multiplicity&quot;.

=== Uniform multiplicity ===
We first define &quot;uniform multiplicity&quot;:

Definition. A self-adjoint operator &quot;A&quot; has uniform multiplicity &quot;n&quot; where &quot;n&quot; is such that 1 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;ω&quot; if and only if &quot;A&quot; is unitarily equivalent to the operator M&quot;f&quot; of multiplication by the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) = &quot;λ&quot; on
: formula_248
where H&quot;n&quot; is a Hilbert space of dimension &quot;n&quot;. The domain of M&quot;f&quot; consists of vector-valued functions &quot;ψ&quot; on R such that
: formula_249

Non-negative countably additive measures &quot;μ&quot;, &quot;ν&quot; are mutually singular if and only if they are supported on disjoint Borel sets.

This representation is unique in the following sense: For any two such representations of the same &quot;A&quot;, the corresponding measures are equivalent in the sense that they have the same sets of measure 0.

=== Direct integrals ===
The spectral multiplicity theorem can be reformulated using the language of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces:

Unlike the multiplication-operator version of the spectral theorem, the direct-integral version is unique in the sense that the measure equivalence class of &quot;μ&quot; (or equivalently its sets of measure 0) is uniquely determined and the measurable function formula_250 is determined almost everywhere with respect to &quot;μ&quot;. The function formula_251 is the spectral multiplicity function of the operator.

We may now state the classification result for self-adjoint operators: Two self-adjoint operators are unitarily equivalent if and only if (1) their spectra agree as sets, (2) the measures appearing in their direct-integral representations have the same sets of measure zero, and (3) their spectral multiplicity functions agree almost everywhere with respect to the measure in the direct integral.

=== Example: structure of the Laplacian ===
The Laplacian on R&quot;n&quot; is the operator
: formula_252

As remarked above, the Laplacian is diagonalized by the Fourier transform. Actually it is more natural to consider the &quot;negative&quot; of the Laplacian −Δ since as an operator it is non-negative; (see elliptic operator).

<text>Telepylos or Telepylus ( &quot;Tēlépylos&quot;, meaning &quot;far-off port&quot; or &quot;big-gated&quot;) was the mythological city of the Laestrygonians.

== Mythology ==
In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; it is described as the rocky stronghold of Lamos. When Odysseus reaches the city in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, he sends three scouts to explore the island. They come across the king, a giant cannibal, who then eats one of the men, causing the other scouts to run away. Most of Odysseus&#x27; men are killed in the incident, but his boat is moored outside the Laestrygonians&#x27; harbour. He is able to sail away, without the bombardment of rocks received by the rest of the fleet who did moor within the harbour. Only forty-five men escape.

It has been identified with Mezapo, located on the Mani Peninsula. Iman Jacob Wilkens makes a less likely identification: the harbour of Havana, Cuba, believing that Ulysses had in fact crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
The harbour, about which on both sides a sheer cliff runs continuously, and projecting headlands opposite to one another stretch out at the mouth, and the entrance is narrow, ..., and the ships were moored within the hollow harbour, for therein no wave ever swelled, great or small, but all about was a bright calm...

== Locations ==

In Greek mythology, the name Telepylos is mentioned in the Odyssey (k 82, ps 318) the city or country of the Laistrygons (&quot;laistrygonii&quot;). The name, from tele- = far and the door, perhaps according to some authors has the meaning of &quot;eurypylos, megalopylos&quot;, or &quot;macropylos&quot; (Eustathius: &quot;at a distance from each other, but next to the doors or at the length &quot; ). In the view of the later ancient Greeks (e.g. Thucydides, 6.2), Telepilos was located in Sicily, while the Romans believed it to be located in mainland Italy, in Formia ( today Mola di Gaeta). The significant Laestrygonian associations with the Talayotic culture or pre-Talayotic culture in Balearic Islands have recently been admitted, and the interest in the description -let&#x27;s think of one of the well-known ports of the Mediterranean-, allows us to believe that is a first and almost perfect port of Mahón. Jasen Boko establishes Omiš as the most probable location, for its unique landscape that corresponds to the verses.

<text>The Church of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine (, ), or less formally, La Madeleine (), is a Catholic parish church on Place de la Madeleine in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. It was planned by Louis XV as the focal point of the new Rue Royal, leading to the new Place Louis XV, the present Place de la Concorde. It was dedicated in 1764 by Louis XV, but work halted due to the French Revolution. Napoleon Bonaparte had it redesigned in the Neoclassical style to become a monument to the glory of his armies. After his downfall in 1814, construction as a church resumed, but it was not completed until 1842. The building is surrounded on all four sides by Corinthian columns. The interior is noted for its frescoes on the domed ceiling, and monumental sculptures by François Rude, Carlo Marochetti and other prominent 19th-century French artists.

The exterior and interior of the church are undergoing a major project of cleaning and restoration, which began in 2020 and is scheduled for completion in 2024.

==History==
=== First church ===
The neighbourhood, then at the edge of Paris, was annexed to the city in 1722. An earlier church of Saint-Marie-Madeleine was built in the 13th century on avenue Malesherbes, but was considered too small for the growing neighbourhood. Louis XV authorised the construction of a new, larger church, with a view along Rue Royale toward the new Place Louis XV, now Place de la Concorde. In 1763 the King laid the first stone for a new church, designed by Pierre Contant d&#x27;Ivry and Guillaume-Martin Couture.

The first design for the new church by Pierre Contant d&#x27;Ivry proposed a large dome atop a building in the form of Latin cross, similar to the Les Invalides church designed by Jules Hardouin Mansart. D&#x27;Ivry died in 1777 and was replaced by his pupil Guillaume Martin Couture. Couture abandoned the first plan, demolished much of the early work. and went to work on a simpler, more classical design, modelled after an ancient Greek or Roman temple.

=== Proposed monument to Napoleon&#x27;s Army and railroad station, then church again ===
The construction of the new church was abruptly halted in 1789 by the French Revolution, with only the foundations and grand classical portico completed. After the execution of Louis XVI in 1793, his body was transported to the old Church of the Madeleine, which was still standing until 1801. The King&#x27;s body was thrown onto bed of quicklime at the bottom of a pit and covered by one of earth, the whole being firmly and thoroughly tamped down. Louis XVI&#x27;s head was placed at his feet. On 21 January 1815 Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette&#x27;s remains were moved to a new tomb in the Basilica of Saint-Denis.

Under the Revolutionary government, a debate began on the future purpose of the building. Proposals included a library, a public ballroom, and a marketplace. The new building of the National Assembly, in the Palais Bourbon, at the other end of the former Rue Royale, was given a classical colonnade to match the already completed portico of church. 
The new Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, was crowned in 1804 and in 1806 settled the debate. In 1806 he declared that the church would become &quot;A Temple to the Glory of the Grand Army&quot;. While on a military campaign in Poland, he personally chose the design of a new architect, Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (:fr: Pierre-Alexandre Vignon), over the design that was recommended to him by the Academy of Architecture. The plan of Vignon took the form of a classical temple with Corinthian columns on all four sides. The work began anew, with new foundations but preserving the classical columns that had already been raised.

=== Completion of the church (1855)===

After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, the new King, Louis XVIII, resumed construction on the unfinished church, which he intended to make an Expiatory chapel for the sins of the Revolution and the execution of Louis XVI. However, this idea was dropped, and the new church was instead dedication to Mary Magdalene, or the Madeleine, a follower of Jesus who witnessed both the Crucifixion and the Resurrection of Christ.

The architect Vignon died in 1828 before completing the project and was replaced by Jacques-Marie Huvé. A new competition was set up in 1828–29 to determine the design for sculptures for the pediment. The design chosen was &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, depicting Saint Mary Magdalene kneeling to pray for sinners, by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire. The new government of the July Monarchy decided to go ahead with the church, despite financial difficulties. in 1830 they declared that it would be dedicated to national reconciliation. The vaults were finally completed in 1831.

Work on the church was largely completed during the reign of King Louis-Philippe, between 1830 and 1848. in 1837 a proposal was brought forward to convert church into the first railroad station in Paris, but this was abandoned as expensive and impractical. The church was finally inaugurated on 24 July 1842, the day of Saint Mary-Magdalene.

The new church became popular with musicians. The funeral of Chopin at the Church of the Madeleine in Paris was delayed almost two weeks, until 30 October 1849. Chopin had requested that Mozart&#x27;s Requiem be sung. The Requiem had major parts for female voices, but the Church of the Madeleine had never permitted female singers in its choir. The church finally relented, on condition that the female singers remain behind a black velvet curtain.

During the Paris Commune of 1871, the curé of the church, Abbé Deguerry, was one of those arrested and held hostage by the Commune. He was executed alongside Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris and four other hostages on 24 May, during the Semaine sanglante, as French government troops were bloodily retaking the city and executing Communard defenders.

Besides Chopin, musicians and artists whose funerals were held at the church include Jacques Offenbach, Charles Gounod, Camille Saint-Saëns, Coco Chanel, Joséphine Baker, Charles Trenet, Dalida and Johnny Hallyday.

== Exterior ==
===Inspiration===

The design of the church by Vignon was an example of the Neo-Classical style, using the plan of a peripteral Greek temple, with rows of classical columns around all four exterior sides, not just on the facade. Notable examples included the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the largest temple in ancient Athens, located below the Parthenon, and the much smaller Roman Maison Carrée in Nîmes in France one of the best-preserved of all Roman temples (here the columns around the &quot;cella&quot; are &quot;engaged&quot; or half-embedded in the wall). The Madeleine is one of the rare large neo-classical buildings to imitate the whole external form of an ancient temple, rather than just the portico front. Its fifty-two Corinthian columns, each high, surround the building.

===South facade ===

The inscription on the frieze over the entrance reads in Latin: &quot;D⸱O⸱M⸱SVB⸱INVOC⸱S⸱M⸱MAGDALENAE&quot;, that is &quot;Deo Optimo Maximo sub invocatione Sanctae Mariae Magdalenae&quot; (&quot;To God all-powerful and Very Great, under the invocation of Saint Mary Magdalen.&quot;)

The pedimental sculpture of the Last Judgement is by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire. Lemaire&#x27;s sculpture also has a prominent place on the Arc de Triomphe. In the sculpture, Christ is in the centre, presiding over the Last Judgement, flanked by two angels. On the right is the Archangel Michael, with a group of figures representing the Vices, who will be refused entry to heaven. To the left are the Virtues, escorting those admitted to heaven. Mary Magadelen is shown kneeling with those refused entrance to heaven, expressing her repentance.

=== Bronze Doors ===

The large bronze doors of the south portal have reliefs illustrating the Ten Commandments. The artist was Henri de Triqueti (1804–1874), who was only thirty years old when he won the commission. His main influence was the doors made by Ghiberti for the Baptistry of Florence, as well as those found on Pantheon in Rome and Christian basilicas in Pisa, Rome, Verona and Venice. Their size is exceptional; they are larger than the doors of the Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome; but they were also designed to be thinner and lighter. Unlike many bronze church doors, they have no gilding, just the color of the bronze. The doors earned Triqueti a place as a royal sculptor for the projects of King Louis-Philippe, including sculpture in Napoleon&#x27;s tomb.

=== Statues in niches of the Colonnade ===
Another feature of the exterior is a series of statues of Saints, made by different sculptors, alternating women and men, arranged on the outside walls along the portico, within the colonnade. The original plan by Vignon had only bare walls on the exterior, but the new architect, Huvé, proposed a series of thirty-three statues in niches. The selection of Saints was largely made by the Orleans family of King Louis Philippe and his family. The two most prominent places, by the south entrance, were given to traditional French Saints, Louis IX and Saint Philip, Bernard of Clairvaux, as well as Saint Joan of Arc and Saint Genevieve, the Patron Saint of Paris. Women saints alternate with men. At the north or rear end of the church, the heads of four of the statues were knocked off by the explosion of a German shell during the First World War, in 1918.

== Parts ==
The plan of the church was inspired more by the classical Roman architecture, particularly the baths, than by traditional church architecture.
Inside, the church designed by Huvé is composed of a single long space, without a transept. It is divided into three wide arched bays, each with a dome, with circular skylights that provide limited illumination. All the walls and arches and the ceiling are covered with decoration, largely composed of colored marble in intricate geometric forms, and frequently gilded.

=== The choir dome – &quot;The History of Christianity&quot; ===

The cul-de-four or half-dome over the choir of the church is decorated with a painting by Jules-Claude Ziegler (1804–1856) which depicts major events in the history of Christianity, with an emphasis on France. At the top is the figure of Christ with Apostles and Mary Magdalene. In the foreground are Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII signing the Concordat of 1801, which, following the French Revolution, marked the reconciliation of the French church and state and allowed Catholic churches to re-open in France. Ziegler was a pupil of Ingres, and painted the figures with the same realism and animation. The work took four years to complete.

=== Mosaic of Lameire – &quot;Christianity of France&quot; and &quot;The Ecstasy of Mary Magdalene&quot; ===
Below the &quot;History of Christianity&quot; and above the altar is later, unusual work; a wide ceramic mosaic depicting Christ with a group of Saints who had connections with France. This was conceived between 1888 and 1893 by Father LeRebours, the curate of the church, and is in the Neo-Byxantine style, very different from the rest of the art in the choir. It painted by Charles-Joseph Lameire, and transformed into ceramic by the Sevres Porcelain workshops in Paris. In the dim light inside of the church, the gilded ceramic tiles catch the light, sometimes making it the most visible art work in the church.

The Christ of the Resurrection is the central figure in the mosaic, accompanied by the first disciples and missionaries who lived and preached in Gaul, including the patron saint of the church, Mary Magdalene; Saint Martha, sister of Mary Magdalene, buried in Tarascon; Saint Lazare, who founded the first church in Marseille; Saint Genevieve, patron saint of Paris; Saint Trophyme, a disciple of Saint Paul and founder of the church in Arles. The figure of Saint Front of Perigeaux, founder of the church in Rocamadour, who is given the features of the artist, Lameire); Saint Ursin, founder of the church in Bourges, who is given the features of the architect Charles Garnier, and others.

Below the mosaic is a row of Corinthian columns which form a theatrical background behind the altar. and a marble stairway leading up to the altar. Behind the altar is a monumental sculpture, &quot;The Ecstasy of Mary Magdalene&quot;, by Carlo Marochetti (1805–1868), depicting Mary Magdalene, kneeling in prayer, as she is transported into heaven by three angels.

=== Sculpture in the Vestibule – &quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot; ===

In the vestibule at the south end of the church, is another monumental sculpture, &quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot; by François Rude (1784–1855). Rude was already famous for a work he made in 1836, &quot;The Departure of the Volunteers of 1795&quot;, prominently featured on the Arc de Triomphe.

=== Decoration ===

The decoration of the interior was completed in a relatively short period, under King Louis-Philippe, and is noted for its unusual harmony.

==The organs ==
The church has had a long association with music and musicians. The funeral of Chopin took place in the church, and the composers Camille Saint-Saëns and Gabriel Fauré each held the title of the church organist. The church has a celebrated pipe organ, located in the tribune over the south entrance to the church. It is contained in a very ornate case with sculpted angels, spires, and other ornament harmonised with the decor. The organ was built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in 1845. It was restored by Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s successor Charles Mutin in 1927, who also extended the manuals to 56 notes. Tonal modifications were carried out by Roethinger, Gonzalez-Danion, and Dargassies in 1957, 1971 and 1988 respectively. :.&lt;ref name=&quot;/books-google&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller organ from the same period is located in the choir.

==The foyer==
In the basement of the Church (entrance on the Flower Market side) is the Foyer de la Madeleine. Typical of various foyers run by religious and civic groups throughout France, the Madeleine is the home of a restaurant in which, for a yearly subscription fee, one can dine under the vaulted ceilings on a three-course French meal served by volunteers for a nominal price. The walls of the Foyer are often decorated by local artists.

<doc id="187425" wikidata="Q207686" url="?curid=187425" title="Iamb (poetry)">
<text>An iamb ( ) or iambus is a metrical foot used in various types of poetry. Originally the term referred to one of the feet of the quantitative meter of classical Greek prosody: a short syllable followed by a long syllable (as in () &quot;beautiful (f.)&quot;). This terminology was adopted in the description of accentual-syllabic verse in English, where it refers to a foot comprising an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (as in &quot;abóve&quot;). Thus a Latin word like , because of its short-long rhythm, is considered by Latin scholars to be an iamb, but because it has a stress on the first syllable, in modern linguistics it is considered to be a trochee.

==Etymology==

R. S. P. Beekes has suggested that the &quot;iambos&quot; has a Pre-Greek origin. An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from Phrygian or Pelasgian, and literally means &quot;Einschritt&quot;, i. e., &quot;one-step&quot;, compare &quot;dithyramb&quot; and &quot;thriambus&quot;, but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation. The word may be related to Iambe, a Greek minor goddess of verse, especially scurrilous, ribald humour. In ancient Greece iambus was mainly satirical poetry, lampoons, which did not automatically imply a particular metrical type. Iambic metre took its name from being characteristic of &quot;iambi&quot;, not vice versa.

==Accentual-syllabic use==


In accentual-syllabic verse and in modern linguistics an iamb is a foot that has the rhythmic pattern:
Using the &#x27;ictus and x&#x27; notation (see systems of scansion for a full discussion of various notations) we can write this as:

The word &#x27;attempt&#x27; is a natural iamb:
In phonology, an iambic foot is notated in a flat representation as (σ&#x27;σ) or as foot tree with two branches W and S where &quot;W&quot; = weak and &quot;S&quot; = strong.

Iambic pentameter is one of the most commonly used measures in English and German poetry, for instance it can be found in Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets. A line of iambic pentameter comprises five consecutive iambs.

Iambic trimeter is the metre of the spoken verses in Greek tragedy and comedy, comprising six iambs—as one iambic metrum consisted of two iambs. In English accentual-syllabic verse, iambic trimeter is a line comprising three iambs.

Less common iambic measures include iambic tetrameter (four iambs per line) and iambic heptameter, sometimes called the &quot;fourteener&quot; (seven iambs per line). Lord Byron&#x27;s also &quot;She Walks in Beauty&quot; exemplifies iambic tetrameter; iambic heptameter is found in Australian poet A. B. &quot;Banjo&quot; Paterson&#x27;s &quot;The Man from Ironbark&quot;. Related to iambic heptameter is the more common ballad verse (also called common metre), in which a line of iambic tetrameter is succeeded by a line of iambic trimeter, usually in quatrain form. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is a classic example of this form.

The reverse of an iamb is called a trochee.

== Types of meter ==

Key:
*Non-bold = unstressed syllable
*Bold = stressed syllable

=== Dimeter ===
Iambic dimeter is a meter referring to a line consisting of two iambic feet.

The way a crow

Shook down on me... (Robert Frost, &quot;Dust of Snow&quot;)

=== Trimeter ===
Iambic trimeter is a meter referring to a line consisting of three iambic feet.

We romped until the pans

Slid from the kitchen shelf; (Theodore Roethke, &quot;My Papa&#x27;s Waltz&quot;)

The only news I know

Is bulletins all day (Emily Dickinson, &quot;The Only News I Know&quot;)

===Tetrameter===
Iambic tetrameter is a meter referring to a line consisting of four iambic feet:

She walks in beauty, like the night

Of cloudless climes and starry skies; (Lord Byron, &quot;She Walks in Beauty&quot;)

===Pentameter===
Iambic Pentameter is a meter referring to a line consisting of five iambic feet:

:To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. (Alfred Tennyson, &quot;Ulysses&quot;)

:Shall I compare thee to a summer&#x27;s day? (William Shakespeare, Sonnet 18)

(Although, it could be argued that this line in fact reads: Shall I compare thee to a summer&#x27;s day?
Meter is often broken in this way, sometimes for intended effect and sometimes simply due to the sound of the words in the line. Where the stresses lie can be debated, as it depends greatly on where the reader decides to place the stresses. Although in this meter the foot is no longer iambs but trochees.)

:A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse! (William Shakespeare, &quot;Richard III&quot;)

:They also serve who only stand and wait. (John Milton, &quot;When I Consider How My Light is Spent&quot;)

=== Hexameter ===
Iambic hexameter is a meter referring to a line consisting of six iambic feet. In English verse, &quot;alexandrine&quot; is typically used to mean &quot;iambic hexameter&quot;

: Ye sacred Bards, that to ¦ your harps&#x27; melodious strings

: Sung th&#x27;ancient Heroes&#x27; deeds (the monuments of Kings) (Michael Drayton, Poly-Olbion)

===Heptameter===
Iambic Heptameter is a meter referring to a line consisting of seven iambic feet:

:I s&#x27;pose the flats is pretty green up there in Ironbark. (A. B. Paterson, The Man from Ironbark)

==Sound change==

Through iambic shortening, a word with the shape &quot;light–heavy&quot; or &quot;short–long&quot; changes to become &quot;light–light&quot;; for example, changes to with two short syllables. In modern linguistics this change is sometimes referred to as &quot;trochaic shortening&quot;, since has a stress on the first syllable and is thus in modern linguistic terms a trochee.

<text>Secret Affair are a mod revival band, formed in 1978 and disbanded in 1982 during which period their work is predominantly best-known. They reformed in 2002 and have since then produced an album in 2012.

==Career==

Formed after the demise of the CBS Records signed power pop band New Hearts, singer Ian Page and guitarist David Cairns spent the second half of 1978 writing songs that would form the basis of the first two Secret Affair albums.

After spending January 1979 demoing songs, Page and Cairns enlisted the services of bassist Dennis Smith from the power pop band Advertising and Young Bucks drummer Seb Shelton. Saxophone player Dave Winthrop, originally playing with the group in his capacity as a session musician, would join as a full-time member of the band later in the year.
After the demise of the group in 1982, Cairns went on to form a band called Flag, with Archie Brown from The Bureau and signed a recording contract in the US. He subsequently teamed up with Scottish singer Alan King in Walk on Fire, writing the majority of the band&#x27;s material and playing keyboards on tours. Signing to MCA in the US, the band released the album &quot;Blind Faith&quot; in 1990 and toured supporting Foreigner, Nils Lofgren and Dan Reed Network, before Cairns joined Gibson Guitars USA as Special Projects and Events manager. Page released two solo singles before leaving the music industry. Having departed the band in late 1980, drummer Seb Shelton joined Kevin Rowland&#x27;s Dexys Midnight Runners and enjoyed success with them between 1980 and 1982.

==Reunion==
In June 2002, Page, Cairns, Smith and Winthrop, with drummer Paul Bultitude, reunited for three gigs, including a performance at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. They returned in June the following year, playing at The Scala in Islington to promote the release of &quot;Time For Action: The Anthology&quot; (Sanctuary), a major CD retrospective of hits, rarities and previously unreleased tracks. The concert was filmed and released on DVD.

In 2006, Page and Cairns attempted to mend their sometimes fractious relationship and started work on a fourth Secret Affair album, recording five new songs for Peer Music. The album remains unfinished, but in 2010 Captain Mod Records released &quot;Secret Affair, The Singles Collection&quot; which featured two of the Peer Music tracks, &quot;Soho Dreams&quot; and &quot;Land of Hope&quot;.

Page and Cairns reformed Secret Affair as a touring band with a new line-up. In 2009 they played regularly around the UK and further afield, having played their first ever concerts in Dublin, Madrid, Moscow and Tokyo.

In July 2011, Secret Affair re-recorded &quot;Time For Action&quot; for Save The Children. The latter spearheaded their campaign for health workers in poor countries, and over 42,000 people signed the petition in the UK which was taken to David Cameron in September 2011, resulting in funds for the cause endorsed and approved by the United Nations.

On 5 December 2011, Dave Cairns appeared as a guest on BBC Two programme, &quot;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&quot;.

Secret Affair released their fourth studio album, &quot;Soho Dreams&quot; after an absence of 30 years on their label, I-SPY Records, on 10 September 2012, distributed by Code7/Plastic Head and supported by a 13-date UK tour ending at The 229 Club, London, on 24 November. The band continue to tour throughout 2013 and perform their end of year show at the Islington Assembly Hall, 7 December.

On 5 September 2014, Secret Affair begin their &#x27;35th Anniversary Tour&#x27; of the UK in Gloucester at the Guildhall, followed by Stockton on Tees and ending in Manchester at the Band on the Wall venue, on 13 December 2014, celebrating the 1979 release of their debut album, &quot;Glory Boys&quot;. In November that year, Sony/BMG/Captain Mod Records released &quot;Est 1979&quot;; The Secret Affair 35th Anniversary Box Set featuring all four albums from 1979 to the present day. In August 2016, I-SPY Records released Secret Affair&#x27;s cover of the Northern soul classic &quot;Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)&quot; on 7-inch vinyl only. In September that year the band appeared on Vintage TV, episode 28, performing live in concert three tracks, &quot;Do I Love You&#x27; (Indeed I Do)&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need No Doctor&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;.

Secret Affair celebrated their 40th anniversary in 2019 with a 14 date UK tour.

<text>A spondee (Latin: ) is a metrical foot consisting of two long syllables, as determined by syllable weight in classical meters, or two stressed syllables in modern meters. The word comes from the Greek , , &#x27;libation&#x27;.

==Spondees in Ancient Greek and Latin==
===Libations===
Sometimes libations were accompanied by hymns in spondaic rhythm, as in the following hymn by the Greek poet Terpander (7th century BC), which consists of 20 long syllables:


&quot;Zeus, Beginning of all things,
Leader of all things,
Zeus, I make a libation to Thee
this beginning of (my) hymns.&quot;
===In hexameter poetry===
However, in most Greek and Latin poetry, the spondee typically does not provide the basis for a metrical line in poetry. Instead, spondees are found as irregular feet in meter based on another type of foot.

For example, the epics of Homer and Virgil are written in dactylic hexameter. This term suggests a line of six dactyls, but a spondee can be substituted in most positions. The first line of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; has the pattern dactyl-dactyl-spondee-spondee-dactyl-spondee:

:– ᴗ ᴗ | – ᴗ ᴗ | – – | – – | – ᴗ ᴗ | – –
:&#x27;I sing of arms and of the man, who first from the shores of Troy...&#x27;

Most of Virgil&#x27;s lines, like the above, are a mixture of dactyls and spondees. However, sometimes he will begin a line with three or four spondees for special effect, such as the following, which describes how Aeneas and his companion made their way slowly down a dark passage into the Underworld. In this line all the feet are spondaic except the fifth:

: – – | – – | – – | – – | – ᴗ ᴗ | – –
:&#x27;They began moving in the darkness beneath the lonely night through the shadow&#x27;

Spondees can also add solemnity, as in the following lines where Dido, Queen of Carthage, curses Aeneas after he has abandoned her. The first line begins with three spondees, the second with four:

: – – | – – | – – | – ᴗ ᴗ | – ᴗ ᴗ | – –
: – – | – – | – – | – – | – ᴗ ᴗ | – – 
:
:&#x27;O Sun, who surveyest all the works of the world with thy flames,
:and Thou, interpreter and witness of these sorrows, Juno...&#x27;

Only two hexameter lines in Latin poetry use spondees throughout the verse. One is by Ennius:
:
:&#x27;to him replied the King of Alba Longa&#x27;

The other is in an elegiac couplet in the last poem of Catullus (116), perhaps mocking the poetic style of his addressee:
:    – – | – ᴗ ᴗ | – || – ᴗ ᴗ | – ᴗ ᴗ | –
:   
:&#x27;with which I could soften your attitude towards me, and so that you would not try
:   to keep hurling hostile missiles at my head&#x27;

==Spondees in English verse==
In Latin and Greek meter spondees are easily identified because the distinction between long and short syllables is unambiguous. In English meter indisputable examples are harder to find because metrical feet are identified by stress, and stress is a matter of interpretation.

For example, the first part of this line from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (in iambic pentameter) would normally be interpreted as two spondees:

&quot;Crý, crý! Tróy búrns, or élse let Hélen gó.&quot;
The effect of spondees in verse is often to slow the line down and to represent slow movement. Thus Alexander Pope writes, in a poem illustrating how the sound of the words should imitate their meaning:

&quot;When Ajax strives, some Rock&#x27;s vast Weight to throw,&quot;
&quot;The Line too labours, and the Words move slow;&quot;

In the first line above, most of the syllables, even those in weak positions, are long and heavy: &quot;A-jax strives some Rock&#x27;s vast weight&quot;; only the last foot, &quot;to throw&quot;, is a true iamb. The final foot of the second line &quot;move slow&quot; is another spondee replacing an iamb.

John Masefield also uses spondees effectively in the line:

&quot;Dirty British / coaster with a / salt-caked / smoke-stack&quot;

Here the last four syllables make two spondees, contrasting with the eight short syllables in the first two feet. The length and weight of the last four syllables derives partly from the fact that all of them are closed by one or more consonants, and partly from the fact that all of them are stressed.

Another Masefield poem, &quot;Sea Fever&quot; (1902), which includes spondees contains these lines:

&quot;And the wheel&#x27;s kick and the wind&#x27;s song and the white sail&#x27;s shaking,&quot;
&quot;And a grey mist on the sea&#x27;s face, and a grey dawn breaking.&quot;

<text>An amphibrach () is a metrical foot used in Latin and Greek prosody. It consists of a long syllable between two short syllables. The word comes from the Greek ἀμφίβραχυς, &quot;amphíbrakhys&quot;, &quot;short on both sides&quot;.

== Usage ==

=== English ===
In English accentual-syllabic poetry, an amphibrach is a stressed syllable surrounded by two unstressed syllables. It is rarely used as the overall meter of a poem, usually appearing only in a small amount of humorous poetry, children&#x27;s poetry, and experimental poems. The individual amphibrachic foot often appears as a variant within, for instance, anapaestic meter.

It is the main foot used in the construction of the limerick, as in &quot;There once was / a girl from / Nantucket.&quot; It was also used by the Victorians for narrative poetry, e.g. Samuel Woodworth&#x27;s poem &quot;The Old Oaken Bucket&quot; (1817) beginning &quot;How dear to / my heart are / the scenes of / my childhood.&quot; W. H. Auden&#x27;s poem &quot;O where are you going?&quot; (1931) is a more recent and slightly less metrically-regular example. The amphibrach is also often used in ballads and light verse, such as the hypermetrical lines of Sir John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;Meditation on the A30&quot; (1966).

=== Russian ===
Amphibrachs are a staple meter of Russian poetry. A common variation in an amphibrachic line, in both Russian and English, is to end the line with an iamb, as Thomas Hardy does in &quot;The Ruined Maid&quot; (1901): &quot;Oh did n&#x27;t / you know I&#x27;d / been ru in&#x27;d / said she&quot;.

=== Polish ===
Amphibrachic metre is very popular in Polish literature. It can be found in romantic poetry in some works by Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. The best known example is &quot;Deszcz jesienny&quot; (English: &quot;Autumn rain&quot;; 1908) by Leopold Staff. The amphibrach is believed to be suitable for lullabies. Usually Polish amphibrachic lines have feminine endings (for example the tetrametre ◡–◡◡–◡◡–◡◡–◡) but some poets experiment with masculine lines as well. In the poem &quot;Walc&quot; (English: &quot;Waltz&quot;) from Czesław Miłosz&#x27;s 1945 collection &quot;Ocalenie&quot; the first line is feminine, ◡–◡◡–◡◡–◡◡–◡, the second masculine, ◡–◡◡–◡◡–◡◡–, and so on. Jan Bolesław Ożóg experimented with irregular amphibrachic verse with different numbers of feet in successive lines. An example of this way of making verse is the poem &quot;Jemioła&quot; (&quot;Mistletoe&quot;), included in the book with the same title (1966).

== Examples ==

=== Dr. Seuss ===
Some books by Dr. Seuss contain many lines written in amphibrachs, such as these from &quot;If I Ran the Circus&quot; (1956):

:All ready / to put up / the tents for / my circus.
:I think I / will call it / the Circus / McGurkus.

:And NOW comes / an act of / Enormous / Enormance!
:No former / performer&#x27;s / performed this / performance!

=== A Visit from St. Nicholas ===
Clement Clarke Moore&#x27;s popular Christmas poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; is written mostly in anapestic tetrameter (&quot;&#x27;Twas the Night before Christmas, when all through the house…&quot;) but shifts into amphibrachs when St. Nick calls his reindeer by name:

:Now, Dasher! / now, Dancer! / now, Prancer / and Vixen!
:On, Comet! / on, Cupid! / on, Donder / and Blitzen!

=== Famous Blue Raincoat ===
Much of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; (1971) is written in amphibrachs, e.g. the first verse (apart from the first foot of the third line, which is a spondee):

:It&#x27;s four in / the morning, / the end of / December
:I&#x27;m writing / you now just / to see if / you&#x27;re better
:New York / is cold, but / I like where / I&#x27;m living
:There&#x27;s music / on Clinton / Street all through / the evening.

=== Versace ===
Migos&#x27; 2013 hit &quot;Versace&quot; popularized rapping in (amphibrachic) triplets: 
Versace / Versace / Medusa / head on me / like I&#x27;m &#x27;Lum / inati 

I know that / you like it / Versace / my neck and / my wrist is / so sloppy 

Versace / Versace / I love it / Versace / the top of / my Audi 

My plug is / John Gotti / he give me / the ducks and / I know that / they mighty

<text>The Imperial War Museum (IWM), currently branded &quot;Imperial War Museums&quot;, is a British national museum. It is headquartered in London, with five branches in England. Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, it was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of the United Kingdom and its Empire during the First World War. The museum&#x27;s remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims &quot;to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and &#x27;wartime experience&#x27;.&quot;

Originally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill, the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924, it moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington and in 1936 it acquired a permanent home at the former Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark, which serves as its headquarters. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period it entered a period of decline. In 1976 the museum opened IWM Duxford at Duxford airfield in Cambridgeshire, and in 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser , which is permanently berthed on the River Thames in central London, became a branch of the museum. In 1984, Churchill War Rooms, an underground wartime command centre in Westminster, were opened to the public. In 2002 IWM North opened in Trafford, Greater Manchester, the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. From the 1980s onwards, the museum&#x27;s Southwark building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, the latest of which was completed in 2022. 

The museum&#x27;s collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs, film and video material, and oral history recordings, an extensive library, a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment, and other artefacts.

The museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations, and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. General admission is free to IWM London (although specific exhibitions require the purchase of a ticket) and IWM North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. As of April 2024, the chairman of the trustees is Guy Weston. Since May 2023, Caro Howell has served as the museum&#x27;s director-general 

==History of the museum==
===Establishment: 1917–1921===

On 27 February 1917 Sir Alfred Mond, a Liberal MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in &quot;The Times&quot; on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum.

This National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain&#x27;s war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of munitions, and women&#x27;s war work. There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the museum&#x27;s first director general, said that exhibits must &quot;be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals&quot;. The museum&#x27;s first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum&#x27;s growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, along with Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the &quot;Imperial&quot; War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.
The museum was opened by King George V at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on behalf of the committee, saying that &quot;it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made&quot; and that the museum &quot;was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice&quot;. Shortly afterwards the (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 16) was passed and established a board of trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum&#x27;s Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the act was being debated, some parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Lieutenant-Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would &quot;refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War&quot;. On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum&#x27;s opening, 94,179 visitors were received, and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.

===Relocation 1924–1936===

In 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark. The building, designed by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital&#x27;s relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained.

The two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere&#x27;s mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as &quot;...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear&quot;. The &quot;distinguishing dome&quot; was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital&#x27;s chapel. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.

===Second World War and after: 1939–1966===
With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. In November 1939, during the &quot;Phoney War&quot;, the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production &quot;The First Days&quot;, in which children are seen playing on some of the museum&#x27;s German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. With the Dunkirk evacuation in May–June 1940, the British Army&#x27;s shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum&#x27;s artillery pieces return to military service. The museum&#x27;s trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused to return some historic items such as a naval gun from (which had fired Britain&#x27;s first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Type 184 seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum&#x27;s building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school.

In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. Due to bomb damage to the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal and opened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949. In 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved. Despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Noble Frankland, the museum&#x27;s director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum&#x27;s galleries in 1955 as appearing &quot;dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay&quot; the museum&#x27;s &quot;numerous stunning exhibits&quot; notwithstanding.

===Redevelopment and expansion: 1966–2012===
In 1966 the museum&#x27;s Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15-inch naval guns. One had been mounted on the Royal Navy&#x27;s HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; and the other on both HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; and HMS &quot;Roberts&quot;. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968. The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships, led the museum to seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers. This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy light cruiser , which became a branch of the museum in 1978.
Later in 1968 on 13 October the museum was attacked by an arsonist, Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison.

In 1969 RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter airfield in Cambridgeshire was declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence. Needing further space, the museum duly requested permission to use part of the site as temporary storage. The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford became the museum&#x27;s first branch. Also during the 1970s the government raised the possibility of the museum taking over the historic Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, but agreed in 1982.

By 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building&#x27;s exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum.

The first phase of the works to the Southwark building started in 1986 and were completed in 1989, during which time the museum was closed to the public. The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital&#x27;s courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War. For some years the museum was marketed as &quot;The &quot;new&quot; Imperial War Museum&quot;. This atrium, with its concentration of military hardware, has been described as &quot;the biggest boys&#x27; bedroom in London&quot;. This first phase cost £16.7 million (of which £12 million was provided by the government) and the museum was reopened by The Queen on 29 June 1989. In 1990, the museum was awarded National Heritage Museum of the Year.
In September 1992 the museum was the target of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two incendiary devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.

The second stage of the redevelopment of the Southwark building, during which the museum remained open to the public, was completed in 1994. During the 1990s, while these works were going on, the museum was also seeking to open a branch in the north of England. 71 sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum, Imperial War Museum North, in Trafford, Greater Manchester.

The following year, 2000, the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed. The development included the installation of the museum&#x27;s &quot;Holocaust Exhibition&quot; which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum; its development had taken five years at a cost of £5 million. Two years later, in July 2002, Imperial War Museum North was opened.

Between 2004 and 2010 the museum was a partner in a national learning project entitled &quot;Their Past Your Future&quot; (TPYF), part of the Big Lottery Fund&#x27;s Veterans Reunited programme to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people, overseas educational visits and further activities run by local authorities. A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media, and a professional development scheme for educators. A digital archive of the project, online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced.

In October 2011 the museum rebranded itself as Imperial War Museums, the initials IWM forming the basis of a new corporate logo.

In September 2011 the museum secured funding from NESTA, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Arts Council England to develop &quot;social interpretation&quot; systems to allow visitors to comment on, collect, and share museum objects via social media. These systems were incorporated in &quot;A Family in Wartime&quot;, an exhibition at IWM London depicting British family life during the Second World War, which opened in April 2012.

===First World War centenary: 2014===
In August 2009 the museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathan Harmsworth the foundation was charged with raising funds to support the redevelopment of Imperial War Museum London&#x27;s permanent galleries. In December 2010 plans were announced to redevelop IWM London&#x27;s First World War gallery in time for the conflict&#x27;s centenary in 2014, and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge became the foundation&#x27;s patron. In a speech at IWM London on 11 October 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron announced an additional £5 million of government funding to support the museum&#x27;s redevelopment, as part of funding arrangements to facilitate national centenary commemorations. The £40 million redevelopment, designed by Foster and Partners, provides new gallery spaces dedicated to the history of the First World War, a new central hall, easier navigation and improved visitor facilities, access and circulation. In preparation for building work, a number of galleries were closed during September 2012, and by December 2012 over sixty large objects had been removed from the IWM London atrium for conservation at Duxford. To allow building work to go ahead, IWM London closed to the public on 2 January 2013. The museum partially reopened on 29 July 2013.

IWM London was formally reopened on 17 July 2014 by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.


All of the sites of the Imperial War Museum were closed to the public from 17 March to 31 July 2020 inclusive, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. A further shutdown, for the same reasons, was in place from 16 December 2020 to 18 May 2021 inclusive.

==Branches==
From the 1970s onwards the Imperial War Museum began to expand onto other sites. The first branch, Imperial War Museum Duxford opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976. became a branch of the museum in 1978. The Churchill War Rooms opened in 1984, and Imperial War Museum North in 2002.

===Imperial War Museum London===

====Architecture and layout====

The museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road, with a central entrance under a portico.

The building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844 and 1846, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.

The building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke&#x27;s later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women&#x27;s war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum&#x27;s photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum&#x27;s library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.

The original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000 m2 of gallery space of which 4,600 m2 was new, and the second provided a further 1,600 m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013–14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, &quot;Secret War&quot;, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent &quot;Crimes against Humanity&quot; exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent &quot;Holocaust Exhibition&quot;, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum&#x27;s Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total. The Lord Ashcroft Collection was on loan for ten years, was extended for a further five years because of COVID, and the termination of the loan was first confirmed in July 2024, resulting in the closure on 1 June 2025.
In August 2019, the museum announced plans to spend over £30m on a new set of galleries over two floors at its London site covering the Holocaust and its importance in World War II. The galleries opened in October 2021 to replace the existing permanent exhibition.

====All Saints Annexe====
In 1989 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square. The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman, then later used as a hospital. It housed the museum&#x27;s photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.

===Imperial War Museum Duxford===

Imperial War Museum Duxford, near the village of Duxford in Cambridgeshire, is Britain&#x27;s largest aviation museum. Duxford houses the museum&#x27;s large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings. The site also provides storage space for the museum&#x27;s collections of film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Anglian Regiment.

Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome, the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War. During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. Many of Duxford&#x27;s original buildings, such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status. The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the Stirling Prize-winning American Air Museum, designed by Sir Norman Foster. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular air shows. The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.

===HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; (1938)===

HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, a Town class cruiser, was launched in 1938 and served throughout the Second World War, participating in the December 1943 Battle of North Cape and firing some of the first shots of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the Korean War. Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve &quot;Belfast&quot; as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971 &quot;Belfast&quot; became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, Shirley Williams, as &quot;a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology&quot;. In service for 24 years HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; was in Frankland&#x27;s opinion, capable of representing &quot;a whole generation of [historical evidence]&quot;.

In 2017, the name of the exhibit was changed to &quot;HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; 1938&quot; to reflect that one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s new Type 26 frigates had been given the name HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;.

===Churchill War Rooms===
The Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982, a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain&#x27;s wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill&#x27;s life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15 m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an &quot;electronic filing cabinet&quot;. The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.

===Imperial War Museum North===
The Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford, Greater Manchester, in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, with Manchester-based architects Leach Rhodes Walker providing implementation services, The Imperial War Museum North was Libeskind&#x27;s first building in Britain. Libeskind&#x27;s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.
The museum&#x27;s first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery&#x27;s 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in &quot;silos&quot; within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army&#x27;s first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.

==Collections==
The Imperial War Museum&#x27;s original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland&#x27;s reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. The museum maintains an online database of its collections.

===Documents===
The museum&#x27;s documents archive seeks to collect and preserve the private papers of individuals who have experienced modern warfare. The archive&#x27;s holdings range from the papers of senior British and Commonwealth army, navy and air officers, to the letters, diaries and memoirs of lower-ranked servicemen and of civilians. The collection includes the papers of Field Marshals Bernard Montgomery, and Sir John French. The archive also includes large collections of foreign documents, such as captured German Second World War documents previously held by the Cabinet Office Historical Section, Air Historical Branch and other British government bodies. The foreign collection also includes captured Japanese material transferred from the Cabinet Office. The collection also includes files on Victoria and George Cross recipients, and correspondence relating to the BBC documentary &quot;The Great War&quot;. The documents collection also includes the UK National Inventory of War Memorials. In 2012 the museum reported its documents collection to contain 24,800 collections of papers.

===Art===

The museum&#x27;s art collection includes paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture, and works in film, photography and sound. The collection originated during the First World War, when the museum acquired works that it had itself commissioned, as well as works commissioned by the Ministry of Information&#x27;s British War Memorials Committee. As early as 1920 the art collection held over 3,000 works and included pieces by John Singer Sargent, Wyndham Lewis, John Nash and Christopher Nevinson. Notable First World War works include Sargent&#x27;s &quot;Gassed&quot; and other works commissioned for an, unbuilt, Hall of Remembrance. The collection expanded again after the Second World War, receiving thousands of works sponsored by the Ministry of Information&#x27;s War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee.

In 1972 the museum established the Artistic Records Committee (since renamed the Art Commissions Committee) to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts. Commissioned artists include Ken Howard, Linda Kitson, John Keane, Peter Howson, Steve McQueen (see &quot;Queen and Country&quot;) and Langlands &amp; Bell, responding to conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. The collection also includes over twenty thousand items of publicity material such as posters, postcards, and proclamations from both world wars, and more recent material such as posters issued by anti-war organisations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Stop the War Coalition. The museum&#x27;s collection is represented in digital resources such as the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS), and Google Art Project. In 2012 the museum reported the total size of its art collection as 84,980 items.

===Film===

The museum&#x27;s Film and Video Archive is one of the oldest film archives in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive&#x27;s First World War holdings is &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot;, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and &quot;Der Magische Gürtel&quot;, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine &quot;U-35&quot;. The archive&#x27;s Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945.

The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; (1941) and &quot;Desert Victory&quot; (1943). The archive&#x27;s post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material from the collection was used in the production of TV documentary series such as &quot;The Great War&quot; and &quot;The World at War&quot;. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage. IWM participated in the national digitising project Unlocking Film Heritage.

===Photographs===
The museum&#x27;s Photograph Archive preserves photographs by official, amateur and professional photographers. The collection includes the official British photographic record of the two world wars; the First World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Ernest Brooks and John Warwick Brooke. The archive also holds 150,000 British aerial photographs from the First World War, the largest collection of its kind. The Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton and Bert Hardy. Like the Film Archive, the Photograph Archive is an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, and as such continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its photographic holdings as approximately 11 million images in 17,263 collections.

===Exhibits===
The museum&#x27;s exhibits collection includes a wide range of objects, organised into numerous smaller collections such as uniforms, badges, insignia and flags (including a Canadian Red Ensign carried at Vimy Ridge in 1917, a Union flag from the 1942 British surrender of Singapore, and another found among the wreckage of the World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks), as well a piece of the towers; personal mementoes, souvenirs and miscellanea such as trench art; orders, medals and decorations (including collections of Victoria and George Crosses); military equipment; firearms and ammunition, ordnance, edged weapons, clubs (such as trench clubs) and other weapons, and vehicles, aircraft and ships. The museum holds the national collection of modern firearms. The firearms collection includes a rifle used by T. E. Lawrence, and an automatic pistol owned by Winston Churchill.

The ordnance collection includes artillery pieces that participated in notable battles, such as the Néry gun, a field gun that was used during the 1914 action at Néry, and equipment captured from enemy forces. The museum&#x27;s vehicles collection includes &quot;Ole Bill&quot;, a bus used by British forces in the First World War, and a number of vehicles used by Field Marshal Montgomery during the Second World War. The museum&#x27;s aircraft collection includes aircraft that are notable for their rarity, such as the only complete and original Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in existence and one of only two surviving TSR-2 strike aircraft, and aircraft associated with particular actions, such as a Supermarine Spitfire flown during the Battle of Britain. The museum&#x27;s naval collection includes HM Coastal Motor Boat 4 and a midget submarine HMS &quot;XE8&quot;. In 2012 the museum reported its exhibits collection to contain 155,000 objects and a further 357 vehicles and aircraft.

===Library===
The museum&#x27;s library is a national reference collection on modern conflict, and holds works on all aspects of warfare, including regimental or unit histories (such as 789 rare German unit histories from the First World War), technical manuals, biographical material and works on war&#x27;s social, cultural, economic, political and military aspects. The library also holds printed ephemera such as the Imperial War Museum Stamp Collection, leaflets and ration books, printed proclamations, newspapers, trench magazines (such &quot;The Wipers Times&quot;) and trench maps. In 2012 the museum reported its library collection to contain over 80,000 items of historic importance (such as maps, proclamations and rare books) and a further 254,000 items of reference material.

===Sound===
The museum&#x27;s Sound Archive holds 33,000 sound recordings, including a large collection of oral history recordings of witnesses to conflicts since 1914. The museum&#x27;s sound collection originated in 1972 with the creation of the Department of Sound Records and the instigation of an oral history recording programme. The sound collection opened to the public in July 1977. The collection also includes recordings made by the BBC during the Second World War, actuality sound effects, broadcasts, speeches and poetry. As part of the museum&#x27;s First World War centenary programme, the museum is producing &quot;Voices of the First World War&quot;, a podcast series drawing upon the museum&#x27;s oral history recordings. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its sound collection as 37,000 hours.

===Databases===
The IWM has an online database, listing the various items which make up the IWM Collections. In some cases, there are images of the item, or contemporary photos, which can be shared and reused under a Creative Commons Licence.

The War Memorials Register is a database of known war memorials in the United Kingdom. Information such as the material used in construction, the condition of the memorial, its address and coordinates with a satellite map plot are recorded for each of the memorials. Whilst many memorials commemorate those who died in the First World War, the scope of the project is all conflicts. , there are over 90,000 memorials on the register.

In 2014, IWM and online genealogy service provider Findmypast entered into a collaboration to launch the &quot;Lives of the First World War&quot; platform. During the centenary period, anyone could sign up for an account, and those who paid for a subscription had the ability to add records from Findmypast&#x27;s collections.

A number of sources (War Office medal index cards, Canadian Expeditionary Force attestations, Royal Navy service records etc.) had been used as seeding documents to create individual entries in the database. Each person&#x27;s profile in the database could have been further built up, so as to document when that person was born, when they died, family members etc. If a person needed to be added, or a duplicate existed that needed to be merged, such activity was requested via a support forum manned by IWM volunteers. A user with a subscription had the ability to group person profiles together into a &quot;community&quot;. This could be a grouping based around a ship&#x27;s crew, a unit in the army, or the names of men and women buried in a given war cemetery.

The goal was to encourage crowdsourcing to build up as many details as possible in the database, and to tap into the popularity of online genealogy as a pastime. One selling point of the platform was that the data thus captured would form a &quot;permanent digital memorial [that] will be saved for future generations.&quot; The IWM declared that the data from the platform would become part of its archive when the platform ceased to be interactive in 2019, &quot;and will be free to access online for research.&quot;

=== Size of collection ===

The museum holds around half a petabyte of digitised data (as of 2017). This is held in Duxford (Cambridgeshire) on two SpectraLogic T950 tape libraries, with a distance of 500m between them. One is a LTO-5 (Linear Tape-Open) tape library, the other is IBM TS1150.

==Selected collection highlights==
==Governance==
The Imperial War Museum is an executive non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, from which it receives financial support in the form of a grant-in-aid. The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence, and Culture Secretaries. Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed &quot;ex officio&quot; by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely. Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1967–77), Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy (trustee 1971–78, chairman 1978–89). During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford&#x27;s American Air Museum, which opened in 1997.

The museum&#x27;s director-general is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway, a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum&#x27;s poster collection. Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland. Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command, winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford&#x27;s retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously director of the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum.

<doc id="187433" wikidata="Q17869" url="?curid=187433" title="Calypso (moon)">
<text>Calypso is a moon of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980, from ground-based observations, by Dan Pascu, P. Kenneth Seidelmann, William A. Baum, and Douglas G. Currie, and was provisionally designated &#x27; (the 25th satellite of Saturn discovered in 1980). Several other apparitions of it were recorded in the following months: , , , and . In 1983 it was officially named after Calypso of Greek mythology. It is also designated &#x27; or Tethys C.

Calypso is co-orbital with the moon Tethys, and resides in Tethys&#x27; trailing Lagrangian point (), 60 degrees behind Tethys. This relationship was first identified by Seidelmann &quot;et al.&quot; in 1981. The moon Telesto resides in the other (leading) Lagrangian point of Tethys, 60 degrees in the other direction from Tethys. Calypso and Telesto have been termed &quot;Tethys trojans&quot;, by analogy to the trojan asteroids, and are half of the four presently known trojan moons.

Like many other small Saturnian moons and small asteroids, Calypso is irregularly shaped, has overlapping large craters, and appears to also have loose surface material capable of smoothing the craters&#x27; appearance. Its surface is one of the most reflective (at visual wavelengths) in the Solar System, with a visual geometric albedo of 1.34. This very high albedo is the result of the sandblasting of particles from Saturn&#x27;s E-ring, a faint ring composed of small, water-ice particles generated by Enceladus&#x27; south polar geysers.

<text>Bert Williams (November 12, 1874 – March 4, 1922) was a Bahamian-born American entertainer, one of the pre-eminent entertainers of the vaudeville era and one of the most popular comedians for all audiences of his time. While some sources have credited him as being the first Black man to have a leading role in a film with &quot;Darktown Jubilee&quot; in 1914, other sources have credited actor Sam Lucas with this same distinction for a different 1914 film, the World Film Company&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. &quot;Ebony&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Darktown Follies&quot; was the first attempt of an independent film company to star a black actor in a movie&quot;, and credited the work as beginning a period in independent American cinema that explored &quot;black themes&quot; within works made for African-American audiences by independent producers.

Williams was by far the best-selling Black recording artist before 1920. In 1918, the &quot;New York Dramatic Mirror&quot; called Williams &quot;one of the great comedians of the world.&quot;

Williams was a key figure in the development of African-American entertainment. In an age when racial inequality and stereotyping were commonplace, he became the first Black person to take a lead role on the Broadway stage, and did much to push back racial barriers during his three-decade-long career. Fellow vaudevillian W. C. Fields, who appeared in productions with Williams, described him as &quot;the funniest man I ever saw—and the saddest man I ever knew.&quot;

==Early life==
Williams was born in Nassau, The Bahamas, on November 12, 1874, to Frederick Williams Jr. and his wife Julia. At the age of either 2 or 3, Williams permanently emigrated with his parents to the US. Their names all appear in the 1880 United States Federal Census. They are shown as residents of New York City, and Bert (“Egbert”) is listed as 5 years old at the time. Having made his way to California by his late teens, he joined different West Coast minstrel shows, including Martin and Selig&#x27;s Mastodon Minstrels in 1893 San Francisco, where he first met his future professional partner, George Walker.

Williams and Walker performed song-and-dance numbers, comic dialogues and skits and humorous songs. They fell into stereotypical vaudevillian roles: originally Williams portrayed a slick conniver, while Walker played the &quot;dumb coon&quot; victim of Williams&#x27; schemes. They discovered that they got a better reaction by switching roles and subverting expectations. The sharp-featured and slender Walker eventually developed a persona as a strutting dandy, while the stocky Williams played the languorous oaf. Despite his thickset physique, Williams was a master of body language and physical &quot;stage business.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;He holds a face for minutes at a time, seemingly, and when he alters it, bring[s] a laugh by the least movement.&quot;

In late 1896, the pair were added to &quot;The Gold Bug&quot;, a struggling musical. The show did not survive, but Williams &amp; Walker got good reviews, and were able to secure higher profile bookings. They headlined the Koster and Bial&#x27;s vaudeville house for 36 weeks in 1896–97, where their spirited version of the cakewalk helped popularize the dance. The pair performed in burnt-cork blackface, as was customary at the time, billing themselves as &quot;Two Real Coons&quot; to distinguish their act from the many white minstrels also performing in blackface. Williams also made his first recordings in 1896, but none are known to survive. They participated in a &quot;Benefit for New York&#x27;s Poor&quot; held on February 9, 1897, at the Metropolitan Opera House, their only appearance at that theater.

While playing off the &quot;coon&quot; formula, Williams &amp; Walker&#x27;s act and demeanor subtly undermined it as well. Camille Forbes wrote, &quot;They called into question the possible realness of blackface performers who only &quot;emphasized&quot; their artificiality by recourse to burnt cork; after all, Williams did not really need the burnt cork to be Black,&quot; despite his lighter skin complexion. He would pull on a wig full of kinky hair to help conceal his wavy hair. Terry Waldo noted the layered irony in their cakewalk routine, which presented them as mainstream Blacks performing a dance in a way that lampooned whites who had mocked a Black dance that originally satirized plantation whites&#x27; ostentatiously fussy mannerisms. The pair also made sure to present themselves as immaculately groomed and classily dressed in their publicity photos, which were used for advertising and on the covers of sheet music promoting their songs. Thus, they drew a contrast between their real-life comportment and the comical characters they portrayed onstage. This aspect of their act was ambiguous enough that some Black newspapers criticized the duo for failing to uplift the dignity of their race.

In 1899, Williams surprised his partner George Walker and his family when he announced he had recently married Charlotte (&quot;Lottie&quot;) Thompson, a singer with whom he had worked professionally, in a very private ceremony. Lottie was a widow eight years Bert&#x27;s senior. Thus, the match seemed odd to some who knew the gregarious and constantly traveling Williams, but all who knew them considered them a uniquely happy couple, and the union lasted until his death. The Williamses never had children biologically, but they adopted and reared three of Lottie&#x27;s nieces. They also frequently sheltered orphans and foster children in their homes.

Williams &amp; Walker appeared in a succession of shows, including &quot;A Senegambian Carnival&quot;, &quot;A Lucky Coon&quot;, and &quot;The Policy Players&quot;. Their stars were on the ascent, but they still faced vivid reminders of the limits placed on them by white society. In August 1900, in New York City, hysterical rumors of a white detective having been shot by a Black man erupted into an uncontained riot. Unaware of the street violence, Williams &amp; Walker left their theater after a performance and parted ways. Williams headed off in a fortunate direction, but Walker was yanked from a streetcar by a white mob and was beaten.

==&quot;Sons of Ham&quot; and &quot;In Dahomey&quot;==

 The following month, Williams &amp; Walker had their greatest success to date with &quot;Sons of Ham&quot;, a broad farce that did not include any of the extreme &quot;darkie&quot; stereotypes that were then common. One of the show&#x27;s songs, &quot;Miss Hannah from Savannah,&quot; even touched upon class divisions within the Black community. The pair had already begun to transition away from racial minstrel conventions to a fuller human style of comedy. In 1901, they recorded 13 discs for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Some of these, such as &quot;The Phrenologist Coon&quot;, were standard blackface material, but the financial lament &quot;When It&#x27;s All Going Out and Nothing Coming In&quot; was race-blind, and became one of Williams&#x27;s best-known songs. Another Williams composition, &quot;Good Morning Carrie&quot;, was covered by many artists, becoming one of the biggest hits of 1901. These discs existed only in pressings of fewer than 1,000, and were not heard by many listeners. &quot;Sons of Ham&quot; ran for two years.

In September 1902, Williams &amp; Walker debuted their next vehicle, &quot;In Dahomey&quot;, a full-length musical written, directed and performed by an all-Black cast. It was an even bigger hit. In 1903 the production, with music by composer Will Marion Cook, book by Shipp, and lyrics by poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, moved to New York City. Part of the inspiration for the show was Williams&#x27; copy of a 1670 book, &quot;Africa&quot;, in which author John Ogilby traced the history of the continent&#x27;s tribes and peoples. &quot;With this volume, I could prove that every Pullman porter is the descendant of a king,&quot; said Williams.

This was a landmark event, as it was the first such musical to be produced at a major Broadway theater. Seating inside the theater was segregated. One of the musical&#x27;s songs, &quot;I&#x27;m a Jonah Man&quot;, helped codify Williams&#x27; hard-luck persona and tales of woe. It helped to establish the character which Williams played most frequently in his career: the slow-talking, deep-thinking victim of life&#x27;s misfortunes. &quot;Even if it rained soup,&quot; Williams later explained, &quot;[my character] would be found with a fork in his hand and no spoon in sight.&quot; However, Williams and Walker were ebullient about their Broadway breakthrough, which came years after they had established themselves as profitable stage stars. Williams wrote, &quot;We&#x27;d get near enough to hear the Broadway audiences applaud sometimes, but it was some one else they were applauding. I used to be tempted to beg for a $15 job in a chorus just for one week so as to be able to say I&#x27;d been on Broadway once.&quot; Walker recalled, &quot;Some years ago we were doing a dance before an east side audience. They gave us a hand, and I called out to them, &#x27;Some day we&#x27;ll do this dance on Broadway!&#x27; Then they gave us the laugh. Just the same we gave Broadway that same dance.&quot;

&quot;In Dahomey&quot; traveled to London, where it was enthusiastically received. A command performance was given at Buckingham Palace in June 1903. The show&#x27;s British tour continued through June 1904. In May, Williams and Walker were both initiated into the Edinburgh Lodge of the Freemasons; the Scottish Masons did not racially discriminate as the United States chapters did, including those of the northern states.|

==&quot;Abyssinia&quot; and recording success==
The duo&#x27;s international success established them as the most visible Black performers in the world. They hoped to parlay this renown into a new, more elaborate and costly stage production, to be shown in the top-flight theaters. Williams and Walker&#x27;s management team balked at the expense of this project, then sued the pair to prevent them from securing outside investors or representation. Filings in the suit revealed that each member of the team had earned approximately $120,000 from 1902 to 1904, or $ apiece in dollars. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and Williams and Walker accepted an offer from Hammerstein&#x27;s Victoria Theatre, the premiere vaudeville house in New York. A white Southern monologist objected to the integrated bill, but the show went ahead with Williams and Walker and without the objector.

In February 1906, &quot;Abyssinia&quot;, with a score co-written by Williams, premiered at the Majestic Theater. The show, which included live camels, was another smash. Aspects of the production continued the duo&#x27;s cagey steps toward greater creative pride and freedom for Black performers. The nation of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) was the only African nation to remain sovereign during European colonization, repelling Italy&#x27;s attempts at control in 1896. The show also included inklings of a love story, something that had never been tolerated in a Black stage production before. Walker played a Kansas tourist while his wife, Aida, portrayed an Abyssinian princess. A scene between the two of them, while comic, presented Walker as a nervous suitor.

While the show was praised, many white critics were uncomfortable or uncertain about its cast&#x27;s ambitions. One critic declared that audiences &quot;do not care to see their own ways copied when they can have the real thing better done by white people,&quot; while the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; thought the score &quot;is at times too elaborate for them and a return to the plantation melodies would be a great improvement upon the &#x27;grand opera&#x27; type, for which they are not suited either by temperament or by education.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; remarked, disapprovingly, &quot;there is hardly a trace of negroism in the play.&quot; George Walker was unbowed, telling the &quot;Toledo Bee&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s all rot, this slapstick bandanna handkerchief bladder in the face act, with which negro acting is associated. It ought to die out and we are trying to kill it.&quot; Though the flashier Walker rarely had qualms about opposing the racial prejudice and limitations of the day, the more introspective and brooding Williams internalized his feelings.

Williams committed many of &quot;Abyssinia&quot;″s songs to disc and cylinder. One of them, &quot;Nobody&quot; (1905), became his signature theme, and the song he is best remembered for today. It is a doleful and ironic composition, replete with his dry observational wit, and is perfectly complemented by Williams&#x27; intimate, half-spoken singing style.

Williams became so identified with the song that he was obliged to sing it in almost every appearance for the rest of his life. He considered its success both blessing and curse: &quot;Before I got through with &#x27;Nobody,&#x27; I could have wished that both the author of the words and the assembler of the tune had been strangled or drowned... &#x27;Nobody&#x27; was a particularly hard song to replace.&quot; &quot;Nobody&quot; remained active in Columbia&#x27;s sales catalogue into the 1930s, and the musicologist Tim Brooks estimates that it sold between 100,000 and 150,000 copies, a phenomenally high number for the era.

Williams&#x27; languorous, drawling delivery would become the primary selling point of several similarly structured Williams recordings, such as &quot;Constantly&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Neutral&quot;. Williams even recorded two compositions entitled &quot;Somebody&quot; and &quot;Everybody&quot;. His style was inimitable. In an era when the most popular songs were simultaneously promoted by several artists (for example, &quot;Over There&quot; was a top-10 hit for six different acts in 1917–18), Williams&#x27; repertoire was left comparatively untouched by competing singers. Describing his character&#x27;s style and the appeal it had with audiences, he said: &quot;When he talks to you it is as if he has a secret to confide that concerns just you two.&quot;

Williams and Walker were prominent success stories for the Black community, and they received both extensive press coverage and frequent admonitions to properly &quot;represent the race.&quot; Leading Black newspapers mounted campaigns against demeaning stereotypes such as the word &quot;coon.&quot; Williams &amp; Walker were sympathetic, but also had their careers to consider, where they performed before many white audiences. The balancing act between their audience&#x27;s expectations and their artistic impulses was tricky.

In his only known essay, Williams wrote:
==&quot;Bandanna Land&quot;==

In 1908, while starring in the successful Broadway production &quot;Bandanna Land&quot;, Williams and Walker were asked to appear at a charity benefit by George M. Cohan. Walter C. Kelly, a prominent monologist, protested and encouraged the other acts to withdraw from the show rather than appear alongside Black performers; only two of the acts joined Kelly&#x27;s boycott.

&quot;Bandanna Land&quot; continued the duo&#x27;s series of hits and introduced a tour de force sketch that soon Williams made famous: his pantomime poker game. In total silence, Williams acted out a hand of poker, with only his facial expressions and body language conveying the dealer&#x27;s up-and-down emotions as he considered his hand, reacted to the unseen actions of his invisible opponents, and weighed the pros and cons of raising or calling the bet. It later became a standard routine in his solo stage act, and was recorded on film by Biograph Studios in 1916.

==Solo career==

Walker was in ill health by this point due to syphilis, which was then incurable. In January 1909, he suffered a stroke onstage while singing, and was forced to drop out of &quot;Bandanna Land&quot; the following month. The famous pair never performed in public again, and Walker died less than two years later. Walker had been the businessman and public spokesman for the duo. His absence left Williams professionally adrift.

After 16 years as half of a duo, Williams needed to reestablish himself as a solo act. In May 1909, he returned to Hammerstein&#x27;s Victoria Theater and the high-class vaudeville circuit. His new act consisted of several songs, comic monologues in dialect, and a concluding dance. He received top billing and a high salary, but the White Rats of America, an organization of vaudevillians opposed to encroachments from Blacks and women, intimidated the theater managers into reducing Williams&#x27; billing. The brash Walker would have resisted such an insult to his star status, but the more reserved Williams did not protest. Allies were few; big-time vaudeville managers were fearful of attracting a disproportionate number of Black audience members and thus allowed only one Black act per bill. Due to his ethnicity, Williams typically was forced to travel, eat and lodge separately from the rest of his fellow performers, increasing his sense of isolation following the loss of Walker.

Williams next starred as &quot;Mr. Lode of Koal&quot;, a farce about a kidnapped king that was well received by critics as a star vehicle, although it did not have a fully realized storyline. Camille Forbes in &quot;Introducing Bert Williams&quot; collects several reviews that express competing race-based agendas. Many of the white reviewers praised Williams&#x27; &quot;apparent spontaneous&quot;, &quot;unpremeditated&quot; humor, as if he were a guileless simpleton in no control of his own performance. A Chicago critic wrote, &quot;They are racial, those hands and feet,&quot; while a Boston reviewer felt that the show&#x27;s flimsiness and lack of structure were actually attributes because &quot;when we succumb to the surreptitious desire for the broad tang of &quot;nigger&quot; humor, we want no disturbing atom of intelligence busy-bodying about.&quot; Meanwhile, many Black reviewers ignored the show&#x27;s faults, praising Williams&#x27; continued persistence and prominence as much if not more than his actual performance; an Indianapolis reviewer thought the play was evidence that &quot;we are nearing the day of better things.&quot; Despite the good if loaded notices, &quot;Mr. Lode of Koal&quot; played a secondary string of theaters and was a box office flop.

Following the show&#x27;s abbreviated run, Williams returned to the vaudeville circuit, and The White Rats renewed their opposition to his featured status. The Victoria Theater responded by cutting Williams to secondary billing, but putting his name on the marquee in lettering twice as large as that of the nominal headliner. Newspapers took note of the disingenuous manner in which the White Rats&#x27; demands had been met, as well as the way in which many of those performers who were impeding his career would rush to the front of the theater whenever his turn to perform came up.

==&quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;==
After &quot;Mr. Lode&quot; skidded to a halt, Williams accepted an unprecedented offer to join Flo Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. The idea of a Black-featured performer amid an otherwise all-white show was a shock in 1910. Williams&#x27; initial reception was cool, and several cast members delivered an ultimatum to Ziegfeld that Williams be fired. Ziegfeld held firm, saying, &quot;I can replace every one of you, except [Williams].&quot; The show&#x27;s writers were slow to devise material for him to perform, forcing Williams to repeat much of his vaudeville act. But by the time the show finally debuted in June, Williams was a sensation. In addition to his usual material, Williams appeared in a boxing sketch playing off the racially charged &quot;Great White Hope&quot; heavyweight bout that had just taken place between Jack Johnson and James J. Jeffries. Reviews were uniformly positive for Williams, and also for Fanny Brice, who was making her Broadway debut.

Following his success, Williams signed an exclusive contract with Columbia Records, and recorded four of the show&#x27;s songs. His elevated status was signaled not just by the generous terms of the contract, but by the tenor of Columbia&#x27;s promotion, which dropped much of the previous &quot;coon harmony&quot;-type sales patter and began touting Williams&#x27; &quot;inimitable art&quot; and &quot;direct appeal to the intelligence.&quot; Brooks wrote that &quot;Williams had become a star who transcended race, to the extent that was possible in 1910.&quot; All four songs sold well, and one of them, &quot;Play That Barbershop Chord&quot;, became a substantial hit.

Few stage performers were recording regularly in 1910, in some cases because their onstage styles did not translate to the limited technical media. But Williams&#x27; low-key natural delivery was ideal for discs of the time, and his personality was warm and funny.
Williams returned for the 1911 edition of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, teaming up in some sketches with the comedian Leon Errol to ecstatic effect. The best-received sketch featured Errol as a tourist, and Williams as a porter using a mountaineer&#x27;s rope to lead him across dangerously high girders in the then-unfinished Grand Central Station. Errol&#x27;s fast-talking persona and frenetic physical comedy gave Williams his first effective onstage foil since Walker&#x27;s retirement. Williams and Errol wrote the sketch themselves, turning it into a 20-minute centerpiece of the show after the &quot;Follies&quot; writers had originally given Williams but a single two-word line of dialogue. Williams also reprised his poker routine, and popularized a song called &quot;Woodman, Spare That Tree&quot;.

The team of Williams with the white Leon Errol was a groundbreaking pairing that had never been seen before on the Broadway stage. Also notable was the relative equality of the duo in their sketches, with Williams delivering most of the punchlines and generally getting the better of Errol. At the conclusion of their Grand Central Station routine, Errol offered Williams a mere five-cent tip, to which the aggrieved Williams deliberately loosened Errol&#x27;s supporting rope, sending him plunging from the high girder. Then, a construction explosion below sent Errol shooting into the sky, unseen by the audience, while Williams laconically described his trajectory: &quot;There he goes. Now he&#x27;s near the Metropolitan Tower. If he can only grab that little gold knob on top... uh... um... he muffed it.&quot; After Williams&#x27; death a decade later, Errol was the only white pallbearer at his funeral.

Williams continued as the featured star of the &quot;Follies&quot;, signing a three-year contract that paid him an annual salary of $62,400, equivalent to $1.5 million today. By his third stint, Williams&#x27; status was such that he was allowed to be onstage at the same time as white women—a significant concession in 1912—and started to interact with more of the show&#x27;s principals.

In January 1913, he recorded several more sides for Columbia, including a new version of &quot;Nobody&quot;, the 1906 copies having long since become scarce. All of the releases remained in Columbia&#x27;s catalog for years. He continued to make several more recording dates for Columbia, though he stopped writing his own songs by 1915. He also began making film appearances, though most have been lost. One of them, &quot;A Natural Born Gambler&quot;, shows his pantomime poker sketch, and is the best-known footage of Williams available. Part of an abandoned Williams comedy film, &quot;Lime Kiln Field Day&quot;, was found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art and restored for its first screening in October 2014. The film featured an all-Black cast, and the recovered footage included cast and crew interactions between scenes.

Williams did not appear in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1913&quot;, instead taking part in an all-Black revue of The Frogs, a Negro theatrical organization that had been founded in 1908 by George Walker. For many of his Black fans, this was the first time to see Williams onstage since before he joined the &quot;Follies&quot;. Following the Frogs tour, Williams set out again on the vaudeville circuit, where he was the highest-paid Black performer in history.

Back in the &quot;Follies&quot; fold for 1914, Williams was reunited with Leon Errol for a more absurd version of their girder sketch, this time set on the 1,313th floor of a skyscraper. But as the annual production became more lavish, more crowded with talent, and more devoted to the parade of &quot;Ziegfeld Girls,&quot; Williams and other performers were given less stage time, and less attention from the show&#x27;s writers. This trend continued in the 1915 edition. W. C. Fields made his &quot;Follies&quot; debut in 1915, and endured the same treatment when the writers cut his scene down rather than enhancing it. Eventually, left alone on an empty stage with a pool table, the comedian responded by creating his famed &quot;pool shark&quot; routine. In 1916, the writers gave Williams a takeoff of Othello to play, but by most accounts neither the material nor his performance was up to his usual standard.

The 1917 installment of Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; featured a rich array of talent, including Williams, W. C. Fields, Fanny Brice, Will Rogers (who had debuted in 1916), and newcomer Eddie Cantor. Williams and Cantor did scenes together, and struck up a close friendship. In 1918, Williams went on a hiatus from the &quot;Follies&quot;, citing the show&#x27;s difficulty in providing him with quality parts and sketches. Within a month, he was performing in another Ziegfeld production, the secondary &quot;Midnight Frolic&quot;. By all accounts, Williams thrived in the smaller setting, in which he had the stage time he needed for his routines. He returned to the &quot;Follies of 1919&quot;, but once again was saddled with sub-par material, including a supporting part in a minstrel show segment.

Between 1918 and 1921, he recorded several records in the guise of &quot;Elder Eatmore&quot;, an unscrupulous preacher, as well as songs dealing with Prohibition, such as &quot;Everybody Wants a Key to My Cellar&quot;, &quot;Save a Little Dram for Me&quot;, &quot;Ten Little Bottles&quot;, and the smash hit, &quot;The Moon Shines on the Moonshine&quot;. By this point, Williams&#x27; records were taking up a full page in Columbia&#x27;s catalog, and they were among the strongest-selling songs of the age. At a time when 10,000 sales was considered a very successful major label release, Williams had four songs that shipped between 180,000 and 250,000 copies in 1920 alone. Williams, along with Al Jolson and Nora Bayes, was one of the three most highly paid recording artists in the world.

Despite continuous success, Williams&#x27; position was tenuous in other ways. When Actors Equity went on strike in August 1919, the entire &quot;Follies&quot; cast walked out, except for Williams, who showed up to work to find an empty theater; he had not been told about the strike. &quot;I don&#x27;t belong to either side,&quot; he told W. C. Fields. &quot;Nobody wants me.&quot;

Williams continued to face institutional racism, but due to his success and popularity, he was in a better position to deal with it. On one occasion, when he attempted to buy a drink at the bar of New York&#x27;s elegant Hotel Astor, the white bartender tried to chase Williams away by telling him that he would be charged $50. Williams&#x27; response was to produce a thick roll of hundred dollar bills out of his pocket; placing the wad on the bar, he ordered a round for everyone in the room. He told a reporter, &quot;They say it is a matter of race prejudice. But if it were prejudice a baby would have it, and you will never find it in a baby... I have notice that this &quot;race prejudice&quot; is not to be found in people who are sure enough of their position to defy it.&quot; In a letter to a friend, Williams described some of the segregation and abuse he&#x27;d experienced, adding, &quot;When ultimate changes come... I wonder if the new human beings will believe such persons as I am writing you about actually lived?&quot; Even so, in 1914, a perceptive critic for the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; wrote: &quot;Every time I see Mr. Bert Williams, the &#x27;distinguished colored comedian&#x27;, I wonder if he is not the patient repository of a secret sadness... Sorrow concealed, &#x27;like an oven stopped&#x27;, must burn his heart to cinders.&quot;

==Late career and death==
Williams&#x27; stage career lagged after his final &quot;Follies&quot; appearance in 1919. His name was enough to open a show, but they had shorter, less profitable runs. In December 1921, &quot;Under the Bamboo Tree&quot; opened, to middling results. Williams still got good reviews, but the show did not. Williams developed pneumonia, but did not want to miss performances, knowing that he was the only thing keeping an otherwise moribund musical alive at the box office. However, Williams also emotionally suffered from the racial politics of the era, and did not feel fully accepted. He experienced almost chronic depression in his later years, coupled with alcoholism and insomnia.

On February 27, 1922, Williams collapsed during a performance in Detroit, Michigan, which the audience initially thought was a comic bit. Helped to his dressing room, Williams quipped: &quot;That&#x27;s a nice way to die. They was laughing when I made my last exit.&quot; He returned to New York, but his health worsened. He died at his home, 2309 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, on March 4, 1922, at the age of 47. 

Few knew he was sick, and news of his death came as a public shock. More than 5,000 fans filed past his casket, and thousands more were turned away. A private service was held at the Masonic Lodge in Manhattan, where Williams broke his last barrier. He was the first Black American to be so honored by the all-white Grand Lodge. When the Masons opened their doors for a public service, nearly 2,000 mourners of both races were admitted. Williams was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==
In 1910, Booker T. Washington wrote of Williams: &quot;He has done more for our race than I have. He has smiled his way into people&#x27;s hearts; I have been obliged to fight my way.&quot; Gene Buck, who had discovered W. C. Fields in vaudeville and hired him for the &quot;Follies&quot;, wrote to a friend on the occasion of Fields&#x27; death: &quot;Next to Bert Williams, Bill [Fields] was the greatest comic that ever lived.&quot;

Phil Harris recorded &quot;Nobody&quot; and &quot;Woodman, Woodman, Spare That Tree&quot;—both big hits of Williams—in late 1936 and early 1937.

In 1940, Duke Ellington composed and recorded &quot;A Portrait of Bert Williams&quot;, a subtly crafted tribute. In 1978, in a memorable turn on a Boston Pops TV special, Ben Vereen performed a tribute to Williams, complete with makeup and attire. He reprised Williams&#x27; high-kick dance steps, to such classic vaudeville standards as &quot;Waitin&#x27; for the Robert E. Lee&quot;.

In the 1955 film &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot;, a biography of vaudevillian Eddie Foy, Bob Hope sings &quot;Nobody&quot;.

The 1975 musical version of &quot;Chicago&quot;, which reimagined the characters of the 1926 play &quot;Chicago&quot; with the personalities of famed vaudeville performers of the 1920s, adapted Williams&#x27; personality for the character of Amos Hart. Hart&#x27;s featured number in the musical, &quot;Mister Cellophane,&quot; is a pastiche of &quot;Nobody.&quot;

Ry Cooder covered Williams&#x27; song &quot;Nobody&quot; on his album &quot;Jazz&quot;, released in 1978.

The 1980 Broadway musical &quot;Tintypes&quot; featured &quot;Nobody&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Jonah Man&quot;, a song first popularized by Williams in 1903.

Johnny Cash covered Williams&#x27; song &quot;Nobody&quot; on his album &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot;, released in 2000.

In 1996, Bert Williams was inducted into the International Clown Hall of Fame.

The Archeophone label has collected and released all of Williams&#x27; extant recordings on three CDs.

&quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; (2005) by Caryl Phillips is a novelization of the life of Bert Williams.

&quot;Nobody&quot; (2008) by Richard Aellen is a play centered on Williams&#x27; and George Walker&#x27;s time in vaudeville.

<text>Edward of Westminster (13 October 1453 – 4 May 1471), also known as Edward of Lancaster, was the only child of Henry VI of England and Margaret of Anjou. He was killed aged seventeen at the Battle of Tewkesbury.

==Early life==
Edward was born at the Palace of Westminster, London, the only child of Henry VI of England and his wife, Margaret of Anjou. At the time, there was strife between Henry&#x27;s supporters and those of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, who had a claim to the throne and challenged the authority of Henry&#x27;s officers of state. Henry was suffering from mental illness, and there were widespread rumours that the prince was the result of an affair between his mother and one of her loyal supporters. Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond, were both suspected of fathering Prince Edward; however, there is no firm evidence to support the rumours, and Henry himself never doubted the boy&#x27;s legitimacy and publicly acknowledged paternity. Edward was invested as Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle in 1454.

==War over the English throne==
In 1460, Henry was captured by the supporters of the Duke of York at the Battle of Northampton and taken to London. The Duke of York was dissuaded from claiming the throne immediately, but he induced Parliament to pass the Act of Accord, by which Henry was allowed to reign but Edward was disinherited, as York or his heirs would become king on Henry&#x27;s death.

Queen Margaret and Edward had meanwhile fled through Cheshire. By Margaret&#x27;s later account, she induced outlaws and pillagers to aid her by pledging them to recognise the seven-year-old Edward as rightful heir to the crown. They subsequently reached safety in Wales and journeyed to Scotland, where Margaret raised support, while the Duke of York&#x27;s enemies gathered in the north of England.

After York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield, the large army which Margaret had gathered advanced south. They defeated the army of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, one of York&#x27;s most prominent supporters, at the Second Battle of St Albans. Warwick had brought the captive Henry in the train of his army, and he was found abandoned on the battlefield. Two of Warwick&#x27;s knights, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, and Sir Thomas Kyriell, who had agreed to remain with Henry and see that he came to no harm, were captured. The day after the battle, Margaret asked Edward what death the two knights should suffer. Edward readily replied that their heads should be cut off.

==Exile in France==

Margaret hesitated to advance on London with her unruly army and subsequently retreated. They were routed at the Battle of Towton a few weeks later. Margaret and Edward fled once again, to Scotland. For the next three years, Margaret inspired several revolts in the northernmost counties of England, but was eventually forced to sail to France, where she and Edward maintained a court in exile. (Henry had once again been captured and was a prisoner in the Tower of London.)

In 1467 the ambassador of the Duchy of Milan to the court of France wrote that Edward &quot;already talks of nothing but cutting off heads or making war, as if he had everything in his hands or was the god of battle or the peaceful occupant of that throne.&quot;

After several years in exile, Margaret took the best opportunity that presented itself and allied herself with the renegade Earl of Warwick. Louis XI of France wanted to start a war with Burgundy, allies of the Yorkist Edward IV. He believed if he allied himself to restoring Lancastrian rule they would help him conquer Burgundy. As a compliment to his new allies Louis made young Edward godfather to his son Charles. Prince Edward was married to Anne Neville, Warwick&#x27;s younger daughter, in December 1470, though there is some doubt as to whether the marriage was ever .

==Battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury==

Warwick returned to England and deposed Edward IV, with the help of Edward IV&#x27;s younger brother, the Duke of Clarence. Edward IV fled into exile to Burgundy with his youngest brother the Duke of Gloucester, while Warwick restored Henry VI to the throne. Prince Edward and Margaret lingered behind in France until April 1471. However, Edward IV had already raised an army, returned to England, and reconciled with Clarence. On the same day Margaret and Edward landed in England (14 April), Edward IV defeated and killed Warwick at the Battle of Barnet. With little real hope of success, the inexperienced prince and his mother led the remnant of their forces to meet Edward IV in the Battle of Tewkesbury. They were defeated and Edward of Westminster was killed.

According to contemporary sources, Edward was overtaken and slain in the battle during the rout of the Lancastrians. An eyewitness to the battle dramatized the moment of his death in a picture which was preserved in a public library, and is described as follows: &quot;The horse is wounded and on its knees. Then the rider receives his death blow from behind. The helmet had been struck off. The bright golden locks sink down on the horse&#x27;s mane, and in another moment horse and rider fall and are ridden over.&quot;

Some accounts attribute Edward&#x27;s death to his former ally the Duke of Clarence, to whom the prince vainly appealed for help. Paul Murray Kendall, a biographer of Richard III, accepts this version of events. Another version states that Clarence and his men found the grieving prince near a grove following the battle, and immediately beheaded him on a makeshift block, despite his pleas.

Another account of Edward&#x27;s death is given by three Tudor sources: &quot;The Grand Chronicle of London&quot;, Polydore Vergil, and Edward Hall. It was later dramatised by William Shakespeare in &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, Act V, scene v. Their story is that Edward was captured and brought before the victorious Edward IV and his brothers, the Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Gloucester, and his followers. The king received the prince graciously, and asked him why he had taken up arms against him. The prince replied defiantly, &quot;I came to recover my father&#x27;s heritage.&quot; The king then struck the prince across his face with his gauntlet hand, whereupon Gloucester and Clarence killed the prince with their swords.

However, none of these accounts appears in any of the contemporaneous sources, which all report that Edward died in battle.

Edward&#x27;s body is buried at Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire. His widow, Anne Neville, married the Duke of Gloucester, who eventually succeeded to the throne as Richard III in 1483.

==Epitaph==
The Latin memorial brass to Edward in Tewkesbury Abbey is set in the floor between the choir stalls, under the tower. It reads as follows:





This can be translated into English as follows:

&quot;Here lies Edward, Prince of Wales,
cruelly slain whilst but a youth.
Anno Domini 1471, May fourth.
Alas, the savagery of men.
Thou art the sole light of thy Mother,
and the last hope of thy race.&quot;

<text>Golf Halt is a small railway halt on the Fairbourne Railway in Gwynedd, North Wales.

Until 2007 the station was known as Gorsafawddachaidraigddanheddogleddollônpenrhynareurdraethceredigion (.

==Overview==
The name was contrived by the railway for publicity and to outdo Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. The Welsh name is translated as: &quot;Mawddach Station and its Dragon beneath the northern peace of the Penrhyn Road on the golden beach of Cardigan Bay.&quot;

The &quot;dragon&quot; refers to some surviving World War II anti-tank blocks, known as dragon&#x27;s teeth.

Problems with the name are the need for the apostrophe and that the two words &quot;...[g]ogleddol-lôn...&quot; need a hyphen between them to make sense. &quot;Ll&quot; is a letter in its own right in Welsh. It also includes the description &quot;ar eurdraeth Ceredigion&quot; for &quot;on the golden beach of Cardigan Bay&quot;: however &quot;Cardigan Bay&quot; is &quot;Bae Ceredigion&quot;, and it is the neighbouring county (the station itself is in Gwynedd). Possibly because of this, the name has not received much if any official recognition and Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is still regarded as the longest by most authorities. The station reverted to its original name of Golf Halt in 2007 (although on the new sign underneath &quot;Golf Halt&quot; the long name is displayed in small letters).

<doc id="187440" wikidata="Q953629" url="?curid=187440" title="Dildo, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Dildo is a local service district and designated place in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador on the island of Newfoundland. It is located on the southeastern Dildo Arm of Trinity Bay about west of St. John&#x27;s. South Dildo is a community located to the south, and in 2021 had 195 residents. It is known for its unusual name.

== Name ==

The place name &quot;Dildo&quot; is attested in this area since at least 1711, though how this came to be is unknown. The origin of the word &quot;dildo&quot; itself is obscure. It was once used to reference a phallus-shaped pin stuck in the edging of a row boat to act as a pivot for the oar (also known as a &quot;thole pin&quot; or &quot;dole pin&quot;). It was used as early as the 16th century for a cylindrical object such as a &quot;dildo glass&quot; (test tube), for a phallus-shaped sex toy, as an insult for a &quot;contemptuous or reviling&quot; male, and as a refrain in ballads.

The name, then written as &quot;Dildoe&quot;, was first applied to Dildo Island, located offshore from the present-day community of Dildo. This use was recorded in 1711 and 1775, and the name was thereafter applied to the Dildo Arm of Trinity Bay and other local physical features. Social scientist William Baillie Hamilton notes that Captain James Cook and his assistant Michael Lane, who mapped Newfoundland in the 1760s, often displayed a sense of humour in the place names they chose, and were not above selecting names that might &quot;offend over-sensitive&quot; readers. Regardless of the origin, the name has brought the town of Dildo a measure of notoriety. In the 20th century, there were several unsuccessful campaigns to change the name.

== History ==
The Dildo area has a long history, going as far back as 2000 BC when Maritime Archaic aboriginal people resided at Anderson&#x27;s Cove. By 700 AD, people of the Dorset culture inhabited Dildo Island. In 1613, Henry Crout, whilst sailing up Dildo Arm, came in contact with the Beothuks, who were residing on Dildo Island at this time. He traded with them and left gifts. In 1711, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, the inhabitants of Trinity Bay were ordered by Governor Crow to leave their homes during the winter, to defend themselves against the French, who burned their houses. Dildo Island was one of the places designated for this purpose. The town of Dildo was founded in the late 18th century and settled to exploit the abundance of marine resources such as fish (mostly cod), whales and seals.

== Geography ==
Dildo is in Newfoundland within Subdivision E of Division No. 1.

== Demographics ==
As a designated place in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Dildo recorded a population of 803 living in 363 of its 440 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 943. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Arts and culture ==

In August 2019, the American late-night talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; focused on Dildo over a number of episodes. As part of the activity, host Jimmy Kimmel was made honorary mayor of Dildo. The community is governed by a volunteer committee and does not have an elected mayor. In addition, Guillermo Rodriguez, who is known as Kimmel&#x27;s sidekick &quot;security guard&quot;, was made an honorary citizen of Dildo through the Newfoundland tradition of &#x27;screeching in,&#x27; on the August 15, 2019, broadcast of the show. Rodriguez visited the community for a week. Kimmel declared Hollywood as Dildo&#x27;s sister city. As part of his gesture, he also gave the community a sign, in the style of the Hollywood sign, which sits on the hillside overlooking the community.

== Government ==
Dildo is a local service district (LSD) that is governed by a committee responsible for the provision of certain services to the community. The chair of the LSD committee is Greg Pretty.

<doc id="187442" wikidata="Q657339" url="?curid=187442" title="Software metric">
<text>In software engineering and development, a software metric is a standard of measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property. Even if a metric is not a measurement (metrics are functions, while measurements are the numbers obtained by the application of metrics), often the two terms are used as synonyms. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance, testing, software debugging, software performance optimization, and optimal personnel task assignments.

== Common software measurements ==
Common software measurements include:
* ABC Software Metric
* Balanced scorecard
* Bugs per line of code
* Code coverage
* Cohesion
* Comment density
* Connascent software components
* Constructive Cost Model
* Coupling
* Cyclomatic complexity (McCabe&#x27;s complexity)
* Cyclomatic complexity density
* Defect density - defects found in a component
* Defect potential - expected number of defects in a particular component
* Defect removal rate
* DSQI (design structure quality index)
* Function Points and Automated Function Points, an Object Management Group standard
* Halstead Complexity
* Instruction path length
* Maintainability index
* Source lines of code - number of lines of code
* Program execution time
* Program load time
* Program size (binary)
* Weighted Micro Function Points
* Cycle time (software)
* First pass yield
* Corrective Commit Probability

== Limitations ==
As software development is a complex process, with high variance on both methodologies and objectives, it is difficult to define or measure software qualities and quantities and to determine a valid and concurrent measurement metric, especially when making such a prediction prior to the detail design. Another source of difficulty and debate is in determining which metrics matter, and what they mean.
The practical utility of software measurements has therefore been limited to the following domains:
* Scheduling
* Software sizing
* Programming complexity
* Software development effort estimation
* Software quality

A specific measurement may target one or more of the above aspects, or the balance between them, for example as an indicator of team motivation or project performance.

Additionally metrics vary between static and dynamic program code, as well as for object oriented software (systems).

== Acceptance and public opinion ==
Some software development practitioners point out that simplistic measurements can cause more harm than good. Others have noted that metrics have become an integral part of the software development process.
Impact of measurement on programmer psychology have raised concerns for harmful effects to performance due to stress, performance anxiety, and attempts to cheat the metrics, while others find it to have positive impact on developers value towards their own work, and prevent them being undervalued. Some argue that the definition of many measurement methodologies are imprecise, and consequently it is often unclear how tools for computing them arrive at a particular result, while others argue that imperfect quantification is better than none (“You can’t control what you can&#x27;t measure.”). Evidence shows that software metrics are being widely used by government agencies, the US military, NASA, IT consultants, academic institutions, and commercial and academic development estimation software.

<text>The Haydn Quartet, later known as the Hayden Quartet, was one of the most popular recording close harmony quartets in the early twentieth century. It was originally formed in 1896 as the Edison Quartet to record for Edison Records; it took its new name when recording for other companies. The name was a homage to Joseph Haydn, the classical composer; the spelling was later revised to Hayden, which reflects the way it was pronounced. The group disbanded in 1914.

==Formation==
The &quot;Haydn Quartet&quot; originally formed under the name &quot;Edison Quartet&quot; in 1896, with a membership of John Bieling (tenor), Jere Mahoney (tenor), Samuel Holland Rous (who performed under the name S. H. Dudley, baritone), and William F. Hooley (bass). Mahoney was soon replaced by John Scantlebury Macdonald, who used the pseudonym Harry Macdonough. They recorded as the Edison Quartet (or Edison Male Quartet), before taking the name Haydn Quartet in order to record for companies other than Edison.

In 1901 they signed a contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company, and in 1902 also traveled to the UK to record for the Gramophone Company, which was Victor&#x27;s affiliate. The group had great success over the next decade as one of the premier recording groups of the time, on a par with the Peerless Quartet. The Haydn Quartet often sang material at a slower tempo and in a statelier fashion than other groups. The ensemble also performed vaudeville and minstrel show songs, one of which, &quot;The Camp Meeting Jubilee&quot;, released in 1904 as Victor no. 4003, includes a very early recorded use of the phrase &quot;rockin&#x27; and rollin&#x27;&quot;, albeit used with a spiritual rather than secular connotation.

Recordings credited to the Haydn Quartet began to be phased out in 1908. After that time, Billy Murray frequently sang lead with the group, and S. H. Dudley was often replaced by Reinald Werrenrath. Following the successful collaborations between Murray and the Haydn Quartet, Victor organized a new group, the American Quartet, in 1910, with Murray, Bieling and Hooley from the Haydn Quartet, and baritone Steve Porter. The group&#x27;s name was spelled Hayden after 1910. The quartet disbanded in 1914. As well as members participating in the American Quartet, Macdonough and Hooley, together with Reinald Werranrath and tenor Lambert Murphy, also formed the Orpheus Quartet, who recorded successfully until 1919.

In his book &quot;Pop Memories 1890-1954&quot;, music archivist and statistician Joel Whitburn assessed a variety of sources such as &quot;Talking Machine World&quot;″s lists of top-selling recordings, and &quot;Billboard&quot;″s sheet music and vaudeville charts, to estimate the most successful recordings of the period. He concluded that the Haydn Quartet had 62 &quot;top ten&quot; hits in all between 1898 and 1914, and in the decade 1900-1909 had more successful recordings than any other group, behind only Macdonough and Murray, who recorded as solo artists in addition to their group performances. Although Whitburn&#x27;s methods of assessment have been criticized, this confirms that the group were one of the most popular of their era.

<doc id="187446" wikidata="Q2748415" url="?curid=187446" title="Orientability">
<text>In mathematics, orientability is a property of some topological spaces such as real vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, surfaces, and more generally manifolds that allows a consistent definition of &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;anticlockwise&quot;. A space is orientable if such a consistent definition exists. In this case, there are two possible definitions, and a choice between them is an orientation of the space. Real vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, and spheres are orientable. A space is non-orientable if &quot;clockwise&quot; is changed into &quot;counterclockwise&quot; after running through some loops in it, and coming back to the starting point. This means that a geometric shape, such as , that moves continuously along such a loop is changed into its own mirror image . A Möbius strip is an example of a non-orientable space.

Various equivalent formulations of orientability can be given, depending on the desired application and level of generality. Formulations applicable to general topological manifolds often employ methods of homology theory, whereas for differentiable manifolds more structure is present, allowing a formulation in terms of differential forms. A generalization of the notion of orientability of a space is that of orientability of a family of spaces parameterized by some other space (a fiber bundle) for which an orientation must be selected in each of the spaces which varies continuously with respect to changes in the parameter values.

==Orientable surfaces==
A surface &quot;S&quot; in the Euclidean space R3 is orientable if a chiral two-dimensional figure (for example, ) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image (). Otherwise the surface is non-orientable. An abstract surface (i.e., a two-dimensional manifold) is orientable if a consistent concept of clockwise rotation can be defined on the surface in a continuous manner. That is to say that a loop going around one way on the surface can never be continuously deformed (without overlapping itself) to a loop going around the opposite way. This turns out to be equivalent to the question of whether the surface contains no subset that is homeomorphic to the Möbius strip. Thus, for surfaces, the Möbius strip may be considered the source of all non-orientability.

For an orientable surface, a consistent choice of &quot;clockwise&quot; (as opposed to counter-clockwise) is called an orientation, and the surface is called oriented. For surfaces embedded in Euclidean space, an orientation is specified by the choice of a continuously varying surface normal n at every point. If such a normal exists at all, then there are always two ways to select it: n or −n. More generally, an orientable surface admits exactly two orientations, and the distinction between an orient&quot;ed&quot; surface and an orient&quot;able&quot; surface is subtle and frequently blurred. An orientable surface is an abstract surface that admits an orientation, while an oriented surface is a surface that is abstractly orientable, and has the additional datum of a choice of one of the two possible orientations.

===Examples===
Most surfaces encountered in the physical world are orientable. Spheres, planes, and tori are orientable, for example. But Möbius strips, real projective planes, and Klein bottles are non-orientable. They, as visualized in 3-dimensions, all have just one side. The real projective plane and Klein bottle cannot be embedded in R3, only immersed with nice intersections.

Note that locally an embedded surface always has two sides, so a near-sighted ant crawling on a one-sided surface would think there is an &quot;other side&quot;. The essence of one-sidedness is that the ant can crawl from one side of the surface to the &quot;other&quot; without going through the surface or flipping over an edge, but simply by crawling far enough.

In general, the property of being orientable is not equivalent to being two-sided; however, this holds when the ambient space (such as R3 above) is orientable. For example, a torus embedded in 
:formula_1

can be one-sided, and a Klein bottle in the same space can be two-sided; here formula_2 refers to the Klein bottle.

===Orientation by triangulation===
Any surface has a triangulation: a decomposition into triangles such that each edge on a triangle is glued to at most one other edge. Each triangle is oriented by choosing a direction around the perimeter of the triangle, associating a direction to each edge of the triangle. If this is done in such a way that, when glued together, neighboring edges are pointing in the opposite direction, then this determines an orientation of the surface. Such a choice is only possible if the surface is orientable, and in this case there are exactly two different orientations.

If the figure can be consistently positioned at all points of the surface without turning into its mirror image, then this will induce an orientation in the above sense on each of the triangles of the triangulation by selecting the direction of each of the triangles based on the order red-green-blue of colors of any of the figures in the interior of the triangle.

This approach generalizes to any &quot;n&quot;-manifold having a triangulation. However, some 4-manifolds do not have a triangulation, and in general for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4 some &quot;n&quot;-manifolds have triangulations that are inequivalent.

===Orientability and homology===

If &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;S&quot;) denotes the first homology group of a closed surface &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is orientable if and only if &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;S&quot;) has a trivial torsion subgroup. More precisely, if &quot;S&quot; is orientable then &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;S&quot;) is a free abelian group, and if not then &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;S&quot;) = &quot;F&quot; + Z/2Z where &quot;F&quot; is free abelian, and the Z/2Z factor is generated by the middle curve in a Möbius band embedded in &quot;S&quot;.

==Orientability of manifolds==

Let &quot;M&quot; be a connected topological &quot;n&quot;-manifold. There are several possible definitions of what it means for &quot;M&quot; to be orientable. Some of these definitions require that &quot;M&quot; has extra structure, like being differentiable. Occasionally, must be made into a special case. When more than one of these definitions applies to &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is orientable under one definition if and only if it is orientable under the others.

===Orientability of differentiable manifolds===

The most intuitive definitions require that &quot;M&quot; be a differentiable manifold. This means that the transition functions in the atlas of &quot;M&quot; are &quot;C&quot;1-functions. Such a function admits a Jacobian determinant. When the Jacobian determinant is positive, the transition function is said to be orientation preserving. An oriented atlas on &quot;M&quot; is an atlas for which all transition functions are orientation preserving. &quot;M&quot; is orientable if it admits an oriented atlas. When , an orientation of &quot;M&quot; is a maximal oriented atlas. (When , an orientation of &quot;M&quot; is a function .)

Orientability and orientations can also be expressed in terms of the tangent bundle. The tangent bundle is a vector bundle, so it is a fiber bundle with structure group . That is, the transition functions of the manifold induce transition functions on the tangent bundle which are fiberwise linear transformations. If the structure group can be reduced to the group of positive determinant matrices, or equivalently if there exists an atlas whose transition functions determine an orientation preserving linear transformation on each tangent space, then the manifold &quot;M&quot; is orientable. Conversely, &quot;M&quot; is orientable if and only if the structure group of the tangent bundle can be reduced in this way. Similar observations can be made for the frame bundle.

Another way to define orientations on a differentiable manifold is through volume forms. A volume form is a nowhere vanishing section &quot;ω&quot; of , the top exterior power of the cotangent bundle of &quot;M&quot;. For example, R&quot;n&quot; has a standard volume form given by . Given a volume form on &quot;M&quot;, the collection of all charts for which the standard volume form pulls back to a positive multiple of &quot;ω&quot; is an oriented atlas. The existence of a volume form is therefore equivalent to orientability of the manifold.

Volume forms and tangent vectors can be combined to give yet another description of orientability. If is a basis of tangent vectors at a point &quot;p&quot;, then the basis is said to be right-handed if . A transition function is orientation preserving if and only if it sends right-handed bases to right-handed bases. The existence of a volume form implies a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle or the frame bundle to . As before, this implies the orientability of &quot;M&quot;. Conversely, if &quot;M&quot; is orientable, then local volume forms can be patched together to create a global volume form, orientability being necessary to ensure that the global form is nowhere vanishing.

===Homology and the orientability of general manifolds===

At the heart of all the above definitions of orientability of a differentiable manifold is the notion of an orientation preserving transition function. This raises the question of what exactly such transition functions are preserving. They cannot be preserving an orientation of the manifold because an orientation of the manifold is an atlas, and it makes no sense to say that a transition function preserves or does not preserve an atlas of which it is a member.

This question can be resolved by defining local orientations. On a one-dimensional manifold, a local orientation around a point &quot;p&quot; corresponds to a choice of left and right near that point. On a two-dimensional manifold, it corresponds to a choice of clockwise and counter-clockwise. These two situations share the common feature that they are described in terms of top-dimensional behavior near &quot;p&quot; but not at &quot;p&quot;. For the general case, let &quot;M&quot; be a topological &quot;n&quot;-manifold. A local orientation of &quot;M&quot; around a point &quot;p&quot; is a choice of generator of the group
:formula_3

To see the geometric significance of this group, choose a chart around &quot;p&quot;. In that chart there is a neighborhood of &quot;p&quot; which is an open ball &quot;B&quot; around the origin &quot;O&quot;. By the excision theorem, formula_4 is isomorphic to formula_5. The ball &quot;B&quot; is contractible, so its homology groups vanish except in degree zero, and the space is an -sphere, so its homology groups vanish except in degrees and . A computation with the long exact sequence in relative homology shows that the above homology group is isomorphic to formula_6. A choice of generator therefore corresponds to a decision of whether, in the given chart, a sphere around &quot;p&quot; is positive or negative. A reflection of through the origin acts by negation on formula_7, so the geometric significance of the choice of generator is that it distinguishes charts from their reflections.

On a topological manifold, a transition function is orientation preserving if, at each point &quot;p&quot; in its domain, it fixes the generators of formula_4. From here, the relevant definitions are the same as in the differentiable case. An oriented atlas is one for which all transition functions are orientation preserving, &quot;M&quot; is orientable if it admits an oriented atlas, and when , an orientation of &quot;M&quot; is a maximal oriented atlas.

Intuitively, an orientation of &quot;M&quot; ought to define a unique local orientation of &quot;M&quot; at each point. This is made precise by noting that any chart in the oriented atlas around &quot;p&quot; can be used to determine a sphere around &quot;p&quot;, and this sphere determines a generator of formula_4. Moreover, any other chart around &quot;p&quot; is related to the first chart by an orientation preserving transition function, and this implies that the two charts yield the same generator, whence the generator is unique.

Purely homological definitions are also possible. Assuming that &quot;M&quot; is closed and connected, &quot;M&quot; is orientable if and only if the &quot;n&quot;th homology group formula_10 is isomorphic to the integers Z. An orientation of &quot;M&quot; is a choice of generator of this group. This generator determines an oriented atlas by fixing a generator of the infinite cyclic group formula_11 and taking the oriented charts to be those for which pushes forward to the fixed generator. Conversely, an oriented atlas determines such a generator as compatible local orientations can be glued together to give a generator for the homology group formula_11.

===Orientation and cohomology===

A manifold &quot;M&quot; is orientable if and only if the first Stiefel–Whitney class formula_13 vanishes. In particular, if the first cohomology group with Z/2 coefficients is zero, then the manifold is orientable. Moreover, if &quot;M&quot; is orientable and &quot;w&quot;1 vanishes, then formula_14 parametrizes the choices of orientations. This characterization of orientability extends to orientability of general vector bundles over &quot;M&quot;, not just the tangent bundle.

===The orientation double cover===

Around each point of &quot;M&quot; there are two local orientations. Intuitively, there is a way to move from a local orientation at a point to a local orientation at a nearby point : when the two points lie in the same coordinate chart , that coordinate chart defines compatible local orientations at and . The set of local orientations can therefore be given a topology, and this topology makes it into a manifold.

More precisely, let &quot;O&quot; be the set of all local orientations of &quot;M&quot;. To topologize &quot;O&quot; we will specify a subbase for its topology. Let &quot;U&quot; be an open subset of &quot;M&quot; chosen such that formula_15 is isomorphic to Z. Assume that α is a generator of this group. For each &quot;p&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, there is a pushforward function formula_16. The codomain of this group has two generators, and α maps to one of them. The topology on &quot;O&quot; is defined so that
:formula_17
is open.

There is a canonical map that sends a local orientation at &quot;p&quot; to &quot;p&quot;. It is clear that every point of &quot;M&quot; has precisely two preimages under . In fact, is even a local homeomorphism, because the preimages of the open sets &quot;U&quot; mentioned above are homeomorphic to the disjoint union of two copies of &quot;U&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; is orientable, then &quot;M&quot; itself is one of these open sets, so &quot;O&quot; is the disjoint union of two copies of &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; is non-orientable, however, then &quot;O&quot; is connected and orientable. The manifold &quot;O&quot; is called the orientation double cover.

===Manifolds with boundary===

If &quot;M&quot; is a manifold with boundary, then an orientation of &quot;M&quot; is defined to be an orientation of its interior. Such an orientation induces an orientation of ∂&quot;M&quot;. Indeed, suppose that an orientation of &quot;M&quot; is fixed. Let be a chart at a boundary point of &quot;M&quot; which, when restricted to the interior of &quot;M&quot;, is in the chosen oriented atlas. The restriction of this chart to ∂&quot;M&quot; is a chart of ∂&quot;M&quot;. Such charts form an oriented atlas for ∂&quot;M&quot;.

When &quot;M&quot; is smooth, at each point &quot;p&quot; of ∂&quot;M&quot;, the restriction of the tangent bundle of &quot;M&quot; to ∂&quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to , where the factor of R is described by the inward pointing normal vector. The orientation of &quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;∂&quot;M&quot; is defined by the condition that a basis of &quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;∂&quot;M&quot; is positively oriented if and only if it, when combined with the inward pointing normal vector, defines a positively oriented basis of &quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;M&quot;.

==Orientable double cover==

A closely related notion uses the idea of covering space. For a connected manifold formula_18 take formula_19, the set of pairs formula_20 where formula_21 is a point of formula_18 and formula_23 is an orientation at formula_21; here we assume formula_18 is either smooth so we can choose an orientation on the tangent space at a point or we use singular homology to define orientation. Then for every open, oriented subset of formula_18 we consider the corresponding set of pairs and define that to be an open set of formula_19. This gives formula_19 a topology and the projection sending formula_20 to formula_21 is then a 2-to-1 covering map. This covering space is called the orientable double cover, as it is orientable. formula_19 is connected if and only if formula_18 is not orientable.

Another way to construct this cover is to divide the loops based at a basepoint into either orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing loops. The orientation preserving loops generate a subgroup of the fundamental group which is either the whole group or of index two. In the latter case (which means there is an orientation-reversing path), the subgroup corresponds to a connected double covering; this cover is orientable by construction. In the former case, one can simply take two copies of formula_18, each of which corresponds to a different orientation.

==Orientation of vector bundles==

A real vector bundle, which &quot;a priori&quot; has a GL(n) structure group, is called &quot;orientable&quot; when the structure group may be reduced to formula_34, the group of matrices with positive determinant. For the tangent bundle, this reduction is always possible if the underlying base manifold is orientable and in fact this provides a convenient way to define the orientability of a smooth real manifold: a smooth manifold is defined to be orientable if its tangent bundle is orientable (as a vector bundle). Note that as a manifold in its own right, the tangent bundle is &quot;always&quot; orientable, even over nonorientable manifolds.

==Related concepts==

===Lorentzian geometry===

In Lorentzian geometry, there are two kinds of orientability: space orientability and time orientability. These play a role in the causal structure of spacetime. In the context of general relativity, a spacetime manifold is space orientable if, whenever two right-handed observers head off in rocket ships starting at the same spacetime point, and then meet again at another point, they remain right-handed with respect to one another. If a spacetime is time-orientable then the two observers will always agree on the direction of time at both points of their meeting. In fact, a spacetime is time-orientable if and only if any two observers can agree which of the two meetings preceded the other.

Formally, the pseudo-orthogonal group O(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) has a pair of characters: the space orientation character σ+ and the time orientation character σ−,
:formula_35

Their product σ = σ+σ− is the determinant, which gives the orientation character. A space-orientation of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is identified with a section of the associated bundle
:formula_36

where O(&quot;M&quot;) is the bundle of pseudo-orthogonal frames. Similarly, a time orientation is a section of the associated bundle

<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) was a British railway company. It was formed on 1 January 1923 under the Railways Act 1921, which required the grouping of over 120 separate railways into four. The companies merged into the LMS included the London and North Western Railway, the Midland Railway, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (which had previously merged with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922), several Scottish railway companies (including the Caledonian Railway), and numerous other, smaller ventures.

Besides being the world&#x27;s largest transport organisation, the company was also the largest commercial enterprise in the British Empire and the United Kingdom&#x27;s second largest employer, after the Post Office.

In 1938, the LMS operated of railway (excluding its lines in Northern Ireland), but its profitability was generally disappointing, with a rate of return of only 2.7%. Under the Transport Act 1947, along with the other members of the &quot;Big Four&quot; British railway companies (Great Western Railway, London and North Eastern Railway and Southern Railway), the LMS was nationalised on 1 January 1948, becoming part of the state-owned British Railways.

The LMS was the largest of the Big Four railway companies serving routes in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

==Geography==
===Overview===
The Railways Act 1921 created four large railway companies which were in effect geographical monopolies, albeit with competition at their boundaries, and with some lines either reaching into competitor territory, or being jointly operated.

The LMS operated services in and around London, the Midlands, the North West of England, Mid/North Wales and Scotland. The company also operated a separate network of lines in Northern Ireland.

The principal routes were the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line, which had been the main routes of the two largest constituent companies, the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway respectively.

At the time of its creation, the LMS had inherited from the 35 merged companies, a system of 7,000 route miles and 19,000 track miles; accounting for 38.4% of the total mileage of the &#x27;big four&#x27; grouped railways. It was the owner of 9,319 locomotives, 19,000 passenger-carrying vehicles, and 286,000 wagons. It operated more than 10,600 passenger trains and 15,000 goods trains a day, with a total staff of 231,000. In addition to this, the LMS owned 543 miles of canal, 8,950 horses, 17,000 carts, 2,000 motor vehicles, 64 steamboats and 27 docks, and was the owner of 28 hotels.

===Joint lines===

The LMS operated a number of lines jointly with the other main railway companies, a situation which arose when the former joint owners of a route were placed into different post-grouping companies. Most of these were situated at or near the boundaries between two or more of the companies, but there were some notable examples which extended beyond this borderland zone.

Together with the London and North Eastern Railway, the LMS ran the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway network. Exceeding , this was the largest jointly operated network in Great Britain in terms of route mileage, and extended from Peterborough to the East Anglian coast. The M&amp;GN was wholly incorporated into the LNER in 1936.

The LMS also operated a significant joint network with the Southern Railway, in the shape of the former Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. This network connected Bath and Bournemouth, and wound its way through territory nominally allocated to a third railway company, the Great Western.

Through the former Midland Railway holdings, the LMS, together with the Great Northern Railway (Ireland), jointly owned the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee lines.

===Areas of competition===
Being geographically the largest, and the most central of the four main post-grouping railway companies, the LMS shared numerous boundaries with both the LNER and GWR, although its overlap with the Southern Railway was limited due to the general lack of direct routes through London. The SR and the LMS were mainly overlapping on the West London Line.

Competition with the LNER was mainly in terms of the premium London to Scotland traffic, with the rival LMS (West Coast) and LNER (East Coast) routes competing to provide ever better standards of passenger comfort and faster journey times. The LNER also competed with the LMS for traffic between London, the East Midlands, South Yorkshire and Manchester, with the former Midland main line from St Pancras (LMS) and Great Central Main Line from Marylebone (LNER) both providing express, stopping and local services between these destinations.

The London to Birmingham corridor was fiercely contested with the LMS running expresses over its West Coast Main Line via Rugby, and the Great Western running services via Banbury.

===Northern Ireland===

The LMS was also the only one of the Big Four companies to operate rail services in Northern Ireland, serving most major settlements in the region.

On 1 July 1903, the Midland Railway took over the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway and operated it under the name of Midland Railway (Northern Counties Committee). On grouping, the network became part of the LMS, again operating under the name of the Northern Counties Committee, and consisted of of gauge track with a further of gauge line.

===Apparent geographical anomalies===
The expansionist policies of many of the constituent companies which formed the LMS, particularly the Midland Railway and the London and North Western Railway, resulted in the LMS owning or operating a number of lines outside its core geographical area. For instance, in 1912, the Midland Railway had purchased the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway which operated between London Fenchurch Street and Shoeburyness, with a loop serving Tilbury. These lines were automatically included in the LMS Group, along with the rest of the Midland Railway system, which meant that the LMS had a considerable presence in a part of the country (south Essex) which could be said to form part of the natural territory of the LNER. The process of Grouping under the Railways Act did not address geographical anomalies of this kind, although this particular arrangement did provide a competitive choice for residents of Southend, who could take LNER services from Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street or LMS services from Southend Central to Fenchurch Street.

==History==
===Formation===
The LMS was formed from the following major companies:
*Caledonian Railway 1,114.4 miles (1,793 km) route length
*Furness Railway 158 miles (254 km)
*Glasgow and South Western Railway 498.5 miles (802 km)
*Highland Railway 506 miles (814 km)
*London and North Western Railway (including Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, amalgamated 1 January 1922) 2,667.5 miles (4,292.9 km)
*Midland Railway 2,170.75 miles (3,493 km)
*North Staffordshire Railway 220.75 miles (355 km)

There were also some 24 subsidiary railways, leased or worked by the above companies, and a large number of joint railways, including the UK&#x27;s largest Joint Railway, the Midland &amp; Great Northern, and one of the most famous, the Somerset &amp; Dorset. The LMS was the minority partner (with the LNER) in the Cheshire Lines Committee.

In Ireland there were three railways:
* Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway 26.5 miles (42 km)
* Northern Counties Committee 265.25 miles (426 km)
* &quot;Joint Midland and Great Northern of Ireland Railway&quot; 91 miles (146 km), with interests in Ireland
All of the above operated, at least partially, in Northern Ireland

The total route mileage of the LMS in 1923 was 7,790 miles (12,537 km).

===Early history===
The early history of the LMS was dominated by infighting between parties representing its constituent parts, many of whom had previously been commercial and territorial rivals. This was particularly marked in the case of the Midland and the North Western, each of which believed its way was the right – and only – way of doing business. This rivalry was so severe, that stories of connecting trains at Birmingham New Street from the previous LNWR and MR parts of the system, being deliberately made to miss each other persisted even as late as the early 1950s, long after their demise. Many of the senior appointments on the operating side were of former Midland men, such as James Anderson, so that Midland ideas and practices tended to prevail over those of other constituents. For example, the Midland&#x27;s system of traffic control was imposed on a system-wide basis, along with the Midland livery of Crimson Lake for passenger locomotives and rolling stock. Particularly notable, especially after the appointment of Sir Henry Fowler as Chief Mechanical Engineer, was the continuation of the Midland Railway&#x27;s small-engine policy (see Locomotives of the Midland Railway).

The LMS also implemented a novel management structure, breaking with British railway tradition, and mirroring a contemporary management practice more common in the United States, appointing a President and Vice-Presidents. On 4 January 1926, Josiah Stamp was appointed First President of the Executive, the equivalent of a Chief executive in modern organisational structures. He added the role of chairman of the board of directors to his portfolio in January 1927, succeeding Sir Guy Granet.

===The Stanier revolution===
The arrival of the new chief mechanical engineer, William Stanier, who was brought in from the Great Western Railway by Josiah Stamp in 1932, heralded a change. Stanier introduced practices used at the Swindon Works that had been introduced by George Jackson Churchward, such as tapered boilers, long travel valves, and large bearings. His locomotives were not only more powerful, and economical, but they also ended the company&#x27;s internal conflict.

===Nationalisation===
The war-damaged LMS was nationalised in 1948 by the Transport Act 1947, becoming part of British Railways. It formed the London Midland Region and part of the Scottish Region. British Railways transferred the lines in Northern Ireland to the Ulster Transport Authority in 1949. The London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two years after Nationalisation, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. The lines in Great Britain were rationalised through closure in the 1950s to 70s but the main routes survive and some have been developed for 125 mph inter-city services.

==Railway operations==
Despite having widespread interests in a number of commercial areas, the LMS was first and foremost a railway organisation. It operated in all four constituent countries of the United Kingdom, and in England its operations penetrated 32 of the 40 counties. The company operated around 7,000 route miles of railway line, servicing 2,944 goods depots and 2,588 passenger stations, using 291,490 freight vehicles, 20,276 passenger vehicles and 9,914 locomotives. The company directly employed 263,000 staff, and through its annual coal consumption of over six and a half million tons, could claim to indirectly employ a further 26,500 coal miners.

===Commercial organisation===
For nearly ten years after its formation, the LMS had been run using a similar organisational structure to one of its constituents, the Midland Railway. In practice this meant that the commercial managers found themselves subservient to the needs of the operating departments. This changed in 1932 when a major restructuring was completed, replacing the traditional board of directors with an executive headed by a president, supported by vice-presidents each with responsibility for a specific area. Ernest Lemon, who had briefly held the office of Chief Mechanical Engineer pending the arrival of William Stanier became Vice-President (Railway traffic, operating and commercial), with separate chief operating and chief commercial managers of equal status reporting to him. Railway operations were directed by Charles Byrom, a veteran officer of the LNWR, while commercial activities were headed by Ashton Davies, formerly of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

Davies created a commercial research section, increased the sales force and provided them with specialist training. The emphasis of the organisation switched from operators dictating what was reasonable to the commercial managers asking what was possible to maximise sales opportunities. Thirty five district managers were appointed to oversee sales through the company&#x27;s goods depots, passenger stations and key dock facilities. There was even sales representation in the Irish Free State, certain European countries and North America. A monthly newsletter was produced entitled &quot;Quota News&quot;, and trophies were awarded to the best performing districts and salesmen. To provide maximum capacity during times of peak demand, the operating department re-organised maintenance schedules to maximise the availability of locomotives and rolling stock, and trained staff to step into key roles; firemen trained as drivers and locomotive cleaners trained to replace firemen.

Numerous special fares were introduced to encourage travel, develop niche markets and overcome competitors. The cheap day return ticket offered return travel at a price usually equivalent to the single fare, although in areas with rival bus services they were sometimes offered at less than the single fare. Companies holding large freight accounts with the LMS received reduced price season tickets for nominated employees, while commercial travellers, anglers and conveyors of racing pigeons were all tempted with special offers.

Passenger miles rose quite dramatically, from a low point of 6,500 million in 1932 to 8,500 million by 1937, while at the same time the number of coaches required was reduced through improved maintenance and more efficient utilisation. In 1938 it opened a School of Transport in Derby to train its staff in best railway practice.

===Railway posters===
The LMS&#x27;s commercial success in the 1920s resulted in part from the contributions of English painter, Norman Wilkinson. In 1923, Wilkinson advised Superintendent of Advertising and Publicity of the LMS, T.C Jeffrey, to improve rail sales and other LMS services by incorporating fine art into the design of their advertisement posters. In this time, fine art already had a distinguished association in Europe and North America with good taste, longevity and quality. Jeffrey wanted LMS’ commercial image to align with these qualities and therefore accepted Wilkinson&#x27;s advice. For the first series of posters, Wilkinson personally invited 16 of his fellow alumni from the Royal Academy of London to take part. In letter correspondence, Wilkinson outlined the details of the LMS proposal to the artists. The artist fee for each participant was £100. The railway poster would measure 50 X 40 inches. In this area, the artist&#x27;s design would be reproduced as a photolithographic print on double royal satin paper, filling 45 X 35 inches. The mass-produced posters were pasted inside railway stations in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. LMS decided the subject advertised, but choices of style and approach were left to the artist&#x27;s discretion. LMS’ open design brief resulted in a collection of posters that reflected the large capacity of destinations and experiences available with the transport organisation. For the Irish Free State, Wilkinson designed a poster in 1927 encouraging the public to avail of the LMS ferry and connecting boat trains to Ireland. For this promotion, Wilkinson&#x27;s design was accompanied with four posters of Ireland by Belfast modernist painter, Paul Henry. The commercial success of Wilkinson and Jeffrey&#x27;s collaboration manifested between 1924 and 1928, with public sale of 12,000 railway posters. Paul Henry&#x27;s 1925 poster depicting the Gaeltacht region of Connemara in County Galway proved most commercially popular, with 1,500 sales.

===Charter and excursion traffic===

Charter and excursion trains were a significant source of revenue and the LMS became a specialist in the movement of large numbers of people, with locomotives and rolling stock often kept in operation just to service such seasonal traffic. In one year, the LMS ran 43 special trains to take spectators to the Grand National at Aintree, and a further 55 for the Cup Final at Wembley. Longer running events demanded operations on a much larger scale, with the Glasgow Empire Exhibition requiring 1,800 special trains, with a further 1,456 run in connection with the Blackpool Illuminations. The number of people moved was huge, with over 2.2 million holidaymakers arriving in Blackpool between the start of July and the end of September alone. Besides these mass-market events, the company also ran regular tourist excursions to a variety of destinations, such as Oban in the Scottish highlands, Keswick in the English Lake District, and even the First World War battlefields in Belgium, by way of the Tilbury to Dunkerque ferry service and the Belgian railways.

Such was the importance of such excursion traffic that a special department was established in 1929 and oversaw the expansion from 7,500 special trains in that year to nearly 22,000 in 1938.

===Scheduled services===
However important the excursion traffic was, it was the ordinary scheduled services which had to be the focus of efforts to improve the fortunes of the LMS. A number of initiatives were introduced, with the aim of making train travel more attractive and encouraging business growth. Services were accelerated, and better quality rolling stock was introduced and from 24 September 1928 sleeping cars were provided for third class ticket holders for the first time. The effect of these improvements was significant, with receipts from passenger traffic increasing by £2.9 million () between 1932 and 1938.

A number of premium services were offered, culminating in 1937 with the launch of the &quot;Coronation Scot&quot;, which featured streamlined locomotives hauling a nine coach train of specially constructed stock between London Euston and Glasgow Central in six and a half hours.

Most other major cities on the network were linked by trains with names which would become famous in railway circles including the &quot;Thames-Clyde Express&quot; between London St Pancras and Glasgow St Enoch, &quot;The Palatine&quot; between London St Pancras and Manchester Central, &quot;The Irish Mail&quot; from London Euston to Holyhead and the &quot;Pines Express&quot; conveying portions from Liverpool and Manchester to Bournemouth.

===Goods services===
Goods accounted for around 60% of LMS revenue, and was even more varied than passenger services, catering for a range of goods from fresh perishables such as milk, fish and meat through to bulk minerals and small consignments sent point to point between individuals and companies.

Particularly notable were the Toton–Brent coal trains, which took coal from the Nottinghamshire coalfield to London.

==Traction and rolling stock==

===Construction===
The LMS owned and operated a number of railway works, all of which were inherited from constituent companies. Between them these sites constructed locomotives, coaching stock, multiple units and freight wagons, as well as a number of non-rolling stock items required for the everyday running of the railway.

Two facilities were located in Derby, one known as Derby Loco and one as Carriage and Wagon. The former was opened in the 1840s by the North Midland, Midland Counties and Birmingham &amp; Derby railway companies to meet their joint requirements for locomotive, carriage and wagon construction and maintenance. The latter site was opened in the 1860s by the Midland Railway as part of a reorganisation of facilities in Derby and left the original site to concentrate on locomotive manufacture and repair. The Midland Railway also had works at Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, which had been inherited from the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. 

The LNWR also contributed several works sites to the LMS. Crewe Works was opened in 1840 by the Grand Junction Railway and by the time of grouping was the locomotive works for the LNWR. Wolverton works in Buckinghamshire had been established by the London and Birmingham Railway in the 1830s, and since 1862 (when all locomotive works had transferred to Crewe) had been the LNWR&#x27;s carriage works. In 1922, one year prior to the formation of the LMS, the LNWR had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, including their works at Horwich in Lancashire, which had opened in 1886.

St. Rollox railway works, north east of Glasgow, had been built in 1856 by the Caledonian Railway, while Stoke works in Staffordshire were established in 1864 by the North Staffordshire Railway. Both were absorbed into the LMS with their parent companies, and while the former became the main workshops for the Northern Division of the LMS, the latter works were wound down, closing in 1930, all work being transferred to nearby Crewe.

Smaller workshop facilities were also transferred to the LMS by other constituent companies, including at Barrow-in-Furness (Furness Railway), Bow (North London Railway), Kilmarnock (Glasgow and South Western Railway) and Inverness (Highland Railway). The table below shows all major works taken over by the LMS upon formation.

===Locomotives===
===Coaching stock===
The LMS inherited a wide variety of passenger rolling stock from its constituent companies, and appointed Robert Whyte Reid, an ex-Midland Railway man, as the head of its Carriage department. Reid had already started to introduce more efficient carriage building practices at the Derby Carriage and Wagon Works of the Midland Railway prior to grouping and these same practices were soon introduced to the carriage and wagon works of the former LNWR at Wolverton and the L&amp;YR at Newton Heath.

Most railway carriages were constructed by fitting together component parts which had been roughly machined to larger dimensions than required, which were then cut to the required size and joined together by skilled coachbuilders. Reid&#x27;s new method involved the use of templates or &quot;jigs&quot; to mass-produce components to a set pattern and size. Once these had been checked any example of a specific part could be used interchangeably with any other of the same type. The technique was applied to any item which could be manufactured in large numbers (as there were significant costs in producing the initial jigs) such as doors, ventilators, windows and seats.

The natural progression was to streamline the assembly process and the company introduced a method known as Progressive Construction. In this process the mass-produced parts were combined into &quot;unit assemblies&quot;, each of which was a major sub-component of the finished carriage such as side panels, carriage ends or the roof. The workshops were organised on the &quot;flow-line&quot; principle, similar to a modern assembly line, and the unit assemblies were taken to workstations, where the precision machining of the mass-produced parts ensured they all fitted accurately into position, building into a complete carriage as the unit moved along the flow line. The technique was already in use in Derby prior to grouping, and was adopted in Wolverton during 1925, with Newton Heath following two years later. By using this method, the time taken to construct a typical carriage fell from six weeks to six days and by 1931 Derby and Wolverton were able to handle the entire LMS carriage building workload, and production at Newton Heath ceased.

===Goods wagons===
===Livery===
Each of the constituent companies of the LMS had their own liveries for locomotives and rolling stock. The board of directors of the LMS was dominated by former Midland Railway officers, and the company adopted the &quot;crimson lake&quot; livery for coaching stock as had been used by the Midland and Glasgow &amp; South Western Railways prior to grouping (with the North Staffordshire Railway using a very similar shade). The livery worked well, proving to be hard wearing and practical.

===Preservation===
==Technical innovation==

===Electrification===

The LMS operated a number of suburban lines using electric traction, in and around London, Liverpool, Manchester and Lancashire.
Schemes in the London area generally used the four-rail system in use by tube and sub-surface railways (such as the Metropolitan Railway). Lines from Bow to Barking, Euston to Watford Junction, Broad Street to Richmond and a number of related branches and connecting lines were already electrified when the LMS came into existence, although the LMS did extend electrification from Barking to Upminster in 1932.

In the Liverpool area, lines were electrified using a third rail, energised at 630 V DC. Routes from to and and from Aintree to were already completed prior to the formation of the LMS. Lines from to and were added to this network in 1938.

In Manchester, the line from Bury to Manchester Victoria had already been electrified by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway using a side-contact, third rail system. In conjunction with the LNER, the lines of the former Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway were electrified using the 1500 V DC overhead line system, opening on 11 May 1931.

Finally the route between and Heysham via had been electrified by the Midland Railway using a 6600 V AC overhead system, as early as 1908.

===All-steel carriages===
In 1926, the LMS introduced its &quot;all-steel carriage&quot;, which represented a significant departure from previous carriage construction. Previously carriages had been built with wood or steel-plated wood bodies, mounted on heavy underframes. The all-steel carriages differed in that they consisted of a steel tube or box girder, which not only formed the body but also formed the load-bearing part of the carriage, meaning that a heavy underframe was not required. The new technique also meant that the carriages were stronger under collision conditions, as proved during an accident at Dinwoodie – Wamphray on 25 October 1928 when the leading &quot;all-steel&quot; carriage absorbed most of the impact. Construction of the carriages was carried out for the LMS by external companies, largely to provide work for them during a difficult economic period, but within a couple of years the company returned to more conventional construction methods, as it could no longer justify using external contractors due to efficiency improvements within its own workshops, which were set up to produce carriages of more traditional configuration.

==Accidents==
*On 5 July 1923, an express passenger train was in a rear-end collision with a goods train at . Four people were killed.
*On 26 April 1924, an electric multiple unit overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with an excursion train at station, London.
*On 4 November 1924, an express passenger train was derailed near Lytham St. Annes, Lancashire due to a broken tyre on the locomotive. Fourteen people were killed.
*On 8 September 1926, a passenger train was unable to stop at Leeds Wellington station due to greasy rails after a thunderstorm. It crashed through the buffers and ended up in building. There were no injuries.
*On 19 November 1926, a private owner wagon of a goods train disintegrated near station, Yorkshire, derailing the goods train that it was part of. A signal post was partially knocked over, obstructing the adjacent line. An express passenger train had the sides of its carriages ripped open by the signal post, killing eleven people. A direct consequence of this accident was that private owner wagons had to be registered with railway companies before they were allowed to run on main lines. They were also subject to a detailed inspection every ten years.
*On 30 November 1926, a passenger train overran signals at Upney, Essex and was in a rear-end collision with another. Of 604 people injured, only four are hospitalised.

*On 28 September 1934, an express passenger train was in a rear-end collision with a passenger train at Winwick Junction, Cheshire due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Eleven people were killed and nineteen were injured.
*On 25 February 1935, a passenger train was derailed at Ashton under Hill due to a combination of locomotive design, speed and track condition. One person was killed.
*On 13 March 1935, an express meat train from Liverpool to London was brought to a halt at Kings Langley due to a defective vacuum brake. Due to a signalman&#x27;s error a milk train ran into its rear. Wreckage spread across all four lines, with the result that a few minutes later the Camden to Holyhead freight collided with the debris, followed a few seconds later by the Toton to Willesden coal train. All four lines were blocked for some time and the driver of the milk train was killed. Contemporaneous newsreel footage shows the aftermath of the four-fold accident.

==Non-railway interests==

===Canals===
The LMS owned many canals, originally acquired by some of its constituent companies in the 19th century, such as the Shropshire Union group (which included the Montgomeryshire Canal, Ellesmere Canal and Chester Canal), originally owned by the London &amp; North Western Railway, and the Trent and Mersey Canal, owned by the North Staffordshire Railway. Many were abandoned by Act of Parliament, instigated by LMS, although those surviving in 1948 passed to the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive of the British Transport Commission, and eventually to the British Waterways Board.

===Shipping===

The LMS acquired numerous docks, harbours and piers from its predecessors. These ranged in size from major ports at Barrow-in-Furness and Grangemouth through ferry harbours such as Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Fleetwood to much smaller facilities including piers on the Thames and Clyde. The LMS also inherited steamers and piers from the Furness Railway on Windermere and Coniston Water.

Ships inherited from the Midland Railway.
The LMS also inherited docks at Goole.

===Road transport===
In 1933, along with the other three main line railways, the LMS purchased the Hay&#x27;s Wharf Cartage Company Ltd., the owners of Pickfords, and Carter Paterson. Subsequently, the LMS acquired Joseph Nall &amp; Co. of Manchester and a 51% stake in Wordie &amp; Co. of Glasgow. The LMS operated a road haulage fleet consisting of 29,754 road vehicles.

===Hotels===

The LMS Hotels &amp; Catering Service, apart from providing catering cars on trains and refreshment facilities at stations also operated a chain of nearly 30 hotels throughout the United Kingdom. Just prior to World War II the department employed 8,000 staff, served over 50 million customers per annum and grossed more than £3 million in receipts () from the combined hotel and catering operations. The scale of the undertaking enabled the LMS to claim that they operated the largest chain of hotels in the British Empire.

The range of hotels was extensive ranging from large resort and city centre hotels to much smaller provincial establishments. One of the most famous was the Midland Hotel in Morecambe, which had been rebuilt as an Art Deco landmark, as had the Queens Hotel in Leeds. While most were open all year round, a number opened for only particular months in the year, to coincide with local tourist seasons.

==Legacy==
 The name of the LMS was revived by Govia in the form of the train operating company London Midland which operated services primarily around the West Midlands and services north to Liverpool Lime Street and south to London Euston between 2007 and 2017.

LMS was trademarked by the Department for Transport on 14 November 2017 sparking speculation of the name becoming the long term branding for the new InterCity West Coast Partnership franchise, which is scheduled to commence operations on 8 December 2019, branded as Avanti West Coast.

<text>Gustave Caillebotte (; 19 August 1848 – 21 February 1894) was a French painter who was a member and patron of the Impressionists, although he painted in a more realistic manner than many others in the group. Caillebotte was known for his early interest in photography as an art form.

==Early life==

Gustave Caillebotte was born on 19 August 1848 to an upper-class Parisian family living in the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis. His father, Martial Caillebotte (1799–1874), was the inheritor of the family&#x27;s military textile business and was also a judge at the Tribunal de commerce de la Seine. Caillebotte&#x27;s father was twice widowed before marrying Caillebotte&#x27;s mother, Céleste Daufresne (1819–1878), who had two more sons after Gustave: René (1851–1876) and Martial (1853–1910). 

Caillebotte earned a law degree in 1868 and a license to practice law in 1870, and he also was an engineer. Shortly after his education, he was drafted to fight in the Franco-Prussian war, and served from July 1870 to March 1871 in the &quot;Garde Nationale Mobile de la Seine&quot;.

==Artistic life==
===Development===
After the war, Caillebotte began visiting the studio of the painter Léon Bonnat, where he began to study painting seriously. He then developed an accomplished style in a relatively short time and had his first studio in his parents&#x27; home. In 1873, Caillebotte entered the , but apparently did not spend much time there. He inherited his father&#x27;s fortune in 1874 and the surviving sons divided the family fortune after their mother&#x27;s death in 1878. Gustave and his brother sold the Yerres estate and moved into an apartment on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris.

Around 1874, Caillebotte had met and befriended several artists working outside the Académie des Beaux-Arts, including Edgar Degas and Giuseppe de Nittis, and attended (but did not participate in) the First Impressionist Exhibition of 1874. The &quot;Impressionists&quot; – also called the &quot;Independents&quot;, &quot;Intransigents&quot;, and &quot;Intentionalists&quot; – had broken away from the academic painters showing in the annual Salons.

Caillebotte made his debut in the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, showing eight paintings, including &quot;Les raboteurs de parquet&quot; (&quot;The Floor Scrapers&quot;) (1875), his earliest masterpiece. Its subject matter, the depiction of labourers preparing a wooden floor (thought to have been that of the artist&#x27;s own studio) was considered &quot;vulgar&quot; by some critics and this is the probable reason for its rejection by the Salon of 1875. At the time, the art establishment deemed only rustic peasants or farmers acceptable subjects from the working class.

===Style===

In common with his precursors Jean-François Millet and Gustave Courbet, as well his contemporary Degas, Caillebotte aimed to paint reality as it existed and as he saw it, hoping to reduce the inherent theatricality of painting. Perhaps because of his close relationship with so many of his peers, his style and technique vary considerably among his works, as if &quot;borrowing&quot; and experimenting, but not really sticking to any one style. At times, he seems very much in the Degas camp of rich-colored realism (especially his interior scenes); at other times, he shares the Impressionist commitment to &quot;optical truth&quot; and employs an impressionistic pastel-softness and loose brush strokes most similar to Renoir and Pissarro, although with a less vibrant palette.

The tilted ground common to these paintings is characteristic of Caillebotte&#x27;s work, which may have been strongly influenced by Japanese prints and the new technology of photography, although evidence of his use of photography is lacking. Cropping and &quot;zooming-in&quot;, techniques that commonly are found in Caillebotte&#x27;s oeuvre, may also be the result of his interest in photography, but may just as likely be derived from his intense interest in perspective effects. A large number of Caillebotte&#x27;s works also employ a very high vantage point, including &quot;View of Rooftops (Snow) (Vue de toits (Effet de neige))&quot; (1878), &quot;Boulevard Seen from Above (Boulevard vu d&#x27;en haut)&quot; (1880), and &quot;A Traffic Island (Un refuge, boulevard Haussmann)&quot; (1880).

===Themes===
Caillebotte painted many domestic and familial scenes, interiors, and portraits. Many of his paintings depict members of his family; &quot;Young Man at His Window (Jeune Homme à la fenêtre)&quot; (1876) shows René in the home on rue de Miromesnil; &quot;The Orange Trees (Les Orangers)&quot; (1878), depicts Martial Jr. and his cousin Zoé in the garden of the family property at Yerres; and &quot;Portraits in the Country (Portraits à la campagne)&quot; (1875) includes Caillebotte&#x27;s mother along with his aunt, cousin, and a family friend. There are scenes of dining, card playing, piano playing, reading, and sewing, all executed in an intimate, unobtrusive manner that portrays the quiet ritual of upper-class indoor life.

His country scenes at Yerres focus on pleasure boating on the leisurely stream as well as fishing and swimming, and domestic scenes around his country home. He often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of Renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside, in sharp contrast to the flatter, smoother strokes of his urban paintings. In &quot;Oarsman in a Top Hat&quot; (1877), he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger in the back of a rowboat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead, in a manner much more realistic and involving than Manet&#x27;s &quot;Boating&quot; (1874).

Caillebotte is best known for his paintings of urban Paris, such as &quot;The Europe Bridge&quot; (&quot;Le Pont de l&#x27;Europe&quot;) (1876), and &quot;Paris Street; Rainy Day&quot; (&quot;Rue de Paris; temps de pluie&quot;, also known as &quot;La Place de l&#x27;Europe, temps de pluie)&quot; (1877). The latter is almost unique among his works for its particularly flat colors and photo-realistic effect, which give the painting its distinctive and modern look, almost akin to American Realists such as Edward Hopper. Many of his urban paintings were quite controversial due to their exaggerated, plunging perspective. In &quot;Man on a Balcony&quot; (1880), he invites the viewer to share the balcony with his subject and join in observing the scene of the city reaching into the distance, again by using unusual perspective. Showing little allegiance to any one style, many of Caillebotte&#x27;s other urban paintings produced in the same period, such as &quot;The Place Saint-Augustin&quot; (1877), are considerably more impressionistic.

Caillebotte&#x27;s still life paintings focus primarily on food, some at table ready to be eaten and some ready to be purchased, as in a series of paintings he made of meat at a butcher shop. He also produced some floral still-life paintings, particularly in the 1890s. Rounding out his subject matter, he painted a few nudes, including &quot;Homme au bain&quot; (1884) and &quot;Nude on a Couch&quot; (1882), which, although provocative in its realism, is ambivalent in its mood—neither overtly erotic nor suggestive of mythology—themes common to many nude paintings of women during that era.

==Later life==

In 1881, Caillebotte acquired a property at Petit-Gennevilliers, on the banks of the Seine near Argenteuil, and he moved there permanently in 1888. He ceased showing his work at age 34 and devoted himself to gardening and to building and racing yachts, and he spent much time with his brother, Martial, and his friend Auguste Renoir. Renoir often came to stay at Petit-Gennevilliers, and engaged in far-ranging discussions on art, politics, literature, and philosophy. Caillebotte was a model for Renoir&#x27;s 1881 painting, &quot;Luncheon of the Boating Party&quot;. Although he never married, Caillebotte appears to have had a serious relationship with Charlotte Berthier, a woman eleven years his junior and of the lower class, to whom he left a sizeable annuity.

While Caillebotte was known for his urban and domestic scenes, he also painted many rural scenes of the area around his home in the years before his death.

Caillebotte&#x27;s painting career slowed dramatically in the early 1890s when he stopped working on large canvases. Caillebotte died of pulmonary congestion while working in his garden at Petit-Gennevilliers in 1894 at age 45. He was interred at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

For many years, and partly because he never had to sell his work to support himself, Caillebotte&#x27;s reputation as a painter was overshadowed by his recognition as a supporter of the arts. Seventy years after his death, however, art historians began reevaluating his artistic contributions. His striking use of varying perspective sets him apart from his peers who may have otherwise surpassed him. His art was largely forgotten until the 1950s when his descendants began to sell the family collection. In 1964, The Art Institute of Chicago acquired &quot;Paris Street; Rainy Day&quot;, spurring American interest in him. By the 1970s, his works were being exhibited again and critically reassessed.

The National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.) and the Kimbell Art Museum (Fort Worth, Texas) organized a major retrospective display of Caillebotte&#x27;s painting for exhibition in 2015–2016.

==Patron and collector==

Caillebotte&#x27;s sizable allowance, along with the inheritance he received after the death of his father in 1874 and his mother in 1878, allowed him to paint without the pressure to sell his work. It also allowed him to help fund Impressionist exhibitions and support his fellow artists and friends (Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro among others) by purchasing their works and, at least in the case of Monet, paying the rent for their studios.

Caillebotte bought his first Monet in 1875 and was especially helpful to that artist&#x27;s career and financial survival. He was precise in his sponsorship; notably absent are works by Georges Seurat and Paul Gauguin, or any of the Symbolists. In 1890, he played a major role in assisting Claude Monet in organizing a public subscription and in persuading the French state to purchase Édouard Manet&#x27;s 1863 &quot;Olympia&quot;.

==2024 Exhibition at Musée d&#x27;Orsay==
In 2024, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay hosted an exhibition examining how Gustave Caillebotte depicted men in unconventional ways, hinting at his possible homosexuality. The exhibition’s introductory texts highlight how Caillebotte portrayed men in domestic, often intimate settings typically reserved for women in the 19th century. His male subjects are shown with striking realism in everyday activities—bathing, rowing, lounging, and even defecating. A curator remarked on the radical nature of his work: “His subject matter is very radical during the time, because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men... It’s the elephant in the room. It’s what makes him so different.”
 However, this parti-pris of the Orsay exhibition has been disputed by some art critics in French newspapers such as Le Monde. 

==Other interests==
In addition, Caillebotte used his wealth to fund hobbies for which he was quite passionate, including stamp collecting, orchid growing, yacht building, and even textile design (the women in his paintings &quot;Madame Boissière Knitting&quot;, 1877, and &quot;Portrait of Madame Caillebotte&quot;, 1877, may be working on patterns created by Caillebotte). After his death, he was inscribed in the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists, and the collection he formed with his brother Martial is now in the British Library.

==Caillebotte&#x27;s collection==

Convinced after the death in 1876 of his younger brother René that his own life would be short, Caillebotte wrote his will while still in his twenties. In the will, Caillebotte bequeathed a large collection to the French government. This collection of sixty-eight paintings, included works by Camille Pissarro (nineteen), Claude Monet (fourteen), Pierre-Auguste Renoir (ten), Alfred Sisley (nine), Edgar Degas (seven), Paul Cézanne (five), and Édouard Manet (four).

At the time of Caillebotte&#x27;s death, the Impressionists were still largely condemned by the art establishment in France, which remained dominated by Academic art and specifically, the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Because of this, Caillebotte realised that the cultural treasures in his collection would likely disappear into &quot;attics&quot; and &quot;provincial museums&quot;. He therefore stipulated that they must be displayed in the Luxembourg Palace (devoted to the work of living artists), and then in the Louvre. The French government would not agree to these terms. In February 1896, they finally negotiated terms with Renoir, who was the executor of the will, under which they took thirty-eight of the paintings to the Luxembourg Palace. The installation constituted the first presentation of the Impressionists in a public venue in France. The remaining twenty-nine paintings (one by Degas was taken by Renoir in payment for his services as executor) were offered to the French government twice again, in 1904 and 1908, and were both times refused. When the government finally attempted to claim them in 1928, the bequest was repudiated by the widow of Caillebotte&#x27;s brother Martial Caillebotte. One of the remaining works, &quot;Bathers at Rest&quot;, was purchased by Albert C. Barnes and is now held by the Barnes Foundation. Forty of Caillebotte&#x27;s own works are held by the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. His &quot;Man on a Balcony, Boulevard Haussmann (Homme au balcon, boulevard Haussmann)&quot; (1880), sold for more than US$14.3 million in 2000.

<doc id="187461" wikidata="Q192288" url="?curid=187461" title="Lenz's law">
<text>Lenz&#x27;s law states that the direction of the electric current induced in a conductor by a changing magnetic field is such that the magnetic field created by the induced current opposes changes in the initial magnetic field. It is named after physicist Heinrich Lenz, who formulated it in 1834.

The Induced current is the current generated in a wire due to change in magnetic flux. An example of the induced current is the current produced in the generator which involves rapidly rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field. 

It is a qualitative law that specifies the direction of induced current, but states nothing about its magnitude. Lenz&#x27;s law predicts the direction of many effects in electromagnetism, such as the direction of voltage induced in an inductor or wire loop by a changing current, or the drag force of eddy currents exerted on moving objects in the magnetic field.

Lenz&#x27;s law may be seen as analogous to Newton&#x27;s third law in classical mechanics&lt;ref name=&quot;Electromagnetics explained:
a handbook for wireless/RF, EMC, and high-speed electronics&quot;&gt;Schmitt, Ron. &quot;Electromagnetics explained&quot;. 2002. Retrieved 16 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle in chemistry.

==Definition==
Lenz&#x27;s law states that:
The current induced in a circuit due to a change in a magnetic field is directed to oppose the change in flux and to exert a mechanical force which opposes the motion.

Lenz&#x27;s law is contained in the rigorous treatment of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction (the magnitude of EMF induced in a coil is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux), where it finds expression by the negative sign:

formula_1

which indicates that the induced electromotive force formula_2 and the rate of change in magnetic flux formula_3 have opposite signs. 

This means that the direction of the back EMF of an induced field opposes the changing current that is its cause. D.J. Griffiths summarized it as follows: &quot;Nature abhors a change in flux.&quot;

If a change in the magnetic field of current &quot;i&quot;1 induces another electric current, &quot;i&quot;2, the direction of &quot;i&quot;2 is opposite that of the change in &quot;i&quot;1. If these currents are in two coaxial circular conductors &quot;ℓ&quot;1 and &quot;ℓ&quot;2 respectively, and both are initially 0, then the currents &quot;i&quot;1 and &quot;i&quot;2 must counter-rotate. The opposing currents will repel each other as a result.
===Example===
Magnetic fields from strong magnets can create counter-rotating currents in a copper or aluminium pipe. This is shown by dropping the magnet through the pipe. The descent of the magnet inside the pipe is observably slower than when dropped outside the pipe.

When a voltage is generated by a change in magnetic flux according to Faraday&#x27;s law, the polarity of the induced voltage is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it. The induced magnetic field inside any loop of wire always acts to keep the magnetic flux in the loop constant. The direction of an induced current can be determined using the right-hand rule to show which direction of current flow would create a magnetic field that would oppose the direction of changing flux through the loop. In the examples above, if the flux is increasing, the induced field acts in opposition to it. If it is decreasing, the induced field acts in the direction of the applied field to oppose the change.

==Detailed interaction of charges in these currents==

In electromagnetism, when charges move along electric field lines work is done on them, whether it involves storing potential energy (negative work) or increasing kinetic energy (positive work).

When net positive work is applied to a charge &quot;q&quot;1, it gains speed and momentum. The net work on &quot;q&quot;1 thereby generates a magnetic field whose strength (in units of magnetic flux density (1 tesla = 1 volt-second per square meter)) is proportional to the speed increase of &quot;q&quot;1. This magnetic field can interact with a neighboring charge &quot;q&quot;2, passing on this momentum to it, and in return, &quot;q&quot;1 loses momentum.

The charge &quot;q&quot;2 can also act on &quot;q&quot;1 in a similar manner, by which it returns some of the momentum that it received from &quot;q&quot;1. This back-and-forth component of momentum contributes to magnetic inductance. The closer that &quot;q&quot;1 and &quot;q&quot;2 are, the greater the effect. When &quot;q&quot;2 is inside a conductive medium such as a thick slab made of copper or aluminum, it more readily responds to the force applied to it by &quot;q&quot;1. The energy of &quot;q&quot;1 is not instantly consumed as heat generated by the current of &quot;q&quot;2 but is also stored in &quot;two&quot; opposing magnetic fields. The energy density of magnetic fields tends to vary with the square of the magnetic field&#x27;s intensity; however, in the case of magnetically non-linear materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, this relationship breaks down.

==Conservation of momentum==
Momentum must be conserved in the process, so if &quot;q&quot;1 is pushed in one direction, then &quot;q&quot;2 ought to be pushed in the other direction by the same force at the same time. However, the situation becomes more complicated when the finite speed of electromagnetic wave propagation is introduced (see retarded potential). This means that for a brief period the total momentum of the two charges is not conserved, implying that the difference should be accounted for by momentum in the fields, as asserted by Richard P. Feynman. Famous 19th century electrodynamicist James Clerk Maxwell called this the &quot;electromagnetic momentum&quot;. Yet, such a treatment of fields may be necessary when Lenz&#x27;s law is applied to opposite charges. It is normally assumed that the charges in question have the same sign. If they do not, such as a proton and an electron, the interaction is different. An electron generating a magnetic field would generate an EMF that causes a proton to accelerate in the same direction as the electron. At first, this might seem to violate the law of conservation of momentum, but such an interaction is seen to conserve momentum if the momentum of electromagnetic fields is taken into account.

<text>Sex appeal in advertising is a common tactic employed to promote products and services. Research indicates that sexually appealing content, including imagery, is often used to shape or alter the consumer&#x27;s perception of a brand, even if it is not directly related to the product or service being advertised. This approach, known as &quot;sex sells,&quot; has become more prevalent among companies, leading to controversies surrounding the use of sexual campaigns in advertising.

Contemporary mainstream advertising, across various media platforms such as magazines, online, and television, frequently incorporates sexual elements to market a wide range of branded goods and services. Provocative images of attractively dressed men and women are commonly used to promote clothing, alcohol, beauty products, and fragrances. Renowned brands like Calvin Klein, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, and Pepsi use such imagery to cultivate an alluring media presence.

In some cases, sexual content is overtly displayed, while in others, it is subtly integrated with imperceptible cues aimed at influencing the target audience. Furthermore, sexual content has been employed to promote mainstream products that were not traditionally associated with sex. For instance, the Dallas Opera&#x27;s marketing of the more suggestive aspects of its performances is believed to have contributed to a boost in ticket sales.

The effectiveness of sex appeal in advertising varies depending on the cultural context and the gender of the recipient, though these aspects are subject to further research and discussion.

==Concept==
&quot;Gender Advertisements&quot;, a 1979 book by Canadian social anthropologist Erving Goffman, is a series of studies of visual communication and how gender representation in advertising communicates subtle, underlying messages about the sexual roles projected by masculine and feminine images in advertising. The book is a visual essay about sex roles in advertising and the symbolism implied in the depictions of men and women in advertising.

When couples are used in an advertisement, the sex roles played by each partner also sends out messages. The interaction of the couple may send out a message of relative dominance and power, and may stereotype the roles of one or both partners. Usually the message is very subtle, and sometimes advertisements attract interest by changing stereotypical roles. For example, companies including Spotify, Airbnb, Lynx and Amazon.com have used same-sex couples in adverts. These adverts appeal to same-sex couples; they also create the image that these companies are tolerant, allowing them to appeal to a wider consumer audience.

As many consumers and professionals are thinking people, sex may be used to grab a viewer&#x27;s attention, but this is likely short-term success. Whether using sex in advertising is effective depends on the product. About three-quarters of advertisements using sex to sell the product are communicating a product-related benefit, such as the product making its users more sexually attractive. 

Daily exposure on social media by adolescents to these types of influences can affect their development. Younger teenage girls are drawn to these ads in order to learn about romance and relationships. 

Correlational studies have linked sociodemographic variables to adolescent viewing habits. This can include (but not limited to) sex, age, and even ethnicity. Adolescents who watch and listen to a lot of media are more likely than less regular audiences to consider stereotypes of sex roles on TV as realistic.

==Types==
===Physical attractiveness===
The use of physically attractive models in advertising is a form of sex in advertising. Physical attractiveness can be conveyed through facial beauty, physique, hair, skin complexion as well as by the model&#x27;s inferred personality. This form of sex in advertising is effective as it draws attention and influences the overall feeling of the ad. Furthermore, such ads create an association between physical attractiveness and the product which sends a message to the consumer that buying and using the product will help them achieve that physique. The sexual arousal possibly elicited by physical attractiveness in adverts is thought to transfer onto the advertised product.

===Sexual behavior===
Marketers often use tactics such as sexual imagery in their advertisements to capture the consumer&#x27;s attention for longer. Sex in advertising is also incorporated using hints of sexual behavior. The latter is communicated by the models using flirtatious body language, open posture and making eye contact with the viewer. Sexual behavior can also be displayed using several models interacting in a more or less sexual way. Sexual behavior in advertising is used to arouse sexual interest from the viewer. Research has shown that sexual arousal elicited by an advert subsequently affects the overall ad evaluation and the chances of future purchase.

For example, in a Guess clothing advert, while the models are physically attractive, it is their behavior such as position, posture and facial expressions that communicate sexual interest to the viewer. Women are often shown as being shorter, put in the background of images, shown in more &#x27;feminine&#x27; poses than men, and generally present a higher degree of &#x27;body display&#x27; than men in print advertisements.

===Sexual embeds===
Sexual embeds are a controversial form of sex in advertising. They are a powerful technique that advertising agencies do not want consumers to consciously notice. They are subliminal elements that are detected as sexual information solely at the subconscious level. Sexual embeds can take the form of objects or words that, at the subconscious level (or when occasionally consciously identified) explicitly depict sexual acts or genitalia. For example, a perfume bottle could mimic a phallic shape and its positioning could suggest sexual intercourse. Embeds are especially effective as they unconsciously trigger sexual arousal in the consumer which drives motivation and goal directed behavior such as purchase intention.

===Gender roles===
After women achieved the vote in the United States, Britain and Canada in the 1920s, advertising agencies exploited the new status of women. For example, they associated driving an automobile with masculinity, power, control, and dominance over a beautiful woman sitting alongside. More subtly, they published automobile ads in women&#x27;s magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were in fact men. The new ads promoted themes of women&#x27;s liberation while also delineating the limits of this freedom. Automobiles were more than practical devices, they were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility and modernity. The ads offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women.

==History==


The earliest known use of sex in advertising is by the Pearl Tobacco brand in 1871, which featured a naked maiden on the package cover. In 1885, W. Duke &amp; Sons inserted trading cards into cigarette packs that featured sexually provocative starlets. Duke grew to become the leading American cigarette brand by 1890.

Other early forms of sex appeal in advertising include woodcuts and illustrations of attractive women (often unclothed from the waist up) adorning posters, signs, and ads for saloons, tonics, and tobacco. In several notable cases, sex in advertising has been claimed as the reason for increased consumer interest and sales.

===Sex and soap===
Woodbury&#x27;s Facial Soap, a woman&#x27;s beauty bar, was almost discontinued in 1911. The soap&#x27;s sales decline was reversed, however, with ads containing images of romantic couples and promises of love and intimacy for those using the brand. Jōvan Musk Oil, introduced in 1971, was promoted with sexual entendre and descriptions of the fragrance&#x27;s sexual attraction properties. As a result, Jōvan, Inc.&#x27;s revenue grew from $1.5 million in 1971 to $77 million by 1978.

===Kamasutra condoms in India===
In 1991, J.K. Chemicals Group asked the Bombay office of Lintas Bombay to develop a campaign for a new condom brand. The problem was that in the late 1940s, the Nehru government had launched a major population limitation program to reduce India&#x27;s birthrate. The program was very heavy-handed, using coercion, and demanding that men use condoms. The product therefore signified an oppressive governmental intrusion. The agency head hit on the idea of a pleasurable condom, &quot;So when the user hears the brand name, he says, &quot;Wow. It&#x27;s a turn on. Not a turn off.&quot; A brainstorming session hit on the name &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, which refers to an ancient Sanskrit treatise on lovemaking and the sculptures at temples that illustrate the positions involved. The term was known to well-educated Indians, the intended audience. Correctly predicting the huge impact the campaign would have, the agency purchased all the advertising space in the popular glamour magazine &quot;Debonair&quot; and filled it with erotic images of Bollywood actors and actresses promoting Kamasutra condoms. A television commercial followed featuring a steamy shower scene. The television ad was censored but the print campaign proved highly successful.

===Benetton===
The Italian clothing company Benetton gained worldwide attention in the late 20th century for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director Oliviero Toscani. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign &quot;United Colors of Benetton&quot; then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.

===Calvin Klein – sex and jeans===
Calvin Klein of Calvin Klein Jeans has been at the forefront of this movement to use sex in advertising, having claimed, &quot;Jeans are about sex. The abundance of bare flesh is the last gasp of advertisers trying to give redundant products a new identity.&quot; Calvin Klein&#x27;s first controversial jeans advertisement showed a 15-year-old Brooke Shields, in Calvin Klein jeans, saying, &quot;Do you want to know what gets between me and my Calvins? Nothing.&quot; Calvin Klein has also received media attention for its controversial advertisements in the mid-1990s. Several of Calvin Klein&#x27;s advertisements featured images of teenage models, some &quot;who were reportedly as young as 15&quot; in overly sexual and provocative poses. Although Klein insisted that these advertisements were not pornographic, some considered the campaign as a form of &quot;soft porn&quot; or &quot;kiddie porn&quot; that was exploitative, shocking, and suggestive. In 1999, Calvin Klein was the subject of more controversy when it aired advertisements of young children who were only wearing the brand&#x27;s underwear. This &quot;kiddie underwear ad campaign&quot; was pulled only one day after it aired as a result of public backlash. A spokesperson from Calvin Klein insisted that these ads were intended &quot;to capture the same warmth and spontaneity that you find in a family snapshot.&quot;

===The film industry===
Film studios often make use of provocative movie posters in order to increase publicity and draw in larger audiences. One example is the iconic poster for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, in which Uma Thurman lies on her front, wearing a low-cut top and stilettos and smoking a cigarette despite the fact that, in the actual movie, she wears a button-down shirt that is far less revealing.
The idea that &quot;sex sells&quot; has also led to film studios going a step further - rather than dressing female stars in a certain way simply to promote the movie, they base their actual costume design around this concept. For example, in the 2004 film &quot;Catwoman&quot;, Halle Berry simply wore a black push-up bra with S&amp;M inspired straps, heavily ripped leather trousers and heels with a cat mask and whip, which commentators said &quot;oozed overt [...] sexuality&quot;. This costume was a move away from Catwoman&#x27;s skin-tight black suit that she wears for the majority of her appearances within DC Comics and thus, despite being entirely more revealing, was actually not a popular decision among fans of the character.

==Effectiveness==

===Effective use===
Gallup &amp; Robinson, an advertising and marketing research firm, has reported that in more than 50 years of testing advertising effectiveness, it has found the use of the erotic to be a significantly above-average technique in communicating with the marketplace, &quot;...although one of the more dangerous for the advertiser. Weighted down with taboos and volatile attitudes, sex is a Code Red advertising technique ... handle with care ... seller beware; all of which makes it even more intriguing.&quot; This research has led to the popular idea that &quot;sex sells&quot;.

Marketing strategies centered around sex have been successful. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch used sex to market their brand in a variety of ways, including store greeters dressed only in underwear, models working in store and topless models on the bags. Employees were hired based on physical attractiveness. This strategy was aimed at teenagers and young adults, who are the most impressionable consumer group and have significant disposable income. During the late 1990s, the company produced a magazine/catalogue (magalog), featuring semi-nude or nude models. The magalog was a success, with A&amp;F issuing over 1.5 million copies. The use of sexual branding raised their revenue from $85 million in 1993 to $1.35 billion in 2002. A&amp;F have expressed that they will move away from sexual marketing, and focus on showcasing product and trends.

Sexuality in advertising is extremely effective at attracting the consumer&#x27;s attention and once it has their attention, to remember the message. This solves the greatest problem in advertising of getting the potential buyer to look at and remember the advertisement. However, the introduction of attraction and especially sexuality into an ad often distracts from the original message and can cause an adverse effect of the consumer wanting to take action.

=== Ineffective use ===
There are some studies that contradict the theory that sex is an effective tool for improving finances and gathering attention. A study from 2009 found that there was a negative correlation between nudity and sexuality in movies, and box office performance and critical acclaim. A 2005 research by MediaAnalyzer has found that less than 10% of men recalled the brand of sexual ads, compared to more than 19% of non sexual ads; a similar result was found in women (10.8% vs. 22.3%). It is hypothesized by that survey, that this is a result of a general numbing caused by overuse of sexual stimuli in advertising.

In another experimental study conducted on 324 undergraduate college students, Brad Bushman, professor and Chair of Mass Communication at Ohio State University, examined brand recall for neutral, sexual or violent commercials embedded in neutral, sexual or violent TV programs. He found that brand recall was higher for participants who saw neutral TV programs and neutral commercials versus those who saw sexual or violent commercials embedded in sexual or violent TV programs. Other studies have found that sex in television is extremely overrated and does not sell products in ads. Unless sex is related to the product (such as beauty, health or hygiene products), there is no clear effect.

Using sex may attract one market demographic while repelling another at the same time. The overt use of sexuality to promote breast cancer awareness, through fundraising campaigns like &quot;I Love Boobies&quot; and &quot;Save the Ta-tas&quot;, is effective at reaching younger women, who are at low risk of developing breast cancer, but angers and offends some breast cancer survivors and older women, who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer.

In addition, sexually objectified content fails to achieve its goal of brand recall, a 2020 study by Vargas &amp; Mensa shows. Despite the use of sex in marketing to influence men, the 2020 Vargas &amp; Mensa study highlights that young women are more influenced; thus, the approach can be ineffective when directed towards male products.

=== Gender differences ===

Recent research indicates that the use of sexual images of females in ads negatively affects women&#x27;s interest. Research shows that females were more likely than males to be portrayed as nude, wearing sexual clothing or only a partial amount of clothing. A study from the University of Minnesota in 2013 of how printed ads with sexual content affects women clearly showed that women are not attracted to them except in the case of products being luxurious and expensive. Besides alienating women, there is a serious risk that the audience in general will reduce support for organisations that uses the sexual images of women without a legitimate reason.

Further research found that men have a positive attitude to sexual adverts, whereas women have a negative response to them; this study used an advert with both a male and female. This was thought to be because women had lower average sex drives than men. Another theory for this difference is that evolution has led men to seek casual sex, contrary to women who value commitment and intimacy in the context of a sexual relationship. In adverts sex tends to be represented in its own right and not as part of a relationship leading to the difference in responses. This theory is supported by research which found that women respond less negatively to sexual adverts when it is in the context of gift giving from a man to a woman, i.e. when the sexuality of the advert is the context of commitment. Men respond more negatively to the sexual advert when it involves gift giving as it emphasizes them having to spend money in a relationship. This is in line with evolutionary theory that women value men for their resources and men value women for sex and fertility. Further research found that even in men, recall of the advert is worsened by sexual content, as they focus on breasts and legs but not on the product.

=== Cultural differences ===
In order to be consistent, brands use standardized campaigns across various countries. Cultural differences have been found in response to sexual adverts. A 2016 study by the Korea Internet Advertising Foundation (KIAF) noted that 94.5% of South Korean high-schoolers were familiar with sex-driven ads, 83.4% of adults thought such ads have negative influence on society, and 91.2% said there are too many of such ads. A KIAF official noted that government legislation aimed to reduce such ads is not effective due to its ambiguity. Research has found that sex is used in adverts more in France than in the United States because they are more sexually liberated and so receptive to its use in advertising.

==Prevalence==
In the 21st century, the use of increasingly explicit sexual imagery in consumer-oriented print ads have become almost commonplace. Ads for jeans, perfumes and many other products have featured provocative images that were designed to elicit sexual responses from as large a cross section of the population as possible, to shock by their ambivalence, or to appeal to repressed sexual desires, which are thought to carry a stronger emotional load. Increased tolerance, more tempered censorship, emancipatory developments and increasing buying power of previously neglected appreciative target groups in rich markets (mainly in the West) have led to a marked increase in the share of attractive flesh &#x27;on display&#x27;.

A 2008 cross-national study examined nudity in television advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States. It showed that female but not male levels of nudity differed substantially across countries, and that U.S. and Chinese commercials showed the lowest level of nudity, whereas German and Thai ads showed the highest level. 

Historically, sex in advertising has focused on heterosexual gender roles, but there are increasing examples of sex being used to advertise to the LGBT community. The New Zealand Aids Foundation&#x27;s Love Your Condom (LYC) campaign used provocative images of males alongside captions such as &quot;Riding hard?&quot;, &quot;Bear hunting?&quot; and &quot;Going deep?&quot;, followed by the hashtag #loveyourcondom. It was hoped by using images explicitly directed towards homosexual men, their use of condoms would increase, which would help decrease rates of HIV transmission amongst gay and bisexual men. The campaign has been successful, with a 12% reduction in new HIV infections among MSM in New Zealand.

In a 2003 study conducted at the University of Georgia’s Department of Advertising and Public Relations Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, researchers looked at sexual advertisements in magazines over the span of the last 30 years. The rate at which sex in advertising is being used increased from 15% to 27% in the advertisements that the researchers looked at. Their reasoning behind the increase is because they believe sex still sells, specifically with “low-risk products impulse purchases.” The study also mentions “alcohol, entertainment and beauty are the main product categories that use sex in advertising.

&quot;Ad Age&quot;, a magazine delivering news, analysis, and data on marketing and media, published a list of Top 100 most effective advertising of the century, out of the 100, only eight involved use of sex. Unruly Media&#x27;s viral video tracker lists the Top-20 most viewed car commercial viral videos; only one uses sex, while the No.1 spot was held by VW&#x27;s &quot;The Force&quot; ad. The overall top-spot (across all product segments), was held by VW&#x27;s &quot;Fun Theory&quot; campaign, the most viewed viral video as of October 2011.

==Criticism==

=== Stereotypes===
The use of sex in advertising has been criticized for its tendency to reinforce sexist stereotypes. Since the late 1970s, many researchers have determined that advertisements depict women as having less social power than men, but the ways in which women are displayed as less powerful than men have evolved over time. In modern times, advertisements have displayed women&#x27;s expanding roles in the professional realm and importance in business backgrounds. However, as this change occurred there has been a substantial increase in the number of images that showcase women as less sexually powerful than men and as objects of men&#x27;s desire. The 2011 documentary film Miss Representation by Jennifer Siebel Newsom explores how the depiction of women in mainstream media contributes to the under-representation of women in leadership roles and other positions of influence.

=== Objectification ===

Furthermore, sex in advertising has been criticized for its emphasis on the importance of physical attractiveness and role as a mate. This emphasis has led men and women to value intelligence and general skills less. The rise in awareness of sexism portrayed in these types of adverts has led to stricter advertising policies. One group that enforces these rules is the Advertising Women of New York association. Adverts using highly sexual images containing nudity and unrealistic physiques can lead to self-objectification. In turn, this can lead to shame, disgust, appearance anxiety, eating disorders and depression. The increase in self-objectification caused by the use of sex in advertising has been found in women and men. The latter is not surprising with the increased sexual portrayal of men in advertising.

=== Social norms ===

Sex in advertising is an accepted marketing technique, however it is not unusual for it to cause backlash when it breaks social norms. In 1995, the Calvin Klein advertising campaign (see section on Calvin Klein, above) that showed teenage models in provocative poses wearing Calvin Klein underwear and jeans was deemed inappropriate and shocking. The ads were withdrawn when parents and child welfare groups threatened to protest and Hudson stores did not want their stores associated with the ads. It was reported that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating the ad campaign for possible violations of federal child pornography and exploitation laws. The Justice Department subsequently decided not to prosecute Calvin Klein for these alleged violations as the DOJ “independently verified that minors were not used as models in the particular photographs that raised questions,” according to Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Kevin V. Di Gregory.

<text>Madras is a lightweight cotton fabric with typically patterned texture and tartan design, used primarily for summer clothing such as pants, shorts, lungi, dresses, and jackets. The fabric takes its name from the former name of the city of Chennai in south India.

==Definition==
Authentic Madras comes from Chennai (Madras). Both sides of the cloth must bear the same pattern, and it must be handwoven (evidenced by the small flaws in the fabric). Madras was most popular in the 1960s.

Cotton madras is woven from a fragile, short-staple cotton fiber that cannot be combed, only carded. This results in bumps known as slubs which are thick spots in the yarn that give madras its unique texture. The cotton is hand-dyed after being spun into yarn, woven, and finished in some 200 small villages in the Madras area.

==History==
By the 16th century, madras cotton had morphed into something more elegant, printed with floral patterns or religious designs.

Dutch traders arrived in India in the early 17th century to trade in the local calico cloth, followed by the British. The English East India Company sought quality textiles, finding the small fishing village of Madrasapattinam (Madras), and the company established a trading post there in the mid-17th century.

The first madras material was a muslin overprinted or embroidered in elaborate patterns with vegetable dyes. To secure a reliable labor supply, the English East India Company promised a 30-year exemption from duties for Indian weavers in the area, and thus within a year nearly 400 families of weavers had settled in Madras.

Undyed madras cloth became popular in Europe because it was lightweight and breathable. Cotton plaid madras reached America in 1718 as a donation to the Collegiate School of Connecticut (now known as Yale University). Sears offered the first madras shirt for sale to the American consumer in its 1897 catalog.

In the Philippines, madras fabric was known as cambaya, after the state of Cambay (present-day Gujarat, India) that also exported madras fabrics. They were popular in the early 19th century for use in traditional women&#x27;s skirts (&quot;saya&quot;) in the baro&#x27;t saya ensemble, as well as for pants for the barong tagalog. Since they were expensive, they were copied by Chinese manufacturers as well as local industries, resulting in a lower-grade fabric that was usually used for clothing by commoners.
The name &quot;madras&quot; was attributed to shirt maker David J. Anderson in 1844, although the material had been referred to as such much earlier. In 1958 William Jacobson, a leading textile importer, traveled to Bombay to trade with Captain C.P. Krishnan, an exporter of madras from Chennai (formerly Madras). The two men struck a dollar-a-yard deal for madras material possessing a &quot;strong smell of vegetable dyes and sesame oils,&quot; woven of bright colors and originally bound for South Africa. Krishnan warned Jacobson that the fabric should be washed gently in cold water to avoid bleeding, advice that never reached the Brooks Brothers buyers to whom Jacobson sold 10,000 yards for the manufacture of madras clothing. Brooks Brothers then sold cotton madras garments to consumers without proper washing instructions, resulting in the bright madras dyes bleeding in the wash and the garments emerged discolored and faded. To counter dissatisfied customers, Madison Avenue advertising giant David Ogilvy coined the phrase &quot;guaranteed to bleed&quot; and used this as a selling point rather than a defect. A 1966 advertisement in John Plain stated:
Authentic Indian Madras is completely handwoven from yarns dyed with native vegetable colorings. Home-spun by native weavers, no two plaids are exactly the same. When washed with mild soap in warm water, they are guaranteed to bleed and blend together into distinctively muted and subdued colorings.

In the United States, the plaid cotton madras shirt became popular in the 1960s among the post-World War II generation of preppy baby boomers.

As early as the 1930s, cotton madras clothing was emerging as a status symbol in the US because only American tourists who could afford expensive Caribbean vacations during the Great Depression had access and thus the madras shirt was a signal of affluence.

Madras today is available as plaid patterns in regular cotton, seersucker, and as patchwork madras, meaning cutting several madras fabrics into squares or rectangles and sewing them back together to form a mixed pattern of various plaids.

== National costumes ==
In 1994 the government of Antigua and Barbuda adopted a new national dress, which featured madras cloth, that had been designed by artist Heather Doram, as a result of a national competition.

<doc id="187470" wikidata="Q4742581" url="?curid=187470" title="America's Promise">
<text>America&#x27;s Promise Alliance is an American alliance of nonprofit, community organizations, businesses, and government organizations dedicated to improving the lives of young people.

The organization was founded on the idea that children and youth need &quot;Five Promises&quot; to thrive—caring adults, safe spaces, a healthy start, effective education, and the opportunity to serve—but that not nearly enough young people have access to these basic resources.

America&#x27;s Promise works to raise awareness about the importance of these resources and inspire actions that help more children and youth receive them. The organization does this by leading national public awareness campaigns, conducting research, hosting events and convening summits, and partnering with hundreds of national, state, and community organizations that work directly with youth.

America’s Promise is currently chaired by Alma Powell and was formerly led by her husband and founding chairman, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell. The president and CEO is John S. Gomperts, a former leader of the Corporation for National and Community Service, Encore.org, and the Public Education Network.

==History==
The Presidents&#x27; Summit for America&#x27;s Future in 1997 – a national summit held in Philadelphia to promote a civic response to many of the country&#x27;s problems, particularly the challenges facing at-risk youth – led to the creation of America&#x27;s Promise Alliance.

Presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush convened the summit, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret) served as the event&#x27;s general chairman. Focusing specifically on helping the nation&#x27;s young people, Gen. Powell agreed to lead a three-year campaign called America&#x27;s Promise – The Alliance for Youth, which set out to improve the lives of 2 million of the nation&#x27;s 15 million at-risk youth by 2000.

In 2000, the target end-date of the campaign, General Powell determined that America&#x27;s Promise should continue its work and continue to operate as a nonprofit organization. Ending the work now, he said, would be &quot;kind of like saying we&#x27;ll be out of Bosnia in a year.&quot;

Early in its history, America&#x27;s Promise drew criticism for not being able to prove it had achieved its goals. A later analysis from the National 4-H Council, the nation&#x27;s largest youth development organization, agreed that while the organization&#x27;s impact was difficult to document, “much of the increased focus on youth and positive youth development … can be attributed to the visibility, energy, and funding America&#x27;s Promise brought to youth work.”

In the years since, the work of America’s Promise has grown to encompass awareness building (see GradNation campaign below), academic research (see Center for Promise), cross-sector collaboration (see Alliance partners), and events that bring people together (see GradNation campaign).

===Presidents&#x27; Summit for America&#x27;s Future===
In July 1995, former Michigan Governor George Romney (and father of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney) outlined his vision of &quot;a summit at which all living presidents and leaders from all sectors of society would gather to support citizen service and show it was not a partisan issue.&quot; Only four days after completing this outline, Romney died of natural causes.

Before his death, however, Romney shared his vision of this bipartisan summit focused on volunteerism with former U.S. Senator Harris Wofford, who had recently become CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service and Bob Goodwin, president of Bush&#x27;s Points of Light Foundation. Wofford and Goodwin agreed to enlist their organizations in fulfilling Romney&#x27;s plans for the summit, so Romney &quot;died knowing that the summit would go forward.&quot;

In his 1997 State of the Union address, President Bill Clinton laid out the overarching theme and goal of the summit: &quot;to mobilize America&#x27;s citizen power in a united effort to solve our common problems, especially those that threaten our young people.&quot;
Three months later, Presidents Clinton and George H. W. Bush officially co-convened the Presidents&#x27; Summit for America&#x27;s Future in Philadelphia. Retired Gen. Colin Powell served as the chairman of the event, and four out of the five living presidents attended, with Nancy Reagan representing her husband Ronald Reagan.

More than 20 governors, nearly 100 mayors, 145 community delegations, and many prominent business leaders and celebrities also attended the summit. With the official slogan, &quot;Two Million by 2000,&quot; the summit encouraged business, government, nonprofit, and community leaders across the country to work together to improve the lives of 2 million of the nation&#x27;s 15 million at-risk youth by 2000.

In 1998, Gen. Powell responded to criticism that the summit and ensuing America&#x27;s Promise campaign were little more than symbolic gestures and reported that, as a result of the summit, among other things, Big Brothers and Big Sisters amassed a 22 percent increase in adults enlisting as mentors; Boys and Girls Clubs of America added 100,000 new members; the U.S Chamber of Commerce committed to helping 3 million young people find summer jobs; and the LensCrafters company gave 100,000 free eye exams to children from low-income families.

==Notable leaders==
Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret) served as the founding chair of America’s Promise and remained board chair until 2001, when he stepped down to become U.S. Secretary of State. Former governor of Montana Marc Racicot took over as chair, followed by former U.S. Senator Harris Wofford in 2002.

Alma Powell, a respected audiologist and General Powell’s wife, became chair in 2004. She published two children’s books in 2003, &quot;America’s Promise&quot; and &quot;My Little Wagon&quot;.

In 2004, America’s Promise – The Alliance for Youth changed its name to America’s Promise Alliance to place a greater emphasis on the strength of Alliance partners (see Alliance partners). &quot;We see ourselves as a convener, a catalyst for action, and we help our partners and communities that focus on the measurable goals,&quot; said then-CEO Marguerite Kondracke.

Kondracke retired as president and CEO in 2012 and was replaced by John S. Gomperts, whose “association with America’s Promise began when he served as chief of staff to Harris Wofford, the CEO of the Corporation for National &amp; Community Service and one of the key conveners of the Summit for America’s Future.”

Gomperts remains CEO and Mrs. Powell continues to chair the board of directors, which includes notable members such as Miami Foundation President Javier Soto, former First Lady of Kentucky Jane Beshear, former Philadelphia Mayor Rev. Dr. Wilson Goode, and NCTA – The Internet and Television Association President, and General and Mrs. Powell’s son, Michael K. Powell.

The America’s Promise board of directors also includes three full voting youth members. Youth members must be between the ages of 18 and 24 and agree to serve two-year terms, operating as &quot;a critical and necessary component to [the America’s Promise] leadership teams,&quot; according to Mrs. Powell.

For a full list of board members, visit the America’s Promise Alliance website.

==The Five Promises==
The Presidents&#x27; Summit for America&#x27;s Future, the 1997 event that launched America&#x27;s Promise Alliance, included a Summit Declaration signed by Presidents Clinton, GHW Bush, Carter, Ford, and Nancy Reagan on behalf of her husband.

The Summit Declaration pledged to fulfill the &quot;promise of America&quot; for every child, which remains the core objective of America&#x27;s Promise. Specifically, the declaration outlined five essential resources the presidents agreed all children need to develop into successful adults, referred to as the Five Promises, which form the basis of America&#x27;s Promise efforts and initiatives. President Gerald Ford, General Colin Powell, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, and Vice President Al Gore

The Five Promises are: caring adults to guide and encourage them; safe places, both physical and psychological, in which students can safely develop; a healthy start in the form of proper nutrition and exercise; effective education that prepares them for work and life; and opportunities to help others and foster a sense of community, self-respect and service.

In July 2001, President George W. Bush added his signature, and President Barack Obama signed the declaration in September 2014.

One of the greatest strengths of America&#x27;s Promise Alliance, one organizational analysis noted, is its ability to coordinate the national response to youth development by collaborating with its many partners, who &quot;provide the arms and legs with which to carry out the Five Promises.&quot;

America&#x27;s Promise counts nearly 400 national partners in its multi-sector alliance. Corporate partners include Target Corporation and State Farm; foundation partners include Usher&#x27;s New Look Foundation and the Ford Foundation; nonprofit partners include Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, the YMCA, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America; education partners include the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), ASCD, and the Education Commission of the States; faith-based partners include Catholic Charities USA and Faith Leaders for Community Change.

America&#x27;s Promise Alliance has the full list of its partners available on its website.

==GradNation Campaign==
In 2006, two America&#x27;s Promise Alliance partner organizations, Civic Enterprises and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, released the study, The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts. The report revealed that nearly one third of public high school students were failing to graduate high school with their class. The research also explored the reasons why so many students were dropping out of school and drew national attention to the &quot;silent epidemic&quot; of high school dropouts. 
Spurred by the urgency to end this dropout crisis, America&#x27;s Promise launched the Dropout Prevention campaign in 2008, later named the GradNation campaign, and hosted 105 Dropout Prevention Summits in all 50 states from April 2008 until 2010. The summits worked to increase awareness about the dropout crisis, encourage collaboration between different sectors and organizations, and facilitate action in states and communities to improve their graduation rates.

Overall, more than 33,000 educators, business leaders, nonprofit leaders, policymakers, families, and youth attended these summits. An analysis from Duke University found that these summits helped raise public awareness about the high school dropout crisis and inspired the creation of new programs and collaborative efforts.

In early 2009, America&#x27;s Promise Alliance commissioned Grad Nation: A Guidebook to Help Communities Tackle the Dropout Crisis, written by Robert Balfanz and Joanna Hornig Fox of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and John M. Bridgeland and Mary McNaught from Civic Enterprises, to provide communities with research and best practices to raise graduation rates at the local level.

In 2010, America&#x27;s Promise partnered with the Alliance for Excellent Education, Civic Enterprises, and the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University to set the GradNation campaign goal of achieving a 90 percent on-time national high school graduation rate and increasing postsecondary enrollment by 2020. President Obama joined U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and General and Mrs. Powell for the announcement at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

State Farm was a lead sponsor of the campaign, which also pledged to focus on reducing the country&#x27;s number of &quot;dropout factories,&quot; or schools where &quot;less than 60 percent of students who started as freshmen remain enrolled four years later.&quot;

For the past few years, researchers, governors, and President Obama have drawn attention to the steady increase in the national on-time high school graduation rate.

&quot;Just 10 years ago, the nation&#x27;s on-time high school graduation rate was hovering around 70 percent, where it had been stuck for decades,&quot; CEO John S. Gomperts wrote in Education Week in 2016.

In October 2016, President Obama announced that the on-time high school graduation rate had again reached a record high for the fifth year in a row, this time at 83.2 percent. 
&quot;The greatest credit goes to students, families and teachers who are putting in the work and showing great determination and resolve, sometimes in the face of great challenge,&quot; Gomperts wrote in September 2016.

===&quot;Building a Grad Nation&quot;===
In 2010, the campaign&#x27;s leading organizations worked together to release the Building a Grad Nation report, research that analyzes the progress and challenges of raising the national high school graduation rate.

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan spoke at the launch of the report, calling it &quot;required reading for those who believe that the high school dropout problem is too intractable to successfully take on.&quot; The four organizations – America&#x27;s Promise Alliance, the Alliance for Excellent Education, Civic Enterprises, and the Everyone Graduates Center – have released the report every year since 2010.

In 2013, America&#x27;s Promise committed to helping community partners across the nation convene 100 GradNation Community Summits over three years. Modeled after the Dropout Prevention Summits, the community summits were designed to inspire local collaboration and action to raise high school graduation rates.

Summits have been hosted in major cities like Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia, as well as smaller cities and rural areas in North Carolina, Northwest Indiana, and Tennessee.

In 2015, America&#x27;s Promise launched the GradNation State Activation initiative, an effort to increase high school graduation rates at the state level. The three-year initiative provides funding to state organizations that encourage statewide innovation and collaboration, shares that knowledge, and develops successful models all states can replicate. Organizations in Arizona, Massachusetts, and Minnesota were each awarded with $200,000 grants.

==The Center for Promise==
In 2012, America&#x27;s Promise partnered with Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences to open the Center for Promise, an applied research institute studying what helps &quot;create the conditions so that all young people in America have the opportunity to succeed in school and life.&quot;

In 2014, the Center produced the report, &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Them Dropouts: Understanding the Experiences of Young People Who Leave High School Before Graduation&quot;, which drew national attention to the challenging life and socioeconomic factors that cause many students to drop out of high school. Similar to the Silent Epidemic study, Don&#x27;t Call Them Dropouts focused heavily on youth perspective and analysis.

&quot;Rather than merely boredom or lack of motivation, young people who drop out are likely growing up in ‘toxic environments&#x27; with unstable families, violent neighborhoods, and unsafe schools,&quot; an Education Week article said of the report. &quot;Some students are caregivers for parents, siblings, or their own children. Others are homeless or the victims of abuse.&quot;

In 2015, the Center for Promise moved from Tufts University to the Boston University School of Education. That same fall, the Center produced a follow-up study to Don&#x27;t Call Them Dropouts that examined the role that relationships with adults play in keeping students in school called Don&#x27;t Quit On Me: What Young People Who Left School Say About the Power of Relationships.

The Center&#x27;s 2016 study, Who&#x27;s Minding the Neighborhood? The Role of Adult Capacity in Keeping Young People on a Path to Graduation examined how adult-to-youth ratios in neighborhoods impact educational outcomes, the first study to do so. Adding seven adults to a neighborhood, researchers concluded, results in one fewer student dropping out of high school.

Also released in 2016: &quot;Barriers to Wellness: Voices and Views from Young People in Five Cities&quot;, a youth-led assessment that provides insight into the obstacles to wellness young people of color face in five cities.

==Other initiatives==
===The Youth Opportunity Fund===
In 2015, America’s Promise partnered with the Citi Foundation to launch the Youth Opportunity Fund, a $3 million initiative to support programs that prepare urban youth for the workforce. It awarded $250,00 grants to each of 12 organizations in 10 U.S. cities: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Newark, St. Louis, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.

The program announced a second round of funding in 2016, providing an additional $3 million for 12 more organizations in the same cities, or a total of $6 million to support 24 organizations—including Communities In Schools, Year Up, Café Momentum, and Per Scholas—and reach more than 7,000 youth.

===Promise of America Awards===
America’s Promise recognizes people making extraordinary contributions to the lives of children and youth with the “Promise of America” award, the highest honor conferred by America&#x27;s Promise. Past recipients include U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, Magic Johnson Enterprises CEO and founder and NBA star Magic Johnson, and Corporation for Public Broadcasting President and CEO Patricia de Stacey Harrison.

<doc id="187472" wikidata="Q1056337" url="?curid=187472" title="Certified Public Accountant">
<text>Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is the title of qualified accountants in numerous countries in the English-speaking world. It is generally equivalent to the title of chartered accountant in other English-speaking countries. In the United States, the CPA is a license to provide accounting services to the public. It is awarded by each of the 50 states for practice in that state. Additionally, all states except Hawaii have passed mobility laws to allow CPAs from other states to practice in their state. State licensing requirements vary, but the minimum standard requirements include passing the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination, 150 semester units of college education, and one year of accounting-related experience.

Continuing professional education (CPE) is also required to maintain licensure. Individuals who have been awarded the CPA but have lapsed in the fulfillment of the required CPE or who have requested conversion to inactive status are in many states permitted to use the designation &quot;CPA Inactive&quot; or an equivalent phrase. In most U.S. states, only CPAs are legally able to provide attestation (including auditing) opinions on financial statements. Many CPAs are members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and their state CPA society.

State laws vary widely regarding whether a non-CPA is even allowed to use the title &quot;accountant&quot;. For example, Texas prohibits the use of the designations &quot;accountant&quot; and &quot;auditor&quot; by a person not certified as a Texas CPA, unless that person is a CPA in another state, is a non-resident of Texas, and otherwise meets the requirements for practice in Texas by out-of-state CPA firms and practitioners.

== History ==
In 1660, the first person who would conduct an audit was chosen in order to be able to manage the money that was raised by England in Virginia, United States. With the help of chartered accountants from England and Scotland for training Americans to learn the procedures of accounting, many firms were established in America. The first American one was in 1895.

On July 28, 1882, the Institute of Accountants and Bookkeepers of the City of New York became the first accounting corporation which supports the need of people in the accounting field and for educational purposes. With the accountancy and industry growing in the world, the need of looking for services from professional accountants who had higher standards and were recognized had been considered. In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants was created to set moral standards for the practice of accounting.

On April 17, 1896, Chapter 312 of the Laws of the State of New York established that the Regents of the University of the State of New York would provide a Certificate of Public Accountancy to individuals over age 21, of good moral character, and who possessed or intended to declare citizenship in the United States with appropriate accounting education or experience either through examination or previous experience. This was the first time the title &quot;Certified Public Accountant&quot; was regulated. Examinations were held in both Buffalo and New York City. Frank Broaker was licensee #1 and he received his certificate solely through previous experience as a public accountant and did not take an examination, commonly referred to as grandfathering. Broaker died on November 12, 1941. The first person to receive the CPA through examination and previous experience was Joseph Hardcastle, who would go on to become an accounting theorist and New York University professor. Hardcastle died on June 16, 1906, after being thrown from a horse after an accident with a wagon. The Chapter was introduced by New York Senator Albert Wray, New York Assemblyman Henry Marshall, and signed by New York Governor Morton as part of business reform. The Regents appointed a Board of Examiners, similar to today&#x27;s NASBA, the first members of which were Charles Sprague, Frank Broaker, and C. W. Haskins

Many accounting professionals believed the 150 credit requirement—implemented in several states first in 1988 and then expanded to nearly all states in 2001—would lead to more knowledgeable, experienced CPAs. The National Association of State Board of Accountancy (NASBA) collected and analyzed data from 1996 to 1998 to verify the effectiveness of the measure. Researchers studied more than 116,000 candidates who took the exam between 1996 and 1998. 33% of respondents had more than 150 college credit hours, while 67% had less than 150 credit hours. The research reveals that for candidates with less than 150 credits, only 13% passed the CPA exam on their first try. Conversely, for candidates with 150 or more credits, 21% passed the CPA exam on their first try. Some suggest extraneous variables—including the additional study time those possessing 150 credits likely have while still enrolled in university—could distort the verifiability of the study.

== CPA in various countries ==
In the United States, &quot;CPA&quot; is an initialism for Certified Public Accountant which is a designation given by a state governing agency, whereas other countries around the world have their own designations, which may be equivalent to &quot;CPA&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;CPA&quot; is an initialism for Certified Public Accountant as well, but refers to an accounting and finance professional who is a member of the Certified Public Accountants Association (formerly the Association of Certified Public Accountants).

In Australia, the term &quot;CPA&quot; is an initialism for Certified Practicing Accountant. To become a CPA in Australia, it also requires a certain amount of education and experience to be eligible working in some specific areas in the accounting field.

In Canada, &quot;CPA&quot; is an initialism for Chartered Professional Accountant. This designation is for someone who would like to be a Canadian CPA. In order to be qualified for this certificate, candidates who major in accounting will get accepted to enter CPA Professional Education Program (CPA PEP). Provinces in Canada also allow non-accounting majors and international candidates to meet the requirements if they get into the CPA Prerequisite Education Program (CPA PREP).

== Functions ==
One important function performed by CPAs relates to assurance services. The most commonly performed assurance services are financial audit services where CPAs attest to the reasonableness of disclosures, the freedom from material misstatement, and the adherence to the applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in financial statements. CPAs can also be employed within corporations (termed &quot;the private sector&quot; or &quot;industry&quot;) in finance or operations positions such as financial analyst, finance manager, controller, chief financial officer (CFO), or chief executive officer (CEO). These CPAs do not provide services directly to the public.

Although some CPA firms serve as business consultants, the consulting role has been under scrutiny following the Enron scandal where Arthur Andersen simultaneously provided audit and consulting services which affected its ability to maintain independence in its audit duties. This incident resulted in many accounting firms divesting their consulting divisions, but this trend has since reversed. In audit engagements, CPAs are (and have always been) required by professional standards and federal and state laws to maintain independence (both in fact and in appearance) from the entity for which they are conducting an attestation (audit and review) engagement. Although most individual CPAs who work as consultants do not also work as auditors, if the CPA firm is auditing the same company that the firm also does consulting work for, then there is a conflict of interest. This conflict voids the CPA firm&#x27;s independence for multiple reasons, including: the CPA firm would be auditing its own work or the work the firm suggested, and, the CPA firm may be pressured into unduly giving a positive (unmodified) audit opinion so as not to jeopardize the consulting revenue the firm receives from the client.

CPAs also have a niche within the income tax return preparation industry. Many small to mid-sized firms have both a tax and an auditing department. Along with attorneys and Enrolled Agents, CPAs may represent taxpayers in matters before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Although the IRS regulates the practice of tax representation, it has no authority to regulate tax return preparers.

Some states also allow unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants. For example, California allows unlicensed accountants to work as public accountants if they work under the control and supervision of a CPA. However, the California Board of Accountancy itself has determined that the terms &quot;accountant&quot; and &quot;accounting&quot; are misleading to members of the public, many of whom believe that a person who uses these terms must be licensed. As part of the California Poll, survey research showed that 55 percent of Californians believe that a person who advertises as an &quot;accountant&quot; must be licensed, 26 percent did not believe a license was required, and 19 percent did not know.

Whether providing services directly to the public or employed by corporations or associations, CPAs can operate in virtually any area of finance including:
* Assurance and attestation services
* Corporate finance (merger and acquisition, initial public offerings, share and debt issuings)
* Corporate governance
* Estate planning
* Financial accounting
* Governmental accounting
* Financial analysis
* Financial planning
* Forensic accounting (preventing, detecting, and investigating financial frauds)
* Income tax
* Information technology, especially as applied to accounting and auditing
* Management consulting and performance management
* Tax preparation and planning
* Venture capital
* Financial reporting
* Regulatory compliance
* SOC engagements

==CPAs in the United States==
===CPA exam===
To become a CPA in the United States, the candidate must sit for and pass the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination (Uniform CPA Exam), which is set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and administered by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA). The Uniform CPA Exam consists of three core sections and three corresponding discipline sections. Candidates are required to take all three core sections and are permitted to choose one of the three discipline sections for a total of four sections.

The CPA designation was first established in law in New York State on April 17, 1896.

To qualify for the CPA examination in the United States, individuals typically need a bachelor&#x27;s degree from an accredited institution with a minimum number of accounting and business-related credit hours (ranging from 120 to 150), and specific coursework in subjects such as auditing and financial accounting. Additional educational requirements, like a master&#x27;s degree, may be necessary in some states. Residency and citizenship requirements, if applicable, vary by state. Candidates must apply through their state&#x27;s Board of Accountancy, pay the requisite fees, and may need to pass an ethics exam. While work experience is not typically required for the exam itself, it is necessary for CPA licensure.

===Other requirements===
Although the CPA exam is uniform, licensing and certification requirements are imposed separately by each state&#x27;s laws and therefore vary from state to state. Some states have a two-tier system whereby an individual would first become certified—usually by passing the Uniform CPA Exam. That individual would then later be eligible to be licensed once a certain amount of work experience is accomplished. Other states have a one-tier system whereby an individual would be certified and licensed at the same time when both the CPA exam is passed and the work experience requirement has been met. Two-tier states include Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Montana, and Nebraska. The trend is for two-tier states to gradually move towards a one-tier system. Since 2002, the state boards of accountancy in Washington and South Dakota have ceased issuing CPA &quot;certificates&quot; and instead issue CPA &quot;licenses&quot;. Illinois planned to follow suit in 2012. A number of states are two-tiered, but require work experience for the CPA certificate, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Like other professionals, CPAs are required to take continuing education courses toward continuing professional development (continuing professional education [CPE]) to renew their license. Requirements vary by state (Wisconsin does not require any CPE for CPAs) but the vast majority require an average of 40 hours of CPE every year with a minimum of 20 hours per calendar year. The requirement can be fulfilled through attending live seminars, webcast seminars, or through self-study (textbooks, videos, online courses, all of which require a test to receive credit). In general, state boards accept group live and group internet-based credits for all credit requirements, while some states cap the number of credits obtained through the self-study format. All CPAs are encouraged to periodically review their state requirements. As part of the CPE requirement, most states require their CPAs to take an ethics course at some frequency (such as every or every other renewal period). Ethics requirements vary by state and the courses range from 2–8 hours. AICPA guidelines (which are adopted by many state boards) grant licensees 1 hour of CPE credit for every 50 minutes of instruction.

===Loss of licensure===
A CPA license may be suspended or revoked for various reasons. Common reasons include these:
*Allowing the license to lapse without renewing in a timely manner.
*Performing attestation services under an unlicensed/unregistered CPA firm or under a CPA firm permit which has expired.
*Continuing to hold out as an active CPA on an expired license, which includes continued use of the CPA title on business cards, letterhead, office signage, correspondence, etc. after the license has expired.
*Using fraud or deceit in obtaining or renewing the CPA license, the most common occurrence being misrepresenting or falsifying compliance with or completion of the continuing education requirements as a condition for renewal.
*Being suspended or barred from practicing before another regulatory body such as the SEC or the IRS.
*&quot;Discreditable acts&quot;, which can include
*#failure to follow applicable standards (such as auditing standards when examining financial statements, or tax code when preparing tax returns); or 
*#violation of felony or serious misdemeanor criminal laws, which may or not be related to the practice of accountancy. (A notable example of a CPA whose license was revoked for non-financial related criminal activity is John Battaglia, convicted of the capital murders of his children).

=== Impact of technology ===
Many tasks that a CPA used to do while working have now been automated. Therefore, current and future CPAs are required to do more complex tasks with technology as the simpler tasks have become automated. An example of a more complex task would include analyzing and interpreting data using a visualization software. Technology is used regularly in the job to the point where technological proficiency is needed when starting as a CPA.

Since technological proficiency is more important than in prior years, accounting organizations have begun starting to teach technology within the accounting curricula in colleges and universities. One significant change was in 2013, when the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) mandated that information technology be included in all accredited accounting programs. The transition to add information technology has not been one without challenges. One specific challenge with regards to adding information technology into accounting curricula is the balance of preparing students for the CPA exam and preparing to work as a CPA following graduation. Preparing for the CPA exam and preparing to work as a CPA after graduation can be different, making this difficult for professors and schools to figure out what to include in their curricula. Instructors generally agree that including data analytics should be included when teaching about accounting information systems as a whole but few instructors think that data analytics should be in the entire accounting curricula at schools.

=== Demographics of CPAs ===
A disparity exists among the demographics of AICPA members, specifically as it relates to class and gender. Between 1976 and 2005, 77% of CPAs were either middle or upper class and nearly half of all CPA candidates belonged to an upper middle class socioeconomic background. Although AICPA membership is predominated by individuals from wealthier socioeconomic backgrounds, 20% of AICPA members were lower class between 1976 and 2005. This indicates that the CPA profession is not exclusionary, but rather that it provides upward social and economic mobility. While women only accounted for 2.4% of all CPAs between 1934 and 1975, 50-60% of all hiring&#x27;s by CPA firms were women between 2001 and 2010. Considering the unique barriers female CPAs may experience within the accounting profession, it is theorized that female CPAs come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds to overcome any gender bias they may experience. This would elucidate the higher prevalence of wealthy AICPA members who are women. These findings indicate that the demographic discrepancies among AICPA members have narrowed significantly in recent years.

===Practice mobility: the substantial equivalency rule===
An accountant is required to meet the legal requirements of any state in which the accountant wishes to practice. In recent years, practice mobility for CPAs has become a major business concern for CPAs and their clients. Practice mobility for CPAs is the general ability of a licensee in good standing from a substantially equivalent state to gain practice privilege outside of the practitioner&#x27;s home state without getting an additional license in the state where the CPA will serve a client or an employer. In today&#x27;s digital age, many organizations require the professional services of CPAs to conduct business on an interstate and international basis and have compliance responsibilities in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, the practice of CPAs often extends across state lines and international boundaries.

Differing requirements for CPA certification, reciprocity, temporary practice and other aspects of state accountancy legislation in the 55 U.S. licensing jurisdictions (the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) make the interstate practice and mobility of CPAs more complicated. By removing boundaries to practice in the US, CPAs are able to more readily serve individuals and businesses in need of their expertise. At the same time, the state board of accountancy&#x27;s ability to discipline is enhanced by being based on a CPA and the CPA firm&#x27;s performance of services (either physically, electronically or otherwise within a state), rather than being based on whether a state license is held.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) have analyzed the current system for gaining practice privileges across state lines and have endorsed a uniform mobility system. This model approach is detailed through the substantial equivalency provision (Section 23) of the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The UAA is an &quot;evergreen&quot; model licensing law co-developed, maintained, reviewed and updated by the AICPA and NASBA. The model provides a uniform approach to regulation of the accounting profession.

Uniform adoption of the UAA&#x27;s substantial equivalency provision creates a system similar to the nation&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license program by providing CPAs with mobility while retaining and strengthening state boards&#x27; ability to protect the public interest. The system enables consumers to receive timely services from the CPA best suited to the job, regardless of location, and without the hindrances of unnecessary filings, forms and increased costs that do not protect the public interest.

As of October 2012, a total of 49 out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia had passed mobility laws and were in the implementation and navigation phases. Only the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam have not passed mobility laws. A California mobility law went into effect July 1, 2013. The District of Columbia passed mobility laws effective on October 1, 2012.

===AICPA membership===
The CPA designation is granted by individual state boards, not the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Membership in the AICPA is not obligatory for CPAs, although some CPAs do join. To become a full member of AICPA, the applicant must hold a valid CPA certificate or license from at least one of the fifty-five U.S. state/territory boards of accountancy; some additional requirements apply.

AICPA members approved a proposed bylaw amendment to make eligible for voting membership individuals who previously held a CPA certificate/license or have met all the requirements for CPA certification in accordance with the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The AICPA announced its plan to accept applications from individuals meeting these criteria, beginning no later than January 1, 2011.

<doc id="187473" wikidata="Q14624265" url="?curid=187473" title="Compressed-air car">
<text>A compressed-air car is a compressed-air vehicle powered by pressure vessels filled with compressed air. It is propelled by the release and expansion of the air within a motor adapted to compressed air. The car might be powered solely by air, or combined (as in a hybrid electric vehicle) with other fuels such as gasoline, diesel, or an electric plant with regenerative braking.

Compressed-air cars use a thermodynamic process. Air cools when expanding and heats when compressed. Thermal energy losses in the compressor and tankage reduce the capacity factor of compressed air systems.

In 2020, Dr. Reza Alizade Evrin of Ontario Tech University developed an isothermal compressed air vehicle. This prototype used low pressure air tanks and exhaust air recovery to power a paraffin heat exchanger system. Its energy efficiency reached 74%. This is as much as 90% of the efficiency of lithium-ion electric cars. It had a driving range of 140 km (86 mi.). Efficiency and range might be increased by a number of practical improvements. For example, combining the storage tank into the car chassis, higher pressure tanks, new rotary engines, and a more efficient heat exchanger. Also, the weight and cost of tanks and pneumatic parts might be reduced by using recycled and bio-based thermoplastics.

This technology might develop into an inexpensive, clean transportation technology. The energy, vehicles and compressors might be produced easily by decentralized methods, even circular industry. Using plastic might permit open source fabrication using numerical control, including additive manufacturing. The compressed air for such vehicles might be produced easily by common types of renewable energy. For example, multistage air compressors and intercoolers or hydraulic pumps might be attached directly to trompes, hydropower, VAWT wind turbines or stirling engines using a solar concentrator. Direct mechanical compression avoids the Carnot inefficiencies of heat engines. Insulated storage of compressed air avoids energy conversion and battery storage. Heat-based systems might use tankage of solar-heated molten salts driving a heat exchanger rather than an onboard heat recovery system. Electric energy, electric grids and their issues might be avoided.

==Technology==

===Engines for compressed air===
There have been several dubious claims with undisclosed information. The &quot;di pietro&quot; engine has been tested partially with CAD and finite element analysis programs. The results were published by Jarosław Zwierzchowski from Lodz University of Technology in 2017. This motor is an eccentric shaft vane motor that uses low air pressure.

===Compressed air tanks and collision safety===
The tanks must be designed to safety standards for a pressure vessel. ISO 11439 is a similar standard, for compressed natural gas tanks.

The air storage tanks usable in compressed air cars can be low pressure (9 atm) or high pressure (240+ atm). Thus, they can be made of composite materials like thermoplastics and fiber reinforced thermoplastics, This might permit low priced tankage. It might be made by rotational molding. Such tanks can be much lighter than lithium-iron batteries and 70% lighter than steel tanks. They resist rust from air, water and condensation. They last longer with less maintenance.

To reduce car weight further the pressure vessels can be used as structural parts of the chassis. Advanced 700-atmosphere pressure vessels have been developed for hydrogen cars. Crash tests showed good safety. Fiber reinforced thermoplastic tanks only rupture in collisions. They do not shatter or explode.

Hydrogen tanks require ‘high strength’ to prevent rupture and ‘high stiffness’ for durability. Strength resists an external force. Stiffness maintains a shape. Carbon fiber hydrogen fuel tanks are as light as plastic but six times the strength of steel and four times the stiffness. “When a bullet penetrates a hydrogen tank, it does not explode. Instead, hydrogen leaks out through the bullet hole. In a standard collision test, not even a tiny amount of hydrogen was detected because none had leaked out.&quot;

===Compressed air production and storage===

Compressed air can also be produced by attaching an air compressor or hydraulic pump to a wind turbine or by using a river, tidal or wave hydropower turbine. These all convert directly from mechanical to pneumatic energy. Eliminating electricity from the cycle gives higher efficiency overall. It is also possible to use thermal solar energy with a parabolic or Fresnel lens solar concentrator to power a thermal Stirling engine. This can move the compressor or pump. Solar Stirling is more efficient than solar steam or photovoltaic.

==Emissions==
Compressed air cars are emission free. They also do not require a connection to the electric grid. A wind turbine or other renewable energy source can directly drive an air compressor or hydraulic pump. Compressed air cars do not rely on petrol stations or an electric grid. While centralized infrastructure might not be needed, it is an option. Tankage can be directly shipped, or a pipeline can be utilized.Compressed air is normally filtered to protect the compressor machinery. Therefore, discharge air has very little suspended dust. There may be some lubricants emitted by some systems, but further development might reduce this with oil free compressors and intercoolers

== Resource consumption ==

Composite pressure vessels and pneumatic components could permit compressed air cars to be a circular industry. The materials would have to be biobased or recycled. Electric energy is not used, so there is no need for metals like copper, iron in magnets, etc.

==Advantages==

There can be a single conversion of mechanical energy to pneumatic or hydraulic energy. Therefore, compressed air can have high energy efficiency when using mechanical renewable energy such as wind turbines or hydropower. Thermal energy to mechanical energy conversion is possible, but less efficient due to Carnot conversion inefficiencies. Thermal storage of heat from a renewable solar source is also possible using a phase change material such as a molten salt.

Energy efficiency of the 2020 isothermal prototype vehicle was 59.4% of a lithium-ion vehicle.

Compressed air technology adapts to renewable energy and possibly a circular economy, if biobased or recycled composites can be used. Thus it is more sustainable than electric cars. For example, there is much less use of metals, or toxic battery chemistries. A centralized manufacturing and electric grid might be less necessary.

Efficiency is also helped by the low weight of composite pressure vessels relative to steel tanks or lithium-ion batteries. Weight might be further reduced if the tanks support the car chassis. Pneumatic engines also have lower weights than electric engines.

Refueling is possible in many places using only wind, solar power or hydropower to move an air compressor, hydraulic pump or Stirling engine.

Pneumatic power has energy synergy, because it is well suited to automotive mechatronics. Many car systems can be powered by small air motors. For example, active pneumatic suspension, pneumatic steering, or pneumatic shock absorbers. Expansion of the compressed air creates cold temperatures, and can directly provide air conditioning or climate control.

Energy recovery systems with regenerative suspension and regenerative braking produce low pressure compressed air. This can be stored in a pressure vessel.

Pistonless engines using compressed air are very quiet.

There is no fire hazard after accidents, unlike systems that utilize combustion fuels or high power batteries.

Compressed air engines reduce the cost of car production, because there is no need to build a cooling system, spark plugs, starter motor, or mufflers.

The rate of self-discharge is very low compared to batteries. A fueled, compressed-air vehicle may be left unused for a longer time than an electric car.

They reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals such as gasoline, battery acids and related metals such as lead.

Compressed air cars are safer in more situations:
* potentially explosive work atmospheres
* brush-fire areas
* the vicinity of strong magnetic electric fields
* radio quiet zones

==Disadvantages==

Compressed air has a lower energy density than liquid nitrogen or hydrogen.

While batteries somewhat maintain their voltage throughout their discharge and chemical fuel tanks provide the same power densities from the first to the last litre, the pressure of compressed air tanks falls as air is drawn off. There are mechanical methods (e.g. continuously variable transmissions or auxiliary motors) to reduce this effect, but they add expense.

==Developers and manufacturers==
Various companies are investing in the research, development and deployment of compressed air cars. The MDI Air Car made its public South African debut in 2002. It was predicted to be in production &quot;within six months&quot; in January 2004. As of 2022, it was not in production.

===MDI===

MDI has proposed a range of vehicles made up of AIRPod, OneFlowAir, CityFlowAir, MiniFlowAir and MultiFlowAir. One of the main innovations of this company is its implementation of its &quot;active chamber&quot;, which is a compartment which heats the air (through the use of a fuel) in order to double the energy output. This &#x27;innovation&#x27; was first used in torpedoes in 1904.

===Tata Motors===
, Tata Motors of India had planned to launch a car with an MDI compressed air engine in 2011. In December 2009 Tata&#x27;s vice president of engineering systems confirmed that the limited range and low engine temperatures were causing problems.

Tata Motors announced in May 2012 that they have assessed the design past phase 1, the &quot;proof of the technical concept&quot;, and were proceeding to full production for the Indian market. Tata moved to phase 2, &quot;completing detailed development of the compressed air engine into specific vehicle and stationary applications&quot;.

In February 2017, Dr. Tim Leverton, president and head at Advanced and Product Engineering at Tata revealed that the project was &quot;starting industrialisation&quot; with the first vehicles to be available by 2020. Other reports indicate Tata is also reviving plans for a compressed air version of the Tata Nano, This had previously been under consideration as part of their collaboration with MDI.

===Engineair Pty Ltd===
Engineair is an Australian company. It produced prototypes of small vehicles using a rotary air engine designed by Angelo Di Pietro. The company is seeking commercial partners to utilise its engine.

===Peugeot/Citroën===
Peugeot and Citroën announced that they intended to build a car using compressed air as an energy source. However, it utilizes a hybrid system. A gasoline engine propels the car more than 70 km/h or when the compressed air tank has been depleted.

In January 2015, there was disappointing news from France: PSA Peugeot Citroën has delayed indefinitely the development of its promising-seeming Hybrid Air powertrain, apparently because the company has been unable to find a development partner willing to share the huge costs of engineering the system. Development costs are estimated to 500 million Euros. Production volumes would have to be more than 500,000 cars a year to repay these costs. The head of the project left Peugeot in 2014.

===APUQ===
APUQ (Association de Promotion des Usages de la Quasiturbine) has made the APUQ Air Car, a car powered by a Quasiturbine.

<text>Joseph Henry (December 17, 1797– May 13, 1878) was an American physicist and inventor who served as the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He was the secretary for the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution. He also served as president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1868 to 1878.

While building electromagnets, Henry discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of self-inductance. He also discovered mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday, though Faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results. Henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device. He invented a precursor to the electric doorbell (specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, 1831) and electric relay (1835). His work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph, invented separately by Samuel F. B. Morse and Sir Charles Wheatstone. In his honor, the SI unit of inductance is named the henry (plural: henries; symbol: H).

==Early life and education==

Henry was born in Albany, New York, to Scottish immigrants Ann Alexander Henry and William Henry. His parents were poor, and Henry&#x27;s father died while he was still young. For the rest of his childhood, Henry lived with his grandmother in Galway, New York. After school, he worked at a general store, and at the age of thirteen became an apprentice watchmaker and silversmith. Joseph&#x27;s first love was theater, and he came close to becoming a professional actor. His interest in science was sparked at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled &quot;Popular Lectures on Experimental Philosophy&quot;.

In 1819, he entered The Albany Academy, where he was given free tuition. Even with free tuition, he was so poor that he had to support himself with teaching and private tutoring positions. He intended to go into medicine, but in 1824 he was appointed an assistant engineer for the survey of the State road being constructed between the Hudson River and Lake Erie. From then on, he was inspired to a career in either civil or mechanical engineering. Henry excelled academically, even often helping his teachers teach science.

==Career==

In 1826, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon&#x27;s electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time, for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism, some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz; however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.

Using his newly developed electromagnetic principle, in 1831, Henry created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern DC motor. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, rocking back and forth. The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.

This apparatus allowed Henry to recognize the property of self inductance. British scientist Michael Faraday also recognized this property around the same time. Since Faraday published his results first, he became the officially recognized discoverer of the phenomenon.

=== Princeton ===
From 1832 to 1846, Henry served as the first Chair of Natural History at the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University. While in Princeton, he taught a wide range of courses including natural history, chemistry, and architecture, and ran a laboratory on campus. Decades later, Henry wrote that he made &quot;several thousand original investigations on electricity, magnetism, and electro-magnetism&quot; while on the Princeton faculty. Henry relied heavily on an African American research assistant, Sam Parker, in his laboratory and experiments. Parker was a free black man hired by the Princeton trustees to assist Henry. In an 1841 letter to mathematician Elias Loomis, Henry wrote:

The Trustees have however furnished me with an article which I now find indispensable namely with a coloured servant whom I have taught to manage my batteries and who now relieves me from all the dirty work of the laboratory.

In his letters, Henry described Parker providing materials for experiments, fixing technical issues with Henry&#x27;s equipment, and at times being used as a test subject in electrical experiments in which Henry and his students would shock Parker in classroom demonstrations. In 1842, when Parker fell ill, Henry&#x27;s experiments stopped completely until he recovered.

=== Smithsonian ===
Henry was appointed the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846, and served in this capacity until 1878. In 1848, while Secretary, Henry worked in conjunction with Professor Stephen Alexander to determine the relative temperatures for different parts of the solar disk. They used a thermopile to determine that sunspots were cooler than the surrounding regions. This work was shown to the astronomer Angelo Secchi who extended it, but with some question as to whether Henry was given proper credit for his earlier work.

In late 1861 and early 1862, during the American Civil War, Henry oversaw a series of lectures by prominent abolitionists at the Smithsonian Institution. Speakers included white clergymen, politicians, and activists such as Wendell Phillips, Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Orator and former fugitive slave Frederick Douglass was scheduled as the final speaker; Henry, however, refused to allow him to attend, stating: &quot;I would not let the lecture of the coloured man be given in the rooms of the Smithsonian.&quot;

In the fall of 2014, history author Jeremy T.K. Farley released &quot;The Civil War Out My Window: Diary of Mary Henry&quot;. The 262-page book featured the detailed diary of Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary Anna Henry, kept from the years of 1855 to 1878 while living in the Smithsonian Castle. Throughout the diary, Henry is repeatedly mentioned by his daughter, who showed a keen affection to her father.

===Influences in aeronautics===

Henry was introduced to Prof. Thaddeus Lowe, a balloonist from New Hampshire who had taken interest in the phenomenon of lighter-than-air gases, and exploits into meteorology, in particular, the high winds which we call the Jet stream today. It was Lowe&#x27;s intent to make a transatlantic crossing by utilizing an enormous gas-inflated aerostat. Henry took a great interest in Lowe&#x27;s endeavors, promoting him among some of the more prominent scientists and institutions of the day.

In June 1860, Lowe had made a successful test flight with his gigantic balloon, first named the &quot;City of New York&quot; and later renamed &quot;The Great Western&quot;, flying from Philadelphia to Medford, New York. Lowe would not be able to attempt a transatlantic flight until late Spring of the 1861, so Henry convinced him to take his balloon to a point more West and fly the balloon back to the eastern seaboard, an exercise that would keep his investors interested.

Lowe took several smaller balloons to Cincinnati, Ohio in March 1861. On 19 April, he launched on a fateful flight that landed him in Confederate South Carolina. With the Southern States seceding from the Union, during that winter and spring of 1861, and the onset of Civil War, Lowe abandoned further attempts at a trans-Atlantic crossing and, with Henry&#x27;s endorsement, went to Washington, D.C. to offer his services as an aeronaut to the Federal government. Henry submitted a letter to U.S. Secretary of War at the time Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania which carried Henry&#x27;s endorsement:

On Henry&#x27;s recommendation Lowe went on to form the United States Army/&quot;Union Army&quot; Balloon Corps and served two years with the Army of the Potomac as a Civil War &quot;Aeronaut&quot;.

===National Academy of Sciences===
On January 25, 1866, Henry was elected as vice president of the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected as president in January 1868. In 1873, he stated his intention of resigning from the role, but a letter signed by members of the academy prevented his resignation. In April 1878, he again stated his interest in resigning if his health did not improve in the next six months. He remained in the role until his death the following month. Upon his death, the academy dedicated a trust named the Joseph Henry Fund.

===Later years===

As a public scientist and director of the Smithsonian Institution, Henry received visits from other scientists and inventors who sought his advice. Henry was patient, kindly, self-controlled, and gently humorous. One such visitor was Alexander Graham Bell, who on 1 March 1875 carried a letter of introduction to Henry. Henry showed an interest in seeing Bell&#x27;s experimental apparatus, and Bell returned the following day. After the demonstration, Bell mentioned his untested theory on how to transmit human speech electrically by means of a &quot;harp apparatus&quot; which would have several steel reeds tuned to different frequencies to cover the voice spectrum. Henry said Bell had &quot;the germ of a great invention&quot;. Henry advised Bell not to publish his ideas until he had perfected the invention. When Bell objected that he lacked the necessary knowledge, Henry firmly advised: &quot;Get it!&quot;

On June 25, 1876, Bell&#x27;s experimental telephone, using a different design, was demonstrated at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, where Henry was one of the judges for electrical exhibits. On 13 January 1877, Bell demonstrated his instruments to Henry at the Smithsonian Institution and Henry invited Bell to demonstrate them again that night at the Washington Philosophical Society. Henry praised &quot;the value and astonishing character of Mr. Bell&#x27;s discovery and invention.&quot;

Henry died on May 13, 1878, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in the Georgetown section of northwest Washington, D.C. John Philip Sousa wrote the Transit of Venus March for the unveiling of the Joseph Henry statue in front of the Smithsonian Castle.

==Legacy==
Henry was a member of the United States Lighthouse Board from 1852 until his death. He was appointed chairman in 1871 and served in that position the remainder of his life. He was the only civilian to serve as chairman. The United States Coast Guard honored Henry for his work on lighthouses and fog signal acoustics by naming a cutter after him. The &quot;Joseph Henry&quot;, usually referred to as the &quot;Joe Henry&quot;, was launched in 1880 and was active until 1904.

In 1915, Henry was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx, New York.

Bronze statues of Henry and Isaac Newton represent science on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They are two of the 16 historical figures depicted in the reading room, each pair representing one of the 8 pillars of civilization.

In 1872, Almon Thompson named a mountain range in southeastern Utah after Henry. The Henry Mountains were the last mountain range to be added to the map of the 48 contiguous U.S. states.

At Princeton University, the Joseph Henry Laboratories and the Joseph Henry House are named for him.

After the Albany Academy moved out of its downtown building in the early 1930s, its old building in Academy Park was renamed Joseph Henry Memorial with a statue of him in front. It is now the main offices of the Albany City School District. In 1971, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; later it was included as a contributing property when the Lafayette Park Historic District was listed on the Register.

<text>&lt;br&gt;
Life (stylized as LIFE) is an American magazine originally launched in 1883 as a weekly publication. In 1972 it transitioned to publishing &quot;special&quot; issues before running as a monthly from 1978, until 2000. Since 2000 &quot;Life&quot; has transitioned to irregularly publishing &quot;special&quot; issues.

Originally published from 1883 to 1936 as a general-interest and humour publication, it featured contributions from many important writers, illustrators and cartoonists of its time including Charles Dana Gibson and Norman Rockwell. Henry Luce purchased the magazine in 1936 and with this the publication was relaunched, becoming the first all-photographic American news magazine. Its role in the history of photojournalism is considered one of its most important contributions to the world of publishing.

From 1936 to the 1960s, &quot;Life&quot; was a wide-ranging general-interest magazine known for its photojournalism. During this period it was one of the most popular magazines in the United States, its circulation regularly reaching a quarter of the American population.

==History==
===19th century===

&quot;Life&quot; was founded on January 4, 1883, in a New York City artist&#x27;s studio at 1155 Broadway, as a partnership between John Ames Mitchell and Andrew Miller. Mitchell held a 75% interest in the magazine with the remaining 25% held by Miller. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths. Miller served as secretary-treasurer of the magazine and managed the business side of the operation. Mitchell, a 37-year-old illustrator who used a $10,000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine, served as its publisher. He also created the first &quot;Life&quot; name-plate with cupids as mascots and later on, drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil. Then he took advantage of a new printing process using zinc-coated plates, which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork. This edge helped because &quot;Life&quot; faced stiff competition from the best-selling humor magazines &quot;Judge&quot; and &quot;Puck&quot;, which were already established and successful. Edward Sandford Martin was brought on as &quot;Life&quot;″s first literary editor; the recent Harvard University graduate was a founder of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

The motto of the first issue of &quot;Life&quot; was: &quot;While there&#x27;s Life, there&#x27;s hope.&quot; The new magazine set forth its principles and policies to its readers:

We wish to have some fun in this paper...We shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness that is drifting about in an unfriendly world...We shall have something to say about religion, about politics, fashion, society, literature, the stage, the stock exchange, and the police station, and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly, as truthfully, and as decently as we know how.

The magazine was a success and soon attracted the industry&#x27;s leading contributors, of which the most important was Charles Dana Gibson. Three years after the magazine was founded, the Massachusetts native first sold &quot;Life&quot; a drawing for $4: a dog outside his kennel howling at the Moon. Encouraged by a publisher, also an artist, Gibson was joined at &quot;Life&quot; by illustrators Palmer Cox, creator of the Brownie, A. B. Frost, Oliver Herford, and E. W. Kemble. &quot;Life&quot;″s literary roster included John Kendrick Bangs, James Whitcomb Riley, and Brander Matthews.

===20th century===
Mitchell was accused of anti-Semitism at a time of high rates of immigration to New York of Eastern European Jews. When the magazine blamed the theatrical team of Klaw &amp; Erlanger for Chicago&#x27;s Iroquois Theater Fire in 1903, many people complained. &quot;Life&quot; drama critic, James Stetson Metcalfe, was barred from the 47 Manhattan theatres controlled by the Theatrical Syndicate. &quot;Life&quot; published caricatures of Jews with large noses.

Several individuals would publish their first major works in &quot;Life&quot;. In 1908 Robert Ripley published his first cartoon in &quot;Life&quot;, 20 years before his &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; fame. Norman Rockwell&#x27;s first cover for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, &quot;Tain&#x27;t You&quot;, was published May 10, 1917. His paintings were featured on &quot;Life&quot; cover 28 times between 1917 and 1924. Rea Irvin, the first art director of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and creator of the character &quot;Eustace Tilley&quot;, began his career by drawing covers for &quot;Life&quot;.

This version of &quot;Life&quot; took sides in politics and international affairs, and published pro-American editorials. After Germany attacked Belgium in 1914, Mitchell and Gibson undertook a campaign to push the U.S. into the war. Gibson drew the Kaiser as a bloody madman, insulting Uncle Sam, sneering at crippled soldiers, and shooting Red Cross nurses.

Following Mitchell&#x27;s death in 1918, Gibson bought the magazine for $1 million. A little more than three years after purchasing &quot;Life&quot;, Gibson quit and turned the property over to publisher Clair Maxwell and treasurer Henry Richter.

In 1920, Gibson had selected former &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; staffer Robert E. Sherwood as editor. A WWI veteran and member of the Algonquin Round Table, Sherwood tried to inject sophisticated humor onto the pages. &quot;Life&quot; published Ivy League jokes, cartoons, flapper sayings and all-burlesque issues. Beginning in 1920, &quot;Life&quot; undertook a crusade against Prohibition. It also tapped the humorous writings of Frank Sullivan, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Franklin Pierce Adams and Corey Ford. Among the illustrators and cartoonists were Ralph Barton, Percy Crosby, Don Herold, Ellison Hoover, H. T. Webster, Art Young and John Held, Jr.

&quot;Life&quot; had 250,000 readers in 1920, but as the Jazz Age rolled into the Great Depression, the magazine lost money and subscribers. By the time editor George Eggleston took over, &quot;Life&quot; had switched from publishing weekly to monthly. Maxwell and Eggleston went to work revamping its editorial style to meet the times, which resulted in improved readership. However, &quot;Life&quot; had passed its prime and was sliding toward financial ruin. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, debuting in February 1925, copied many of the features and styles of &quot;Life&quot;; it recruited staff from its editorial and art departments. Another blow to &quot;Life&quot; circulation came from raunchy humor periodicals such as &quot;Ballyhoo&quot; and &quot;Hooey&quot;, which ran what can be termed &quot;outhouse&quot; gags. In 1933, &quot;Esquire&quot; joined &quot;Life&quot; competitors. In its final years, &quot;Life&quot; struggled to make a profit.

Announcing the end of &quot;Life&quot;, Maxwell stated: &quot;We cannot claim, like Mr. Gene Tunney, that we resigned our championship undefeated in our prime. But at least we hope to retire gracefully from a world still friendly.&quot;

For &quot;Life&quot; final issue in its original format, 80-year-old Edward Sandford Martin was recalled from editorial retirement to compose its obituary. He wrote:

That &quot;Life&quot; should be passing into the hands of new owners and directors is of the liveliest interest to the sole survivor of the little group that saw it born in January 1883 ... As for me, I wish it all good fortune; grace, mercy and peace and usefulness to a distracted world that does not know which way to turn nor what will happen to it next. A wonderful time for a new voice to make a noise that needs to be heard!

====Weekly news magazine====



In 1936, publisher Henry Luce purchased &quot;Life&quot; magazine for US$92,000 because he wanted the name for his company, Time Inc., to use. Time Inc. sold &quot;Life&quot; subscription list, features, and to &quot;Judge&quot;. Convinced that pictures could tell a story instead of just illustrating text, Luce launched the new &quot;Life&quot; on November 23, 1936, with John Shaw Billings and Daniel Longwell as founding editors. The third magazine published by Luce, after &quot;Time&quot; in 1923 and &quot;Fortune&quot; in 1930, &quot;Life&quot; developed as the definitive photo magazine in the U.S., giving as much space and importance to images as to words. The first issue of this version of &quot;Life&quot;, which sold for ten cents (worth $ in ), had five pages of Alfred Eisenstaedt&#x27;s photographs.

In planning the weekly news magazine, Luce circulated a confidential prospectus within Time Inc. in 1936, which described his vision for the new &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and what he viewed as its unique purpose. &quot;Life&quot; magazine was to be the first publication, with a focus on photographs, that enabled the American public,

To see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange things—machines, armies, multitudes, shadows in the jungle and on the moon; to see man&#x27;s work—his paintings, towers and discoveries; to see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to; the women that men love and many children; to see and take pleasure in seeing; to see and be amazed; to see and be instructed...
:—Prospectus for a New Magazine

Luce&#x27;s first issue cover depicted the Fort Peck Dam in Montana, a Works Progress Administration project, photographed by Margaret Bourke-White.

The format of &quot;Life&quot; in 1936 was a success: the text was condensed into captions for 50 pages of photographs. The magazine was printed on heavily coated paper and cost readers only a dime . The magazine&#x27;s circulation was beyond the company&#x27;s predictions, going from 380,000 copies of the first issue to more than one million a week four months later. It soon challenged &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, then the largest-circulation weekly in the country. The magazine&#x27;s success stimulated many imitators, such as &quot;Look&quot;, which was founded a year later in 1937 and ran until 1971.

Luce moved &quot;Life&quot; into its own building at 19 West 31st Street, a Beaux-Arts building constructed in 1894. Later &quot;Life&quot; moved its editorial offices to 9 Rockefeller Plaza.

A co-founder of the new &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Longwell served as managing editor from 1944 to 1946 and chairman of the board of editors until his retirement in 1954. He was credited for publishing Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Second World War&quot; and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;.

Luce also selected Edward Kramer Thompson, a stringer for &quot;Time&quot;, as assistant picture editor in 1937. From 1949 to 1961 he was the managing editor, and served as editor-in-chief for nearly a decade, until his retirement in 1970. His influence was significant during the magazine&#x27;s heyday, which was roughly from 1936 until the mid-1960s. Thompson was known for the free rein he gave his editors, particularly a &quot;trio of formidable and colorful women: Sally Kirkland, fashion editor; Mary Letherbee, movie editor; and Mary Hamman, modern living editor.&quot;

When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, &quot;Life&quot; covered the war closely. By 1944, of the 40 &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; war correspondents, seven were women: Americans Mary Welsh Hemingway, Margaret Bourke-White, Lael Tucker, Peggy Durdin, Shelley Smith Mydans, Annalee Jacoby, and Jacqueline Saix, an Englishwoman. (Saix&#x27;s name is often omitted from the list, but she and Welsh are the only women listed as part of the magazine&#x27;s team in a &quot;Times&quot; publisher&#x27;s letter, dated May 8, 1944.)

&quot;Life&quot; backed the war effort each week. In July 1942, &quot;Life&quot; launched its first art contest for soldiers and drew more than 1,500 entries, submitted by all ranks. Judges sorted out the best and awarded $1,000 in prizes. &quot;Life&quot; picked 16 for reproduction in the magazine. The National Gallery in Washington, D.C. agreed to put 117 entries on exhibition that summer. &quot;Life&quot;, also supported the military&#x27;s efforts to use artists to document the war. When Congress forbade the armed forces from using government money to fund artists in the field, &quot;Life&quot; privatized the programs, hiring many of the artists being let go by the Department of War (which would later become the Department of Defense). On December 7, 1960, &quot;Life&quot; managers later donated many of the works by such artists to the Department of War and its art programs, such as the United States Army Art Program.

Each week during World War II, the magazine brought photographs of the war to Americans; it had photographers from all theaters of war. The magazine was imitated in enemy propaganda using contrasting images of &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;.

In August 1942, writing about labor and racial unrest in Detroit, &quot;Life&quot; warned that &quot;the morale situation is perhaps the worst in the U.S. ... It is time for the rest of the country to sit up and take notice. For Detroit can either blow up Hitler or it can blow up the U.S.&quot; Mayor Edward Jeffries was outraged: &quot;I&#x27;ll match Detroit&#x27;s patriotism against any other city&#x27;s in the country. The whole story in &quot;Life&quot; is scurrilous ... I&#x27;d just call it a yellow magazine and let it go at that.&quot; The article was considered so dangerous to the war effort that it was censored from copies of the magazine sold outside North America.
The magazine hired war photographer Robert Capa in July 1943 to cover the Sicilian and Italian campaigns. A veteran of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine, Capa accompanied the first wave of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944, and returned with only a handful of images, many of them out of focus. The magazine wrote in the captions that the photos were fuzzy because Capa&#x27;s hands were shaking. He denied it, claiming that the darkroom had ruined his negatives. Later he poked fun at &quot;Life&quot; by titling his war memoir &quot;Slightly Out of Focus&quot; (1947). In 1954, Capa was killed after stepping on a land mine, while working for the magazine covering the First Indochina War. &quot;Life&quot; photographer Bob Landry also went in with the first wave at D-Day, &quot;but &quot;all&quot; of Landry&#x27;s film was lost, and his shoes to boot.&quot;

In a notable mistake, in its final edition just before the 1948 U.S. presidential election, the magazine printed a large photo showing U.S. presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey and his staff riding across San Francisco, California harbor entitled &quot;Our Next President Rides by Ferryboat over San Francisco Bay&quot;. Incumbent President Harry S. Truman won the election. Dewey was expected to win the election, and this mistake was also made by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

On May 10, 1950, the council of ministers in Cairo banned &quot;Life&quot; from Egypt forever. All issues on sale were confiscated. No reason was given, but Egyptian officials expressed indignation over the April 10, 1950 story about King Farouk of Egypt, entitled the &quot;Problem King of Egypt&quot;. The government considered it insulting to the country.

&quot;Life&quot; in the 1950s earned a measure of respect by commissioning work from top authors. After &quot;Life&quot; publication in 1952 of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, the magazine contracted with the author for a 4,000-word piece on bullfighting. Hemingway sent the editors a 10,000-word article, following his last visit to Spain in 1959 to cover a series of contests between two top matadors. The article was republished in 1985 as the novella, &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot;.

In February 1953, just a few weeks after leaving office, President Harry S. Truman announced that &quot;Life&quot; magazine would handle all rights to his memoirs. Truman said it was his belief that by 1954 he would be able to speak more fully on subjects pertaining to the role his administration played in world affairs. Truman observed that &quot;Life&quot; editors had presented other memoirs with great dignity; he added that &quot;Life&quot; had also made the best offer.

Beginning in 1953, a Spanish-language edition was published, titled Life en español. It had a circulation of over 300,000 in Latin America.

For his 1955 Museum of Modern Art traveling exhibition &quot;The Family of Man&quot;, which was to be seen by nine million visitors worldwide, curator Edward Steichen relied heavily on photographs from &quot;Life;&quot; 111 of the 503 pictures shown, constituting more than 20% as counted by Abigail Solomon-Godeau. His assistant Wayne Miller entered the magazine&#x27;s archive in late 1953 and spent an estimated nine months there. He searched through 3.5 million images, most in the form of original negatives (only in the last years of the war did the picture department start to print contact sheets of all assignments) and submitted to Steichen for selection many that had not been published in the magazine.

In November 1954, the actress Dorothy Dandridge was the first African-American woman to be featured on the cover of the magazine.

In 1957, R. Gordon Wasson, a vice president at J. P. Morgan, published an article in &quot;Life&quot; extolling the virtues of magic mushrooms. This prompted Albert Hofmann to isolate psilocybin in 1958 for distribution by Sandoz alongside LSD in the U.S., further raising interest in LSD in the mass media. Following Wasson&#x27;s report, Timothy Leary visited Mexico to try out the mushrooms, which were used in traditional religious rituals.

&quot;Life&quot;″s motto became &quot;To see Life; to see the world.&quot; The magazine produced many popular science serials, such as &quot;The World We Live In&quot; and &quot;The Epic of Man&quot; in the early 1950s. The magazine continued to showcase the work of notable illustrators, such as Alton S. Tobey, whose contributions included the cover for a 1958 series of articles on the history of the Russian Revolution.

As the 1950s drew to a close and television became more popular, the magazine was losing readers. In May 1959 it announced plans to reduce its regular news-stand price from 25 cents a copy to 20. With the increase in television sales and viewership, interest in news magazines was waning. &quot;Life&quot; had to try to create a new form.

In the 1960s, the magazine was filled with color photos of movie stars, President John F. Kennedy and his family, the war in Vietnam, and the Apollo program. Typical of the magazine&#x27;s editorial focus was a long 1964 feature on actress Elizabeth Taylor and her relationship with actor Richard Burton. Journalist Richard Meryman traveled with Taylor to New York, California, and Paris. &quot;Life&quot; ran a 6,000-word first-person article on the screen star.

&quot;I&#x27;m not a &#x27;sex queen&#x27; or a &#x27;sex symbol,&#x27; &quot; Taylor said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I want to be one. Sex symbol kind of suggests bathrooms in hotels or something. I do know I&#x27;m a movie star and I like being a woman, and I think sex is absolutely gorgeous. But as far as a sex goddess, I don&#x27;t worry myself that way... Richard is a very sexy man. He&#x27;s got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense... When we look at each other, it&#x27;s like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold... I think I ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs. I couldn&#x27;t just have a romance. It had to be a marriage.&quot;

In the 1960s, the magazine printed photographs by Gordon Parks. &quot;The camera is my weapon against the things I dislike about the universe and how I show the beautiful things about the universe,&quot; Parks recalled in 2000. &quot;I didn&#x27;t care about Life magazine. I cared about the people,&quot; he said.

A June 1964 Paul Welch &quot;Life&quot; article, &quot;Homosexuality In America&quot;, was the first time a national mainstream publication reported on gay issues. &quot;Life&quot;&#x27;s photographer was referred to the gay leather bar in San Francisco called the Tool Box for the article by Hal Call, who had long worked to dispel the myth that all gay men were effeminate. The article opened with a two-page spread of the mural of life-size leathermen in the bar, which had been painted by Chuck Arnett in 1962. The article described San Francisco as &quot;The Gay Capital of America&quot; and inspired many gay leathermen to move there.

On March 25, 1966, &quot;Life&quot; featured the drug LSD as its cover story. The drug had attracted attention among the counterculture and was not yet criminalized.

In March 1967, &quot;Life&quot; won the 1967 National Magazine Award, chosen by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
Despite the industry&#x27;s accolades and its coverage of the U.S. mission to the Moon in 1969, the magazine continued to lose circulation. Time Inc. announced in January 1971 its decision to reduce circulation from 8.5 million to 7 million, in an effort to offset shrinking advertising revenues. The following year, &quot;Life&quot; cut its circulation further, to 5.5 million beginning with the January 14, 1972 issue. &quot;Life&quot; was reportedly not losing money, but its costs were rising faster than its profits. &quot;Life&quot; lost credibility with many readers when it supported author Clifford Irving, whose fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes was revealed as a hoax in January 1972. The magazine had purchased serialization rights to Irving&#x27;s manuscript.

Industry figures showed that some 96% of &quot;Life&quot;&#x27;s circulation went to mail subscribers, with only 4% coming from the more profitable newsstand sales. Gary Valk was publisher when, on December 8, 1972, the magazine announced it would cease publication by the end of the year and lay off hundreds of staff. The weekly &quot;Life&quot; magazine published its last issue on December 29, 1972.

From 1972 to 1978, Time Inc. published ten &quot;Life Special Reports&quot; on such themes as &quot;The Spirit of Israel&quot;, &quot;Remarkable American Women&quot; and &quot;The Year in Pictures&quot;. With a minimum of promotion, these issues sold between 500,000 and 1 million copies at cover prices of up to $2.

Beginning with an October 1978 issue, &quot;Life&quot; was published as a monthly, with a new, modified logo. Although it remained a familiar red rectangle with the white type, the new version was larger, the lettering was closer together and the box surrounding it was smaller.

&quot;Life&quot; continued for the next 22 years as general-interest, news features magazine. In 1986, it marked its 50th anniversary under the Time Inc. umbrella with a special issue showing every &quot;Life&quot; cover starting from 1936, which included the issues published during the six-year hiatus in the 1970s.

The circulation in this era hovered around 1.5 million. The cover price in 1986 was $2.50 (). The publisher was Charles Whittingham; the editor was Philip Kunhardt.

In 1991, &quot;Life&quot; sent correspondents to the first Gulf War and published special issues of coverage. Four issues of this weekly, &quot;Life in Time of War&quot;, were published during the war.

&quot;Life&quot;″s online presence began in the 1990s as part of the Pathfinder.com network. The standalone Life.com site was launched on March 31, 2009, and closed on January 30, 2012. Life.com was developed by Andrew Blau and Bill Shapiro, the same team who launched the weekly newspaper supplement. While the archive of &quot;Life&quot;, known as the Life Picture Collection, was substantial, they searched for a partner who could provide significant contemporary photography. They approached Getty Images, the world&#x27;s largest licensor of photography. The site, a joint venture between Getty Images and &quot;Life&quot; magazine, offered millions of photographs from their combined collections. On the 50th anniversary of the night Marilyn Monroe sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to John F. Kennedy, Life.com presented Bill Ray&#x27;s iconic portrait of the actress, along with other rare photos.

Life.com later became a redirect to a small photo channel on Time.com. Life.com also maintains Tumblr and Twitter accounts and a presence on Instagram.

The magazine struggled financially and, in February 1993, &quot;Life&quot; announced the magazine would be printed in a smaller format starting with its July issue, which reintroduced the original &quot;Life&quot; logo.

&quot;Life&quot; reduced advertising prices by 34% in a bid to attract more advertisers. The magazine reduced its circulation guarantee for advertisers by 12% in July 1993, from 1.7 million to 1.5 million copies. The publishers in this era were Nora McAniff and Edward McCarrick. Daniel Okrent was the editor. &quot;Life&quot; now used the smaller size used by its longtime Time Inc. sister publication, &quot;Fortune&quot;.

Though experiencing financial trouble, in 1999 the magazine still made news by compiling lists to round out the 20th century. &quot;Life&quot; editors ranked their &quot;Most Important Events of the Millennium&quot; and a list of the &quot;100 Most Important People of the Millennium.&quot; This list was criticized for focusing on the West. Thomas Edison&#x27;s number one ranking was challenged since critics believed that other inventions, such as the internal combustion engine, the automobile, and electricity-making machines, for example, had greater effects on society than Edison&#x27;s. The top 100 list was criticized for mixing world-famous names, such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Louis Pasteur, and Leonardo da Vinci, with figures largely unknown outside of the United States (18 Americans compared to 13 Italian and French, and 11 English).

===21st century===
In March 2000, Time Inc. announced it would cease regular publication of &quot;Life&quot; with the May issue.

&quot;It&#x27;s a sad day for us here,&quot; Don Logan, chairman and chief executive of Time Inc., told CNN.com. &quot;It was still in the black,&quot; he said, noting that &quot;Life&quot; was increasingly spending more to maintain its monthly circulation level of approximately 1.5 million. &quot;&quot;Life&quot; was a general interest magazine and since its reincarnation, it had always struggled to find its identity, to find its position in the marketplace.&quot;

The magazine&#x27;s last issue featured a human interest story. In 1936, its first issue under Henry Luce featured a baby named George Story, with the headline &quot;Life Begins&quot;; over the years the magazine had published updates about the course of Story&#x27;s life as he married, had children, and pursued a career as a journalist. After &quot;Time&quot; announced its pending closure in March, George Story happened to die of heart failure on April 4, 2000. The last issue of &quot;Life&quot; was titled &quot;A Life Ends&quot;, featuring his story and how it had intertwined with the magazine over the years.

For &quot;Life&quot; subscribers, remaining subscriptions were honored with other Time Inc. magazines, such as &quot;Time&quot;. In January 2001, these subscribers received a special, &quot;Life&quot;-sized format of &quot;The Year in Pictures&quot; edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. It was a &quot;Life&quot; issue disguised under a &quot;Time&quot; logo on the front. Newsstand copies of this edition were published under the &quot;Life&quot; imprint.

While citing poor advertising sales and a difficult climate for selling magazine subscriptions, Time Inc. executives said a key reason for closing the title in 2000 was to divert resources to the company&#x27;s other magazine launches that year, such as &quot;Real Simple&quot;. Later that year, its owner, Time Warner, struck a deal with the Tribune Company for Times Mirror magazines, which included &quot;Golf, Ski, Skiing, Field &amp; Stream&quot;, and &quot;Yachting&quot;. AOL and Time Warner announced a $184 billion merger, the largest corporate merger in history, which was finalized in January 2001.

In 2001, Time Warner began publishing special newsstand &quot;megazine&quot; issues of &quot;Life&quot;, on topics such as the September 11 attacks and the Holy Land. These issues, which were printed on thicker paper, were more like softcover books than magazines.

Beginning in October 2004, &quot;Life&quot; was revived for a second time. It resumed weekly publication as a free supplement to U.S. newspapers, competing for the first time with the two industry heavyweights, &quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;USA Weekend&quot;. At its launch, it was distributed with more than 60 newspapers with a combined circulation of approximately 12 million. Among the newspapers to carry &quot;Life&quot; were the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Denver Post&quot;, and &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;. Time Inc. made deals with several major newspaper publishers to carry the &quot;Life&quot; supplement, including Knight Ridder and the McClatchy Company. The launch of &quot;Life&quot; as a weekly newspaper supplement was conceived by Andrew Blau, who served as the President of &quot;Life&quot;. Bill Shapiro was the founding editor of the weekly supplement.

This version of &quot;Life&quot; retained its trademark logo but sported a new cover motto, &quot;America&#x27;s Weekend Magazine.&quot; It measured 9½ x 11½ inches and was printed on glossy paper in full color. On September 15, 2006, &quot;Life&quot; was 19 pages of editorial content. The editorial content contained one full-page photo, of actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and one three-page, seven-photo essay, of Kaiju Big Battel. On March 24, 2007, Time Inc. announced that it would fold the magazine as of April 20, 2007, although it would keep the web site.

On November 18, 2008, Google began hosting an archive of the magazine&#x27;s photographs, as part of a joint effort with &quot;Life&quot;. Many images in this archive had never been published in the magazine. The archive of over six million photographs from &quot;Life&quot; is also available through Google Cultural Institute, allowing for users to create collections, and is accessible through Google image search. The full archive of the issues of the main run (1936–1972) is available through Google Book Search.

Special editions of &quot;Life&quot; are published on notable occasions, such as a &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; edition on the occasion of his winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, &quot;Paul at 75&quot; when Paul McCartney turned 75 in 2017, and &quot;&quot;Life&quot; Explores: The Roaring &#x27;20s&quot; in 2020.

&quot;Life&quot; is currently owned by Dotdash Meredith, which owns most former Time Inc. and Meredith Corporation assets.

In 2024 it was announced that Bedford Media (owned by Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner) would be reviving the magazine in an agreement with Dotdash Meredith.

<text>Advanced Package Tool (APT) is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on Debian and Debian-based Linux distributions. APT simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling source code.

==Usage==
APT is a collection of tools distributed in a package named &quot;apt&quot;. A significant part of APT is defined in a C++ library of functions; APT also includes command-line programs for dealing with packages, which use the library. Three such programs are codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3. They are commonly used in examples because they are simple and ubiquitous. The &quot;apt&quot; package is of &quot;important&quot; priority in all current Debian releases, and is therefore included in a default Debian installation. APT can be considered a front end to codice_4, friendlier than the older codice_5 front end. While codice_6 performs actions on individual packages, APT manages relations (especially dependencies) between them, as well as sourcing and management of higher-level versioning decisions (release tracking and version pinning).

APT is often hailed as one of Debian&#x27;s best features, which Debian developers attribute to the strict quality controls in Debian&#x27;s policy.

A major feature of APT is the way it calls codice_6 — it does topological sorting of the list of packages to be installed or removed and calls codice_6 in the best possible sequence. In some cases, it utilizes the codice_9 options of codice_6. However, it only does this when it is unable to calculate how to avoid the reason codice_6 requires the action to be forced.

===Installing software===
The user indicates one or more packages to be installed. Each package name is phrased as just the name portion of the package, not a fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system, codice_12 would be the argument provided, not codice_13). Notably, APT automatically gets and installs packages upon which the indicated package depends (if necessary). This was an original distinguishing characteristic of APT-based package management systems, as it avoided installation failure due to missing dependencies, a type of dependency hell.

Another distinction is the retrieval of packages from remote repositories. APT uses a location configuration file (codice_14) to locate the desired packages, which might be available on the network or a removable storage medium, for example, and retrieve them, and also obtain information about available (but not installed) packages.

APT provides other command options to override decisions made by apt-get&#x27;s conflict resolution system. One option is to force a particular version of a package. This can downgrade a package and render dependent software inoperable, so the user must be careful.

Finally, the codice_15 mechanism allows the user to create an alternative installation policy for individual packages.

The user can specify packages using a POSIX regular expression.

APT searches its cached list of packages and lists the dependencies that must be installed or updated.

APT retrieves, configures and installs the dependencies automatically.

Triggers are the treatment of deferred actions.

===Update, upgrade and dist-upgrade===
Usage modes of codice_1 and codice_2 that facilitate updating installed packages include:
* codice_18 is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The lists of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in codice_14. For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the codice_20 files, so that information about new and updated packages is available.
* codice_21 is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in codice_14. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version.
* codice_23 (codice_1) and codice_25 (codice_2), in addition to performing the function of codice_21, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; codice_1 and codice_2 have a &quot;smart&quot; conflict resolution system, and will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The codice_14 file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. aptitude has a smarter codice_25 feature called codice_23.

==Configuration and files==
codice_33 contains the APT configuration folders and files.

codice_34 is the APT Configuration Query program. codice_35 shows the configuration.

===Files===
* codice_14: Locations to fetch packages from.
* codice_37: Additional source list fragments.
* codice_38: APT configuration file.
* codice_39: APT configuration file fragments.
* codice_40: Directory with version preferences files. This is where &quot;pinning&quot; is specified, i.e. a preference to get certain packages from a separate source or from a different version of a distribution.
* codice_41: Storage area for retrieved package files.
* codice_42: Storage area for package files in transit.
* codice_43: Storage area for state information for each package resource specified in codice_44
* codice_45: Storage area for state information in transit.

==Sources==
APT relies on the concept of repositories in order to find software and resolve dependencies. For APT, a repository is a directory containing packages along with an index file. This can be specified as a networked or CD-ROM location. the Debian project keeps a central repository of over 50,000 software packages ready for download and installation.

Any number of additional repositories can be added to APT&#x27;s &quot;sources.list&quot; configuration file (codice_14) and then be queried by APT. Graphical front ends often allow modifying codice_44 more simply (codice_48). Once a package repository has been specified (like during the system installation), packages in that repository can be installed without specifying a source and will be kept up-to-date automatically.

In addition to network repositories, compact discs and other storage media (USB keydrive, hard disks...) can be used as well, using codice_49 or adding codice_50 URI to the source list file. codice_49 can specify a folder other than a CD-ROM, using the codice_52 option (i.e. a hard disk or a USB keydrive). The Debian CDs available for download contain Debian repositories. This allows non-networked machines to be upgraded. One can also use codice_53.

Problems may appear when several sources offer the same package(s). Systems that have such possibly conflicting sources can use APT pinning to control which sources should be preferred.

==APT pinning==
The &quot;APT pinning&quot; feature allows users to force APT to choose particular versions of packages which may be available in different versions from different repositories. This allows administrators to ensure that packages are not upgraded to versions which may conflict with other packages on the system, or that have not been sufficiently tested for unwelcome changes.

In order to do this, the &quot;pins&quot; in APT&#x27;s &quot;preferences&quot; file (codice_54) must be modified, although graphical front ends often make pinning simpler.

==Front ends==
Several other front ends to APT exist, which provide more advanced installation functions and more intuitive interfaces. These include:
* &quot;Synaptic&quot;, a GTK graphical user interface 
* &quot;Ubuntu Software Center&quot;, a GTK graphical user interface developed by the Ubuntu project
* &quot;aptitude&quot;, a console client with CLI and ncurses-based TUI interfaces
* &quot;KPackage&quot;, part of KDE
* &quot;Adept package manager&quot;, a graphical user interface for KDE (deb, rpm, bsd)
* &quot;PackageKit&quot;, a D-Bus frontend, maintained by freedesktop.org, powers GNOME Software and KDE Discover.
* &quot;GDebi&quot;, a GTK-based tool sponsored for Ubuntu. (There is also a Qt version, available in the Ubuntu repositories as gdebi-kde.)
* &quot;apt-cdrom&quot;, a way to add a new CDROM to APT&#x27;s list of available repositories (sources.lists). It is necessary to use apt-cdrom to add CDs to the APT system, it cannot be done by hand.
* &quot;apt-zip&quot;, a way to use apt with removable media, specifically USB flash drives.
* &quot;aptURL&quot;, an Ubuntu software package that enables end-user applications to install with a single-click through a browser.
* &quot;Cydia&quot;, a package manager for jailbroken iOS based on APT (ported to iOS as part of the Telesphoreo project).
* &quot;Sileo&quot;, like Cydia, a package manager for jailbroken iOS based on newer versions of APT (ported to iOS by the Electra team)
* &quot;gnome-apt&quot;, a GTK/GNOME-widget-based graphical front end. Developed by Havoc Pennington
* &quot;Muon discover (previous Muon software center)&quot;, a Qt-based graphical user interface
* &quot;Hildon application manager (Maemo application)&quot;, a Maemo front end
* &quot;apticron&quot;, a service designed to be run via cron to email notices of pending updates to a system administrator (sysadmin).
* &quot;APT Daemon&quot;, a front end that runs as a service to allow users to install software through PolicyKit and is in turn the framework used by Ubuntu software center (along with the Linux Mint software manager).
* &quot;Package installer&quot;, part of MX Linux.
* &quot;Apt-offline&quot;: A convenient way to make any available non-containerized change to any Debian-type Linux installation without using a direct Internet connection. However, a temporary direct connection can be required, such as to install Apt-offline on some of the relevant types of Linux, and to add PPA&#x27;s to the sources-list.

APT front ends can:
* search for new packages;
* upgrade packages;
* install or remove packages and
* upgrade the whole system to a new release.

APT front ends can list the dependencies of packages being installed or upgraded, ask the administrator if packages recommended or suggested by newly installed packages should be installed too, automatically install dependencies and perform other operations on the system such as removing obsolete files and packages.

==History==
The original effort that led to the codice_2 program was the codice_5 replacement project known by its codename &quot;Deity&quot;. This project was commissioned in 1997 by Brian White, the Debian release manager at the time. The first functional version of codice_2 was called codice_58 and was only intended to be a test program for the core library functions that would underpin the new user interface (UI).

Much of the original development of APT was done on Internet relay chat (IRC), so records have been lost. The &#x27;Deity creation team&#x27; mailing list archives include only the major highlights.

The &#x27;Deity&#x27; name was abandoned as the official name for the project due to concerns over the religious nature of the name. The APT name was eventually decided after considerable internal and public discussion. Ultimately the name was proposed on IRC, accepted and then finalized on the mailing lists.

APT was introduced in 1998 and original test builds were circulated on IRC. The first Debian version that included it was Debian 2.1, released on 9 March 1999.

In the end the original goal of the Deity project of replacing the codice_5 user interface was a failure. Work on the user interface portion of the project was abandoned (the user interface directories were removed from the concurrent versions system) after the first public release of codice_2. The response to APT as a codice_61 method and a command line utility was so great and positive that all development efforts focused on maintaining and improving the tool. It was not until much later that several independent people built user interfaces on top of codice_62.

Eventually, a new team picked up the project, began to build new features and released version 0.6 of APT which introduced the Secure APT feature, using strong cryptographic signing to authenticate the package repositories.

==Variants==
APT was originally designed as a front end for dpkg to work with Debian&#x27;s codice_63 packages. A version of APT modified to also work with the RPM Package Manager system was released as APT-RPM. The Fink project has ported APT to Mac OS X for some of its own package management tasks, and APT is also available in OpenSolaris.

==apt-file==
apt-file is a command, packaged separately from APT, to find which package includes a specific file, or to list all files included in a package on remote repositories.

<text>MCI Communications Corporation (originally Microwave Communications, Inc.) was a telecommunications company headquartered in Washington, D.C. that was at one point the second-largest long-distance provider in the United States.

MCI was instrumental in legal and regulatory changes that led to the breakup of the Bell System and introduced competition in the U.S. telephone industry. Its MCI Mail, launched in 1983, was one of the first Email services and its MCI.net was an integral part of the Internet backbone.

The company was acquired by WorldCom in 1998.

==History==
===Founding===
MCI was founded as Microwave Communications, Inc. on October 3, 1963, with John D. Goeken being named the company&#x27;s first president. The initial business plan was for the company to build a series of microwave radio relay stations between Chicago, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri. The relay stations would then be used to interface with limited-range two-way radios used by truckers along U.S. Route 66 or by barges on the Illinois Waterway. The long-distance communication service would then be marketed to shipping companies that were too small to build their own private relay systems. In addition to the radio relay services, MCI soon made plans to offer voice, computer information, and data communication services for business customers unable to afford AT&amp;T&#x27;s TELPAK service.

Hearings on the company&#x27;s initial license application between February 13, 1967, and April 19, 1967, resulted in a recommendation of approval by the FCC.

On June 26, 1968, the FCC ruled in the Carterfone case that AT&amp;T&#x27;s rules prohibiting private two-way radio connections to a telephone network were illegal. AT&amp;T quickly sought a reversal of the ruling, and when the FCC denied the request, AT&amp;T brought suit against the FCC in the United States courts of appeals. The FCC&#x27;s decision was upheld, thus creating a new industry: privately manufactured (non-Bell) devices could be connected to the telephone network as long as the manufacturer met interface standards.

In 1968, William G. McGowan, an investor from New York with experience in raising venture capital, made an investment into the company large enough to pay all outstanding debts and create a cash reserve. McGowan received a seat on the board of directors. Microwave Communications of America, Inc (MICOM) was incorporated on August 8, 1968 as an umbrella corporation to help build a nationwide microwave relay system.

===Licensing and build-out===
On October 28, 1968, Hyrum Rex Lee became an FCC Commissioner and MCI began a series of submissions including a proposal for a low-cost educational television network designed to show MCI as being more flexible to public needs than AT&amp;T. While MCI was performing this lobbying, the President&#x27;s Task Force on Communication Policy issued a report recommending that specialized common carriers be allowed free access into the private line business.

On 14 August 1969, the FCC issued a final ruling on Docket 16509, MCI&#x27;s licensing request to begin building microwave relay stations between Chicago and St. Louis. By a decision of 4-to-3 MCI was licensed for operation. This ruling was quickly appealed by AT&amp;T, and after a denial of the appeal by the commission, AT&amp;T filed a civil suit with the United States courts of appeals to have the ruling overturned.

The company then began to form subsidiary corporations and file applications with the FCC to create microwave relays between other city pairs. Between September 1969 and February 1971, 15 new regional carriers were created, allowing for interconnection between several major cities in the United States.

In July 1969, MICOM purchased a participating interest in Interdata, an independent regional carrier that was applying to build a microwave relay chain between New York City and Washington, D.C.

MCI began selling data transmission services to paying customers on January 1, 1972.

To pay for the microwave transmission and relay equipment needed for build-out, MICOM began a series of private stock offerings in May 1971. In July 1971, MICOM was restructured into MCI Communications, and the company began the process of absorbing the regional carriers into a single corporation.

MCI became a public company via an initial public offering on June 22, 1972.

In early 1971, MCI and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company created a joint venture which was the first company to request FCC authorization as a Specialized Common Carrier using satellite-based communications; satellite service would save the company from building thousands of miles of terrestrial network facilities. A year later, Comsat Corp. entered the venture which was renamed CML Satellite Corp. In need of cash, MCI sold its share of the venture to IBM in 1974. Lockheed also subsequently sold its share to IBM. IBM and Comsat brought in Aetna as a third partner and renamed the company Satellite Business Systems (SBS). IBM later acquired the remainder of the company and sold it back to MCI in March 1986 for $376 million in MCI stock.

Illinois Bell refused to interconnect an MCI long haul interstate circuit and, in January 1974, MCI filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;T. On June 13, 1980, a jury in Chicago awarded MCI $1.8 billion in damages to be paid by AT&amp;T, reduced to $113 million in 1985 on appeal. The suit, coupled with the Department of Justice antitrust suit also brought against AT&amp;T, eventually led to the voluntary breakup of the Bell System.

In 1975, as a result of the Carterfone decision, MCI began offering switched voice telecommunications in direct competition with AT&amp;T, using a combination of its own microwave circuits and leased circuits from AT&amp;T. By 1977, the company operated several switches manufactured by Danray (later part of Nortel).
In 1982, MCI worked with Ally &amp; Gargano to create what &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; referred to in 1997 as one of the 50 best commercials of all time. MCI hired the same actors used in an AT&amp;T commercial in 1981. In the AT&amp;T version, the son calls his mother and, when asked why, replied “just ‘cuz I love you”, which was not a common reason to make an expensive long-distance call, causing the mother to cry. In the MCI version, when the husband asked the wife why she was crying, she replied &quot;I just received my phone bill&quot;... after which an announcer&#x27;s voice stated &quot;You&#x27;re not talking too much, you&#x27;re just paying too much. MCI: The Nation&#x27;s New Long Distance Telephone Company.&quot;

In 1982, MCI acquired Western Union International, the cable systems properties and the right-of-way rights of Western Union&#x27;s telegraph lines from Xerox for $185 million. Xerox had acquired it for $279 million in 1979. It was renamed MCI International and its headquarters were moved from New York City to Westchester County, New York.

On September 27, 1983, an MCI division led by Vint Cerf, one of the developers of the TCP/IP protocol, launched MCI Mail, one of the first email services, and a data network using the CCITT X.25 packet switching protocol.

In 1983, Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert raised a $1.1 billion hybrid security, at the time the largest debt financing in history, for the company.

In 1984, MCI became the first company to deploy single-mode optical fiber (the standard had been multi-mode optical fiber), which was manufactured by Siecor, a joint venture between Siemens Telecom and Corning Glass Company. Referred to as MAFOS (Mid-Atlantic Fiber Optic System), the fiber cable ran between New York City and Washington D.C. Eventually, single-mode fiber became the standard for US telecommunications carriers.

In 1987, MCI acquired RCA Global from General Electric.

In 1987, MCI partnered with IBM and Merit Network (a network run by triad of universities in Michigan) to respond to a National Science Foundation proposal to develop a high-speed telecommunications network called National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET). This network used the TCP/IP protocol that had been developed by the United States Department of Defense ARPANet and was the immediate forerunner to the Internet. In 1988, Vint Cerf was working at CNRI and obtained support from MCI and permission from the Federal Networking Council to interconnect MCI Mail with the NSFNET. In 1989, it was the first commercial e-mail service to do so. Immediately, most of the other commercial e-mail providers also got permission to interconnect to the Internet, leading to their interconnection with each other. In 1994, NSF announced that it would terminate the NSFNET operation and support the development of Network Access Point operation to link the networks that had been interconnected by NSFNET. NSF also proposed that an academic research network be built called the Very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) and MCI responded. MCI also built a separate commercial Internet service, MCI.net, which was an integral part of the global Internet backbone. It was sold to Cable &amp; Wireless plc as part of the merger of MCI with Worldcom in 1998.

In 1990, the company acquired Telecom*USA and became the second-largest telecommunications company in the U.S., with a fiber-optic network spanning more than 46,000 miles. The company offered more than 50 services in more than 150 countries that included voice, data, and telex transmissions, MCI Mail, and MCI Fax.

In March 1991, the company introduced the &quot;Friends &amp; Family&quot; plan, whereby customers received a reduced rate when calling numbers they had included in their &quot;calling circle&quot;, which could contain up to 20 MCI customers.

In 1993, the company introduced a collect call service called &quot;1-800-COLLECT&quot;. Actors Phil Hartman, Chris Rock, and Arsenio Hall starred in some of its commercials, but the most commonly used spokesperson was the fictional Eva Save-a-lot, played by actress Alyssa Milano. The service was sold to viiz in 2016.

In 1995, the company partnered with News Corporation on a satellite television venture, known as American Sky Broadcasting (named after Murdoch&#x27;s UK DBS company). It intended to broadcast from two satellites at the 110 degree orbital slot; but the venture never started broadcasting. The orbital slot and an uplink center were sold to EchoStar in 1999; the planned satellites Tempo 1 and Tempo 2 were sold to PrimeStar, whose assets were sold to DirecTV in 1999.

In October 1994, BT Group acquired 20% of the company for $4.3 billion.

In November 1995, MCI introduced 1-800-MUSIC-NOW, a short-lived telephone-based and online music store.

==Purchase by WorldCom==

BT made an offer to purchase the rest of the company in November 1996 for $22 billion. In October 1997, GTE, now a part of Verizon, made a bid to purchase MCI for $28 billion in cash. WorldCom offered $34.7 billion in stock, higher than either the BT or GTE offers, which was accepted by MCI on November 10, 1997. On September 15, 1998 the transaction was consummated and the merged company renamed MCI WorldCom. Two years later, the &quot;MCI&quot; part was dropped.

Following a major accounting scandal, WorldCom filed bankruptcy in 2002 and the company was renamed MCI Inc. upon its exit from bankruptcy in 2003. Before then, however, many executive posts were taken over by holdovers from the old MCI. After the name change, one of those executives said, &quot;We&#x27;re taking our company back.&quot;

<text>dpkg is the software at the base of the package management system in the free operating system Debian and its numerous derivatives. codice_1 is used to install, remove, and provide information about .deb packages.

codice_1 (Debian Package) itself is a low-level tool. APT (Advanced Package Tool), a higher-level tool, is more commonly used than codice_1 as it can fetch packages from remote locations and deal with complex package relations, such as dependency resolution. Frontends for APT, like aptitude (ncurses) and synaptic (GTK), are used for their friendlier interfaces.

The Debian package &quot;dpkg&quot; provides the codice_1 program, as well as several other programs necessary for run-time functioning of the packaging system, including codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9 and codice_10. It also includes the programs such as codice_11 and codice_12. The Debian package &quot;dpkg-dev&quot; includes the numerous build tools described below.

==History==
The first attempt at a package management system for Linux was possibly the development of StopAlop by Greg Wettstein at the Roger Maris Cancer Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It provided inspiration for the creation of dpkg.
dpkg was originally created by Ian Murdock in January 1994 as a Shell script. Matt Welsh, Carl Streeter and Ian Murdock then rewrote it in Perl, and then later the main part was rewritten in C by Ian Jackson in 1994. The name &quot;dpkg&quot; was originally a shortening of &quot;Debian package&quot;, but the meaning of that phrase has evolved significantly, as dpkg the software is orthogonal to the deb package format as well as the Debian Policy Manual which defines how Debian packages behave in Debian.

==Development tools==
dpkg-dev contains a series of development tools required to unpack, build and upload Debian source packages. These include:
* dpkg-source packs and unpacks the source files of a Debian package.
* dpkg-gencontrol reads the information from an unpacked Debian tree source and generates a binary package control package, creating an entry for this in Debian/files.
* dpkg-shlibdeps calculates the dependencies of runs with respect to libraries.
* dpkg-genchanges reads the information from an unpacked Debian tree source that once constructed creates a control file (.changes).
* dpkg-buildpackage is a control script that can be used to construct the package automatically.
* dpkg-distaddfile adds a file input to debian/files.
* dpkg-parsechangelog reads the changes file (changelog) of an unpacked Debian tree source and creates a conveniently prepared output with the information for those changes.

==dselect==

The dpkg source package also contains dselect, a frontend software.

==install-info==

The codice_13 program used to be included in the dpkg software package, but was later removed as it became developed and distributed separately, as part of GNU Texinfo.

==wpkg==

wpkg was created as a dpkg look-alike that would run under the Microsoft Windows operating system. It retained .deb file format compatibility. It subsequently evolved to include functionality similar to parts of the APT suite, improved repository management, distribution management and was ported to Linux and Unix-like systems. , the most recent release of the software was in 2015.

<doc id="187486" wikidata="Q2120090" url="?curid=187486" title="Pyrrhic">
<text>A pyrrhic (; &quot;pyrrichios&quot;, from πυρρίχη &quot;pyrrichē&quot;) is a metrical foot used in formal poetry. It consists of two unaccented, short syllables. It is also known as a dibrach.

==In classical Greek poetry==

Although the pyrrhic by itself is not used in analysis of classical Greek prosody, examples exist of epigrammatic poems that employ nothing but short syllables (except at line ends where a syllable always scans long), creating a pyrrhic-like effect, such as an epigram addressed to the Cynic philosopher Diogenes and recorded in the Suda:
.


==Poetic use in English==

Tennyson used pyrrhics and spondees quite frequently, for example, in &quot;In Memoriam&quot;:

When the blood creeps and the nerves prick.

&quot;When the&quot; and &quot;and the&quot; in the second line may be considered as pyrrhics (also analyzable as ionic meter).

Pyrrhics alone are not used to construct an entire poem in English due to the monotonous effect. Edgar Allan Poe observed that many experts rejected it from English metrics and concurred:The pyrrhic is rightfully dismissed. Its existence in either ancient or modern rhythm is purely chimerical, and the insisting on so perplexing a nonentity as a foot of two short syllables, affords, perhaps, the best evidence of the gross irrationality and subservience to authority which characterise our Prosody.

==War dance==

By extension, this rhythmic pattern apparently formed the basis of an identically named ancient Greek war dance. Proclus thought it was the same as the &quot;hyporcheme&quot; (&quot;hyporchēma&quot;), while Athenaeus distinguished them; this may have depended on whether song accompanied the dance. Citing Aristoxenus, Athenaeus said the pyrrhic is a Spartan dance for boys carrying spears to prepare for war, and noted the intense speed of the dance. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot;, the dance is described as representing the offensive and defensive movements in battle. Other Greeks associated it with Dionysus. There are a number of Classical and later reliefs that depict pyrrhic dancers, even if the motif was not widely used during the Roman era.

Seth Tisue, on his coverage of Jandek discography, stated that the cover was &quot;Almost identical to &quot;Graven Image&quot;. It looks like he stepped about ten feet to one side—you&#x27;re looking down the driveway along the side of the house, instead of just at the back of the house—and took another photo.&quot;

<doc id="187489" wikidata="Q7994489" url="?curid=187489" title="White Box Requiem">
<text>White Box Requiem is the 25th album by Jandek, and his only for the year 1996. Released as Corwood Industries #0763, it is essentially a &quot;concept album&quot; about death, loss, and a man who opens a mysterious white &quot;Pandora&#x27;s box&quot;, which some have speculated is a coffin. There are 14 songs with acoustic guitar, half of them with vocals. The instrumental pieces are sparse and experiment with echo, with &quot;restless&quot; passages that music critic Andre Salles has described as &quot;consistently inventive atonal plonking that never sits still&quot;. 

After not releasing any music in 1995, Jandek returned with &quot;White Box Requiem&quot; the following year.

==Track listing==
== Reception ==
Writing for AllMusic, Skip Jansen calls the album a collection of &quot;fractured songs...drenched in the atonal ambience that makes his contribution such a standout. For lo-fi wayward mavericks, it doesn&#x27;t come more outside than this&quot;.

Seth Tisue, a Jandek discographer, has characterized &quot;White Box Requiem&quot; as &quot;almost catatonically mopey and meandering... He sounds hopeless.&quot; In contrast to &quot;Blue Corpse&quot; (1987), which Tisue describes as &quot;a record about emotional devastation with some perspective in it&quot;, in &quot;White Box Requiem&quot;, the emotion comes &quot;from totally inside it&quot;.

In a review of &quot;White Box Requiem&quot; for &quot;In Music We Trust&quot;, Gary Gold writes, &quot;[Jandek&#x27;s] songs remain as starkly beautiful as a David Lynch opening shot, and the accompaniment (imagine handing your most ornery nine-year-old nephew a $29 guitar before locking him for three days in a windowless basement) remains as brutally poignant as ever.&quot;

<doc id="187495" wikidata="Q2739748" url="?curid=187495" title="Carson Daly">
<text>Carson Jones Daly (born June 22, 1973) is an American television host, radio personality, producer, and television personality. From 1998 to 2003, Daly was a VJ on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; (TRL), and a DJ for the Southern California-based radio station 106.7 KROQ-FM. In 2002, Daly joined NBC, where he hosted and produced the late-night talk show &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;, and occasionally hosting special event programming for NBC, such as the Macy&#x27;s 4th of July Fireworks show, and executive producing &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve with Carson Daly&quot; from Times Square beginning in 2003.

Daly has since been involved in more prominent roles at NBC, such as becoming host for its reality music competition &quot;The Voice&quot; in 2011 and joining NBC&#x27;s morning show &quot;Today&quot; as a social media correspondent in 2013, with his role increasing in subsequent years becoming a co-host.

Daly has also worked as a radio DJ. He was a nighttime host on the Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM and beginning in 2010, began hosting &quot;Mornings with Carson Daly&quot; on its sister station KAMP-FM. Daly also hosts a weekly top 30 countdown show &quot;The Daly Download with Carson Daly&quot; which is produced by Audacy, Inc. (formerly CBS Radio and is the parent of KAMP-FM) and syndicated though Westwood One. The program airs on Saturday and Sunday mornings in a 3–4 hour edition on CHR/hot AC radio stations.

==Early life==
Daly was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Coachella Valley TV personality Pattie Daly Caruso (1944–2017), and car salesman Jim &quot;J.D.&quot; Daly. His mother is from Fayetteville, North Carolina. His father died from bladder cancer when Carson was a child, and his mother married Richard Caruso (1932–2017).

Daly attended Santa Monica High School and was a member of the school&#x27;s golf team before graduating in 1991. He attended Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles but dropped out to pursue a pro golf career. He is of Irish descent and has worked with Guinness on local &quot;Proposition 3–17&quot; to make Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day an official holiday. Daly served as an intern to Jimmy Kimmel in radio. He began his radio career at College of the Desert and as an intern at the former KCMJ FM (now KKUU) under the name &quot;Kid Carson&quot;.

==Career==

Daly began his broadcasting career at the radio station KOME in San Jose, California. Daly was then given the 6-10 PM time slot at KOME&#x27;s sister station KROQ in Los Angeles. It was during Daly&#x27;s time at KROQ that MTV recruited Daly to serve as a VJ during MTV&#x27;s summer beach house programming called &quot;Motel California&quot;.

At the end of the summer of 1997, MTV hired Daly as a permanent VJ, a position which required Daly to relocate to New York. Once in New York, Daly began hosting &quot;MTV Live&quot;.
Daly hosted MTV&#x27;S &quot;TRL&quot; from 1998 to 2003. TRL was based on two previous shows, &quot;Total Request&quot; and &quot;MTV Live&quot;, both of which had also been hosted by Daly. Daly&#x27;s role as host of the popular live program included introducing the top 10 videos of the day and interviewing celebrity guests.

In 2002, &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; debuted. The show was shot on the same set as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; until 2005, when it moved to Los Angeles.

Beginning in 2003–2004, Daly began hosting a New Year&#x27;s Eve special for NBC, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve with Carson Daly&quot;.

In 2011, Daly began hosting and producing NBC&#x27;s reality music competition &quot;The Voice&quot;. Daly&#x27;s duties as host included watching blind auditions alongside contestant&#x27;s family members. As a producer of &quot;The Voice&quot;, Daly has won four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program, first in 2013 and again from 2015, 2016, and 2017.

When social media correspondent Christina Milian departed the show in 2013, Daly became the sole host.

Daly appeared in a brief but pivotal role in the first episode of &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;. While in the hospital after being hit by a car, Earl learns about karma from watching an episode of &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; where Daly claims that his success is a direct result of doing good things for other people. Earl is thus inspired by Carson Daly to turn his own life around, and sets out to make up for his many past wrongs.

Daly had a small role on Dave Chappelle&#x27;s show &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;.

In September 2013, Daly became the orange room anchor (social media reporter) on the &quot;Today&quot; show, as well as serving as a fill-in anchor for Willie Geist and the show&#x27;s weekend edition (&quot;Weekend Today&quot;).

Daly is a founding partner, along with Jonathan Rifkind, Jonathan B. Davis, and Bam Margera, of an independent record label, 456 Enterprise &amp; Entertainment, which released the &quot;Viva La Bands&quot; compilations.

==Personal life==
Carson Daly resides in the Village of Flower Hill, on Long Island.

In March 2000, Tara Reid met Daly on the set of &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, and they began dating. They shared an apartment in New York City and Daly proposed on October 29. In June 2001, Reid and Daly broke off their engagement.

Daly became engaged to Siri Pinter, a food blogger, in 2013. Her father is actor Mark Pinter. The couple married on December 23, 2015 and have four children.

Daly is Catholic.

Daly has stated that he struggles with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.

<text>Sefer Yetzirah ( &quot;Sēp̄er Yəṣīrā&quot;, &quot;Book of Formation&quot;, or &quot;Book of Creation&quot;) is a work of Jewish mysticism. Early commentaries, such as the &quot;Kuzari&quot;, treated it as a treatise on mathematical and linguistic theory, as opposed to one about Kabbalah. The word &quot;Yetzirah&quot; is more literally translated as &quot;Formation&quot;; the word &quot;B&#x27;riah&quot; is used for &quot;Creation&quot;. The book is traditionally ascribed to the patriarch Abraham, although others attribute its writing to Rabbi Akiva or Adam. Modern scholars have not reached consensus on the question of its origins. According to Saadia Gaon, the objective of the book&#x27;s author was to convey in writing how the things of our universe came into existence. Conversely, Judah Halevi asserts that the main objective of the book, with its various examples, is to give humans the means to understand the unity and omnipotence of God, which appear multiform on the one hand, and yet, are uniform.

The famous opening words of the book are as follows:

== Origin ==
A cryptic story in the Babylonian Talmud states,

According to modern historians, the origin of the text is unknown, and hotly debated. Some scholars believe it might have an early medieval origin, while others cite earlier traditions appearing in the book. Most contemporary scholars date the text&#x27;s authorship to the Talmudic period.

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, the essential elements of the book are characteristic of the 3rd or 4th century; for a work of this nature, composed in the Geonic period, could have been cast only in the form of Jewish gnosis, which remained stationary after the 4th century, if indeed it had not already become extinct. The historical origin of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; was placed by Richard August Reitzenstein in the 2nd century BCE. According to Christopher P. Benton, the Hebrew grammatical form places its origin closer to the period of the Mishnah, around the 2nd century CE.

The division of the letters into the three classes of vowels, mutes, and sonants also appears in Hellenic texts.

The date and origin of the book can not be definitely determined as long as there is no critical text of it. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; (Mantua, 1562) contains two recensions, which were used in the main by the commentators of the book as early as the middle of the 10th century. The shorter version (Mantua I.) was annotated by Dunash ibn Tamim or by Jacob ben Nissim, while Saadia Gaon and Shabbethai Donnolo wrote commentaries on the longer recension (Mantua II.). The shorter version was also used by most of the later commentators, such as Judah ben Barzillai and Nachmanides, and it was, therefore, published in the ordinary editions. The longer recension, on the other hand, was little known, the form given in the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; being probably a copy of the text found in Donnolo&#x27;s commentary. In addition to these two principal recensions of the text, both versions contain a number of variant readings that have not yet been examined critically.

As regards the relation of the two recensions, it may be said that the longer form contains entire paragraphs which are not found in the shorter, while the divergent arrangement of the material often modifies the meaning essentially. Although the longer recension doubtless contains additions and interpolations which did not form part of the original text, it has many valuable readings which seem older and better than the corresponding passages in the shorter version, so that a critical edition of the text must consider both recensions.

=== Legendary origin ===
Mystics assert that the biblical patriarch Abraham used the same method to create the calf prepared for the three angels who foretold Sarah&#x27;s pregnancy in the biblical account at Genesis 18:7. All the miraculous creations attributed to other rabbis of the Talmudic era are ascribed by rabbinic commentators to the use of the same book.

&quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;″s appendix (6:15) declares that Abraham was the recipient of the divine revelation of mystic lore; so that the rabbis of the classical rabbinic era and philosophers such as Shabbethai Donnolo and Judah HaLevi never doubted that Abraham was the author of the book.

In &quot;Pardes Rimonim&quot;, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (Ramak) mentions a minority opinion that Rabbi Akiva authored it, and takes it to mean that Abraham wrote it and Akiva redacted it to its current form. Jewish Lore attributes the Kabbalah to Adam, and holds that &quot;[f]rom Adam it passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham, the friend of God.&quot;

In a manuscript in the British Museum, the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; is called the &quot;Hilkhot Yetzirah&quot; and declared to be esoteric lore not accessible to anyone but the truly pious.

=== Manuscripts ===

The &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; exists in many manuscripts, generally falling in categories known as:

# The Short Version,
# The Long Version,
# The Saadia Version, and
# The Gra Version

The long version contains entire paragraphs which are not found in the short version, while the divergent arrangement of the material often modifies the meaning essentially. The short version comprises about 1300 words and was annotated by Dunash ibn Tamim, and it formed the basis of the first printed Hebrew edition, published in Mantua in the year 1562, and most main versions printed thereafter. The long version is 2500 words and is present with a commentary by Shabbethai Donnolo. It is frequently printed with this commentary as an appendix to editions of the short Version. In the 13th century, Abraham Abulafia noted the existence of both of these versions.

The Mantua 1562 edition was printed with the short version surrounded by commentaries attributed to Abraham ben David (outside of the page), Nachmanides (bottom of the page) and Moses Botarel (inside of the page; the printer notes that Botarel followed the first two rabbis and also collected all other commentaries that preceded him). An appendix following this contains a pair of commentaries printed side by side, one attributed to Eleazar of Worms) on the outside of the pages and the other to Saadia Gaon on the inside of the pages. At the end of the volume is found the long version.

In the middle of the 16th century, the leader of the school of Safed kabbalists, Moses Cordovero, established a working text based on ten separate manuscripts. His student and successor Isaac Luria further redacted this to harmonize it with the &quot;Zohar&quot;, and then in the 18th century, the Vilna Gaon, known as &quot;the Gra&quot;, further redacted it. This text is called the Gra or ARI-Gra version.

In the 10th century, Saadia Gaon wrote his commentary based on a manuscript which was a reorganized copy of the Longer Version, now called the &quot;Saadia Version&quot;. This was translated into French by Lambert and thence into English by Scott Thompson. This version and commentary was more philosophical in nature rather than mystical and had virtually no impact on subsequent kabbalists.

== Influence ==
The &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; is devoted to speculations concerning God&#x27;s creation of the world. The ascription of its authorship to the biblical patriarch Abraham shows the high esteem that it enjoyed for centuries. It may even be said that this work had a greater influence on the development of the Jewish mind than almost any other book after the completion of the Talmud.

The &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; is exceedingly difficult to understand on account of its obscure style. The difficulty is rendered still greater by the lack of a critical edition, the present text being much interpolated and altered. Hence there is a wide divergence of opinion regarding the age, origin, contents, and value of the book.

=== Jewish study ===
The history of the study of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; is one of the most interesting in the records of Jewish literature. With the exception of the Bible, scarcely any other book has been the subject of so much annotation.

An intimate relation exists between the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; and the later mystics; and although there is a marked difference between the later Kabbalah and the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; (for instance, the &quot;sefirot&quot; of the Kabbalists do not correspond to those of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;), the system laid down in the latter is the first visible link in the development of Kabbalistic ideas. Instead of the immediate creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, both works postulate a series of emanations of mediums between God and the universe; and both consider God as the first cause only, and not as the immediate efficient cause of the world.

A book of the same name was circulated among the Ashkenazi Hasidim between the 11th and 13th centuries, for whom it became a source of Practical Kabbalah. This book seems to be a mystic work on the six days of creation, and corresponded in part to the small midrash, &quot;Seder Rabbah deBereshit&quot;.

=== In Thelema ===
Charles Stansfeld Jones, in his book called &quot;The Anatomy of The Body of God&quot; has written interpretations of this book from the viewpoint of Thelema, a new religious movement founded by Aleister Crowley early in the 20th century.

== Teachings ==

=== Structure ===
The &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; describes how the universe was created by the &quot;God of Israel&quot; (a list of all of God&#x27;s Hebrew names appears in the first sentence of the book) through &quot;32 wondrous ways of wisdom&quot;:
* Ten Numbers (sefirot, the origin for the sefirot of later Kabbalah)
* The Twenty-Two Letters of the Hebrew alphabet—
** Three mother letters (Aleph, Mem, Shin)
** Seven doubles (Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Kaph, Pe, Resh, Taw)
** Twelve simples or elementals (He, Waw, Zayin, Heth, Teth, Yodh, Lamedh, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tsade, Qoph)
The book describes the method for using the ten sefirot and the 22 Hebrew letters to gain Divine Insight/Secret using Abraham&#x27;s tongue. God&#x27;s covenant with Abraham is described as being twofold.

=== The phonetic system ===
The philological is discussed first, since it is necessary for an elucidation of the philosophical speculations of the work. The twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are classified both with reference to the position of the vocal organs in producing the sounds, and with regard to sonant intensity. In contrast to the Jewish grammarians, who assumed a special mode of articulation for each of the five groups of sounds, the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; says that no sound can be produced without the tongue, to which the other organs of speech merely lend assistance. Hence the formation of the letters is described as follows:
* With the tip of the tongue and the throat
* Between the lips and the tip of the tongue
* In the middle of the tongue
* By the tip of the tongue
* By the tongue, which lies flat and stretched, and by the teeth (ii. 3)

The letters are distinguished, moreover, by the intensity of the sound necessary to produce them, and are accordingly divided into:
* Mutes, which are unaccompanied by sound, such as Mem
* Sibilants, such as Shin, which is therefore called the &quot;hissing shin&quot;
* Aspirates, such as Aleph, which holds a position between the mutes and sibilants, and is designated as the &quot;airy Aleph, which holds the balance in the middle&quot; (iv. 1; in some eds. ii. 1)
Besides these three letters, which are called &quot;mothers,&quot; a distinction is also drawn between the seven &quot;double&quot; letters, which have two different sounds according to inflection, and the twelve &quot;simple&quot; letters, the remaining characters of the alphabet which represent only one sound each.

=== Themes ===
Both the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (human) are viewed in this system as products of the combination and permutation of these mystic characters, and such a use of the letters by the Jews for the formation of the Holy Name for thaumaturgical purposes is attested by magic papyri that quote an &quot;Angelic Book of Moses&quot;, which was full of allusions to biblical names.

The linguistic theories of the author of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; are an integral component of its philosophy, its other parts being astrological and Gnostic cosmogony. The three letters Aleph, Mem, Shin, are not only the three &quot;mothers&quot; from which the other letters of the alphabet are formed, but they are also symbolic figures for the three primordial elements, the substances which underlie all existence.

According to the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, the first emanation from the spirit of God was the &quot;ruach&quot; ( &quot;rúaħ&quot; &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;air&quot;) that produced water, which, in its turn, formed the genesis of fire. In the beginning, however, these three substances had only a potential existence, and came into actual being only by means of the three letters Aleph, Mem, Shin; and as these are the principal parts of speech, so those three substances are the elements from which the cosmos has been formed.

The cosmos consists of three parts, the world, the year (or time), and man, which are combined in such a way that the three primordial elements are contained in each of the three categories. The water formed the earth; heaven was produced from the fire; and the &quot;ruach&quot; produced the air between heaven and earth. The three seasons of the year—winter, summer, and the rainy season—correspond to water, fire, and &quot;ruach&quot; in the same way as man consists of a head (corresponding to fire), torso (represented by &quot;ruach&quot;), and the other parts of the body (equivalent to water).

The seven double letters produced the seven planets, the &quot;seven days,&quot; and the seven apertures in man (two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and one mouth.) Again, as the seven double letters vary, being pronounced either hard or soft, so the seven visible planets are in continuous movement, approaching or receding from the earth. The &quot;seven days,&quot; in like manner, were created by the seven double letters because they change in time according to their relation to the planets. The seven apertures in man connect him with the outer world as the seven visible planets join heaven and earth. Hence these organs are subject to the influence of the planets, the right eye being under Saturn, the left eye under Jupiter, and the like.

The twelve &quot;simple&quot; letters were used to create the twelve signs of the zodiac, whose relation to the earth is always simple or stable; and to them belong the twelve months in time, and the twelve &quot;leaders&quot; in man. The latter are those organs which perform functions in the body independent of the outside world, being the hands, feet, kidneys, gall, intestines, stomach, liver, pancreas, and spleen; and they are, accordingly, subject to the twelve signs of the Zodiac.

In its relation to the construction of the cosmos, matter consists of the three primordial elements; they are not chemically connected with one another, but modify one another only physically. Power (δύναμις) emanates from the seven and the twelve heavenly bodies, or, in other words, from the planets and the signs of the zodiac. The &quot;dragon&quot; rules over the world (matter and the heavenly bodies); the sphere rules time; and the heart rules over the human body. The author sums up this explanation in a single sentence: &quot;The dragon is like to a king on his throne, the sphere like a king traveling in his country, and the heart like a king at war.&quot;

=== Creation ===
To harmonize the Genesis creation narrative, which is a &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;, with the doctrine of the primordial elements, the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; assumes a double creation, one ideal and the other real.

Their name is possibly derived from the fact that as numbers express only the relations of two objects to each other, so the ten sefirot are only abstractions and not realities. Again, as the numbers from two to ten are derived from the number one, so the ten Sefirot are derived from one &quot;their end is fixed in their beginning, as the flame is bound to the coal&quot; (i. 7). Hence the &quot;Sefirot&quot; must not be conceived as emanations in the ordinary sense of the word, but rather as modifications of the will of God, which first changes to air, then becomes water, and finally fire, the last being no further removed from God than the first. The Sefer Yetzirah shows how the sefirot are a creation of God and the will of God in its varied manifestations.

Besides these abstract ten sefirot, which are conceived only ideally, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet produced the material world, for they are real, and are the formative powers of all existence and development. By means of these elements the actual creation of the world took place, and the ten sefirot, which before this had only an ideal existence, became realities. This is, then, a modified form of the Talmudic doctrine that God created heaven and earth by means of letters (Berakhot 58a). The explanation on this point is obscure since the relation of the twenty-two letters to the ten sefirot is not clearly defined.

The first sentence of the book reads: &quot;Thirty-two paths, marvels of wisdom, hath God engraved...,&quot; these paths being then explained as the ten sefirot and the twenty-two letters. While the sefirot are expressly designated as &quot;abstracts&quot;, it is said of the letters: &quot;Twenty-two letters: God drew them, hewed them, combined them, weighed them, interchanged them, and through them produced the whole creation and everything that is destined to come into being&quot; (ii. 2).

The letters are neither independent substances nor yet as mere forms. They seem to be the connecting-link between essence and form. They are designated as the instruments by which the real world, which consists of essence and form, was produced from the sefirot, which are merely formless essences.

=== Theories of contrast in nature ===

In addition to the doctrine of the &quot;Sefirot&quot; and the letters, the theory of contrasts in nature, or of the syzygies (&quot;pairs&quot;), as they are called by the Gnostics, occupies a prominent place in the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;. This doctrine is based on the assumption that the physical as well as the spiritual world consist of pairs mutually at war, but equalized by the unity, God. Thus in the three prototypes of creation the contrasting elements fire and water are equalized by air; corresponding to this are the three &quot;Rulers&quot; among the letters, the mute Mem contrasting with the hushing Shin, and both being equalized by Aleph.

Seven pairs of contrasts are enumerated in the life of man:
* Life and death
* Peace and war
* Wisdom and folly
* Wealth and poverty
* Beauty and ugliness
* Fertility and sterility
* Lordship and servitude (iv. 3).
From these premises the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; draws the important conclusion that subjective &quot;good and evil&quot; have no real existence, for since everything in nature can exist only by means of its contrast, a thing may be called good or evil according to its influence over man by the natural course of the contrast.

The book teaches that man is a free moral agent, and therefore a person is rewarded or punished for his or her actions. While the ideas of heaven and hell are left unmentioned in the book, it teaches that the virtuous man is rewarded by a favorable attitude of nature, while the wicked man finds it hostile to him.

=== Gnostic elements ===
&quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; is similar to various Gnostic systems. As the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; divides the Hebrew alphabet into three groups, so the Gnostic Marcus divided the Greek letters into three classes, regarded by him as the symbolic emanations of the three powers which include the whole number of the upper elements.

Both systems attach great importance to the power of the combinations and permutations of the letters in explaining the genesis and development of diversity from unity. The Clementine literature present another form of gnosis that agrees with the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;. As in the latter, God is not only the beginning but also the end of all things, so in the former He is the arche (, ) and telos (, ) of all that exists; and the Clementine writings furthermore teach that the spirit of God is transformed into pneuma (, ), and this into water, which becomes fire and rocks, thus agreeing with the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, where the pneuma, air, water, and fire are the first four &quot;Sefirot&quot;.

The remaining six &quot;Sefirot&quot;, or the limitations of space by the three dimensions in a twofold direction, are also found in the Clementina, where God is described as the boundary of the universe and the source of the six infinite dimensions.

The &quot;theli&quot; ( &quot;teli&quot;, perhaps meaning &quot;curled one&quot; as a coiled serpent) which plays such a vital part in the astrology of the book, is probably an ancient Semitic figure; at all events its name is an Akkadian loan-word. The &quot;dragon&quot; is often understood as the starry constellation Draco and by extension it represents the cosmic axis (equivalent to the north/south pole) because this constellation coils around Polaris and thus around the celestial axis, as it intersects the northernmost part of the celestial sphere.

===Factorial===
In discussing the number of words that can be formed from the Hebrew alphabet, Sefer Yetzirah includes one for the earliest known descriptions of the mathematical function factorial, enumerating its first seven values and emphasizing its rapid growth.

==Influence==
In 2002, American mathematician Robert P. C. de Marrais named the pathions, or the 32-dimensional hypercomplex numbers, after the 32 paths of wisdom in the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;.

<doc id="187504" wikidata="Q9658" url="?curid=187504" title="1988 Winter Olympics">
<text>The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Calgary 1988 (; or ; /; ; ; ), were a multi-sport event held from February 13 to 28, 1988, with Calgary, Alberta as the main host city. This marks the most recent time that two consecutive Olympic Games were hosted in North America (with the 1984 Summer Olympic Games hosted in Los Angeles, California, United States). It was the first Winter Olympic Games to be held for 15 days, like the counterpart Summer Olympic Games. The majority of the events took place in Calgary itself. However, the snow events were shared by Nakiska ski resort in Kananaskis Country at the west of the city and the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park in the town of Canmore.

In 1988, a record 57 National Olympic Committees (NOC) sent a total of 1,424 athletes to these Games. These Winter Olympics would be the last attended for both the Soviet Union and East Germany NOCs. Just like the 1976 Summer Olympics, host country Canada failed again to win a gold medal on their home soil (They won three gold medals in demonstration events, but they are not added at the official medal table). The Finnish ski jumper, Matti Nykänen, and the Dutch speed skater, Yvonne van Gennip, won three individual gold medals each. The 1988 Winter Olympics were also remembered for the &quot;heroic failure&quot; of both the British ski jumper, Michael Edwards, and the debut of the Jamaica national bobsleigh team. Both of them became subjects of major feature films about their participation in these Games: &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; by Walt Disney Pictures in 1993 and &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot; by 20th Century Fox in 2016.

At approximately C$829 million, the Calgary Games were the most expensive Olympics ever held at the time, as all the necessary infrastructure was built from scratch. The facilities that were built for these Winter Olympics helped the host region to turn into the heart of Canada&#x27;s elite winter sports program, under the tutelage of WinSport. After the Games, their legacy still standing and in constant use, as the five purpose-built venues for those Games are now used for training and hosting various winter sporting events every year. These policies helped Canada develop into one of the top nations in Winter Olympics competition. The climax of this effort was the overall first-place finish at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada.

==Host city selection==

Calgary made its fourth attempt at hosting the Winter Games when it bid for the 1988 Winter Olympic Games, which also marked Canada&#x27;s seventh bid for the Winter Olympic Games. Montreal made the first Canadian bid for the Winter Games in 1956 and won the rights to host the 1976 Summer Olympics, and Vancouver made attempts to host the 1976 and 1980 Games. Calgary, alongside neighbouring Banff, under the leadership of the Calgary Olympic Development Association (CODA), submitted bids for the Winter Games in 1964, 1968, and 1972. However, CODA went dormant in 1966 after losing three consecutive bids. In 1978, Frank King and Bob Niven of Calgary&#x27;s Booster Club took over the organization&#x27;s leadership and revived CODA. King and Niven consulted former Olympic Sprinter and CODA founder, Ernie McCullough, and politician Arthur Ryan Smith, who had worked on previous bids, for guidance on the project.

In October 1979, CODA secured the Canadian Olympic Association&#x27;s (COA) support for Canada&#x27;s official bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics, winning over a competing bid by Vancouver with a vote of 27–9. Calgary&#x27;s bid was at the time the most ambitious for the Winter Olympics ever, as the city lacked winter sports facilities and almost everything would have to be built from scratch. CODA proposed constructing all new venues, arguing that if Calgary was awarded the Games, Canada&#x27;s inventory of training facilities would increase significantly. The Vancouver bidding committee argued that Calgary&#x27;s bid represented a &quot;Big-ticket Games&quot; idea, and estimated to cost nearly three times what Vancouver was expected to pay to host the Winter Olympics. Vancouver&#x27;s bid was based on already developed infrastructure, including the Expo 86 precinct, the Pacific Coliseum and Whistler Blackcomb, which later served as the basis for the successful 2010 Winter Olympics bid and the later unsucceful 2030 Winter Olympics bid.

CODA then spent two years building local support for the megaproject, selling memberships to approximately 80,000 of Calgary&#x27;s 600,000 residents. Calgary also secured million in funding from the federal ( million) and provincial governments. Some civic leaders, including then-mayor Ralph Klein, travelled around the world to lobby IOC delegates. The arrival of the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) newly relocated Calgary Flames from Atlanta in 1980 drove the city to construct a new multi-use arena that would later be named the Olympic Saddledome, demonstrating to the IOC Calgary&#x27;s determination to host the Winter Olympics.

The Olympic bid itself emphasized the unique cultural and natural characteristics who mark the Calgary Metropolitan Region and the Alberta Province and also canadian prairies landscapes, as a perfect places for hosting the Winter Olympics. At the bidding documents, the city was marketed with a capitalist, oil-driven and vibrant economy that also had mountain playgrounds, extensive wilderness, and a rodeo culture. When the two images of Calgary and Alberta were brought together, they seemed to be contrasting; however, they complemented each other as part of extensive and intense bidding lobby process.

Calgary was one of three finalists during the 1988 Winter Olympics bid process. The other two were Falun, Sweden, and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy. The Italian town (comune) had before hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics and was seen by many as the favorite. The vote was held on September 30, 1981, in Baden-Baden, West Germany, during the 84th IOC Session and 11th Olympic Congress. After Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was eliminated in the first round of balloting, Calgary won in the second and final round of balloting over Falun, by a margin of 17 votes. The announcement of CODA&#x27;s victory sent the delegates in Baden-Baden and Calgary residents into singing and dancing. It also made then Alberta premier, Peter Lougheed, burst openly into tears in front of the cameras. Later, Ralph Klein sang a rendition of Mac Davis&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be Humble&quot;. It was the first Winter Olympics awarded to Canada and the second Olympic Games overall, following the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, along with Milan, would get to host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The town will be the fourth to host the Winter Olympics twice, along with St. Moritz (1928 and 1948), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980), and Innsbruck (1964 and 1976).

Olympic historians, John E. Findling and Kimberly D. Pelle noted that once the Games were awarded to Calgary, the cultural and community aspects of the bid were pushed aside by the newly formed Calgary Olympic organizing committee called the &quot;Olympiques Calgary Olympics &#x27;88&quot; (OCO&#x27;88). It then proceeded to take on a &quot;vigorous, resilient, and impersonal corporate business strategy&quot; based in the work made by Los Angeles 1984 Organizing Committee (LAOCOG) toward the planning and operation of the Games.

==Venues==

Bill Pratt was a former general contractor who took over as OCO&#x27;88 president in 1983. He was the main manager that oversaw the construction of the Olympic megaproject. Donald Jacques, a former general manager of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede, once said, &quot;Because of him, everything was built on time and on budget.&quot; However, Bill Pratt was controversial by rubbing many of his colleagues the wrong way. One former co-worker once predicted back in 1983: &quot;He will get everything built. There may not be many (of us) left around to enjoy it, but he&#x27;ll get it done.&quot; His relations with the news media were also strained at times. He had barely settled into his new position when the Calgary press media began criticizing OCO&#x27;88 for excessive secrecy and for awarding Olympic contracts to Calgary&#x27;s PR firm Francis Williams and Johnson Ltd. Pratt was a director of that firm, before accepting the organizing committee job. OCO&#x27;88 had insisted that there was no conflict of interest involved in the whole process. Therefore, Pratt declared: &quot;I have been nailed for a lot, but that does not bother me. The record stands&quot;. After the 1988 Winter Olympics bid was won in 1981, OCO&#x27;88 made a new technical assessment and had to re-plan all the originally proposed competition venues except for the few that already existed and were within the campus of the University of Calgary.

McMahon Stadium, the primary outdoor facility used mainly by the Canadian Football League&#x27;s (CFL) Calgary Stampeders and inside of the University of Calgary and had originally been chosen to host only the opening ceremonies and the Saddledome was chosen to be the place of the closing ceremonies. But with the constant revisions of the project, the later addition of 4 more days in competition and mainly the gigantic demands for tickets, the Organizing Committee decided to move the closing ceremony to the Stadium which held twice the capacity of the Saddledome. The last time that the two Winter Olympic ceremonies were held at the same venue was at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California.

The 1988 Winter Olympics&#x27; five main all-purpose venues were created at a significant cost at that time. Three of them are located within Calgary and the other two are located west of the city. First, the Olympic Saddledome was planned to be the main venue of the games, hosting ice hockey and figure skating finals.This arena is also part of Stampede Park and was expected to cost C$83 million, but a cost overrun pushed it to nearly C$100 million and caused a nine-month delay. Second, the Olympic Oval was built on the campus of the University of Calgary for C$40 million. Contrary to what was proposed in the bid in which this infrastructure would be outdoors, throughout the process it was realized that it would have to be 100% covered and is the first fully enclosed 400-metre long track speed skating in the world, to protect the athletes and public from bitterly cold weather and the Chinook winds. Third, Canada Olympic Park (formerly called the &quot;Paskapoo Ski Hill&quot;) was renovated for C$200 million and is located on the western outskirts of Calgary. This most expensive venue of these Winter Olympics hosted the men&#x27;s bobsleigh, luge, and men&#x27;s ski jumping and its portion of the Nordic combined events. Also, it hosted some events of the demonstration sport of freestyle skiing.

From the west of Calgary, the other two main all-purpose venues were built at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. First, the Canmore Nordic Centre was 90% funded by the province of Alberta, for C$17.3 million. It is located beside the town of Canmore and it hosted cross-country skiing, plus its men&#x27;s portion of the Nordic combined, and the men&#x27;s biathlon events.Was projected that the area could become a year-round destination for Albertans, by facilitating and accelerate Canmore&#x27;s economic transition away from coal mining to tourist attraction. However, the Nakiska (&quot;Cree&quot; meaning &quot;to meet&quot;) ski resort was the most controversial and polemic complex built for these Winter Olympics. It is located on Mount Allan (inside Kananaskis Country) and it hosted the alpine skiing events.It cost around C$25 million to Alberta government funds. This venue drew a lot of criticisms because of the various environmental concerns, the rejection by International Ski Federation (FIS) of slopes for each of the 10 events in the program and the use of artificial snow due the lack of natural snow on that season. After the first inspections, the International Ski Federation (FIS) officials noted the venue&#x27;s lack of technical difficulties needed for the Olympic competition. Therefore, these FIS delegates proposed some major changes in the slopes in an action to cause bigger difficulties. These modifications were met with praise from Olympic alpine skiing competitors. Like at Canada Olympic Park, this venue also hosted some freestyle skiing events as a demonstration sport.

Three other existing facilities served as secondary competition venues for the Games. The first one, was the Max Bell Centre hosted the demonstration sports of curling and short track speed skating. The Father David Bauer Olympic Arena and the Stampede Corral shared the functions of secondary venues for the ice hockey tournament and the figure skating preliminaries. Though the Stampede Corral did not support the International Ice Hockey Federation&#x27;s (IIHF) standard-sized Olympic ice surface, OCO&#x27;88 was able to convince the IIHF to sanction the ice rink for Olympic competition, in exchange for a C$1.2 million payment.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
A record 57 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) entered athletes at the 1988 Winter Olympics, with eight more NOCs than any other previous Olympic Winter Games. 1,109 men and 315 women, for a total of 1,424 athletes, participated in these Games. Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, the Netherlands Antilles and the Virgin Islands had their Winter Olympics debut in 1988.

=== Weather conditions ===
The weather conditions were a problem facing OCO&#x27;88 during the Games, with temperatures ranging from . After an unexpectedly freezing opening ceremony, the outdoor competitions scheduled to start the next day had to be postponed. This ended up affecting the men&#x27;s downhill skiing event at Nakiska which was postponed for one day, due to Chinook winds blowing up to 160 km/h. The women&#x27;s downhill event also experienced the same scenario. With the ski jumping venue facing north at Canada Olympic Park (COP), the same winds also disrupted those events, with the large hill event being postponed four times. It also disrupted the Nordic combined events, in which the ski jumping part had to be postponed as well. This situation ended up causing something unprecedented in the history of the Winter Olympics, as for the first time both the ski jumping and Nordic combined cross-country skiing events were contested in a single day. Despite using artificial cooling, the bobsleigh and luge events did not need to be rescheduled; however, several races had to be postponed because of the high temperatures recorded and also because of the dirt that was carried away by these winds.

==Preparations==
===Olympic organizing committee (OCO&#x27;88)===
The Calgary Olympic Development Association (CODA) Board of Directors had originally 25 members. It was chaired by Frank King, followed by former Mayors Ralph Klein and Ross Alger, and other prominent Calgarians. The executive committee president was Robert Niven. The Olympic Organizing Committee (OOC) was formed by utilizing many of the original board of directors members. It was initially started with 11 members and was grown to 25 members by October 1983. It grew further to 29 members by 1985, when former Alberta premier, Peter Lougheed, was added to the list. An Olympic biographer, Kevin Wamsley, noted that the CEO Frank King, President Bill Pratt, Ralph Klein, and former COA President Roger Jackson had collectively the most influence on all aspects of these Winter Olympics. This organizing committee took a hierarchical form for planning these Olympics, which caused consternation from some staff, volunteers, and people in executive roles. The original staff, who were at odds with the current management structure, were either fired or willingly resigned. Also, there were claims that some of the volunteers were verbally abused. As a result, David Leighton resigned as OOC President in 1982, after only five months on the job. Therefore, Bill Pratt, a former general manager of the Calgary Stampede, became the new OCOG&#x27;s president shortly afterwards. The City of Calgary and the Canadian Olympic Association (COA) delegated officially all Olympic responsibilities, including staging the Winter Olympics under the Olympic Charter, to the newly formed OCO&#x27;88 in February and September 1983 respectively.

However, conflicts within OCO&#x27;88 grew in the public eye and a review of the entire management structure was conducted after Ralph Klein threatened it with a public inquiry in 1986. Thus, Frank King remained as CEO, but with the addition of more full-time staff. Also, more than 9,000 volunteers were registered who were allocated to the most diverse areas. Despite these changes, there was still some animosity within OCO&#x27;88. Kevin Walmsley noted that Bill Pratt and Frank King continued to have a very tense relationship and that any movement caused sparks with each other. Some members of the media commented that the changes made further alienated the general public, with a host broadcaster producer, Ralph Mellanby, describing it as &quot;an oilman&#x27;s and cattleman&#x27;s Calgary thing.&quot; Long-time IOC member Dick Pound, on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), went on record to say that the IOC grew increasingly frustrated, as it saw the actions of OCO&#x27;88 as a refusal to collaborate with them.

===Television===

The 1988 Winter Olympic Games coincided with a shift in television policy by the International Olympic Committee and growing enthusiasm by broadcasters in the United States. Amendments to the &quot;Olympic Charter&quot; in 1977 established a policy mandating joint television rights involving the IOC and the local organizing committee and was enshrined in the 1981 bid agreement for the Calgary games.

The joint negotiating committee convened in 1984 late-January, some weeks before the Sarajevo 1984 Winter Games at the IOC&#x27;s president residency at the Lausanne Palace were held to negotiate the Calgary television contracts with American broadcasters. The negotiating committee was represented by Dick Pound for the IOC, Bill Wardle for OCO&#x27;88 and consultant Barry Frank. The co-negotiating committee designed a new tender process for the television rights bid with an emphasis on creating a level playing field for all broadcasters. For the first time, the negotiations were based on a series of sealed bids and representatives from ABC, CBS and NBC vied for the opportunity to broadcast the Games.

After six rounds of sealed bids, the ABC delegation led by producer Roone Arledge was successful with an agreement paying a record million ( million Canadian at the time) in exchange for exclusive rights for the games. CBS exited the bidding process after the second round with a final offer of $257 million, while ABC and NBC both reached the fifth round with an offer of $300 million. In the sixth and final stage, the IOC and OCO&#x27;88 decided a coin flip would determine which of ABC or NBC had the right to submit the first bid or defer, a decision neither network supported. NBC&#x27;s president of sports Arthur A. Watson elected to call the coin-flip, although he remained silent on the first flip, so a second coinflip was required, and NBC won with a choice of &quot;heads&quot;, and after 30 minutes of deliberation submitted a $304 million bid. ABC&#x27;s representative Arledge made a quick phone call to executive Fred Pierce, and ABC submitted a $309 million bid, exceeding NBC&#x27;s bid by $5 million. ABC&#x27;s record-setting bid was immediately controversial, first Arledge had exceeded the maximum allowable bid set by ABC&#x27;s executives by $34 million, and in the coming weeks ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 1984 Winter Olympics which cost $91.5 million returned poor Nielsen ratings. Early estimates speculated the network would lose $50-$60 million televising the games. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the NBC agreement as the &quot;biggest prize of the Winter Olympics&quot;. The deal which was at the time the highest amount ever paid for a sporting event, allowed OCO&#x27;88 to announce the Games would be debt-free.

The negotiations with American television broadcasters were in sharp contrast to negotiations for Western European rights with the European Broadcasting Union quickly closing an exclusive deal with the IOC for million led by Juan Antonio Samaranch and Marc Hodler on behalf of the IOC. The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; headline after the announcement negatively reflected on the &quot;bargain&quot; the European network received, and OCO&#x27;88 chairman Frank King publicly expressed his disappointment with the IOC. Samaranch&#x27;s argument for providing for a privileged negotiation with EBU was ensuring European viewers had equal access and coverage of the games, something he did not believe would occur if private networks from each nation were provided with the opportunity to bid. Dick Pound was also critical of the decision and argued more revenue could be brought in from BBC and RAI alone and the privileged status suppressed the willingness of the EBU to make a market-value bid on the games.

The CTV Television Network won the bid to broadcast the Games in Canada in December 1983, paying million for the exclusive rights. CTV also won the $23.5 million contract to serve as the host broadcaster, responsible for the manpower and equipment to televise the games. In 1978, while the bid was strengthened, CBC and CTV signed an agreement that if Calgary were the eventual winner, the two broadcasters would create a consortium in which the purchase of television rights would take place jointly. The previous arrangement had CBC provide full coverage for Summer Games with CTV broadcasting a nightly summary, while CTV had the rights to Winter Games with CBC broadcasting a nightly summary. The nightly summary of the Games was also televised on CBC.

Japan&#x27;s broadcast rights were awarded to NHK in July 1986 for million.

OCO&#x27;88 made several alterations to the Olympic program as part of efforts to ensure value for its broadcast partners. Now, the premier and main events, including ice hockey and figure skating, were scheduled for prime time and the Games were lengthened to 15 days from the previous 12 to ensure three weekends of coverage. However, a significant downturn in advertising revenue for sporting events resulted in ABC forecasting significant financial losses on the Games. Calgary organizers appreciated their fortunate timing in signing the deal. King described the timing of the contract with ABC as &quot;the passing of the sun and the moon at the right time for Calgary&quot;. The revenue growth from broadcasting was significant for the Calgary Games, OCO&#x27;88 generated $324.9 million in broadcast rights, which was a significant growth over an eight-period (the 1980 Lake Placid Games generated million). ABC had net losses of more than $60 million, and broadcast rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics were later sold to the CBS network for $243 million, a 20 per cent reduction compared to Calgary.

===Ticketing controversies===
A series of ticket-related scandals plagued the organizing committee as the Games approached, resulting in widespread public anger. Demand for tickets was high, particularly for the main events which had sold out a year in advance. Residents had been promised that only 10 per cent of tickets would go to &quot;Olympic insiders&quot;, IOC officials and sponsors, but OCO&#x27;88 was later forced to admit that up to 50 percent of seats to top events had gone to insiders. The organizing committee, which was subsequently chastised by mayor Klein for running a &quot;closed shop&quot;, admitted that it had failed to properly communicate the obligations it had to supply IOC officials and sponsors with priority tickets.

These events were preceded by the ticketing manager for OCO&#x27;88 being charged with theft and fraud after he sent modified ticket request forms to Americans that asked them to pay in United States funds rather than Canadian and to return them to his company&#x27;s post office box rather than the office of the organizing committee. At that time, the American dollar was trading 40 cents higher than the Canadian dollar, resulting in significantly higher than anticipated revenue through currency conversion. The ticket manager maintained his innocence claiming he was used as a scapegoat and sponsor credit card Visa was responsible for the error, despite his claims, the ticketing manager was convicted of fraud, theft, and forgery, and sentenced to 5 years in prison.

Organizers attempted to respond to public concern by asking sponsors to consider reducing their orders and by paying $1.5 million to add 2,600 seats to the Saddledome, as well as increase capacity for ski jumping, alpine skiing and the opening ceremonies. This led to a change of the venue of the closing ceremonies from Saddledome to McMahon Stadium, as the stadium capacity was about two times bigger than the indoor venue. King also noted that the Calgary Games offered a then-record 1.9 million tickets for sale, three times the amount available at Sarajevo or Lake Placid and that 79 percent of them were to be allocated to Calgarians. By the start of the 1988 Winter Games, a record of over 1.4 million tickets had been sold, a figure that eclipsed the previous three Winter Games combined. In the OCO&#x27;88&#x27;s final report, the Committee admits the culmination of fraud charges, a large portion of premier tickets requested by Olympic insiders, and poor communications led to a negative public reaction to the ticketing process.

For the first time in the history of the Olympics, both summer and winter, the Organizing Committee worked with a refund policy for returned or unused tickets. When an event was postponed by at least 24 hours, the ticketholder was eligible for a refund. Due to weather issues, the 8 events that were scheduled for the first 24 hours had to be rescheduled, resulting in 130,000 ticket refunds totalling million, with transactions handled by the Royal Bank of Canada.

===Community===

The city of Calgary is world-renowned for the enthusiasm of its population for volunteer work which is reflected in the annual Calgary Stampede, which also relied heavily on volunteers to run the Olympics. Over 22,000 people signed up for more than 9,400 positions, no matter how inglorious: doctors, lawyers and executives even offered to collect the waste generated during the opening ceremony. Also, for the first time, a &quot;Homestay&quot; program was created and several local families opened their homes to visitors from around the world, and others were renting their rooms or houses to those who could not stay in pay a reserve in a hotel.

Klein was among those who felt it necessary that the event be community driven, a decision which allowed the city&#x27;s welcoming spirit to manifest. The Games&#x27; mascots, Hidy and Howdy, were designed to evoke images of &quot;western hospitality&quot;. The smiling, cowboy-themed polar bears were popular across Canada. Played by a team of 150 students from Bishop Carroll High School, the sister-brother pair made up to 300 appearances per month in the lead-up to the Games. From their introduction at the closing ceremonies of the Sarajevo Games in 1984 until their retirement at the conclusion of the Calgary Games, the pair made about 50,000 appearances. The iconic mascots graced signs welcoming travellers to Calgary for nearly two decades until they were replaced in 2007. The mascot&#x27;s names &quot;Hidy&quot; and &quot;Howdy&quot; were chosen by a public contest.

===Finances===
The 1988 Winter Olympic Games were the most expensive Games, summer or winter, to be held at that time, with total expenses exceeding million. The high cost was anticipated, as organizers were aware at the outset of their bid that most facilities would have to be constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada&#x27;s national winter sports teams. The record-breaking cost of the Calgary Olympics came in stark contrast to the original projections during the 1981 bid, which estimated a total cost of million, split between million in capital costs and million in operating costs. The significant growth in capital expenditures came despite the three levels of government taking over projects which constituted nearly half of the original budgeted capital projects.

The primary source of revenue for OCO&#x27;88 was the lucrative television contracts, bringing in million (58.3 per cent of revenue), the absolute majority coming from American broadcasters, followed by corporate sponsorships at million (15.8 per cent of revenue), and ticket sales of million (7.5 per cent of revenue). Of the total expenses for the Games ( million), the Government of Canada contributed million (22.7 per cent), the Government of Alberta contributed million (14.8 per cent), and the City of Calgary contributed million (4.9 per cent). The million of government capital contributions not directly included in OCO&#x27;88&#x27;s revenue statements included the Government of Canada constructing the million Canada Olympic Park, and million for the Olympic Oval. Provincial expenses included million to build the Canmore Nordic Centre, and million to build Nakiska. All three governments contributed to the million Olympic Saddledome. Of OCO&#x27;88&#x27;s reported revenue of million, million was paid to the IOC as a share of television and market rights, and an additional million was paid to the United States Olympic Committee for rights to broadcast the Games in the United States, and million was reimbursed to NOC&#x27;s for accommodation fees at the Games.

The Games were a major economic boom for the city, which had fallen into its worst recession in 40 years following the collapse of both oil and grain prices three years before the games. A report prepared for the city in January 1985 estimated the games would create 11,100 man-years of employment and generate million in salaries and wages. In its post-Games report, OCO&#x27;88 estimated the Olympics created billion in economic benefits across Canada during the 1980s, 70 percent within Alberta, as a result of capital spending, increased tourism and new sporting opportunities created by the facilities.

==Torch relay==

The 1988 Olympic torch relay began on November 15, 1987, when the torch was lit at Olympia and Greek runner Stelios Bisbas began what was called &quot;the longest torch run in history&quot;. The flame arrived in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on the Atlantic Ocean two days later and over 88 days, travelled west across the then 10 Canadian provinces and two territories. It passed through most major cities, north to the Arctic Ocean at Inuvik, Northwest Territories, then west to the Pacific Ocean at Victoria, British Columbia before returning east to Alberta, and finally Calgary. The torch covered a distance of , the greatest distance for a torch relay in Olympic history until the 2000 Sydney Games, and a sharp contrast to the 1976 Montreal Games when the relay covered only .

The identity of the final torchbearer who would light the Olympic cauldron was one of the Organizing Committee&#x27;s most closely guarded secrets. The relay began at St. John&#x27;s with Barbara Ann Scott and Ferd Hayward representing Canada&#x27;s past Olympians and ended with Ken Read and Cathy Priestner carrying the torch into McMahon Stadium representing the nation&#x27;s current Olympians. They then stopped to acknowledge the contribution of parathlete Rick Hansen and his &quot;Man in Motion&quot; tour before handing the torch to 12-year-old Robyn Perry, an aspiring figure skater who was selected to represent the future of the Olympic Movement three years before the IOC changed the year of the Winter Games, to light the cauldron.

=== Olympic Torch ===
The design of the Olympic Torch for the Calgary games was a reproduction of the main landmark building of the Calgary skyline, the Calgary Tower. The National Research Council Canada developed the design for the Torch, the base of the torch is made of maple wood, the national tree of Canada, aluminum, and hardened steel, all 100% collected in Canadian territory. The torch was designed to remain lit despite the extreme conditions of Canadian winters. The Torch had to be light enough for relay runners to carry comfortably, and the final design came in at 60 centimetres in length and 1.7 kilograms in weight. The maple handle portion included laser-incised pictograms of the 10 official Olympic Winter sports, and lettering was engraved on the steel caldron portion. The torch used a mixed type of three fuels (gasoline, kerosene and alcohol) to allow a continuous burn during the unpredictable Canadian winter. Approximately 100 torches were manufactured for the Games.

==Event highlights==
The 1988 Winter Games began on afternoon of February 13 with a $10 million opening ceremony in front of 60,000 spectators at McMahon Stadium that featured 5,500 performers, an aerial flyover by the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s Snowbirds, the parade of nations and the release of 1,000 homing pigeons. Canadian composer David Foster performed the instrumental theme song (&quot;Winter Games&quot;) and its vocal version (&quot;Can&#x27;t You Feel It?&quot;), while internationally recognized Canadian folk/country musicians Gordon Lightfoot singing &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; and Ian Tyson performing &quot;Alberta Bound&quot; were among the featured performers. Governor General Jeanne Sauvé opened the Games on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II as an estimated 1.5 billion people watched the ceremony.
The weather was a dominant story throughout much of the Games, as strong chinook winds that brought daily temperatures as high as wreaked havoc on the schedules for outdoor events. Events were delayed when winds were deemed unsafe for competitors and organizers used artificial snow making equipment to ensure skiing venues were properly prepared. It was the first time in Olympic history that alpine events were held on artificial snow. The Games were also marred by the death of the Austrian ski team&#x27;s doctor, Joerg Oberhammer, on February 25 after a collision with another skier threw him underneath a working snow grooming machine at Nakiska, crushing and killing him instantly. The incident was ruled an accident.

The top individual competitors at the Olympics were Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip as they each won three gold medals. Italy&#x27;s Alberto Tomba won gold in two skiing events, his first of five career Olympic medals en route to becoming the first alpine skier to win medals at three Winter Games. East Germany&#x27;s Katarina Witt defended her 1984 gold medal in women&#x27;s figure skating, capturing a second gold in Calgary. Her compatriot Christa Rothenburger won the gold medal in the 1000 metre race in speed skating, then went on to win a silver medal in the team sprint cycling event at the 1988 Summer Games to become the only person in Olympic history to win medals at both Olympic Games in the same year. The Soviet Union won gold in ice hockey as Nordic neighbours Finland and Sweden took silver and bronze, respectively.

As it had in 1976, Canada again failed to win an official gold medal as the host of an Olympic Games. Canadians won two gold medals in demonstration events, including by Sylvie Daigle as one of her five medals in short-track speed skating. Canada&#x27;s top official performances came in figure skating where Brian Orser and Elizabeth Manley each won silver medals. Promoted by the media as the &quot;Battle of the Brians&quot;—the competition between Orser and American rival Brian Boitano—and the &quot;Battle of the Carmens&quot;—between Witt and American rival Debi Thomas, who had both elected to skate to Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in their long programs—were the marquee events of the Games. Boitano won the gold medal over Orser by one-tenth of a point. Witt won the gold while Thomas won the bronze medal. Manley was not viewed as a medal contender, but skated the greatest performance of her career to come within a fraction of Witt&#x27;s gold medal-winning score.

American speed skater Dan Jansen&#x27;s personal tragedy was one of the more poignant events of the Games as he skated the 500 metre race mere hours after his sister Jane died of leukemia. A gold medal favourite, Jansen chose to compete as he felt it is what his sister would have wanted. Viewers around the world witnessed his heartbreak as he fell and crashed into the outer wall in the first quarter of his heat. In the 1000 metre race four days later, Jansen was on a world record pace when he again fell. After failing again in Albertville, Jansen finally won a gold medal at the 1994 Lillehamer Games.
One of the most popular athletes from the games was British ski jumper Michael Edwards, who gained infamy by placing last in both the 70 and 90 metre events finishing 70 and 53 points behind his next closest competitor, respectively. Edwards&#x27; &quot;heroic failure&quot; made him an instant celebrity; he went from earning £6,000 per year as a plasterer before the Games to making £10,000 per hour per appearance afterward. Left embarrassed by the spectacle he created, the IOC altered the rules following Calgary to eliminate each nation&#x27;s right to send at least one athlete and set minimum competition standards for future events. Regardless, the President of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, playfully saluted Edwards&#x27; unorthodox sporting legacy, which would also be commemorated with a 2016 feature film, &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;.

The Jamaican bobsleigh team, making their nation&#x27;s Winter Olympic debut, was also popular in Calgary. The team was the brainchild of a pair of Americans who recruited individuals with strong sprinting ability from the Jamaican military to form the team. Dudley Stokes and Michael White finished the two-man event in 30th place out of 41 competitors and launched the Jamaican team into worldwide fame. The pair, along with Devon Harris and Chris Stokes, crashed in the four-man event, but were met with cheers from the crowd as they pushed their sled across the finish line. Their odyssey was made into the 1993 movie &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;, a largely fictionalized comedy by Walt Disney Pictures.

All of the long track world (WR) and Olympic records (OR) that occurred during these Games were later broken at succeeding Winter Olympics and other world events.
==Legacy==

Prior to 1988, the Winter Olympics were viewed as a second-rate event, in comparison to the Summer Olympics. The IOC had, at one point, considered eliminating it altogether. First, there are only a few mountainous areas in the world that would be able to host the Winter Olympics. Second, there were major challenges in generating revenues for the host city and the IOC from such Games. However, CODA convinced the IOC that it could not only generate enough revenues to make a profit but have enough money left over to ensure a lasting legacy of winter sports development. OCO&#x27;88 followed mainly the example of LAOOC which organized the 1984 Summer Olympics. Under LAOOC&#x27;s president, Peter Ueberroth, he was able to attract a large United States television contract and Los Angeles became the first Olympic host city to make a profit. For the 1988 Winter Olympics, OCO&#x27;88 attracted financial support from over two dozen major Canadian and multinational corporations, in order to generate millions of dollars in revenues.

For OCO&#x27;88, it foresaw some winter sports, like the debut of the Super-G and other new winter sports events, as a way to increase the audience&#x27;s appeal of the Winter Olympics. Thus, for the sponsors, the Games&#x27; length of time to 15 days provided an extra weekend of Olympic media coverage to the world. This additional programming time was filled mainly by TV-friendly demonstration events that are popular in Canada. The 1988 Winter Olympics&#x27; exposure to curling, freestyle skiing, and short track speed skating events in Calgary influenced the worldwide popularity of all of them. So much so that all these events became the new and official Olympic finals in the period between the 1992 Winter Olympics to the 2002 Winter Olympics.

===Impact on Calgary===

Hosting the Winter Olympics helped fuel a significant increase in Calgary&#x27;s reputation on the world stage. Crosbie Cotton, a reporter for the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; who covered the city&#x27;s Olympic odyssey from its 1979 initiative to the closing ceremonies, noted an increased positive outlook of the city&#x27;s population over time. He believed that the populace began to outgrow its &quot;giant inferiority complex&quot; that is &quot;typically Canadian&quot;, by replacing it with a new level of confidence as the Games approached. This outcome helped the city grow from a regional oil and gas centre, best known for the Calgary Stampede, to a destination for international political, economic, and sporting events. A study prepared for the organizing committee of the 2010 Winter Olympics, (VANOC), claimed that Calgary hosted over 200 national and international sporting competitions between 1987 and 2007, due to the facilities it had constructed for these Olympic Games.

The Games&#x27; enduring popularity within Calgary has been attributed to efforts in making them &quot;everybody&#x27;s Games.&quot; Aside from the sense of community fostered by the high level of volunteer support, OCO&#x27;88 included the general public in other ways. For example, the citizens were given an opportunity to purchase a brick with their names engraved on it. Those bricks were used to build the Olympic Plaza, where the medal ceremonies were held in 1988. It remains a popular public park and event site in the city&#x27;s downtown core today.

After the success of these Olympic Games, Calgary was wanting to bring back the Olympic experience again. It offered, to the IOC, in becoming a possible alternate host city of the 2002 Winter Olympics, after a bidding scandal resulted in speculation that Salt Lake City would not be able to remain the host city. Next, the city was attempting to be Canada&#x27;s bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics, but the COC decided to give it to Vancouver and Whistler. Later, a 2013 &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; online poll found that 81% of respondents said they would support the idea of hosting another Winter Olympics. On November 13, 2018, Calgary held a public non-binding plebiscite on whether it should bid to host the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. On November 19, 2018, the results of the plebiscite showed that 56.4% (171,750) of eligible voters said &quot;No&quot;, while 43.6% (132,832) of them said &quot;Yes.&quot; Therefore, the city council concluded that the bid would be withdrawn.

===Canada&#x27;s development as a winter sport nation===

In light of the 1976 Summer Olympics&#x27; disastrous financial legacy, the Calgary Olympic organizing committee, OCO&#x27;88, parlayed its ability to generate television and sponsorship revenues, along with the three levels of government support, into what was ultimately a C$170 million surplus. While OCO&#x27;88 reported officially a surplus after the Games were over, the accounting practices of the final report did not include federal, provincial, and municipal capital and operations funding infrastructures.

The overall surplus was turned into endowment funds that were split between Canada Olympic Park (C$110 million) and CODA. They were subsequently reformed later, in order to manage the Olympic facilities with a trust fund that had grown steadily to be worth over C$200 million by 2013. Consequently, all five primary facilities built for the 1988 Winter Olympics remained operational for their intended purposes, 25 years after the Games concluded. Calgary and Canmore became the heart of winter sports in Canada, as CODA (now known as WinSport) established itself as the nation&#x27;s leader in developing elite winter athletes. For the 2006 Winter Olympics, a quarter of Canada&#x27;s Olympic winter athletes were from the Calgary region and three-quarters of its medalists were from or trained in Alberta.

Before 1988, Canada was not a winter sports power. The nation&#x27;s five overall medals won in Calgary was its second-best total at a Winter Olympics, behind the seven overall medals it won at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. After 1988, Canada won an increasing number of gold and overall medals at each successive Winter Olympics. It culminated in an overall performance of 26 medals won at the 2010 Winter Olympics, which included the previous Olympic record of 14 gold medals. Until 2010, Norway won the most Olympic gold medals on home soil at the 1952 Winter Olympics. However, Norway recaptured the record of winning the most Olympic gold medals at a single Winter Olympics in 2022, claiming 16. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Canada earned its highest overall medal count in the Winter Olympics to date, with a total of 29 medals.

<doc id="187505" wikidata="Q208653" url="?curid=187505" title="Trochee">
<text>In poetic metre, a trochee () is a metrical foot consisting of a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one, in qualitative meter, as found in English, and in modern linguistics; or in quantitative meter, as found in Latin and Ancient Greek, a heavy syllable followed by a light one (also described as a long syllable followed by a short one). In this respect, a trochee is the reverse of an iamb. Thus the Latin word , because of its short-long rhythm, in Latin metrical studies is considered to be an iamb, but since it is stressed on the first syllable, in modern linguistics it is considered to be a trochee.

The adjective form is &quot;trochaic&quot;. The English word &quot;trochee&quot; is itself trochaic since it is composed of the stressed syllable followed by the unstressed syllable .

Another name formerly used for a trochee was a choree (), or choreus. 

==Etymology==
&quot;Trochee&quot; comes from French , adapted from Latin , originally from the Greek , from the phrase ; it is connected with the word . The less-often used word &quot;choree&quot; comes from ; both convey the &quot;rolling&quot; rhythm of this metrical foot. The phrase was adapted into English in the late 16th century.

There was a well-established ancient tradition that trochaic rhythm is faster than iambic. When used in drama it is often associated with lively situations. One ancient commentator notes that it was named from the metaphor of people running () and the Roman metrician notes that it was named from its running and speed ().

== Examples ==

Trochaic meter is sometimes seen among the works of William Shakespeare:

Perhaps owing to its simplicity, though, trochaic meter is fairly common in nursery rhymes:

Trochaic verse is also well known in Latin poetry, especially of the medieval period. Since the stress never falls on the final syllable in Medieval Latin, the language is ideal for trochaic verse. The of the Requiem mass is an example:

The Finnish national epic, , like much old Finnish poetry, is written in a variation of trochaic tetrameter.

Trochaic metre is popular in Polish and Czech literatures. &#x27;s poem Edison is written in trochaic hexameter.

===Latin===

In Greek and Latin, the syllabic structure deals with long and short syllables, rather than accented and unaccented. Trochaic meter was rarely used by the Latin poets in the classical period, except in certain passages of the tragedies and the comedies. The two main metres used in comedy were the trochaic septenarius and trochaic octonarius.

<doc id="187509" wikidata="Q7227384" url="?curid=187509" title="Pomona College">
<text>Pomona College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. It was established in 1887 by a group of Congregationalists who wanted to recreate a &quot;college of the New England type&quot; in Southern California. In 1925, it became the founding member of the Claremont Colleges consortium of adjacent, affiliated institutions.

Pomona is a four-year undergraduate institution that approximately students. It offers 48 majors in liberal arts disciplines and roughly 650 courses, as well as access to more than 2,000 additional courses at the other Claremont Colleges. Its campus is in a residential community east of downtown Los Angeles, near the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.

Pomona has the lowest acceptance rate of any U.S. liberal arts college and is considered the most prestigious liberal arts college in the American West and one of the most prestigious in the country. It has a $ endowment , making it one of the 10 wealthiest schools in the U.S. on a per student basis. Nearly all students live on campus, and the student body is noted for its racial, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity. The college&#x27;s athletics teams, the Sagehens, compete jointly with Pitzer College in the SCIAC, a Division III conference.

Prominent alumni of Pomona include Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony award winners; U.S. Senators, ambassadors, and other federal officials; Pulitzer Prize recipients; billionaire executives; a Nobel Prize laureate; National Academies members; and Olympic athletes. The college is a top producer of Fulbright scholars and recipients of other fellowships.

==History==
===Founding era===
Pomona College was established as a coeducational and nonsectarian Christian institution on October 14, 1887, amidst a real estate boom and anticipated population influx precipitated by the arrival of a transcontinental railroad to Southern California. Its founders, a regional group of Congregationalists, sought to create a &quot;college of the New England type&quot;, emulating the institutions where many of them had been educated. Classes first began at Ayer Cottage, a rental house in Pomona, California, on September 12, 1888, with a permanent campus planned at Piedmont Mesa four miles north of the city. That year, as the real estate bubble burst, making the Piedmont campus financially untenable, the college was offered the site of an unfinished hotel (later renamed Sumner Hall) in the nearby, recently founded town of Claremont. It moved there but kept its name. Trustee Charles B. Sumner led the college during its first years, helping hire its first official president, Cyrus G. Baldwin, in 1890. The first graduating class, in 1894, had 11 members.

Pomona suffered through a severe financial crisis during its early years, but raised enough money to add several buildings to its campus. Although the first Asian and black students enrolled in 1897 and 1900, respectively, the student body (like most others of the era) remained almost all white throughout this period. In 1905, during president George A. Gates&#x27; tenure, the college acquired a parcel of land to its east known as the Wash. In 1911, as high schools became more common in the region, the college eliminated its preparatory department, which had taught pre-college level courses. The following year, it committed to a liberal arts model, soon after turning its previously separate schools of art and music into departments within the college. In 1914, the Phi Beta Kappa honor society established a chapter at the college. Daily attendance at chapel was mandated until 1921, and student culture emphasized athletics and academic class rivalries. During World War I, male students were divided into three military companies and a Red Cross unit to assist in the war effort.

===Mid-20th century===
Confronted with growing demand in the 1920s, Pomona&#x27;s fourth president, James A. Blaisdell, considered whether to grow the college into a large university that could acquire additional resources or remain a small institution capable of providing a more intimate educational experience. Seeking both, he pursued an alternative path inspired by the collegiate university model he observed at Oxford, envisioning a group of independent colleges sharing centralized resources such as a library. On October 14, 1925, Pomona&#x27;s 38th anniversary, the college founded the Claremont Colleges consortium. Construction of the Clark dormitories on North Campus (then the men&#x27;s campus) began in 1929, a reflection of president Charles Edmunds&#x27; prioritization of the college&#x27;s residential life. Edmunds, who had previously served as president of Lingnan University in Guangzhou, China, inspired a growing interest in Asian culture at the college and established its Asian studies program.

Pomona&#x27;s enrollment declined during the Great Depression as students became unable to afford tuition, and its budget was slashed by a quarter. The college reoriented itself toward wartime activities again during World War II, hosting an Air Force military meteorology program and Army Specialized Training Program courses in engineering and foreign languages.

===Postwar transformations===
Pomona&#x27;s longest-serving president, E. Wilson Lyon, guided the college through a transformational and turbulent period from 1941 to 1969. The college&#x27;s enrollment rose above 1,000 following the war, leading to the construction of several residence halls and science facilities. Its endowment grew steadily, due in part to the introduction in 1942 of a deferred giving fundraising scheme pioneered by Allen Hawley called the Pomona Plan, where participants receive a lifetime annuity in exchange for donating to the college upon their death. The plan&#x27;s model has since been adopted by many other colleges.
Lyon made several progressive decisions relating to civil rights, including supporting Japanese-American students during internment and establishing an exchange program in 1952 with Fisk University, a historically black university in Tennessee. He and dean of women Jean Walton ended the gender segregation of Pomona&#x27;s residential life, first with the opening of Frary Dining Hall (then part of the men&#x27;s campus) to women beginning in 1957 and later with the elimination of parietal rules in the late 1960s and the introduction of co-educational housing in 1968. The student body, influenced by the countercultural revolution, became less socially conservative and more politically engaged in this era. Protesters opposed to the Vietnam War occupied Sumner Hall to obstruct Air Force recruiters in 1968 and forced the cancellation of classes at the end of the spring 1970 semester. The college&#x27;s ethnic diversity also began to increase, and activists successfully pushed the consortium to establish black and Latino studies programs in 1969. A bomb exploded at the Carnegie Building that February, permanently injuring a secretary; no culprit was ever identified.

During the tenure of president David Alexander from 1969 to 1991, Pomona gained increased prominence on the national stage. The endowment increased ten-fold, enabling the construction and renovation of a number of buildings. Several identity-based groups, such as the Pomona College Women&#x27;s Union (founded in 1984), were established. In the mid-1980s, out-of-state students began to outnumber in-state students.

In 1991, the college converted the dormitory basements used by fraternities into lounges, arguing that this created a more equitable distribution of campus space. The move lowered the profile of Greek life on campus.

===21st century===

In the 2000s, under president David W. Oxtoby, Pomona began placing more emphasis on reducing its environmental impact, committing in 2003 to obtaining LEED certifications for new buildings and launching various sustainability initiatives. The college also entered partnerships with several college access groups (including the Posse Foundation in 2004 and QuestBridge in 2005) and committed to meeting the full demonstrated financial need of students through grants rather than loans in 2008. These efforts, combined with Pomona&#x27;s previously instituted need-blind admission policy, resulted in increased enrollment of low-income and racial minority students.

In 2008, it was discovered that Pomona&#x27;s alma mater may have been originally written to be sung as the ensemble finale to a student-produced blackface minstrel show performed on campus in 1910. The college stopped singing it at convocation and commencement, alienating some alumni.

Pomona requested proof of legal residency from employees amid a unionization drive by dining hall workers in 2011. Seventeen workers who were unable to provide documentation were fired, drawing national media attention and sparking criticism from activists; the dining hall staff voted to unionize in 2013. A rebranding initiative that year sought to emphasize students&#x27; passion and drive, angering students who thought it would lead to a more stressful culture. Several protests in the 2010s criticized the college&#x27;s handling of sexual assault, leading to various reforms.

In 2017, G. Gabrielle Starr became Pomona&#x27;s tenth president; she is the first woman and first African American to hold the office. From March 2020 through the spring 2021 semester, the college switched to online instruction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2024, the college had 19 demonstrators occupying Starr&#x27;s office to urge the college to divest from Israel arrested. This prompted condemnations and protests, including an encampment on Marston Quad that forced the college to move its commencement off-campus.
==Campus==

Pomona&#x27;s campus is in Claremont, California, an affluent suburban residential community east of downtown Los Angeles. It is directly northwest of the Claremont Village (the city&#x27;s downtown commercial district) and directly south of the other contiguous Claremont Colleges. The area has a Mediterranean climate and consists of a gentle slope from the alluvial fan of San Antonio Creek in the San Gabriel Mountains to the north.

In its early years, Pomona quickly expanded from its initial home in Sumner Hall, constructing several buildings to accommodate its growing enrollment and ambitions. Starting in 1908, development of the campus was guided by master plans from architect Myron Hunt, who envisioned a central quadrangle flanked by buildings connected via visual axes. In 1923, landscape architect Ralph Cornell expanded on Hunt&#x27;s plans, envisioning a &quot;college in a garden&quot; defined by native Southern California vegetation but incorporating global influences in the tradition of the acclimatization movement. President James Blaisdell&#x27;s decision to purchase undeveloped land around Pomona while it was still available later gave the college room to grow and found the consortium. Many of the earlier buildings were constructed in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles, with stucco walls and red terracotta tile roofs. Other and later construction incorporated elements of neoclassical, Victorian, Italian Romanesque, modern, and postmodern styles. As a result, the present campus features a blend of architectural styles. Most buildings are three or fewer stories in height, and are designed to facilitate both indoor and outdoor use.

The campus consists of 88 facilities , including 70 addressed buildings. It is bounded by First Street on the south, Mills and Amherst Avenues on the east, Eighth Street on the north, and Harvard Avenue on the west. It is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus by Sixth Street, with most academic buildings in the western half and a naturalistic area known as the Wash in the east. It has been featured in numerous films and television shows, often standing in for other schools.

Pomona has undertaken initiatives to make its campus more sustainable, including requiring that all new construction be built to LEED Gold standards, replacing turf with drought-tolerant landscaping, and committing to achieving carbon neutrality without the aid of purchased carbon credits by 2030. The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education gave the college a gold rating in its 2018 Sustainable Campus Index.

===South Campus===

South Campus consists of mostly first-year and second-year housing and academic buildings for the social sciences, arts, and humanities.

A row of four residence halls is south of Bonita Avenue, with Frank Dining Hall at the eastern end. Sumner Hall, the home of admissions and several other administrative departments, is to the north of the dormitories. Oldenborg Center, a foreign-language housing option that includes a foreign-language dining hall, is across from Sumner.

South Campus has several arts buildings and performance venues. Bridges Auditorium (&quot;Big Bridges&quot;) is used for concerts and speakers and has a capacity of 2,500. Bridges Hall of Music (&quot;Little Bridges&quot;) is a concert hall with seating for 550. On the western edge of campus is the Benton Museum of Art, which has a collection of approximately including Italian Renaissance panel paintings, indigenous American art and artifacts, and American and European prints, drawings, and photographs. The Seaver Theatre Complex has a 335-seat thrust stage theater and 125-seat black box theater, among other facilities. The Studio Art Hall garnered national recognition for its steel-frame design when it was completed in 2014.

Pomona&#x27;s main social science and humanities buildings are located west of College Avenue. They include the Carnegie Building, a neoclassical structure built in 1908 as a Carnegie library. Several historic Victorian houses line the southern portion of the avenue, including the Queen Anne–style Helen Goodwin Renwick House, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

Marston Quadrangle, a lawn framed by California sycamore and coastal redwood trees, serves as a central artery for the campus, anchored by Carnegie on the west and Bridges Auditorium on the east. To its north is Alexander Hall, the college&#x27;s central administration building, and the Smith Campus Center (SCC), home to many student services and communal spaces. East of the SCC is the Center for Athletics, Recreation and Wellness (Pomona&#x27;s primary indoor athletics and recreation facility) and Smiley Hall dormitory, built in 1908.

&lt;section begin=&quot;gates&quot;/&gt;
At the intersection of Sixth Street and College Avenue are the college gates, built in 1914, which mark the historical northern edge of the campus. They bear two quotes from &lt;includeonly&gt;Pomona&#x27;s fourth president, James A. Blaisdell&lt;/includeonly&gt;. On the north is &quot;let only the eager, thoughtful and reverent enter here&quot;, and on the south is &quot;They only are loyal to this college who departing bear their added riches in trust for mankind&quot;. Per campus tradition, enrolling students walk south through the gates during orientation and seniors walk north through them shortly before graduation.&lt;section end=&quot;gates&quot;/&gt;

The less-developed eastern portion of the campus is known as the Wash (formally Blanchard Park), and contains a large grove of coast live oak trees, as well as many of the college&#x27;s athletics facilities, an outdoor amphitheater, an astronomical observatory, and the Pomona College Organic Farm, an experiment in sustainable agriculture.

===North Campus===

North Campus was designed by architect Sumner Spaulding, and its initial phase was completed in 1930. It consists primarily of residential buildings for third- and fourth-year students and academic buildings for the natural sciences.

The academic buildings are located to the west of North College Way. This area includes &quot;Dividing the Light&quot; (2007), a skyspace by Light and Space artist and alumnus James Turrell.

The residence halls include the Clark halls (I, III, and V) and several more recent constructions. The North Campus dining hall, Frary Dining Hall, features a vaulted ceiling and is the location of the murals &quot;Prometheus&quot; (1930) by José Clemente Orozco, the first Mexican fresco in the U.S., and &quot;Genesis&quot; (1960) by Rico Lebrun.

===Other facilities===

The college owns the Trails Ends Ranch (a wilderness area in the Webb Canyon north of campus), the Mildred Pitt Ranch in southeastern Monterey County, and the Halona Lodge retreat center in Idyllwild, California. The astronomy department built and operates a telescope at the Table Mountain Observatory in Big Pines, California.

Along the north side of campus are several joint buildings maintained by The Claremont Colleges Services. The consortium also owns the Robert J. Bernard Field Station north of Foothill Boulevard.

==Organization and administration==
===Governance===

Pomona is governed as a private, nonprofit organization by a board of trustees responsible for overseeing the long-term interests of the college. The board consists of up to 42 members, most of whom are elected by existing members to four-year terms with a term limit of 12 years. It is responsible for hiring the college&#x27;s president ( since ), approving budgets, setting overarching policies, and various other tasks. The president, in turn, oversees the college&#x27;s general operation, assisted by administrative staff and a faculty cabinet. The college has total employees as of the semester. Pomona operates under a shared governance model, in which faculty and students sit on many policymaking committees and have a degree of control over other major decisions.

===Academic affiliations===

Pomona is the founding member of the Claremont Colleges (colloquially &quot;7Cs&quot;, for &quot;seven colleges&quot;), a consortium of five undergraduate liberal arts colleges (&quot;5Cs&quot;)—Pomona, Scripps, Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, and Pitzer—and two graduate schools—Claremont Graduate University and Keck Graduate Institute. All are located in Claremont. Although each member has individual autonomy and a distinct identity, there is substantial collaboration through The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS), a coordinating entity that manages the central library, campus safety services, health services, and other resources. Overall, the 7Cs have been praised by higher education experts for their close cooperation, although there have been occasional tensions. Pomona is the largest undergraduate and wealthiest member.

Pomona is a member of several other consortia of selective colleges, including the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges, the Oberlin Group, and the Annapolis Group. The college is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission, which reaffirmed its status in 2021 with particular praise for its diversity initiatives.

For the 2023 graduation cohort, 21% of students majored in the arts and humanities, 39% in the natural sciences, 24% in the social sciences, and 16% in interdisciplinary fields. 19% of students completed a double major, 29% completed a minor, and 2% completed multiple minors. The college does not permit majoring in pre-professional disciplines such as medicine or law but offers academic advising for those areas and 3‑2 engineering programs with Caltech, Dartmouth, and Washington University.

=== Courses ===
Individually, Pomona offers approximately 650 courses per semester. Additionally, students may take a significant portion of their courses at the other Claremont Colleges, enabling access to approximately 2,700 courses total. The academic calendars and registration procedures across the colleges are synchronized and consolidated, and there are no additional fees for cross-enrollment. Students may also create independent study courses evaluated by faculty mentors.

All classes at Pomona are taught by professors (as opposed to teaching assistants). The average class size is 15; for the fall 2024 semester, 91% of traditional courses had under 30 students, and only four courses had 50 or more students. The college employs faculty members as of the semester, approximately four-fifths of whom are full-time, resulting in a ratio of students to full-time equivalent professors. Among full-time faculty, 38% are members of racial minority groups, 51% are women, and 96% have a doctorate or other terminal degree in their field. Students and professors often form close relationships, and the college provides faculty with free meals to encourage them to eat with students. Semesters end with a week-long final examination period preceded by two reading days. The college operates several resource centers to help students develop academic skills in quantitative tasks, writing, and foreign languages.

=== Research, study abroad, and professional development ===
More than half of Pomona students conduct research with faculty. The college sponsors an annual Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), in which more than 200 students are paid a stipend of up to $5,600 to conduct research with professors or pursue independent research projects with professorial mentorship.

==Student life==

=== Residential life ===
Pomona is a residential campus, and nearly all students live on campus for all four years in one of the college&#x27;s sixteen residence halls. All first-year students live on South Campus, and most third- and fourth-year students live on North Campus. Housing is offered in various configurations, including singles, one-room or two-room doubles, and &quot;friendship suites&quot; consisting of a cluster of rooms, often around a central common area. All incoming students are placed into a sponsor group, with ten to twenty peers and two or three upper-class &quot;sponsors&quot; tasked with easing the transition to college life but not enforcing rules (a duty given to resident advisors). Sponsor groups often share activities such as &quot;fountaining&quot;, a tradition in which students are thrown into a campus fountain on their birthday. The program dates back to 1927 for women and was expanded in 1950 to include men.

Pomona&#x27;s social scene is intertwined with that of the other , with many activities and events shared between the colleges. The college&#x27;s alcohol policies are aimed at encouraging responsible consumption and include a strict ban of hard liquor on South Campus. Dedicated substance-free housing is also offered. Overall, drinking culture is present but does not dominate over other elements of campus life, nor does athletics culture. Violations of the student code are typically handled by the student-run Judicial Council, known as &quot;J-Board&quot;.

Pomona&#x27;s dining services are run in house. All on-campus students are required to have a meal plan, which can be used at any of the Claremont Colleges&#x27; seven buffet-style dining halls. The menus emphasize sustainable and healthy options, and the food quality is generally praised. Every night Sunday through Wednesday, Frary Dining Hall opens for a late-night snack. Meal plans also include &quot;Flex Dollars&quot; usable at the various campus eateries, including the Coop Fountain, Coop Store, and sit-down Café 47 in the .

The Campus Advocates and EmPOWER Center support survivors of sexual violence and work to promote consent culture.

The Pomona Student Union (PSU) facilitates the discussion of political and social issues on campus by hosting discussions, panels, and debates with prominent speakers holding diverse viewpoints. Other speech and debate organizations include a mock trial team, model UN team, and debate union. Pomona&#x27;s secret society, Mufti, is known for gluing small sheets of paper around campus with cryptic puns offering social commentary on campus happenings.

Pomona&#x27;s music department manages several ensembles, including an orchestra, band, choir, glee club, jazz ensemble, and Balinese gamelan ensemble. All students can receive free private music lessons. 

The Draper Center for Community Partnerships, established in 2009, coordinates Pomona&#x27;s various community engagement programs. These include mentoring for local youth communities, English tutoring for Pomona staff, and volunteering trips over spring break. It also operates the Pomona Academy for Youth Success (PAYS), a three-year pre-college summer program for local low-income and first-generation students of color.

Pomona has two remaining local Greek letter organizations, Sigma Tau and Kappa Delta, both of which are co-educational. Neither have special housing, and Greek life is not considered a major part of the social scene on campus the way it is at many other U.S. colleges.

===Traditions===
====Forty-seven reverence====

====Other traditions====

As part of Pomona&#x27;s 10-day orientation, incoming students spend four days off campus completing an &quot;Orientation Adventure&quot; or &quot;OA&quot; trip. The OA program began in 1995, and is one of the oldest outdoor orientation programs in the U.S.

Every spring, the college hosts &quot;Ski-Beach Day&quot;, in which students visit a ski resort in the morning and then head to the beach after lunch. The tradition dates back to an annual mountain picnic established in 1891.

Since the 1970s, Pomona has used a cinder block flood barrier along the northern edge of its campus, Walker Wall, as a free speech wall. Over the years, provocative postings on the wall have spawned numerous controversies.

===Transportation===

Pomona&#x27;s campus is located immediately north of Claremont Station, where the Metrolink San Bernardino Line train provides regular service to Los Angeles Union Station (the city&#x27;s main transit hub) and the Foothill Transit bus system connects to cities in the San Gabriel Valley and Pomona Valley.

Pomona&#x27;s &quot;Green Bikes&quot; program maintains a fleet of more than 300 bicycles that are rented free to students each semester. Non-first-year students are allowed to park on campus after registering their vehicle. The college has several Zipcar vehicles on campus that may be rented and owns vehicles that can be checked out for club and extracurricular purposes. and off-campus events are usually served with the college&#x27;s &quot;Sagecoach&quot; passenger bus.

===Athletics===


&lt;includeonly&gt;Pitzer&#x27;s&lt;/includeonly&gt; varsity athletics teams compete jointly with &lt;includeonly&gt;Pomona College (another consortium member)&lt;/includeonly&gt; as the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. The 11 women&#x27;s and 10 men&#x27;s teams participate in NCAA Division III in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC). Pomona-Pitzer&#x27;s mascot is Cecil the Sagehen, a greater sage-grouse, and its colors are blue and orange. Its main rival is the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas (CMS), the other sports combination of the Claremont Colleges. 

Club and intramural sports are also offered in various areas, such as dodgeball, flag football, and surfing. The physical education department offers a variety of activity classes each semester, such as karate, playground games, geocaching, and social dance.

====Athletics history====

Pomona&#x27;s first intercollegiate sports teams were formed in 1895. They competed under several names in the school&#x27;s early years; the name &quot;Sagehen&quot; first appeared in 1913 and became the sole moniker in 1917. Pomona was one of the three founding members of the SCIAC in 1914. In 1946, it joined with Claremont Men&#x27;s College (which would later be renamed Claremont McKenna College) to compete as Pomona-Claremont. The teams separated in 1956, and Pomona&#x27;s athletics program operated independently until it joined with Pitzer College in 1970.

<text>The naval Battle of Dover , fought on 19 May 1652 (29 May 1652 Gregorian calendar), was the first engagement of the First Anglo-Dutch War between the navies of the Commonwealth of England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. It proved to be an indecisive battle involving the flagships of Admirals Maarten Tromp and Robert Blake. Opinions about the outcome of that battle vary among historians of that period.

== Background ==
The English Parliament had passed the first of the Navigation Acts in October 1651, aimed at hampering the shipping of the highly trade-dependent Dutch. Agitation among the Dutch merchants had been further increased by George Ayscue&#x27;s capture in early 1652 of 27 Dutch ships trading with the royalist colony of Barbados in contravention of an embargo. Both sides had begun to prepare for war, but conflict might have been delayed if not for an unfortunate encounter on 29 May 1652 (19 May in the Julian calendar then in use in England) near the Straits of Dover between a Dutch convoy escorted by 40 ships under Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp and an English fleet of 25 ships under General-at-Sea Robert Blake.

== Battle ==

Prior to the battle, Oliver Cromwell had issued an ordinance requiring all foreign warships in the North Sea or English Channel to lower their flag in salute when encountering ships of the English navy. Combined with Ayscue&#x27;s seizure of the Dutch merchantmen trading with Barbados, this led to a rapid deterioration in Anglo-Dutch relations. Tromp was subsequently given orders to protect Dutch commerce while keeping watch over the English navy. On 19 May 1652, Tromp was cruising in the English Channel with a fleet of forty ships between Nieuport and the mouth of the Meuse River. General at Sea Robert Blake was lying in Dover Roads with fifteen warships, with eight others were anchored in Bourne in the Downs.

While on patrol, Tromp received orders from a dispatch ketch to attack Blake&#x27;s fleet, and had not struck his flag in salute. Blake, aboard his flagship &quot;James&quot;, assumed Tromp had received orders to commence battle and fired two warning shots. A defiant Tromp hoisted a red battle flag, which prompted &quot;James&quot; to fire a third shot, hitting Tromp&#x27;s ship &quot;Brederode&quot; and wounding a number of its crew. This was followed with Tromp returning fire with a warning broadside from &quot;Brederode&quot;. &quot;James&quot; in turn fired a broadside and a battle that would last five hours ensued. Tromp immediately engaged Blake&#x27;s flag ship where the two ships exchanged broadsides as they passed one another.

While tacking to turn and fire another broadside, &quot;Brederode&quot; came into violent contact with &quot;President&quot;, which grappled with the &quot;Brederode&quot; and began boarding it. During the fierce melee that followed, Tromp&#x27;s crew forced the attackers back on to their own ship. At this time, the English ship &quot;Garland&quot; came along to the other side of &quot;Brederode&quot;, placing it between &quot;President&quot; and &quot;Garland&quot;. Johan Evertsen, now aware of Tromp&#x27;s plight, quickly came to assist, placing his ship directly alongside &quot;President&quot; and firing broadsides which severed all her masts, after which Evertsen&#x27;s crew boarded her and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting before being beaten back. The fighting continued until nightfall, where both sides withdrew, the battle having no distinct victor. The ships of Tromp and Evertsen divided their prisoners between them and sailed back toward Texel, with Blake, with his flagship in tow making his way to Dover.

== Aftermath ==
Both fleets were damaged, but as darkness fell the Dutch fleet withdrew in a defensive line to protect the convoy, and the English captured two Dutch stragglers: &quot;Sint Laurens&quot;, which was taken back by them but not used, and &quot;Sint Maria&quot;, which was abandoned in a sinking condition and later made its way to the Netherlands. Tromp then offered his excuses to Blake and asked for the return of the prize, but this was refused by Blake.

War was declared by the Commonwealth of England on 8 July 1652.

<text>Katrin Juliet Cartlidge (15 May 1961 – 7 September 2002) was an English actress. She first appeared on screen as Lucy Collins in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; (1982–1983), before going on to win the 1997 Evening Standard Film Award for Best Actress for the Mike Leigh film &quot;Career Girls&quot;. Her other film appearances included Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot; (1993), &quot;Before the Rain&quot; (1994), &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996) and &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001).

==Early life==
Cartlidge was born in London, to Derek, an English father and Bobbi, a German-Jewish refugee mother. She was educated at the Parliament Hill School for Girls in Camden.

==Work==
Her work on Manchevski&#x27;s &quot;Before the Rain&quot; and on &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; made her well known in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Balkans. Sophie, in Mike Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot;, was her first leading role. Cartlidge worked in two more Leigh films: in &quot;Career Girls&quot; she played one of the lead roles, Hannah, at the ages of both 20 and 30, and in &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot; she was a madam in a Paris brothel. She was due to play the lead role in Polish director Lech Majewski&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;—that of an art historian dying of cancer—but she left shortly before production began. Cartlidge won a role in &quot;21 Grams&quot; but was replaced by Charlotte Gainsbourg due to her death. Cartlidge was also filming Dogville at the time of her death and was replaced by Patricia Clarkson.
Cartlidge died at the age of 41, owing to complications from pneumonia and septicaemia.

==Legacy==
The impact of Cartlidge&#x27;s sudden death saw the creation of the Katrin Cartlidge Foundation by the trustees Mike Leigh, Peter Gevisser, Simon McBurney, Chris Simon, and Cat Villiers. The patrons include Lars von Trier and Cartlidge&#x27;s sister Michelle. Established at the Sarajevo Film Festival, an annual bursary is awarded by &quot;an elected curator, chosen by the (Foundation) Trustees from a wide and eclectic number of Katrin Cartlidge’s friends and colleagues...(to) a new creative voice... While the new talent nominated each year will be a filmmaker, it is anticipated that the choices will be as varied and extraordinary as Katrin’s own choice of filmmakers and friends from across the arts.&quot;

Mike Leigh: &quot;She took to the improvisation and character work instantly, easily and with extraordinary commitment and imagination. Other than in the Royal Court Young Peoples Theatre, she had had no formal training, but you would never have guessed it. (Drama Centre London turned her down, and that put her off). She often talked to me about [a] move into directing. I am in no doubt that we have lost not only one of our greatest actors but also one of the most interesting new directors of the future.&quot;

Following her death, British singer Morrissey dedicated a performance of his song &quot;Late Night, Maudlin Street&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall to Cartlidge, describing her as a &quot;brilliant person and fantastic actor&quot;.

Tracy Letts dedicated his 2003 play &quot;Man from Nebraska&quot; to Cartlidge, stating &quot;Man from Nebraska is dedicated to the memory of my dear friend Katrin Cartlidge&quot;.

<text>Sten Sture the Younger () (1493 – 3 February 1520), was a Swedish nobleman who served as the regent of Sweden, during the era of the Kalmar Union.

==Biography==
Sture was born in 1493, as the son of Svante Nilsson (regent of Sweden) and Iliana Gisladotter Gädda, heiress of Ulvåsa.
At the death of his father, regent Svante, Sture was only 18 years old. High Councillor Eric Trolle was chosen as regent by the High Council. He supported the union with Denmark. However, Sture utilized the castles and troops fiefed to him by his late father and executed a coup. After Sture promised to continue union negotiations with Denmark, the High Council accepted him as regent replacing Eric Trolle.

In reality, Sture&#x27;s purpose was to keep Sweden independent from Denmark. He adopted the Sture surname, heritage from his great-grandmother, because it symbolized independence from Denmark and as a reminder of Sten Sture the Elder, his father&#x27;s third cousin.

Conflict soon arose between Sture as regent and Gustav Trolle, Archbishop of Uppsala, and son of Eric Trolle. The archbishop claimed more autonomy for the church. Sture had Trolle removed from his office and imprisoned.

Sture knew that sooner or later, a war with King Hans of Denmark (died 1513) or his son and successor King Christian II would be inevitable. Therefore, in 1513 he agreed to a truce with Russia.

When Christian II started an invasion of Sweden, Sture was mortally wounded at the battle of Bogesund on 19 January 1520 and died on the ice of lake Mälaren on his way back to Stockholm. This was during the later part of Christian II of Denmark&#x27;s war against Sweden.

Christian II was enthroned in Sweden in November 1520 and archbishop Gustav had his revenge against supporters of Sture and against those who deposed the archbishop: he listed those enemies and accusations against them, denouncing them as heretics. King Christian had those accused executed at the Stockholm Bloodbath (&quot;Stockholms blodbad&quot;) in November 1520, including Sten Sture&#x27;s corpse which was desecrated as that of a heretic by being burnt at the stake.

==Personal life==
His marriage in 1511 to Christina Gyllenstierna, great-granddaughter of King Charles VIII, produced six children, but only one of them survived to adulthood, the son Svante Stensson Sture, later elevated to Riksmarsk and Count of Stegeholm. In the 20th century, his distant direct descendant, Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha married the hereditary Prince Gustaf Adolf. Their son was King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden.

<text>Erik Trolle (or Erik Arvidsson) (c. 1460–1530) was elected regent of Sweden in 1512, during the era of Kalmar Union. He was Justiciar of Närke and a Lord High Councillor of Sweden from 1487.

==Biography==
Erik Arvidsson was born around 1460 into an important family of high nobility and was apparently aiming at a clerical career. Erik&#x27;s parents were lord Arvid Birgersson Trolle (died 1505) and his first wife Kerstin Jonsdotter (Gädda). His father had connected him to the powerful Thott family by marrying Beate Iversdatter Thott (died 1487) as his second wife in 1466. His last stepmother was his father&#x27;s third wife Brita Turesdotter Bielke.

Erik studied at the University of Rostock and University of Cologne, had positions as Canon in Uppsala and Linköping but was never ordained. Erik was elected Regent (&quot;riksföreståndare&quot;) at the meeting of the High Council of Sweden in 1512 upon the death of regent Svante Nilsson, Lord of Ekesiö, but never actually took office, being superseded by Svante&#x27;s son, the young Sten Sture the Younger.

He married in 1487 the wealthy Ingeborg Philipsdatter (Thott) (died 1495), his stepmother&#x27;s first cousin, as his first wife and settled on her manor Ekholmen Castle in Uppland. His second wife, from about 1512, was Karin Eriksdotter Gyllenstierna, much his junior, who survived until around 1562. She was a great-granddaughter of King Karl Knutsson. Erik Trolle&#x27;s son Gustav Trolle (1488–1535) became Archbishop of Uppsala and leader of the Church of Sweden.

<text>Svante Nilsson ( 1460 – 2 January 1512) was a Swedish nobleman and regent of Sweden from 1504 to 1512. He was the father of Sten Sture the Younger (1493–1520), who later served as regent of Sweden during the era of the Kalmar Union.

==Biography==
Svante was born at Penningby Castle (&quot;Penningby slott&quot;), at Norrtälje in Uppland, the son of Nils Bosson Sture (ca 1426-1494). Nils belonged to the Natt och Dag dynasty, but took the surname Sture from his maternal grandfather Sven Sture. Svante himself never used the surname Sture, but his son Sten later adopted it in order to associate himself with the memory of Sten Sture the Elder (who, confusingly, was unrelated to Sven Sture but was nevertheless a distant cousin of Svante&#x27;s through the Natt och Dag line). Svante&#x27;s mother was Birgitta Tordsdotter Bonde (1439-1494), a member of the Bonde family and cousin of King Karl VIII.

Svante became a member of the Privy Council of Sweden no later than 1482, but acted in opposition to his distant kinsman Sten Sture the Elder, going as far as supporting King John of Denmark. Unwillingly he then switched sides and supported Sten Sture in overthrowing the king.
When Sten Sture died in 1503, Svante became head of state in January 1504. His resignation was demanded by the Privy Council of Sweden in the summer of 1511, on the grounds that he had neglected the defense on the occasion of Danish ravages. In practice he remained in power until his death at Arboga on 2 January 1512. Svante Nilsson was buried in Västerås Cathedral.

His first marriage in 1486 was with Iliana Gisladotter Gädda. Through this marriage he was the father of future statesman and regent of Sweden, Sten Sture the Younger (1493–1520). He married a second time in 1504 with Mette Dyre (c. 1465-before 1533).

<text>Hermann Klaus Hugo Weyl, (; ; 9 November 1885 – 8 December 1955) was a German mathematician, theoretical physicist, logician and philosopher. Although much of his working life was spent in Zürich, Switzerland, and then Princeton, New Jersey, he is associated with the University of Göttingen tradition of mathematics, represented by Carl Friedrich Gauss, David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski.

His research has had major significance for theoretical physics as well as purely mathematical disciplines such as number theory. He was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century, and an important member of the Institute for Advanced Study during its early years.

Weyl contributed to an exceptionally wide range of fields, including works on space, time, matter, philosophy, logic, symmetry and the history of mathematics. He was one of the first to conceive of combining general relativity with the laws of electromagnetism. Freeman Dyson wrote that Weyl alone bore comparison with the &quot;last great universal mathematicians of the nineteenth century&quot;, Henri Poincaré and David Hilbert. Michael Atiyah, in particular, has commented that whenever he examined a mathematical topic, he found that Weyl had preceded him.

==Biography==
Hermann Weyl was born in Elmshorn, a small town near Hamburg, in Germany, and attended the Gymnasium Christianeum in Altona. His father, Ludwig Weyl, was a banker; whereas his mother, Anna Weyl (née Dieck), came from a wealthy family.

From 1904 to 1908, he studied mathematics and physics in both Göttingen and Munich. His doctorate was awarded at the University of Göttingen under the supervision of David Hilbert, whom he greatly admired.

In September 1913, in Göttingen, Weyl married Friederike Bertha Helene Joseph (30 March 1893 – 5 September 1948) who went by the name Helene (nickname &quot;Hella&quot;). Helene was a daughter of Dr. Bruno Joseph (13 December 1861 – 10 June 1934), a physician who held the position of Sanitätsrat in Ribnitz-Damgarten, Germany. Helene was a philosopher (she was a disciple of phenomenologist Edmund Husserl) and a translator of Spanish literature into German and English (especially the works of Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset). It was through Helene&#x27;s close connection with Husserl that Hermann became familiar with (and greatly influenced by) Husserl&#x27;s thought. Hermann and Helene had two sons, Fritz Joachim Weyl (19 February 1915 – 20 July 1977) and Michael Weyl (15 September 1917 – 19 March 2011), both of whom were born in Zürich, Switzerland. Helene died in Princeton, New Jersey, on 5 September 1948. A memorial service in her honor was held in Princeton on 9 September 1948. Speakers at her memorial service included her son Fritz Joachim Weyl and mathematicians Oswald Veblen and Richard Courant. In 1950. Hermann married sculptor Ellen Bär (née Lohnstein) (17 April 1902 – 14 July 1988), who was the widow of professor Richard Josef Bär (11 September 1892 – 15 December 1940) of Zürich.

After taking a teaching post for a few years, Weyl left Göttingen in 1913 for Zürich to take the chair of mathematics at the ETH Zürich, where he was a colleague of Albert Einstein, who was working out the details of the theory of general relativity. Einstein had a lasting influence on Weyl, who became fascinated by mathematical physics. In 1921, Weyl met Erwin Schrödinger, a theoretical physicist who at the time was a professor at the University of Zürich. They were to become close friends over time. Weyl had some sort of childless love affair with Schrödinger&#x27;s wife Annemarie (Anny) Schrödinger (née Bertel), while at the same time Anny was helping raise an illegitimate daughter of Erwin&#x27;s named Ruth Georgie Erica March, who was born in 1934 in Oxford, England.

Weyl was a Plenary Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1928 at Bologna and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1936 at Oslo. He was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1928, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1935, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1940. For the academic year 1928–1929, he was a visiting professor at Princeton University, where he wrote a paper, &quot;On a problem in the theory of groups arising in the foundations of infinitesimal geometry,&quot; with Howard P. Robertson.

Weyl left Zürich in 1930 to become Hilbert&#x27;s successor at Göttingen, leaving when the Nazis assumed power in 1933, particularly as his wife was Jewish. He had been offered one of the first faculty positions at the new Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, but had declined because he did not desire to leave his homeland. As the political situation in Germany grew worse, he changed his mind and accepted when offered the position again. He remained there until his retirement in 1951. Together with his second wife Ellen, he spent his time in Princeton and Zürich, and died from a heart attack on 8 December 1955, while living in Zürich.

Weyl was cremated in Zürich on 12 December 1955. His ashes remained in private hands until 1999, at which time they were interred in an outdoor columbarium vault in the Princeton Cemetery. The remains of Hermann&#x27;s son Michael Weyl (1917–2011) are interred right next to Hermann&#x27;s ashes in the same columbarium vault.

Weyl was a pantheist.

==Contributions==

===Distribution of eigenvalues===
In 1911 Weyl published &quot;Über die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte&quot; (&quot;On the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues&quot;) in which he proved that the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in a compact domain are distributed according to the so-called Weyl law. In 1912 he suggested a new proof, based on variational principles. Weyl returned to this topic several times, considered elasticity system and formulated the Weyl conjecture. These works started an important domain—asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues—of modern analysis.

===Geometric foundations of manifolds and physics===
In 1913, Weyl published &quot;Die Idee der Riemannschen Fläche&quot; (&quot;The Concept of a Riemann Surface&quot;), which gave a unified treatment of Riemann surfaces. In it Weyl utilized point set topology, in order to make Riemann surface theory more rigorous, a model followed in later work on manifolds. He absorbed L. E. J. Brouwer&#x27;s early work in topology for this purpose.

Weyl, as a major figure in the Göttingen school, was fully apprised of Einstein&#x27;s work from its early days. He tracked the development of relativity physics in his &quot;Raum, Zeit, Materie&quot; (&quot;Space, Time, Matter&quot;) from 1918, reaching a 4th edition in 1922. In 1918, he introduced the notion of gauge, and gave the first example of what is now known as a gauge theory. Weyl&#x27;s gauge theory was an unsuccessful attempt to model the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field as geometrical properties of spacetime. The Weyl tensor in Riemannian geometry is of major importance in understanding the nature of conformal geometry. 

His overall approach in physics was based on the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl, specifically Husserl&#x27;s 1913 &quot;Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch: Allgemeine Einführung in die reine Phänomenologie &quot; (Ideas of a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy. First Book: General Introduction). Husserl had reacted strongly to Gottlob Frege&#x27;s criticism of his first work on the philosophy of arithmetic and was investigating the sense of mathematical and other structures, which Frege had distinguished from empirical reference.

===Topological groups, Lie groups and representation theory===
From 1923 to 1938, Weyl developed the theory of compact groups, in terms of matrix representations. In the compact Lie group case he proved a fundamental character formula.

These results are foundational in understanding the symmetry structure of quantum mechanics, which he put on a group-theoretic basis. This included spinors. Together with the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, in large measure due to John von Neumann, this gave the treatment familiar since about 1930. Non-compact groups and their representations, particularly the Heisenberg group, were also streamlined in that specific context, in his 1927 Weyl quantization, the best extant bridge between
classical and quantum physics to date. From this time, and certainly much helped by Weyl&#x27;s expositions, Lie groups and Lie algebras became a mainstream part both of pure mathematics and theoretical physics.

His book &quot;The Classical Groups&quot; reconsidered invariant theory. It covered symmetric groups, general linear groups, orthogonal groups, and symplectic groups and results on their invariants and representations.

===Harmonic analysis and analytic number theory===

Weyl also showed how to use exponential sums in diophantine approximation, with his criterion for uniform distribution mod 1, which was a fundamental step in analytic number theory. This work applied to the Riemann zeta function, as well as additive number theory. It was developed by many others.

===Foundations of mathematics===
In &quot;The Continuum&quot; Weyl developed the logic of predicative analysis using the lower levels of Bertrand Russell&#x27;s ramified theory of types. He was able to develop most of classical calculus, while using neither the axiom of choice nor proof by contradiction, and avoiding Georg Cantor&#x27;s infinite sets. Weyl appealed in this period to the radical constructivism of the German romantic, subjective idealist Fichte.

Shortly after publishing &quot;The Continuum&quot; Weyl briefly shifted his position wholly to the intuitionism of Brouwer. In &quot;The Continuum&quot;, the constructible points exist as discrete entities. Weyl wanted a continuum that was not an aggregate of points. He wrote a controversial article proclaiming, for himself and L. E. J. Brouwer, a &quot;revolution.&quot; This article was far more influential in propagating intuitionistic views than the original works of Brouwer himself.

George Pólya and Weyl, during a mathematicians&#x27; gathering in Zürich (9 February 1918), made a bet concerning the future direction of mathematics. Weyl predicted that in the subsequent 20 years, mathematicians would come to realize the total vagueness of notions such as real numbers, sets, and countability, and moreover, that asking about the truth or falsity of the least upper bound property of the real numbers was as meaningful as asking about truth of the basic assertions of Hegel on the philosophy of nature. Any answer to such a question would be unverifiable, unrelated to experience, and therefore senseless.

However, within a few years Weyl decided that Brouwer&#x27;s intuitionism did put too great restrictions on mathematics, as critics had always said. The &quot;Crisis&quot; article had disturbed Weyl&#x27;s formalist teacher Hilbert, but later in the 1920s Weyl partially reconciled his position with that of Hilbert.

After about 1928 Weyl had apparently decided that mathematical intuitionism was not compatible with his enthusiasm for the phenomenological philosophy of Husserl, as he had apparently earlier thought. In the last decades of his life Weyl emphasized mathematics as &quot;symbolic construction&quot; and moved to a position closer not only to Hilbert but to that of Ernst Cassirer. Weyl however rarely refers to Cassirer, and wrote only brief articles and passages articulating this position.

By 1949, Weyl was thoroughly disillusioned with the ultimate value of intuitionism, and wrote: &quot;Mathematics with Brouwer gains its highest intuitive clarity. He succeeds in developing the beginnings of analysis in a natural manner, all the time preserving the contact with intuition much more closely than had been done before. It cannot be denied, however, that in advancing to higher and more general theories the inapplicability of the simple laws of classical logic eventually results in an almost unbearable awkwardness. And the mathematician watches with pain the greater part of his towering edifice which he believed to be built of concrete blocks dissolve into mist before his eyes.&quot; As John L Bell puts it: &quot;It seems to me a great pity that Weyl did not live to see the emergence in the 1970s of smooth infinitesimal analysis, a mathematical framework within which his vision of a true continuum, not “synthesized” from discrete elements, is realized. Although the underlying logic of smooth infinitesimal analysis is intuitionistic — the law of excluded middle not being generally affirmable — mathematics developed within avoids the “unbearable awkwardness” to which Weyl refers above.&quot;

===Weyl equation===

In 1929, Weyl proposed an equation, known as the Weyl equation, for use in a replacement to the Dirac equation. This equation describes massless fermions. A normal Dirac fermion could be split into two Weyl fermions or formed from two Weyl fermions. Neutrinos were once thought to be Weyl fermions, but they are now known to have mass. Weyl fermions are sought after for electronics applications. Quasiparticles that behave as Weyl fermions were discovered in 2015, in a form of crystals known as Weyl semimetals, a type of topological material.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1126/science.aaa9297&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
Weyl had been interested in philosophy since his youth, when he read Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; with space and time as a priori concepts of knowledge (even if he later disliked Kant&#x27;s too close ties to Euclidean geometry). From 1912 onwards he was strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and his phenomenology, which was also reflected in some passages in his book “Space, Time, Matter”. In 1927 his contribution Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Sciences to the Handbook of Philosophy was published by Oldenbourg Verlag, which was later published separately and revised as a book. In an attempt to reconstruct the origins of Hermann Weyl&#x27;s philosophy and to integrate them into the main currents of philosophy, Norman Sieroka pointed to intensive, long-term discussions between Weyl and his Zurich philosopher colleague Fritz Medicus, a specialist on Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Fichte&#x27;s Wissenschaftslehre and philosophy, according to which &quot;being&quot; results from the interaction of the &quot;absolute ego&quot; with its material neighbourhood (Umgebung), is also of great influence on Weyl and is reflected in Weyl&#x27;s use of the neighbourhood concept of topology (continuum) and in Weyl&#x27;s conception of the general theory of relativity, alongside the influences of Edmund Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology known directly from Weyl&#x27;s writings. According to Sieroka, Weyl also finds influences from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&#x27;s theory of matter (the theory of monads, etc.) and German idealism (Fichte&#x27;s dialectic) in Weyl&#x27;s philosophical interpretation of the physical concept of matter in the context of quantum theory and general relativity and with regard to interaction of a symbol with its surroundings in a mathematical theory structure also in Weyl&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics (debate between formalism and intuitionism under the influence of Brouwer). He understands the intra-mathematical debate about intuitionism and formalism along the lines of a debate between Husserlian phenomenology and Fichtean constructivism. In the 1920s, before the development of quantum mechanics and inspired by the statistical nature of quantum theory, which was becoming increasingly clear at the time, Weyl turned away from the field-theoretical description of matter towards a theory of active (agens) matter, which was achieved by including the spatial environment in the field theoretical description expressed. He had previously described the general theory of relativity and his own extensions of it, which led to the origin of today&#x27;s concept of gauge field theories, using differential geometric methods. Under the influence of quantum theory, he turned away from this “geometric field theory”. According to Sieroka, Fichte and Ernst Cassirer were also an important influence in Weyl&#x27;s late philosophy (science as a “symbolic construction”). Weyl&#x27;s involvement with Martin Heidegger was less well known. Although Weyl did not agree with Heidegger&#x27;s opinion about death, his conception of neighbourhood (Umgebung) was influenced by Heidegger&#x27;s Existentialism.
