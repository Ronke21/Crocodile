<text>Barry Steven Frank Sheene (11 September 1950 – 10 March 2003) was a British professional motorcycle racer and television sports presenter. He competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing between and , most prominently as a member of the Suzuki factory racing team where he won two consecutive FIM World Championships in and . Sheene remains the last British competitor to win the premier class of FIM road racing competitions.

Good looking, articulate and charismatic, Sheene was able to harness the power of mass media to transcend the sport and become the best-known face of British motorcycle racing during the 1970s. He was the first motorcycle racer to gain commercial endorsements from outside the sport, including television advertisements for Brut cologne. As well as being fluent in several languages, he had a cheeky, cockney persona that endeared him to thousands of race fans.

Sheene was also a strong proponent of race track safety, and was one of the first competitors to object to racing at the notoriously dangerous Isle of Man TT street circuit. He recognized his value to race promoters as a gate attraction and used his influence to force race promoters to increase rider safety.

After a racing career stretching from 1968 to 1984 he retired from competition and relocated to Australia, working as a motorsport commentator and property developer. In 2011, the FIM inducted Sheene into the MotoGP Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Barry Steven Frank Sheene was born on September 11, 1950, off the Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, Bloomsbury, London, where his father, Frank Sheene, worked as the resident engineer at the Royal College of Surgeons. His father was a former competitive motorcyclist and an experienced motorcycle mechanic. He grew up in Queen Square, Holborn, London, where he learned to ride a motorcycle at the age of 5 aboard a homemade minibike built by his father. Before he raced motorcycles competitively, Sheene found work as a motorcycle courier and delivery driver.

==Career==
===First foray into racing===
Sheene&#x27;s father had developed a close, personal relationship with Don Paco Bultó, the owner of Bultaco motorcycles, after meeting him in 1959 while attending the Montjuïc 24 Hour endurance race in Barcelona. Frank Sheene was one of the first proponents of the two-stroke engine that began to dominate the smaller engine classes of motorcycle racing in the mid-1960s. Bultó began to supply the Sheene family with his latest motorcycles.

As a young boy, Sheene first interest in competitive motorcycling was in off-road motorcycle trials however, he soon found that he enjoyed speeding between trials sections rather than the trial itself, and decided that he would be better at road circuits. Sheene had no plans to become a motorcycle racer, instead he focused on learning the art of tuning two-stroke engines, which were difficult to master unless a person was prepared to dedicate considerable time in a workshop learning the intricacies of the engines. However his father noticed that he was a naturally talented rider and he was entered into his first road race in 1968 at the age of 17 riding a Bultaco motorcycle.

In his first race at the Brands Hatch Circuit, he suffered a crash when the engine on his 125cc Bultaco seized (The cc initials refer to the engine displacement in cubic centimeters). Undaunted by the experience, he mounted his 250cc Bultaco a few minutes later and finished in third place in the 250 class. Returning to Brands Hatch the following weekend, he would score his first victory. Sheene then stopped racing to become the race mechanic for British privateer Lewis Young, who had entered his Bultacos in several European Grands Prix races. His experiences from attending the European races seemed to ignite Sheene&#x27;s interest in becoming a motorcycle racer.

Sheene was not a keen school student and had an aversion to authority figures, so he began to see motorcycle racing as a possible career path. He sometimes would skip school and attend practice sessions at nearby Brands Hatch circuit. In 1969, Sheene began wearing a crash helmet with an image of Donald Duck on the front of his helmet to stand out from the crowd. The helmet design would remain his trademark throughout his racing career, as well as his racing number 7. He drilled a hole in the chin piece of his crash helmet so he could smoke a cigarette while waiting on the starting grid for a race to begin. A cigarette smoker since the age of nine, he favoured Gitanes cigarettes with a heavy tar content, which would later contribute to his death from cancer in 2003.

Sheene made a big impression as an eighteen-year-old in 1969 when he rode a Bultaco to place second behind Chas Mortimer in the 1969 125cc British Championship, and then dominated the 1970 125cc British Championship. He also placed third in the 1970 250cc Championship aboard a Bultaco. His father Frank served as his mechanic, a position he would hold throughout Sheene&#x27;s racing career.

In 1970, Sheene and his father borrowed £2,000 (£36,720 in 2023), to purchase a twin-cylinder 125cc Suzuki RT67, a former factory racing team motorcycle campaigned by Stuart Graham in the 1968 World Championships and in selected 1969 events. Although it was an expensive purchase, the ex-factory race bike helped to launch Sheene&#x27;s international racing career.

Sheene first met two-time American champion, Gary Nixon, in 1971 when Nixon was a member of the American team competing in that year&#x27;s Transatlantic Trophy match races. The Transatlantic Trophy match races pitted the best British riders against the top American road racers on 750cc motorcycles in a six-race series during Easter weekend in England. The two racers bonded and developed a lifelong friendship. Sheene began wearing his Gary Nixon t-shirt beneath his leather riding suit as a good luck charm every time he raced.

===Grand Prix racing===
In Sheene entered the 125cc World Championship aboard the same Suzuki. He provoked a controversy at the 1971 Isle of Man TT races when he crashed out of the event while lying in second place, and then outraged traditionalists when he criticised the event as unworthy of Grand Prix status. He loudly announced that it would be the last time he ever competed at the Isle of Man TT at a time when the race was considered the most prestigious event on the world championship calendar. As a young boy, Sheene had attended the TT races with his father and appreciated the history of the event however, he felt that racing against the clock on a street circuit for world championship points was too dangerous.

Sheene scored his maiden Grand Prix victory with a win at the 125cc Belgian Grand Prix held at the challenging Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. The championship battle in the 50cc World Championship between Derbi&#x27;s Ángel Nieto and Kreidler&#x27;s Jan de Vries was so heated, that the Kreidler team hired Sheene and Jarno Saarinen to race in support of de Vries, while the Derbi factory hired rider Gilberto Parlotti in support of Nieto. After de Vries retired with engine problems, Sheene went on to win the 50cc Czechoslovakian Grand Prix held at the Masaryk Circuit, where he finished over two and a half minutes ahead of the competition. By denying points to the opposition, Sheene helped de Vries secure the 1971 50cc World Championship.

The 125cc championship then moved to the Scandinavian countries where Sheene won the Swedish and Finnish Grands Prix races to take the lead in the 125cc World Championship going into the final round at the Spanish Grand Prix held at the Jarama Circuit. At the prestigious, non-championship Mallory Park Race of the Year, Sheene won the Lightweight Support Class ahead of Saarinen and Rod Gould, however he suffered a broken rib while competing in the Race of the Year. The following weekend, while riding with the broken rib, he finished in third while his principle rival, Ángel Nieto won the race to clinch the 125cc World Championship. Nieto&#x27;s victory relegated Sheene to second place in the World Championship, a respectable result considering it was his rookie season. Sheene had immense respect for Nieto, calling him one of his greatest rivals.

For the season, Sheene was signed by Yamaha factory to ride a specially made Yamaha YZ635 in the 250cc World Championship under the French Yamaha importer Sonauto&#x27;s sponsorship. There was no Yamaha factory racing team at the time, but Sheene was one of six riders receiving support from the factory. However, at the third round in Austria, after losing a sprint to the finish line to the Australian John Dodds for third place, he voiced his displeasure to team management about the performance of the motorcycle. The next Grand Prix was the Grand Prix of Nations at Imola at the end of May, but Sheene crashed in practice and broke his collarbone, preventing him from taking part in the race, and in the subsequent Isle of Man TT race as well. The next seven races of the world championship all took place in close succession in June and July and Sheene was not fit to take part in them.

After the Yugoslavian Grand Prix, Sheene&#x27;s factory-supported Yamaha YZ635 was given to Jarno Saarinen, already a Yamaha factory rider in the 350cc class, who went on to win four races and the 250cc World Championship that year. Once back to fitness, Sheene would get factory-supported Yamahas back for British races over the summer (Silverstone, Scarborough, Mallory Park) and for the last Grand Prix of the season, at the Montjuïc circuit in Spain on 23 September, where he scored a third place in the 250cc class.

=== 1973 Suzuki team leader===
Sheene was signed by the Suzuki factory racing team along with teammates Jack Findlay and Paul Smart during the off season 1972–1973. He began the 1973 season as a member of the British team riding a Suzuki TR750 in the 1973 Transatlantic Trophy match races where his best result came at the third round at Oulton Park, placing third behind Peter Williams on a John Player Norton and Yvon Duhamel on a Kawasaki H2R.

Sheene then contested the British 500cc Championships riding a Suzuki TR500, but when he found that the motorcycle handled poorly, he replaced Suzuki&#x27;s chassis with a frame designed by British constructor Colin Seeley. He also rode the TR750 to contest the British 750cc Championship and won the newly formed Formula 750 European championship in 1973. He was the first as well as the only non-Yamaha rider to win a Formula 750 championship. As a Suzuki factory rider Sheene had two contracts, with the World Championship events taking precedence over his Suzuki GB contract for home and international events, if any race dates clashed. At the end of the year, Sheene was voted &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by the readers of &quot;Motor Cycle News&quot;.

Prior to the beginning of the 1974 season, the dominant MV Agusta factory racing team offered Sheene a position on their team, however Sheene refused their offer, knowing that Suzuki was developing a new motorcycle to compete in the 500cc class. At the time, the 500cc class was considered to be the premier division in Motorcycle Grand Prix racing. It was not an easy decision for Sheene as the powerful MV Agusta team had won the previous 16 500cc World Championships.

Sheene was again named to the British team for the 1974 Transatlantic Trophy match races where he first encountered American racer, Kenny Roberts, who would become his arch-rival. Roberts twice relegated Sheene to second place in two heat races at Mallory Park before Sheene was able to win over Roberts in the first race at Oulton Park. Roberts then reversed the results in the final event of the series. Sheene&#x27;s TR750 motorcycle was no match for Robert&#x27;s water-cooled Yamaha TZ750 which, would dominate the 750cc class throughout the 1970s.

===1974: Development of the RG500===

Suzuki introduced the new RG500 motorcycle for the season and Sheene secured its first podium results when he rode the raw, unrefined machine to a second place in France and a third place in Austria to start the season. However, Sheene suffered a broken leg in a crash at the Nations Grand Prix held at the Imola Circuit forcing him to miss the next six rounds of the World Championship. Upon recovering from his injury, he placed fourth at the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix, and finished the season ranked sixth in the 1974 500cc World Championship. Also in 1974, he won the prestigious Mallory Park Race of the Year.

At the end of the 1974 season, the Suzuki factory was left disappointed by their efforts on the RG500 project and seemed to be losing their motivation to continue. However, Sheene had become vested in the project and took pride in seeing his suggested modifications being implemented and improving the motorcycle&#x27;s performance. He urged the factory to continue their efforts, offering to stay in Japan to help them develop the motorcycle until it performed to his satisfaction. Suzuki agreed and he spent five weeks in Japan during the offseason, helping engineers on the development work for the RG500.

===Daytona crash===
By the mid-1970s the Daytona 200 motorcycle race had become one of the most important motorcycle races for manufacturers, as they fought for shares of the burgeoning American motorcycle market fueled by the baby boomer generation. The 1974 victory by 15-time world champion Giacomo Agostini helped cement the Daytona 200&#x27;s reputation as one of the most prestigious motorcycle races in the world.

Sheene arrived for the 1975 Daytona 200 with a BBC documentary team following him to record his experiences. The BBC crew was filming Sheene during practice for the race when the tyre on Sheene&#x27;s motorcycle delaminated at approximately 180 mph. The motorcycle pitched sideways, sending Sheene tumbling down the track. He suffered severe injuries including; a broken left femur, right arm, collarbone and two ribs. The BBC coverage of his accident and subsequent recovery made Sheene a household name in Britain.

===The Jet-Set lifestyle===
As Sheene&#x27;s racing career flourished, so did his fame and fortune. He enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, driving a Rolls-Royce and buying a helicopter which he learned to fly. He was often seen in the company of fashion models and musicians and was personal friends with James Hunt, Ringo Starr and George Harrison.

In 1975 while on crutches from his Daytona accident, Sheene met fashion-model-turned-glamour-model Stephanie McLean, who was &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Month for April 1970 and Pet of the Year in 1971, while they were working together on a photoshoot for Chrysler. He made tabloid news in Britain when McLean left her first husband for Sheene. They would marry in 1984 and had two children, Sidonie and Freddie.

He became the motorcycling racing&#x27;s first multi-millionaire, purchasing homes in Putney, in south-west London, and in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and in 1977 he purchased a 700-year-old manor house in Charlwood, Surrey once owned by the actress Gladys Cooper. A shrewd businessman with a penchant for self-promotion, he attracted sponsors from outside the motorcycle industry from clothing, electronics and tobacco companies. He was also contracted by Faberge to promote their Brut aftershave lotion alongside boxer Henry Cooper.

===1975: Return to form===
Despite his serious injuries, Sheene recovered and was racing again seven weeks afterwards. On June 28, only three months after his horrific crash at Daytona, he returned to the world championship at the Assen TT Circuit for the 1975 Dutch TT. Sheene surprised observers who may have expected a gradual return to health by claiming the pole position over second-placed, Giacomo Agostini, now riding for the Yamaha factory racing team. Agostini was nearing the end of his career while the twenty-five-year-old Sheene was approaching his prime. Sheene then claimed a dramatic victory in the race with a well-planned, last corner pass around the outside of Agostini. Both competitors received the same race time.

At the 1975 Swedish Grand Prix, Sheene set the lap record while winning the Formula 750 round on Saturday, then set the 500cc lap record while winning the 500cc Grand Prix race on Sunday. He started the 500cc race slowly, but worked his way through the field to catch and pass both Agostini and Phil Read, who were the championship points leaders. Sheene took the victory ahead of Read while Agostini crashed out of the race. He placed sixth in the 500cc World Championship, but his late season victory showed that Suzuki was becoming a serious challenger. Sheene won three rounds of the 1975 Formula 750 championship, but finished one point behind the eventual champion, Jack Findlay aboard a Yamaha TZ750, who was able to score consistently in six rounds. Sheene once again won the Mallory Park Race of the Year.

Sheene returned to Daytona in 1976, where he flamboyantly drove around the town in a Rolls-Royce on loan to him from the local dealer. However, by 1976 the 750cc class was becoming dominated by the powerful Yamaha TZ750. Agostini&#x27;s 1974 Daytona 200 victory on a Yamaha TZ750 marked the first of ten consecutive Daytona victories for the TZ750. Sheene circulated as high as third place on his under-powered Suzuki until he was forced to retire with engine problems.

Back in Europe, Sheene was the top British points scorer and the only British rider to score a win with a victory at Mallory Park, as Great Britain defeated the United States in the 1976 Transatlantic Trophy match races. However, Yamaha&#x27;s Steve Baker was the dominant rider with four victories in the six race series.

===1976 World Champion===
In the 500cc World Championships, Sheene worked hard to develop the RG500 race bike with his Suzuki team engineers, and by the season, his Suzuki was at the cutting edge of motorcycle racing technology. However, Yamaha had withdrawn their factory team from the World Championships and the Suzuki factory wanted to do the same in order to concentrate their funding on development of the company&#x27;s first range of four-stroke production motorcycles known as the Suzuki GS series. The factory also began to produce customer versions of the RG500 and made them available to the public in 1976.

Suzuki&#x27;s British importer intervened and convinced the Suzuki factory to allow the importer to continue as Suzuki&#x27;s representative in the World Championships. Riders John Newbold and John Williams joined Sheene on the British Suzuki team that became known as the Heron-Suzuki team after their principle sponsor, Heron International. Without Japanese mechanics to support him, Sheene put together a team consisting of his father Frank and Don Mackay, an electrician by trade. The customer version of the RG500 was immediately competitive and became the motorcycle of choice for privateer racers including; Phil Read, Teuvo Länsivuori and newcomers Marco Lucchinelli and Pat Hennen.
With Sheene fully recovered from his Daytona injuries, he took control of the championship from the start of the season by winning the first three races, including a dramatic race-long battle with Read at the Nations Grand Prix where Sheene won by 0.1 seconds. After sitting out the 1976 Isle of Man TT (then in its final season on the World Championship calendar), he won the Dutch TT by 45 seconds over Hennen before his motorcycle experienced mechanical trouble at the Belgian Grand Prix and he placed second to his Suzuki GB teammate John Williams.

The loss of Japanese technical support became apparent at a British championship race at the Snetterton Circuit when someone had forgotten to insert his motorcycle&#x27;s brake pins, causing Sheene to crash when the brakes failed. The damage required a complete rebuild of the motorcycle, and when they arrived at the next World Championship round in Sweden, they discovered that the wrong triple clamps were installed on his number one motorcycle, while the wrong gearbox had been installed in his number two motorcycle. Sheene then discovered that one brake pad had been inserted backwards, a potentially fatal error. Although suspicion fell on his elderly father, who was his lead mechanic, Sheene never publicly blamed anyone for mistakes. The team recovered from their self-inflicted errors with Sheene qualifying second-fastest in Sweden behind pole-sitter Länsivuori.

Sheene experienced more drama during qualifying for the Swedish Grand Prix when his teammate, John Williams was knocked unconscious after a hard crash. Sheene stopped his motorcycle on the racetrack and rushed to Williams&#x27; aide, removing his teammate&#x27;s helmet and clearing his airway after he had swallowed his tongue, thus preventing further injury.

Sheene then clinched the World Championship by winning the Swedish Grand Prix with three races left in the championship. He claimed the title with an impressive 136 points, 81 points more than second-placed Länsivuori. Sheene was the first 500cc champion from the Japanese marque, and remains the only person to win more than one World Championship on a Suzuki motorcycle. Without any major factory teams in the championship, the customer version of the RG500 dominated the standings.

Sheene liked to win races off the track as well as on the track, often using psychological games to distract or upset his rivals. He used his status with the Suzuki factory to ensure that he received the best RG500 engines over his teammates. Sheene&#x27;s elevated status within the team eventually led to the departure of John Williams after the 1976 season, feeling that Sheene was receiving preferential treatment.

===1977: Repeat champion===
Williams was replaced on the Suzuki team by rising talent, 23-year-old Pat Hennen, the first American rider to win a 500cc Grand Prix. Recognizing the threat that Hennen posed to his position at the top of the team&#x27;s hierarchy, Sheene would employ the same psychological tactics on Hennen that he had used on Williams, publicly disparaging his new American teammate by telling journalists, “If you pay peanuts, you get a monkey.” Hennen was joined on the Suzuki team by Steve Parrish, who rode Sheene&#x27;s 1976 Suzuki 500cc machine.

Sheene was once again the top British points scorer at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races, however Suzuki lacked a 750cc motorcycle to compete with the dominant Yamaha TZ750 and Roberts won the first four races of the series before his motorcycle failed during the first race at Oulton Park allowing Sheene to claim the victory. The top American points scorer at the Match races was Sheene&#x27;s Suzuki teammate, Hennen, serving notice that he would be a contender in the coming 500cc World Championship.

Sheene was even more dominant in the facing off against a revived Yamaha factory effort supporting Giacomo Agostini, Johnny Cecotto and Steve Baker. He claimed the World Championship with six Grand Prix victories, finishing well clear of second placed Baker. His victory in the 1977 Belgian Grand Prix marked the fastest Grand Prix in history with an average race speed of 135.067 mph (217.369 kph). The following year, the Spa-Francorchamps road course was replaced by a shorter, safer track, meaning that Sheene&#x27;s record could never be broken.

Sheene&#x27;s campaign for increased rider safety was galvanized at the second round of the 1977 season held at the Salzburgring circuit, when a significant accident during the 350cc race killed Hans Stadelmann and left Johnny Cecotto, Dieter Braun and Patrick Fernandez with serious injuries. The lack of onsite medical facilities exasperated situation and exposed the race organizers&#x27; callousness and indifference regarding the safety of competitors. Sheene and most other 500 class riders refused to race, despite the race organizers offering riders double the usual start money. For his efforts, the FIM race jury issued official warnings to Sheene and other riders.

Although Sheene sought a psychological advantage over his rivals, he could also be generous as he was with Steve Baker who had been released by Yamaha after placing second to Sheene in the 1977 500cc World Championship. Baker was determined to stay and compete in Europe, and with the help of Sheene, he was able to secure a motorcycle and sponsorship from the Suzuki of Italy racing team operated by former Grand Prix competitor, Roberto Gallina.

===1978: The American wave===
A sense of excitement had built up at the beginning of the . The popularity of motorcycle racing had waned after years of stagnation under the domination of the MV Agusta factory racing team led by multi-time world champion, Agostini, however, the Japanese manufacturers were showing a renewed vigor to compete. Sheene&#x27;s popularity had injected some much-needed interest back into the sport along with the arrival of American champion Kenny Roberts. Sheene&#x27;s influence and the arriving American riders boosted attendance at the tracks and spurred the growth in television coverage.

Roberts considered himself primarily a dirt track racer and only participated in American road racing events because they were on the AMA Grand National Championship schedule. He had only transferred to competing in the World Championships because Yamaha lacked a competitive dirt track motorcycle to challenge the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe however, after reading a guest column written by Sheene in the &quot;Motor-Cycle News&quot;, in which he dismissed Roberts as being, &quot;No threat&quot;, citing the Yamaha rider&#x27;s lack of familiarity with most of the European race circuits, the American rider made up his mind to compete. Sheene and Roberts had a fierce rivalry on and off the track, but they also respected each other as competitors.

Roberts brought a new style of riding, forged on the dirt track ovals of America that would revolutionize road racing. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Sheene was the last exponent of the smooth, European riding style which emphasized maintaining as much corner speed as possible without sliding the rear tire. After Roberts, the world championships became dominated by a string of American and Australian riders bred on dirt track racing.
At the pre-season 1978 Transatlantic Trophy match races, Sheene won the first of two races at Brands Hatch, but in the second race, Hennen was able to pass Sheene on the inside of the final corner to win the race. Sheene was angered by what he perceived as a dangerous pass and publicly berated his Suzuki teammate. Hennen was the top points scorer at the 1978 Transatlantic Match races, winning three races as well as two second places and one third place. Later in the week, Sheene continued the psychological warfare on his teammate when he repeated the accusation of dangerous riding in his guest column in &quot;Motor-Cycle News&quot;.

Suzuki produced a new version of the RG500 with a shortened frame for the, and although Sheene began the year on a positive note with a victory at the 1978 Venezuelan Grand Prix, the new version proved to be a setback for the RG500&#x27;s development. Hennen won the Spanish Grand Prix then Roberts won three races in succession. After the first five races, Sheene trailed Roberts by eight points and his Suzuki teammate, Hennen, by five points. During a mid-season break in the Grand Prix schedule, Hennen suffered career-ending injuries while competing in the 1978 Isle of Man TT races.

The Suzuki factory contracted Dutch rider Wil Hartog to replace Hennen on the team, ostensibly to help Sheene fend off the Yamahas of Roberts and Cecotto, however Sheene was unhappy when his new teammate won the 1978 Belgian Grand Prix ahead of Roberts and Sheene in second and third places. Hartog had made the correct tire choice for the deteriorating weather conditions and was able to win by a 16-second margin. Sheene fought back with a string of podium finishes and with a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix, he had cut Roberts&#x27; points lead to three points with three rounds left in the championship.

It was at this crucial point in the championship that Sheene&#x27;s relationship with Suzuki began to sour. At the Finnish Grand Prix, Sheene had an opportunity to overtake Roberts in the points lead when the Yamaha rider failed to finish the race due to a mechanical failure, however Sheene&#x27;s Suzuki also failed allowing his teammate Hartog to win his second race of the year. During a pre-race practice session, Sheene&#x27;s well-trained ear thought he heard a failing crankshaft bearing in his engine. He requested that it be replaced, but his Suzuki mechanics disagreed with his assessment and refused his request. When the crankshaft failed during the race, the outspoken Sheene publicly criticised his team&#x27;s decision.

The 1978 British Grand Prix ended in controversy when torrential rains during the race, along with pit stops for tire changes by both Roberts and Sheene, created confusion among official scorers. Sheene took to the public address system during the confusion to declare that he had won the race however, an FIM Jury eventually declared that Roberts was the winner with Sheene being awarded third place behind privateer Steve Manship, who did not stop for a tire change. At the final round in Germany, Roberts finished third ahead of Sheene in fourth place to claim the 500cc title, dropping Sheene to second place in the world rankings. Sheene blamed the loss of the 1978 World Championship on his team&#x27;s sluggish response to his request in Finland. He won his third Mallory Park Race of the Year in 1978.

===1979: Final year with Heron-Suzuki===
Sheene&#x27;s relationship with Suzuki was further soured before the season when, the Suzuki factory asked its three top riders, Sheene, Virginio Ferrari and Wil Hartog to choose the new factory race bike by comparing two versions. Sheene, used to receiving preferential treatment from Suzuki, was outvoted when Ferrari and Hartog chose the motorcycle that he had rejected and, he was forced to ride their choice rather than his preferred choice.

The 1979 Transatlantic Trophy match races saw Sheene claim the first four races of the series against a depleted American team that was missing Roberts and Hennen due to injuries. Sheene&#x27;s motorcycle suffered engine problems at Oulton Park allowing Gene Romero to win the final two races of the series.

Sheene began the 1979 season with a victory over teammate Ferrari at the Venezuelan Grand Prix, while Roberts was recovering from career-threatening back injuries suffered during a pre-season testing crash in Japan. Roberts returned to win the second round in Austria despite still recovering from his injuries, while Sheene suffered from a mechanic&#x27;s mistake when installing his brake pads, causing him to finish in 12th place. He then failed to finish in three of the next four races as Roberts won three consecutive races in Italy, Spain and Yugoslavia to take the championship points lead. Sheene placed second to Ferrari at the Dutch TT before all the factory teams boycotted the Belgian Grand Prix due to the dangerous track conditions. He then won the Swedish Grand Prix followed by a third place in Finland.

Sheene&#x27;s battle with Kenny Roberts at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited as one of the greatest motorcycle Grand Prix races of the 1970s. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race. Heading into the final lap of the race, the two leaders came upon lapped riders. Roberts was unhindered as he passed the slower riders however, Sheene was momentarily held up, allowing Roberts to increase his lead. An undeterred Sheene put in an impressive lap time to catch Roberts as they entered the final corner. With momentum on his side, Sheene attempted a last second pass, but Roberts was able to prevail over Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. The hard-fought race, which was broadcast live by the BBC, cemented the fierce rivalry between the two competitors in the annals of motorcycle Grand Prix racing history. Years later, when informed of Sheene&#x27;s death from cancer in 2003, Roberts simply stated, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be Kenny Roberts without Barry Sheene&quot;.

Sheene recovered to win the final race of the season at the French Grand Prix, but Roberts placed third to secure his second consecutive 500cc World Championship. Despite winning more races than any other Suzuki rider in 1979, Sheene finished the season in third place, two points behind Ferrari on the Gallina-Suzuki.

===Riders revolt===
During the 1979 season, the riders boycott of the 1979 Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the increasing animosity between motorcycle racers and the FIM concerning rider safety. The Belgian circuit had been paved just days before the race, creating a track that many of the racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to the surface. Roberts began talking to journalists about forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM&#x27;s monopoly. At the end of the 1979 season, Sheene joined Roberts and British motorsports journalist, Barry Coleman, in announcing their intention to break away from the FIM and create a rival race series called the &quot;World Series&quot;, with most of the top Grand Prix racers joining the revolt.

The death of Gilberto Parlotti at the 1972 Isle of Man TT along with the deaths of Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini in 1973 highlighted the need for improved safety standards for motorcycle racers. At the time, many motorcycle Grand Prix races were still being held on street circuits with hazards such as telephone poles and railroad crossings. Dedicated race tracks of the time were also dangerous for motorcycle racers due to the steel Armco trackside barriers preferred by car racers. Tensions over safety issues continued to simmer throughout the 1970s between the Grand Prix racers, race organizers and the FIM, as riders showed their increasing dissatisfaction with the safety standards and the way races were organized by boycotting several Grand Prix races.

Although the competing series was not successful due to difficulties in securing enough venues, it forced the FIM to take the riders&#x27; demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety. During the 1979 FIM Congress, new rules were passed substantially increasing prize money and in subsequent years, stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers.

===Move to Yamaha===

Believing that he was receiving inferior equipment to his Suzuki teammates, Sheene made the decision to switch manufacturers for the season. He campaigned on a privateer Yamaha YZR500, but Yamaha remembered his outspoken criticism of their motorcycle in 1972 and withheld their best machinery for Kenny Roberts who captured his third consecutive 500cc World Championship in 1980.

With the help of the British Yamaha importer, Mitsui-Yamaha, Sheene began receiving more favorable treatment from the Yamaha factory. In , Sheene retained the services of the recently retired Gary Nixon&#x27;s former mechanic, Erv Kanemoto, who helped Sheene score two podium results before winning the final round of the series at the Anderstorp Raceway in Sweden, taking fourth overall in the 1981 500cc World Championship. Gallina-Suzuki&#x27;s Marco Lucchinelli took command of the season with four victories in five races to claim the world championship ahead of Sheene&#x27;s replacement on the Heron-Suzuki team, Randy Mamola. Sheene&#x27;s victory at the 1981 Swedish Grand Prix would be the last Grand Prix victory by a British competitor for 35 years, until Cal Crutchlow ended the streak by winning the 2016 Czech Republic Grand Prix.
Sheene received the latest Yamaha OW60 TZ500 motorcycle before the 1982 season, on par with Roberts machinery and showed he was back on form by claiming five out of six races at the 1982 Transatlantic Trophy match races, although the American team had been depleted by the absence of Roberts and Randy Mamola due to testing commitments. Then American newcomer, Freddie Spencer crashed and damaged his Honda so badly in the first race, that he had to abandon the remainder of the series. Only a low-speed crash on the last lap at the Mallory Park hairpin turn allowed Roger Marshall to pass and deprive Sheene of a $40,000 bonus for being the first competitor to win all six races in one year.

===Silverstone accident===
With Yamaha&#x27;s top machinery for the season, Sheene was immediately competitive, finishing just 0.670 seconds behind Roberts at the Argentine Grand Prix followed by a second place behind Franco Uncini on the Gallina-Suzuki RG500 at the Austrian Grand Prix. After the top riders boycotted the 
French Grand Prix, he produced a string of podium positions and was in contention for the world championship once again, when he suffered the second serious accident of his career during practice for the 1982 British Grand Prix. During unofficial practice on Thursday at the Silverstone Circuit, Sheene came over a blind rise and collided with Patrick Igoa&#x27;s motorcycle at over 160 mph, shattering both legs and breaking an arm.

His injured legs were saved by orthopaedic surgeon Mr Nigel John Cobb FRCS at the nearby Northampton General Hospital. Although he would return to the world championships in racing a privateer Suzuki RG500, he never regained his old form and he retired in . Fittingly for a rider whose name had become synonymous with the Suzuki RG500, after having scored the motorcycle&#x27;s first podium position in 1974, he was also the rider who secured its final podium with a third-place result at the 1984 South African motorcycle Grand Prix. He remains the only rider to win Grand Prix races in the 50 cc and 500 cc categories.

The final major victory of Sheene&#x27;s motorcycle racing career came at the 1984 Scarborough Gold Cup held at the Oliver&#x27;s Mount circuit, one of his favorite venues. He took the victory over his old foe, Mick Grant marking the fourth time he had won the Scarborough Gold Cup race.
==Television career==
Sheene worked as a Television presenter, including the ITV series &quot;Just Amazing!&quot;, where he interviewed people who had, through accident or design, achieved feats of daring and survival (including the former RAF air gunner, Nicholas Alkemade, who survived a fall of 18,000 feet without a parachute from a blazing Avro Lancaster bomber over Germany in March 1944). He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1978 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at a motor racing cycle exhibition in London&#x27;s Victoria. Sheene and his wife, Stephanie McLean, also starred in the low-budget film &quot;Space Riders&quot;.

==Later life and death in Australia==
The Sheene family moved to Australia in the late 1980s, in the hope that the warmer climate would help relieve some of the pain of Sheene&#x27;s injury-induced arthritis, settling in a property near the Gold Coast. He combined a property development business with a role as a commentator on motor sport. He began on SBS TV then moved to the Nine Network with Darrell Eastlake, and finally followed the TV broadcast rights of the Grand Prix motorcycle series to Network Ten. Further to this, on Network Ten Sheene co-hosted the weekly motor sport television show &quot;RPM&quot; from 1997 to 2002 with journalists Bill Woods and Greg Rust and was involved in Ten&#x27;s coverage of other motor sport including V8 Supercars for several years. In the 1990s, Sheene appeared in a series of well-known and popular television advertisements for Shell, with Australian motor sport icon Dick Johnson.

With his personal connections in the motorcycle industry, Sheene helped boost the racing careers of young Australian motorcycle racers such as five-time 500cc World Champion, Mick Doohan, two-time Superbike World Champion, Troy Corser and MotoGP Grand Prix winner, Chris Vermeulen. In later years, Sheene became involved in historic motorcycle racing, often returning to England to race at Donington Park. Sheene competed in his last race in Britain at the Goodwood Revival in 2002. He was also chosen to run with the Queen&#x27;s Baton in the run-up to the 2002 Commonwealth Games held in Manchester, England.

In July 2002, at the age of 51, Sheene was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus and stomach. Refusing conventional treatments involving chemotherapy, Sheene instead opted for a holistic approach involving a strict diet devised by Austrian healer Rudolf Breuss, intended to starve the cancer of nourishment.

He died at a hospital on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast in March 2003, aged 52, having suffered from the condition for eight months.

==Honours and awards==
In 1978, Sheene was appointed MBE for services to motorcycle sport. He was a two-time Segrave Trophy recipient in 1977 and 1984 for his career in motorcycle Grand Prix racing. Following reconstruction of the Brands Hatch Circuit in England for safety concerns after requests by the FIM, the Dingle Dell section was changed for safety, and shortly after Sheene&#x27;s death the new section was renamed Sheene&#x27;s Corner in his honour. The FIM named him a Grand Prix &quot;Legend&quot; in 2001. For the 2003 season, V8 Supercars introduced a medal in honour of Sheene, the Barry Sheene Medal, for the &#x27;best and fairest&#x27; driver of the season. A memorial ride from Bairnsdale to Phillip Island, Victoria is held by Australian motorcyclists annually, before the MotoGP held at the island.

==In popular culture==

A song titled &quot;Mr. Sheene&quot; that describes &quot;Mr. Sheene&#x27;s riding machine&quot; was recorded by comedians Eric Idle and Rikki Fataar and released in 1978 as the B-side of the single &quot;Ging Gang Goolie&quot; under the names Dirk and Stig, their characters in Beatles-parody band The Rutles.

In the UK television series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, the main characters Stuart and Vince reminisce about their teenage attraction to a photo of Sheene &quot;On his motorbike! In his leathers...&quot;

In a Sleaford Mods song &quot;Dirty Den&quot; the character is mentioned &quot;falling off the wagon like Barry Sheen&quot;.

<text>BIX is a rock band from Lithuania. The band was formed in 1987 in Šiauliai and in a few months became a cult band. After a period of intensive touring throughout Europe and the US they were the most experienced Baltic band, and probably the best known in the West. Recording never was a strong side of BIX since they were a &#x27;live&#x27; band.

Their style of music may be described as post-punk with the elements of ska, Latin American music and funk.

<doc id="194465" wikidata="Q1184955" url="?curid=194465" title="Delta-v">
<text>Delta-&quot;v&quot; (also known as &quot;change in velocity&quot;), symbolized as formula_1 and pronounced , as used in spacecraft flight dynamics, is a measure of the impulse per unit of spacecraft mass that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launching from or landing on a planet or moon, or an in-space orbital maneuver. It is a scalar that has the units of speed. As used in this context, it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of said spacecraft.

A simple example might be the case of a conventional rocket-propelled spacecraft, which achieves thrust by burning fuel. Such a spacecraft&#x27;s delta-&quot;v&quot;, then, would be the change in velocity that spacecraft can achieve by burning its entire fuel load.

Delta-&quot;v&quot; is produced by reaction engines, such as rocket engines, and is proportional to the thrust per unit mass and the burn time. It is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given maneuver through the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.

For multiple maneuvers, delta-&quot;v&quot; sums linearly.

For interplanetary missions, delta-&quot;v&quot; is often plotted on a porkchop plot, which displays the required mission delta-&quot;v&quot; as a function of launch date.

==Definition==
formula_2
where
* is the instantaneous thrust at time .
* is the instantaneous mass at time .

Change in velocity is useful in many cases, such as determining the change in momentum (impulse), where: formula_3, where formula_4 is momentum and m is mass.

==Specific cases==
In the absence of external forces:
formula_5
where formula_6 is the coordinate acceleration.

When thrust is applied in a constant direction ( is constant) this simplifies to:
formula_7
which is simply the magnitude of the change in velocity. However, this relation does not hold in the general case: if, for instance, a constant, unidirectional acceleration is reversed after then the velocity difference is 0, but delta-&quot;v&quot; is the same as for the non-reversed thrust.

For rockets, &quot;absence of external forces&quot; is taken to mean the absence of gravity drag and atmospheric drag, as well as the absence of aerostatic back pressure on the nozzle, and hence the vacuum I is used for calculating the vehicle&#x27;s delta-&quot;v&quot; capacity via the rocket equation. In addition, the costs for atmospheric losses and gravity drag are added into the delta-&quot;v&quot; budget when dealing with launches from a planetary surface.

==Orbital maneuvers==

Orbit maneuvers are made by firing a thruster to produce a reaction force acting on the spacecraft. The size of this force will be

where
* is the velocity of the exhaust gas in rocket frame
* is the propellant flow rate to the combustion chamber

The acceleration formula_6 of the spacecraft caused by this force will be

where is the mass of the spacecraft

During the burn the mass of the spacecraft will decrease due to use of fuel, the time derivative of the mass being
If now the direction of the force, i.e. the direction of the nozzle, is fixed during the burn one gets the velocity increase from the thruster force of a burn starting at time formula_9 and ending at as
\, dt&lt;/math&gt;|}}}}

Changing the integration variable from time to the spacecraft mass one gets

Assuming formula_10 to be a constant not depending on the amount of fuel left this relation is integrated to
which is the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.

If for example 20% of the launch mass is fuel giving a constant formula_11 of 2100 m/s (a typical value for a hydrazine thruster) the capacity of the reaction control system is
formula_12

If formula_11 is a non-constant function of the amount of fuel left
formula_14
the capacity of the reaction control system is computed by the integral ().

The acceleration () caused by the thruster force is just an additional acceleration to be added to the other accelerations (force per unit mass) affecting the spacecraft and the orbit can easily be propagated with a numerical algorithm including also this thruster force. But for many purposes, typically for studies or for maneuver optimization, they are approximated by impulsive maneuvers as illustrated in figure 1 with a formula_15 as given by (). Like this one can for example use a &quot;patched conics&quot; approach modeling the maneuver as a shift from one Kepler orbit to another by an instantaneous change of the velocity vector.
This approximation with impulsive maneuvers is in most cases very accurate, at least when chemical propulsion is used. For low thrust systems, typically electrical propulsion systems, this approximation is less accurate. But even for geostationary spacecraft using electrical propulsion for out-of-plane control with thruster burn periods extending over several hours around the nodes this approximation is fair.

==Production==
Delta-&quot;v&quot; is typically provided by the thrust of a rocket engine, but can be created by other engines. The time-rate of change of delta-&quot;v&quot; is the magnitude of the acceleration &quot;caused by the engines&quot;, i.e., the thrust per total vehicle mass. The actual acceleration vector would be found by adding thrust per mass on to the gravity vector and the vectors representing any other forces acting on the object.

The total delta-&quot;v&quot; needed is a good starting point for early design decisions since consideration of the added complexities are deferred to later times in the design process.

The rocket equation shows that the required amount of propellant increases exponentially with increasing delta-&quot;v&quot;. Therefore, in modern spacecraft propulsion systems considerable study is put into reducing the total delta-&quot;v&quot; needed for a given spaceflight, as well as designing spacecraft that are capable of producing larger delta-&quot;v&quot;.

Increasing the delta-&quot;v&quot; provided by a propulsion system can be achieved by:
*staging
*increasing specific impulse
*improving propellant mass fraction

==Multiple maneuvers==
Because the mass ratios apply to any given burn, when multiple maneuvers are performed in sequence, the mass ratios multiply.

Thus it can be shown that, provided the exhaust velocity is fixed, this means that delta-&quot;v&quot; can be summed:

When are the mass ratios of the maneuvers, and are the delta-&quot;v&quot; of the first and second maneuvers
formula_16
where and . This is just the rocket equation applied to the sum of the two maneuvers.

This is convenient since it means that delta-&quot;v&quot; can be calculated and simply added and the mass ratio calculated only for the overall vehicle for the entire mission. Thus delta-&quot;v&quot; is commonly quoted rather than mass ratios which would require multiplication.

==Delta-&quot;v&quot; budgets==
When designing a trajectory, delta-&quot;v&quot; budget is used as a good indicator of how much propellant will be required. Propellant usage is an exponential function of delta-&quot;v&quot; in accordance with the rocket equation, it will also depend on the exhaust velocity.

It is not possible to determine delta-&quot;v&quot; requirements from conservation of energy by considering only the total energy of the vehicle in the initial and final orbits since energy is carried away in the exhaust (see also below). For example, most spacecraft are launched in an orbit with inclination fairly near to the latitude at the launch site, to take advantage of the Earth&#x27;s rotational surface speed. If it is necessary, for mission-based reasons, to put the spacecraft in an orbit of different inclination, a substantial delta-&quot;v&quot; is required, though the specific kinetic and potential energies in the final orbit and the initial orbit are equal.

When rocket thrust is applied in short bursts the other sources of acceleration may be negligible, and the magnitude of the velocity change of one burst may be simply approximated by the delta-&quot;v&quot;. The total delta-&quot;v&quot; to be applied can then simply be found by addition of each of the delta-&quot;v&quot;&#x27;s needed at the discrete burns, even though between bursts the magnitude and direction of the velocity changes due to gravity, e.g. in an elliptic orbit.

For examples of calculating delta-&quot;v&quot;, see Hohmann transfer orbit, gravitational slingshot, and Interplanetary Transport Network. It is also notable that large thrust can reduce gravity drag.

Delta-&quot;v&quot; is also required to keep satellites in orbit and is expended in propulsive orbital stationkeeping maneuvers. Since the propellant load on most satellites cannot be replenished, the amount of propellant initially loaded on a satellite may well determine its useful lifetime.

===Oberth effect===
From power considerations, it turns out that when applying delta-&quot;v&quot; in the direction of the velocity the specific orbital energy gained per unit delta-&quot;v&quot; is equal to the instantaneous speed. This is called the Oberth effect.

For example, a satellite in an elliptical orbit is boosted more efficiently at high speed (that is, small altitude) than at low speed (that is, high altitude).

Another example is that when a vehicle is making a pass of a planet, burning the propellant at closest approach rather than further out gives significantly higher final speed, and this is even more so when the planet is a large one with a deep gravity field, such as Jupiter.

===Porkchop plot===

Due to the relative positions of planets changing over time, different delta-vs are required at different launch dates. A diagram that shows the required delta-&quot;v&quot; plotted against time is sometimes called a &quot;porkchop plot&quot;. Such a diagram is useful since it enables calculation of a launch window, since launch should only occur when the mission is within the capabilities of the vehicle to be employed.

===Around the Solar System===

Delta-&quot;v&quot; needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets; red arrows show where optional aerobraking can be performed in that particular direction, black numbers give delta-&quot;v&quot; in km/s that apply in either direction. Lower-delta-&quot;v&quot; transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: . 
;C3: Escape orbit
;GEO: Geosynchronous orbit
;GTO: Geostationary transfer orbit
;L4/5: Earth–Moon Lagrangian point
;LEO: Low Earth orbit
===LEO reentry===
For example the Soyuz spacecraft makes a de-orbit from the ISS in two steps. First, it needs a delta-&quot;v&quot; of 2.18 m/s for a safe separation from the space station. Then it needs another 128 m/s for reentry.

<text>A parity bit, or check bit, is a bit added to a string of binary code. Parity bits are a simple form of error detecting code. Parity bits are generally applied to the smallest units of a communication protocol, typically 8-bit octets (bytes), although they can also be applied separately to an entire message string of bits.

The parity bit ensures that the total number of 1-bits in the string is even or odd. Accordingly, there are two variants of parity bits: even parity bit and odd parity bit. In the case of even parity, for a given set of bits, the bits whose value is 1 are counted. If that count is odd, the parity bit value is set to 1, making the total count of occurrences of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an even number. If the count of 1s in a given set of bits is already even, the parity bit&#x27;s value is 0. In the case of odd parity, the coding is reversed. For a given set of bits, if the count of bits with a value of 1 is even, the parity bit value is set to 1 making the total count of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an odd number. If the count of bits with a value of 1 is odd, the count is already odd so the parity bit&#x27;s value is 0. Even parity is a special case of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), where the 1-bit CRC is generated by the polynomial &quot;x&quot;+1.

==Parity==
In mathematics &quot;parity&quot; can refer to the evenness or oddness of an integer, which, when written in its binary form, can be determined just by examining only its least significant bit. 

In information technology parity refers to the evenness or oddness, given any set of binary digits, of the number of those bits with value one. Because parity is determined by the state of every one of the bits, this property of parity—being dependent upon all the bits and changing its value from even to odd parity if any one bit changes—allows for its use in error detection and correction schemes.

In telecommunications the parity referred to by some protocols is for error-&quot;detection&quot;. The transmission medium is preset, at both end points, to agree on either odd parity or even parity. For each string of bits ready to transmit (data packet) the sender calculates its parity bit, zero or one, to make it conform to the agreed parity, even or odd. The receiver of that packet first checks that the parity of the packet as a whole is in accordance with the preset agreement, then, if there was a parity error in that packet, requests a retransmission of that packet.

In computer science the parity stripe or parity disk in a RAID provides error-&quot;correction&quot;. Parity bits are written at the rate of one parity bit per &quot;n&quot; bits, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of disks in the array. When a read error occurs, each bit in the error region is recalculated from its set of &quot;n&quot; bits. In this way, using one parity bit creates &quot;redundancy&quot; for a region from the size of one bit to the size of one disk. See below.

In electronics, transcoding data with parity can be very efficient, as XOR gates output what is equivalent to a check bit that creates an even parity, and XOR logic design easily scales to any number of inputs. XOR and AND structures comprise the bulk of most integrated circuitry.

==Error detection==
If an odd number of bits (including the parity bit) are transmitted incorrectly, the parity bit will be incorrect, thus indicating that a parity error occurred in the transmission. The parity bit is suitable only for detecting errors; it cannot correct any errors, as there is no way to determine the particular bit that is corrupted. The data must be discarded entirely, and retransmitted from scratch. On a noisy transmission medium, successful transmission can therefore take a long time or even never occur. However, parity has the advantage that it uses only a single bit and requires only a number of XOR gates to generate. See Hamming code for an example of an error-correcting code.

Parity bit checking is used occasionally for transmitting ASCII characters, which have 7 bits, leaving the 8th bit as a parity bit.

For example, the parity bit can be computed as follows. Assume Alice and Bob are communicating and Alice wants to send Bob the simple 4-bit message 1001.
This mechanism enables the detection of single bit errors, because if one bit gets flipped due to line noise, there will be an incorrect number of ones in the received data. In the two examples above, Bob&#x27;s calculated parity value matches the parity bit in its received value, indicating there are no single bit errors. Consider the following example with a transmission error in the second bit using XOR:

There is a limitation to parity schemes. A parity bit is guaranteed to detect only an odd number of bit errors. If an even number of bits have errors, the parity bit records the correct number of ones even though the data is corrupt. (See also error detection and correction.) Consider the same example as before but with an even number of corrupted bits:
Bob observes even parity, as expected, thereby failing to catch the two bit errors.

==Usage==
Because of its simplicity, parity is used in many hardware applications in which an operation can be repeated in case of difficulty, or simply detecting the error is helpful. For example, the SCSI and PCI buses use parity to detect transmission errors, and many microprocessor instruction caches include parity protection. Because the Instruction cache data is just a copy of the main memory, it can be disregarded and refetched if it is found to be corrupted.

In serial data transmission, a common format is 7 data bits, an even parity bit, and one or two stop bits. That format accommodates all the 7-bit ASCII characters in an 8-bit byte. Other formats are possible; 8 bits of data plus a parity bit can convey all 8-bit byte values.

In serial communication contexts, parity is usually generated and checked by interface hardware (such as a UART) and, on reception, the result made available to a processor such as the CPU (and so too, for instance, the operating system) via a status bit in a hardware register in the interface hardware. Recovery from the error is usually done by retransmitting the data, the details of which are usually handled by software (such as the operating system I/O routines).

When the total number of transmitted bits, including the parity bit, is even, odd parity has the advantage that both all-zeros and all-ones patterns are detected as errors. If the total number of bits is odd, only one of the patterns is detected as an error, and the choice can be made based on what the more common error is expected to be.

=== RAID array ===
Parity data is used by RAID arrays (redundant array of independent/inexpensive disks) to achieve redundancy. If a drive in the array fails, remaining data on the other drives can be combined with the parity data (using the Boolean XOR function) to reconstruct the missing data.

For example, suppose two drives in a three-drive RAID 4 array contained the following data:

To calculate parity data for the two drives, an XOR is performed on their data:

The resulting parity data, 10111001, is then stored on Drive 3.

Should any of the three drives fail, the contents of the failed drive can be reconstructed on a replacement drive by subjecting the data from the remaining drives to the same XOR operation. If Drive 2 were to fail, its data could be rebuilt using the XOR results of the contents of the two remaining drives, Drive 1 and Drive 3:

as follows:

The result of that XOR calculation yields Drive 2&#x27;s contents. 11010100 is then stored on Drive 2, fully repairing the array. 

XOR logic is also equivalent to even parity (because &quot;a&quot; XOR &quot;b&quot; XOR &quot;c&quot; XOR ... may be treated as XOR(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;...), which is an n-ary operator that is true if and only if an odd number of arguments is true). So the same XOR concept above applies similarly to larger RAID arrays with parity, using any number of disks. In the case of a RAID 3 array of 12 drives, 11 drives participate in the XOR calculation shown above and yield a value that is then stored on the dedicated parity drive.

Extensions and variations on the parity bit mechanism &quot;double,&quot; &quot;dual,&quot; or &quot;diagonal&quot; parity, are used in RAID-DP.

== History ==
A &quot;parity track&quot; was present on the first magnetic-tape data storage in 1951. Parity in this form, applied across multiple parallel signals, is known as a transverse redundancy check. This can be combined with parity computed over multiple bits sent on a single signal, a longitudinal redundancy check. In a parallel bus, there is one longitudinal redundancy check bit per parallel signal.

Parity was also used on at least some paper-tape (punched tape) data entry systems (which preceded magnetic-tape systems). On the systems sold by British company ICL (formerly ICT) the paper tape had 8 hole positions running across it, with the 8th being for parity. 7 positions were used for the data, e.g., 7-bit ASCII. The 8th position had a hole punched in it depending on the number of data holes punched.

<text>Tauno Valdemar Palo (born Tauno Brännäs; 25 October 1908 – 24 May 1982) was a Finnish actor and singer in what some consider the golden age of Finnish cinema.

In &quot;Guide to the Cinema of Sweden and Finland&quot; Peter von Bagh names Palo as the most renowned, the best-loved, and quite indisputably the greatest and the best actor of Finnish cinema. His skill to combine lightweight and youthful charm with heavyweight acting was seen most clearly in the theatre. 

His most famous roles were perhaps in &quot;Kulkurin valssi&quot; (&quot;The Vagabond&#x27;s Waltz&quot;), and &quot;Vaimoke&quot; (&quot;Surrogate Wife&quot;). He appeared with actress/singer Birgit Kronström in the 1941 romantic comedy &quot;Onnellinen ministeri&quot; (&quot;The Lucky Cabinet Minister&quot;), which included the famous song &quot;Katupoikien laulu&quot;, remade by other Finnish pop singers including Katri Helena.

== Life and career ==
Palo was born in Hämeenlinna as Tauno Brännäs, but changed his name to Tauno Palo in 1935. He was of partial Russian descent through his mother Olga Andersson () whose father was a Russian soldier and mother a Finnish maid. Palo recruited in the military and was educated as a chemist. His friend invited him to join the theatre of Working Men&#x27;s Club in Sörnäinen. Theatre director and famous actor Aarne Orjatsalo became his mentor. The dark-haired lad from Sörnäinen who had a good voice got attention, and in 1931 he was invited to audition for film studios. His final breakthrough came when era of silent films was over, and people could hear his voice.

Palo left his work as chemist in 1932. He was hired by the Finnish National Theatre, but until 1938 he got only small roles, because his popularity as a film star harmed his credibility on the stage. 

Ansa Ikonen played as his leading lady in 12 films and in numerous plays and on tours. In eyes of the public, they became the most romantic couple ever. In real life they did not have a romantic relationship.

Palo had in total over 300 roles on stage and played in 65 feature films.

Before the Second World War Palo recorded a number of songs from the musical films he acted in. He continued his recording career after 1967. He died in Helsinki.

<doc id="194470" wikidata="Q26620" url="?curid=194470" title="Common redstart">
<text>The common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), or often simply redstart, is a small passerine bird in the genus &quot;Phoenicurus&quot;. Like its relatives, it was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family, (Turdidae), but is now known to be an Old World flycatcher (family Muscicapidae).

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The first formal description of the common redstart was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla phoenicurus&quot;. The genus &quot;Phoenicurus&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist Thomas Forster in 1817. The genus and species name &quot;phoenicurus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phoinix&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;-ouros&quot; -&quot;tailed&quot;.

Two subspecies are accepted. The nominate &quot;P. p. phoenicurus&quot; is found all over Europe and reaches into Siberia. To the southeast, subspecies &quot;P. p. samamisicus&quot;, sometimes called ‘Ehrenberg’s Redstart’, is found from the Crimean Peninsula and Greece through Turkey, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and into Central Asia. Adult males have white outer webs in the remiges, forming a pale to whitish wing-patch similar to the one seen in Black Redstart and Daurian Redstart. This patch is also present but less conspicuous in some immature males, and sometimes in adult females. Some males exhibit a blackish mantle, too. Both subspecies intergrade widely in the southern Balkans and coastal Ukraine.

The closest genetic relative of the common redstart may be the Moussier&#x27;s redstart, though incomplete sampling of the genus gives some uncertainty to this. Its ancestors were apparently the first redstarts to spread to Europe; they seem to have diverged from the black redstart group about 3 mya, during the Piacenzian. Genetically, common and black redstarts are still fairly compatible and can produce hybrids that appear to be healthy and fertile, but they are separated by different behaviour and ecological requirements so hybrids are rather rare in nature.

==Description==
The Common Redstart shows some affinity to the European Robin in many of its habits and actions. It has the same general carriage, and chat-like behaviour, and is the same length at 13–14.5 cm long but slightly slimmer and not quite as heavy, weighing 11–23 g. The orange-red tail, from which it and other redstarts get their names (&quot;start&quot; is an old word for &quot;tail&quot;), is frequently quivered. Among common European birds, only the Black Redstart (&quot;Phoenicurus ochrurus&quot;) has a similarly coloured tail.
The male in summer has a slate-grey head and upperparts, except the rump and tail, which, like the flanks, underwing coverts and axillaries are orange-chestnut. The forehead is white; the sides of the face and throat are black. The two central tail feathers are dark brown, the other tail feathers bright orange-red. The wings are grey-brown in male &quot;P. p. phoenicurus&quot; but the remiges have white outer webs forming a pale to whitish wing-patch in adult male &quot;P. p. samamisicus&quot; (see Taxonomy and systematics). The orange on the flanks shades to almost white on the belly. The bill and legs are black. In autumn, pale feather fringes on the body feathering obscure the colours of the male, giving it a washed-out appearance. The female is grey-brown above and buff-white or light orange below. In most females the throat is whitish, but some (older?) females show a dark bib, some even approaching males in appearance. In &quot;P. p. samamisicus&quot;, many females tend to show a light wing-patch, analogous to the males but much less prominent. 

==Distribution and habitat==

Common Redstarts prefer open mature birch, oak or, particularly in the north of the breeding range, conifer woodland with a high horizontal visibility and low amounts of shrub and understorey especially where the trees are old enough to have holes suitable for its nest. Other habitats of the species are orchards as well as villages, parks and old gardens in urban areas. In Britain the Common Redstart occurs primarily in upland areas less affected by agricultural intensification. Nests are built in cavities, e.g. natural tree holes, so dead trees or those with dead limbs are beneficial to the species; nestboxes are commonly used. A high cover of moss and lichen is also preferred.

In England, where it has declined by 55% in the past 25 years , the Forestry Commission offers grants under a scheme called England&#x27;s Woodland Improvement Grant (EWIG); as does Natural Englands Environmental Stewardship Scheme. It is a very rare breeding bird in Ireland, with between one and five pairs breeding in most years, nearly all of them in County Wicklow.

==Behaviour and ecology==

It is a summer visitor throughout most of Europe and western Asia (east to Lake Baikal), and also in northwest Africa in Morocco. It winters in central Africa and Arabia, south of the Sahara Desert but north of the Equator, from Senegal east to Yemen. It is widespread as a breeding bird in Great Britain, particularly in upland broadleaf woodlands and hedgerow trees, but in Ireland it is very local, and may not breed every year.

The males first arrive in early to mid April, often a few days in advance of the females. Five or six light blue eggs are laid during May, with a second brood in midsummer in the south of the breeding range. It departs for Africa between mid-August and early October. It often feeds like a flycatcher, making aerial sallies after passing insects, and most of its food consists of winged insects. The main contact call in Central Europe is a rising, slightly dissylabilic huid. In southern Italy and as well as within the range of the subspecies P. p. samamisicus this call is replaced by a monosyllabic heed. This call can be rising or constant in Italy but is always constant and reminiscent of the slightly higher pitched contact calls of Collared Flycatcher &quot;Ficedula albicollis&quot; in &quot;P. p. samamisicus.&quot; A third call variant exists on the Iberian peninsula, whereas in Siberia huid and heed calls can be combined. All call variants are regularly combined with ticking alarm calls.

The male&#x27;s song consists of soft melancholy strophes lasting 1–2 seconds that can be divides into three parts: an introduction, a repetitive part and a more variable third part. This structure seems to be very constant across the breeding range of the nominate subspecies, but is more variable in &quot;P. p. samamisicus&quot; where the introduction only rarely consists solely of a clear whistle similar to that of nominate &quot;P. p. phoenicurus&quot;.

Common Redstarts are sometimes parasitized by common cuckoos. Surprisingly, redstart chicks did not suffer from sharing the nest with a cuckoo chick. The presence of a cuckoo might even be beneficial for the nestlings. The large size of the cuckoo chick affects the thermoregulation in the nest. In some sense, the cuckoo chick is ‘brooding’ the redstart nestlings. Moreover, food provision might be better for redstart chicks in a mixed brood.

<text>SimAnt: The Electronic Ant Colony is a 1991 life simulation video game by Maxis and the company&#x27;s third product, focusing on the lifecycle of ants. It was designed by Will Wright. In 1992, it was named &quot;Best Simulation Game&quot; at the Software Publishers Association&#x27;s Codie awards. &quot;SimAnt&quot; was re-released in 1993 as part of the &quot;SimClassics Volume 1&quot; compilation alongside &quot;SimCity Classic&quot; and &quot;SimLife&quot; for MS-DOS, Mac and Amiga. In 1996, &quot;SimAnt&quot;, alongside several of Maxis&#x27; simulation games were re-released under the &quot;Maxis Collector Series&quot; with greater compatibility with Windows 95 and differing box art, including the addition of &quot;Classics&quot; beneath the title.

==Gameplay==
The game is a simulation of an ant colony. Wright was inspired by E. O. Wilson&#x27;s study of ant colonies. The game consists of three modes: a Quick Game, a Full Game, and an Experimental Game. It was released for MS-DOS, Amiga, Mac, and Super NES. The Super NES version adds eight scenarios, where the goal in each is to eliminate the enemy red ants in various locales, each with different hazards.

In &quot;SimAnt&quot;, the player plays the role of an ant in a colony of black ants in the back yard of a suburban home. The ant colony must battle against enemy red ants. The ultimate goal is to spread throughout the garden, into the house, and finally to drive out the red ants and human owners. In this respect, &quot;SimAnt&quot; differed from other &#x27;Sim&#x27; games that were open-ended and had no victory conditions.

In the Quick Game, the player establishes a black ant colony in a small patch of yard, shown in top-down perspective. The computer opponent establishes a competing red ant colony in the same patch. Underground ant colonies are depicted in a side view. The player has direct control of a single ant at a time, indicated by a yellow color, and may switch control to a different ant at any time by either double-clicking the desired ant or choosing Exchange from the Yellow Ant menu and clicking on it. 

The player&#x27;s yellow ant may influence the behavior of other black ants by leaving pheromone trails to destinations such as food and enemy ant colonies and can control the other ants in a limited way, by ordering a certain number to follow it, for instance. The yellow ant can also dig new tunnels underground and expand the network of the black colony. The quick game is won or lost when either the red or black colony in said patch is defeated.

The player&#x27;s yellow ant may pick up food and pebbles, engage in trophallaxis by receiving regurgitated food from friendly ants, and attack enemy ants. Groups of ants, or the yellow ant with her recruits, may attack and kill bigger enemies like spiders, caterpillars, and antlions. Natural hazards include human footsteps, electrical outlets, bug spray, spiders, antlions, lawnmowers, and rain, which washes away pheromone trails and can flood the bottom of ant nests.

In the Full Game, the player begins with an ant colony in an overhead view, much like the Quick Game. The region of this overhead view is a single square of a map containing a yard and house. The player spreads to other areas by producing young queens and drones to mate with each other. The full game is lost when the black colonies are eliminated and won when the red colonies are eliminated and the humans are driven out of the house.

The Experimental Game is similar to the Quick Game, except the player can control red ants and spiders and has access to a set of experimental tools. These tools allow the player to place pheromone trails, maze walls, rocks, ants, pesticides and food.

The boxed game comes with a thoroughly researched instruction manual, which covers game mechanics, and contains a large amount of information regarding ants and ant societies.

==Development==

&quot;SimAnt&quot; was developed by Maxis and designed and programmed by the company&#x27;s co-founder Will Wright alongside his high school friend Justin McCormick. The two each did about half the code and design on the game. Total production time was less than a year due to their round-the-clock effort. While Wright focused on the simulation core during the day, McCormick handled much of the front-end programming at night with the duo meeting twice daily. This was Wright&#x27;s third simulation title following 1989&#x27;s &quot;SimCity&quot; and 1990&#x27;s &quot;SimEarth&quot;. While &quot;SimEarth&quot; was a result of Wright&#x27;s desire to create a simulation other than a direct sequel to the city-building of &quot;SimCity&quot;, he described &quot;SimAnt&quot; as a &quot;slight overreaction&quot; to the seriousness of &quot;SimEarth&quot;. &quot;I wanted &quot;SimAnt&quot; to go in the opposite direction: something non-intimidating, something lighthearted, something fun, something where it was really clear what went wrong,&quot; he explained.

Wright was intrigued by social insects and had been patiently waiting for the release of a computer simulation of an ant farm. When this never occurred he opted to create one himself. Most of the games he worked on resulted from his academic interest in a field of study and simulation development was &quot;almost an excuse to do years of research on a subject.&quot; &quot;SimAnt&quot; was largely based on the research of Harvard University biologist E. O. Wilson, specifically his 1990 zoology textbook &quot;The Ants&quot;. Written with colleague Bert Hölldobler, the book details the behavior of ants and the intricacies of their colonies. Wright considered Wilson to be &quot;kind of &quot;the&quot; myrmecologist&quot; or &quot;the premier myrmecologist&quot; and referencing his work was paramount to building a model for the game. He was particularly interested in Wilson&#x27;s explorations of emergence whereby individual ants performing basic tasks can collectively accomplish very complex goals.

Using Wilson&#x27;s scientific data, Wright said the game was designed with layers of complexity based on how ants function in the real world, making it a form of &quot;self-directed learning.&quot; Wright and McCormick attempted to contact Wilson during development to see if he would like to assist directly on the game. Their letter allegedly arrived at the same time Wilson received a Pulitzer Prize notice for &quot;The Ants&quot;. Wilson commented that the game &quot;captured the subtleties of life in an ant colony&quot; and that he was charmed enough by its &quot;sophistication and precision&quot; that he would recommend it to entomology students. After completing a year&#x27;s worth of the work on the game, Wright lost his home in October 1991 during the Oakland firestorm. He had moved the game&#x27;s source code from his house to his office just two weeks prior.

==Release==
Maxis partnered with Broderbund to first release &quot;SimAnt&quot; in North America in November 1991. Versions were available for Macintosh, DOS, Windows 3.x, and Amiga. The Macintosh version could be played in monochrome or color. Similarly, the Amiga conversion included both low and high resolution graphical settings. Ocean Software distributed the game in Europe in 1992. In Japan, Imagineer published &quot;SimAnt&quot; for Macintosh in November 1991. The company subsequently released conversions to FM Towns, PC-9801, X68000, and Super Famicom in February 1993. This last port, developed by Tomcat System, contains eight gameplay scenarios alongside the full game; has unique graphics and music; and is compatible with the Super NES Mouse. It was localized by Maxis for the North American Super Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1993.

&quot;SimAnt&quot; saw several re-releases on PC. An enhanced CD-ROM version from November 1993 featured Super VGA graphic, digital sound, 20 minutes of full-motion video, and an avatar named SimAntha to entertain and guide the player. The game was included on the &quot;SimClassics Volume 1&quot; compilation in September 1994 alongside &quot;SimCity&quot; and &quot;SimLife&quot;. Finally, &quot;SimAnt&quot; was sold individually as part of the Maxis Collector&#x27;s Series in 1996.

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1992 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #178 by Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;players seeking a non-linear, unconventional and provocative strategy simulation will hit with &quot;SimAnt&quot;. The game is easy to get into, stimulating, fun, and increasingly challenging ... students will love it&quot;.

&quot;GamePro&quot; named it &quot;Educational Game of the Year&quot;, commenting that &quot;&quot;SimAnt&quot; is a delightful combination of simulation, strategy, and adventure.&quot;

==Legacy==
Like its predecessor &quot;SimEarth&quot;, &quot;SimAnt&quot; achieved only middling sales. It sold over 50,000 copies by February 1992. According to one game box, using a statistic from the Software Publisher&#x27;s Association, more than 100,000 copies of the PC version had sold by April 10, 1992. Designer Will Wright stated in 1994 that he considered the game his biggest disappointment up to that point in his career as he felt he failed to convey &quot;how cool ants are.&quot; In a 1996 postmortem, Wright considered &quot;SimAnt&quot; as effectively educational yet &quot;too simple&quot; and lacking the same level of creativity and personal imprinting of the original
&quot;SimCity&quot;. Though not as popular with the targeted adult demographic, the lower complexity of &quot;SimAnt&quot; ultimately connected best with children, specifically boys aged ten to thirteen years of age. Misgauging a game&#x27;s core audience was a lesson Wright learned from his experience with the game. He said in 2003 that he would like to remake &quot;SimAnt&quot; with a more immersive, first-person perspective if given the opportunity. The designer claimed to continue studying books about ants years after the game&#x27;s completion.

Wright has stated that working on &quot;SimAnt&quot; helped inspire him to create the hugely successful social simulation game &quot;The Sims&quot;, first released by Maxis in 2000. The use of ant pheromone trails in the former game was used as a model to drive the wants and needs of the human-like behavior of the Sims in the latter.

The crowdfunded real-time strategy game &quot;Empires of the Undergrowth&quot;, released for early access on Steam in 2024, is considered a spiritual successor to &quot;SimAnt&quot;.

<doc id="194475" wikidata="Q212486" url="?curid=194475" title="Faisal I of Iraq">
<text>Faisal I bin al-Hussein bin Ali al-Hashemi (, &quot;Fayṣal al-Awwal bin al-Ḥusayn bin ʻAlī al-Hāshimī&quot;; 20 May 1885 – 8 September 1933) was King of Iraq from 23 August 1921 until his death in 1933. A member of the Hashemite family, he was a leader of the Great Arab Revolt during the First World War, and ruled as the unrecognized King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria from March to July 1920 when he was expelled by the French.

The third son of Hussein bin Ali, the Grand Emir and Sharif of Mecca, Faisal was born in Mecca and raised in Istanbul. From 1916 to 1918, with British assistance, he played a major role in the revolt against the Ottoman Empire. He helped set up an Arab government in Syria, based in Damascus, and led the Arab delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. In 1920, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed Faisal king, rejecting the French claim to a Mandate for Syria. In response, France invaded a few months later, abolished the kingdom and forced him into exile. 

In August 1921, in accordance with the decision made at the Cairo Conference, the British arranged for Faisal to become king of a new Kingdom of Iraq under British administration. During his reign, Faisal fostered unity between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims to encourage common loyalty and promote pan-Arabism in the goal of creating an Arab state that would include Iraq, Syria and the rest of the Fertile Crescent. In 1932, he presided over the independence of Iraq upon the end of the British Mandate and the country&#x27;s entry into the League of Nations. Faisal died of a heart attack in 1933 in Bern, Switzerland, at the age of 48 and was succeeded by his eldest son Ghazi.

==Early life==
Faisal was born in Mecca, Ottoman Empire (in present-day Saudi Arabia), in 1885, the third son of Hussein bin Ali, the Grand Sharif of Mecca. He grew up in Constantinople and learned about leadership from his father. In 1913, he was elected as representative for the city of Jeddah for the Ottoman parliament.

Following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s declaration of war against the Entente in December 1914, Faisal&#x27;s father sent him on a mission to Constantinople to discuss the Ottomans&#x27; request for Arab participation in the war. Along the way Faisal visited Damascus and met with representatives of the Arab secret societies al-Fatat and Al-&#x27;Ahd. After visiting Constantinople Faisal returned to Mecca via Damascus where he again met with the Arab secret societies, received the Damascus Protocol, and joined with the al-Fatat group of Arab nationalists.

==World War One and the Great Arab Revolt==
On 23 October 1916 at Hamra in Wadi Safra, Faisal met Captain T. E. Lawrence, a junior British intelligence officer from Cairo. Lawrence, who envisioned an independent post-war Arabian state, sought the right man to lead the Hashemite forces and achieve this. In 1916–18, Faisal headed the Northern Army of the rebellion that confronted the Ottomans in what was to later become western Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria. In 1917, Faisal, desiring an empire for himself instead of conquering one for his father, attempted to negotiate an arrangement with the Ottomans under which he would rule the Ottoman &quot;vilayets&quot; of Syria and Mosul as an Ottoman vassal. In December 1917 Faisal contacted General Djemal Pasha declaring his willingness to defect to the Ottoman side provided they would give him an empire to rule, saying the Sykes–Picot agreement had disillusioned him in the Allies and he now wanted to work with his fellow Muslims. Only the unwillingness of the Three Pashas to subcontract ruling part of the Ottoman Empire to Faisal kept him loyal to his father when it finally dawned on him that the Ottomans were just trying to divide and conquer the Hashemite forces. 

In his book &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, Lawrence sought to put the best gloss on Faisal&#x27;s double-dealing as it would contradict the image he was seeking to promote of Faisal as a faithful friend of the Allies betrayed by the British and the French, claiming that Faisal was only seeking to divide the &quot;nationalist&quot; and &quot;Islamist&quot; factions in the ruling Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). The Israeli historians Efraim Karsh and his wife Inari wrote that the veracity of Lawrence&#x27;s account is open to question given that the major dispute within the CUP was not between the Islamist Djemal Pasha and the nationalist Mustafa Kemal as claimed by Lawrence, but rather between Enver Pasha and Djemal Pasha. 

In the spring of 1918, after Germany launched Operation Michael on 21 March 1918, which appeared for a time to foreordain the defeat of the Allies, Faisal again contacted Djemal Pasha asking for peace provided that he be allowed to rule Syria as an Ottoman vassal, which Djemal, confident of victory, declined to consider. After a 30-month-long siege, he conquered Medina, defeating the defence organised by Fakhri Pasha and looted the city. Emir Faisal also worked with the Allies during World War I in their conquest of the region of Syria and the capture of Damascus in October 1918. Faisal became part of a new Arab government at Damascus, formed after the capture of that city in 1918. Emir Faisal&#x27;s role in the Arab Revolt was described by Lawrence in &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;. However, the accuracy of that book, not least the importance given by the author to his own contribution during the Revolt, has been criticized by some historians, including David Fromkin.

==Post World War I==

===Participation in the Paris Peace Conference===
In 1919, Emir Faisal led the Arab delegation to the Paris Peace Conference and, with the support of the knowledgeable and influential Gertrude Bell, argued for the establishment of independent Arab emirates for the predominantly Arab areas previously held by the Ottoman Empire.

===Greater Syria===

British and Arab forces took Damascus in October 1918, which was followed by the Armistice of Mudros. With the end of Turkish rule that October, Faisal helped set up an Arab government, under British protection, in Arab controlled Greater Syria. In May 1919, elections were held for the Syrian National Congress, which met the following month.

===Faisal–Weizmann Agreement===

On 4 January 1919, Emir Faisal and Chaim Weizmann, President of the Zionist Organization, signed the Faisal–Weizmann Agreement for Arab-Jewish Cooperation, in which Faisal conditionally accepted the Balfour Declaration, an official declaration on behalf of the British government by Arthur Balfour, promising British support to the development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Once Arab states were granted autonomy from the European powers, years after the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement, and these new Arab nations were recognized by the Europeans, Weizmann argued that since the fulfillment was kept eventually, the agreement for a Jewish homeland in Palestine still held. In truth, however, this hoped-for partnership had little chance of success and was a dead letter by late 1920. Faisal had hoped that Zionist influence on British policy would be sufficient to forestall French designs on Syria, but Zionist influence could never compete with French interests. At the same time Faisal failed to enlist significant sympathy among his Arab elite supporters for the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, even under loose Arab suzerainty.

Following the decisions taken by the San Remo conference in April 1920, on 13 May 1920, Lord Allenby forwarded to the British War Cabinet a letter from Faisal which stated his opposition to the Balfour proposal to establish a homeland for the Jews in Palestine.

==King of Syria==

On 7 March 1920, Faisal was proclaimed King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria (the region of Syria) by the Syrian National Congress government of Hashim al-Atassi. In April 1920, the San Remo conference gave France the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, which led to the Franco-Syrian War. In the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920, the French were victorious and Faisal was expelled from Syria.

== King of Iraq ==

=== Accession to the Iraqi throne ===
In 1920, Iraqis gathered in sociable meetings in coffeehouses and tents during the winter of 1920 to discuss which form of government and leader the new Iraqi state should have. The British government, mandate holders in Iraq, were concerned at the unrest in the colony. They decided to step back from direct administration and create a monarchy to head Iraq while they maintained the mandate. The idea was to set up a native leader who would be popular among the Iraqi people while still maintaining close relations with the British government.

In March 1921, at the Cairo Conference, the British decided that Faisal was a good candidate for ruling the British Mandate of Iraq because of his apparent conciliatory attitude towards the Great Powers and based on advice from T. E. Lawrence (more commonly known as Lawrence of Arabia). But, in 1921, few people living in Iraq even knew who Faisal was or had ever heard his name. With help of British officials, including Gertrude Bell, he successfully campaigned among the Arabs of Iraq and won over the popular support of the minority Sunni. However, the Shia majority were at first lukewarm about Faisal, and his appearance at the port of Basra was met with indifference. From 23 April to 8 May 1921, Iraqis including most notably Nuri Pasha al-Sa&#x27;id would send telegrams to Faisal, inviting him to Iraq as its prospective king. Between May and June, Faisal sent representatives to confirm his election.

On 12 June 1921, Faisal left Jeddah for Iraq alongside several Iraqi nobles and Sir Kinahan Cornwallis on the RIMS Northbrook, and on 23 June, Faisal first landed in Iraq on the main port of Basra. Faisal&#x27;s arrival was met with a mixed response, while most Iraqis welcomed him in large numbers and groups, some people, especially the Ulama&#x27; at Najaf and the tribesman of Southern Iraq, including Samawah, were either disappointed or hostile which shocked Faisal. Despite this, the Mayor of Baghdad at the time sent a telegram to greet Faisal. The city of Hillah also welcomed him. When Faisal arrived in Baghdad on 26 June, he was widely welcomed by Baghdadis. The next day, an ovation was given to him in al-Kadhimiyya, where he prayed at its main mosque and was welcomed.

Faisal became a candidate for King of Iraq alongside other candidates such as the Sayyid Muhammad al-Sadr, and Ali Jawdat al-Ayyubi. Following a plebiscite showing 96% in favor, Faisal agreed to become king. On 23 August 1921, he was made king of Iraq. Iraq was a new entity created out of the former Ottoman &quot;vilayets&quot; (provinces) of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra. Ottoman &quot;vilayets&quot; were usually named after their capital, and thus the Basra &quot;vilayet&quot; was southern Iraq. Given this background, there was no sense of Iraqi nationalism or even Iraqi national identity when Faisal took his throne. Anecdotally, the band present played God Save the King, as Iraq did not yet have a national anthem and would not have one until 1932. 

=== Reign ===
During his reign as King, Faisal encouraged pan-Arab nationalism that envisioned ultimately bringing the French mandates of Syria and Lebanon together with the British mandate of Palestine under his rule. Faisal was keenly aware that his power-base was with the Sunni Muslim Arabs of Iraq, who comprised a significant minority. By contrast, if Syria, Lebanon and Palestine were incorporated into his realm, then the Sunni Muslim Arabs would comprise the majority of his subjects, making the Arab Shi&#x27;i Muslim and the ethnic Kurds of Iraq into minorities. Furthermore, the Arab Shi&#x27;i Muslims of Iraq at the time had traditionally looked towards Persia for leadership, and the rallying cry of Pan-Arabism might unite the Arab Sunnis and Shi&#x27;a around a common sense of Arab identity. In Iraq, a majority of the Arabs were Shi&#x27;i Muslims who had not responded to the call for Sharif Hussein to join the &quot;Great Arab Revolt&quot; as the Sharif was a considered a Sunni Muslim from the Hejaz, thus making him a double outsider. Rather than risk the wrath of the Ottomans on behalf of an outsider like Hussein, the Shi&#x27;i Muslims of Iraq had ignored the Great Arab Revolt. In the Ottoman Empire, the state religion was Sunni Islam and the Shi&#x27;i Muslim had been marginalized for their religion, making the Shia population poorer and less educated than the Sunni population.
Faisal himself was a tolerant man, proclaiming himself a friend of the Shi&#x27;i Muslim, Kurdish and Jewish communities in his realm, and in 1928 criticized the policy of some of his ministers of seeking to fire all Jewish Iraqis from the civil service, but his policy of promoting pan-Arab nationalism to further his personal and dynastic ambitions proved to be a disruptive force in Iraq as it drew a wedge between the Arab and Kurdish communities. Faisal&#x27;s policy of equating &quot;wataniyya&quot; (&quot;patriotism&quot; or in this case Iraqiness) with being Arab marginalized the Kurds who feared that they had no place in an Arab-dominated Iraq, indeed in a state that equated being Iraqi with being Arab.

Faisal also developed desert motor routes from Baghdad to Damascus, and Baghdad to Amman. This led to a great interest in the Mosul oilfield and eventually to his plan to build an oil pipeline to a Mediterranean port, which would help Iraq economically. This also led to an increase in Iraq&#x27;s desire for more influence in the Arab East. During his reign, Faisal made great effort to build Iraq&#x27;s army into a powerful force. He attempted to impose universal military service in order to achieve this, but this failed. Some see this as part of his plan to advance his pan-Arab agenda.

During the Great Syrian Revolt against French rule in Syria, Faisal was not particularly supportive of the rebels partly because of British pressure, partly because of his own cautious nature, and mainly because he had reason to believe that the French were interested in installing a Hashemite to govern Syria on their behalf. In 1925, after the Syrian Druze uprising, the French government began consulting Faisal on Syrian matters. He advised the French to restore Hashemite power in Damascus. The French consulted Faisal because they were inspired by his success as an imposed leader in Iraq. As it turned out, the French were merely playing Faisal along as they wished to give him the impression that he might be restored as king of Syria to dissuade him from supporting the Syrian rebels, and once they crushed the Syrian revolt, they lost interest in having a Hashemite rule in Syria.

Faisal saw the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 as an obstacle to his pan-Arab views, although it provided Iraq with a degree of political independence. He wanted to make sure that the treaty had a built-in end date because the treaty further divided Syria and Iraq, the former which was under French control, and the latter under British rule. This prevented unity between two major Arab regions, which were important in Faisal&#x27;s pan-Arab agenda. Ironically, Arab nationalists in Iraq had a positive reception to the treaty because they saw this as progress, which seemed better than the Arab situation in Syria and Palestine. Faisal&#x27;s schemes for a greater Iraqi-Syrian state under his leadership attracted much opposition from Turkey, which preferred to deal with two weak neighbors instead of one strong one, and from King Fuad I of Egypt and Ibn Saud of Hejaz and Nejd, who both saw themselves as the rightful leaders of the Arab world. When Nuri al-Said visited Yemen in May 1931 to ask the Imam Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din if he was interested in joining the &quot;Arab Alliance&quot; under Faisal&#x27;s leadership, the Imam replied with a confused look what would be the purpose of the &quot;Arab Alliance&quot; and to please explain the meaning of the phrase &quot;Arab World&quot;, which he was unfamiliar with.

== Public relationship with Iraqis ==
When Faisal first came to Iraq, he was a stranger to the cultural and social life. Due to this, throughout his reign, he tried his best to immerse himself in understanding the ways of his new country. A few weeks after he arrived in Iraq, he was greeted by the respected Islamic scholar Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi, and met with several educated Iraqis to learn of their perspectives and conditions. Even becoming a patron in several clubs such as the 1920s Baghdadi &quot;Irshad Club.&quot; Faisal started a tradition of receiving several writers and poets regularly. Among these poets was Ma&#x27;ruf al-Rusafi, who wrote poems praising the King. Another poet that Faisal received and made a part of his royal court was al-Jawahiri, who was made a member after Arab Nationalist Sati&#x27; al-Husri falsely accused him of being an Iranian.

Another group that Faisal held greatly were teachers as he saw them as important figures to encourage and cultivate. Accompanied by Rustam Haidar, he regularly toured Baghdadi schools, including Christian and Jewish, and inspected their conditions as part of his agenda. He met with several teachers, both male and female, to motivate them to work as he considered teachers to be more significant than a king&#x27;s or minister&#x27;s work.

However, the poets had also caused Faisal trouble in the matter of education. An example was when Faisal opened the first girls&#x27; school in Najaf and received backlash from the conservative groups in the traditionalist city. In response during the opening occasions, al-Jawahiri, who was a Najafi himself, wrote scathing lines criticizing the conservative nature of the city&#x27;s people in his poem named &quot;The Reactionaries&quot; which was published in several newspapers. This would cause a large outcry in the city which reached Faisal&#x27;s attention. Faisal would confront al-Jawahiri reportedly saying &quot;Are you aware of the calls and cables I have received that all say that this is the work of your &quot;son, Muhammad,&quot; who works under your auspices and protections? And do you know how much grief this has caused me?&quot; In response, al-Jawahiri apologized and offered to resign, but Faisal decided to forgive al-Jawahiri and decided to keep him in his royal court.

=== Relations with religious groups ===
Faisal regularly attended Friday prayers as it helped him meet with the public Iraqi people more. Faisal was noticeably unaffected by sectarian considerations, and was noted by al-Rihani to have a faith that reflected all Islamic dominations, which made him respect, and be tolerant to all world religions. Abbas Baghdadi, a young writer, recounted how Faisal would pull up in the Arab attire to the al-Sarai Mosque for Friday Prayers, which was decided to be the main Friday Prayers mosque. Faisal has also ordered the reconstruction of Sufi shrines in Mosul such as the tekke of the Shadhili Order. Faisal also met with leaders of smaller religious communities such as chief Rabbis from both Baghdad and Mosul.

Faisal had great tolerance for Shi&#x27;i Muslims and was a component of inter-faith. Faisal&#x27;s main link with the community was the Sayyid Muhammad al-Sadr, who was one of the only people who could enter the king&#x27;s prescience without further notice. Faisal always wanted to remind Shi&#x27;i Muslims of his linage to Ali. Due to this, his coronation took place on 18 Dhu al-Hijja according to the Islamic Calendar, which coincided with Eid al-Ghadir. Throughout his reign, especially in his early days, Faisal had wanted to increase the prescience of Shi&#x27;i Muslims in administrations. Example being the hiring of Tawfiq al-Suwaidi in the Baghdadi Law College, accepting qualifications of Shi&#x27;i Muslim-based schools, help fund the commemorating of Muharram, working with Ayatollah Medhi al-Khalissi who was a friend of Sharif Hussein, and visiting Najaf and Karbala to strengthen his position. Reportedly, Faisal once told Sir Percy Cox that the Iraqi Shi&#x27;i Muslim Mujtahideen were prepared to back him up.

In March 1932, just months before independence, Faisal wrote a memorandum where he criticized the Iraqi people&#x27;s lack of Iraqi national identity in the newly established country, writing: Iraq is a kingdom ruled by a Sunni Arab government founded on the wreckage of Ottoman rule. This government rules over a Kurdish segment, the majority of which is ignorant, that includes persons with personal ambitions who lead it to abandon it [the government] under the pretext that it does not belong to their ethnicity. [The government also rules over] an ignorant Shiite majority that belongs to the same ethnicity of the government, but the persecutions that had befallen them as a result of Turkish rule, which did not enable them to take part in governance and exercise it, drove a deep wedge between the Arab people divided into these two sects. Unfortunately, all of this made this majority, or the persons who harbor special aspirations, the religious among them, the seekers of posts without qualification, and those who did not benefit materially from the new rule, to pretend that they are still being persecuted because they are Shiites. 

== Foreign relations ==
Faisal encouraged an influx of Syrian exiles and office-seekers to cultivate better Iraqi-Syrian relations. In order to improve education in the country Faisal employed doctors and teachers in the civil service and appointed Syrian Arab nationalist Sati&#x27; al-Husri, the ex-Minister of Education in Damascus, as his director of the Ministry of Education. This influx resulted in much native resentment towards Syrians and Lebanese in Iraq. The tendency of the Syrian emigres in the education ministry to write and issue school textbooks glorying the Umayyad Caliphate as the &quot;golden age&quot; of the Arabs together with the highly dismissive remarks about Ali gave great offense in the Shi&#x27;i Muslim community in Iraq, prompting protests and leading Faisal to withdraw the offending textbooks in 1927 and again in 1933 when they were reissued.

=== Palestinian issue ===
In 1929, when bloody rioting broke out in Jerusalem between the Arab and Jewish communities, Faisal was highly supportive of the Arab position and pressured the British for a pro-Arab solution of the Palestine crisis. In a memo stating his views on Palestine submitted to the British high commissioner Sir Hubert Young on 7 December 1929, Faisal accepted the Balfour Declaration, but only in the most minimal sense in that the declaration had promised a &quot;Jewish national home&quot;. Faisal stated he was willing to accept the Palestine Mandate as a &quot;Jewish national home&quot; to which Jews fleeing persecution around the world might go, but he was adamant that there be no Jewish state. Faisal argued that the best solution was for Britain to grant independence to Palestine, which would be united in a federation led by his brother, the Emir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan, which would allow for a Jewish &quot;national home&quot; under his sovereignty.

Faisal argued that what was needed was a compromise under which the Palestinians would give up their opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine in exchange for which the Zionists would give up their plans to one day create a Jewish state in the Holy Land. Faisal&#x27;s preferred solution to the &quot;Palestine Question&quot;, which he admitted might not be practical at the moment, was for a federation that would unite Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine under his leadership.

== Independence and last years ==
In 1932, the British mandate ended and Faisal was instrumental in making his country independent. On 3 October, the Kingdom of Iraq joined the League of Nations.

In August 1933, incidents like the Simele massacre caused tension between the United Kingdom and Iraq. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald ordered High Commissioner Francis Humphrys to Iraq immediately upon hearing of the killing of Assyrian Christians. The British government demanded that Faisal stay in Baghdad to punish the guilty, whether Christian or Muslim. In response, Faisal cabled to the Iraqi Legation in London: &quot;Although everything is normal now in Iraq, and in spite of my broken health, I shall await the arrival of Sir Francis Humphrys in Bagdad, but there is no reason for further anxiety. Inform the British Government of the contents of my telegram.&quot;

In July 1933, right before his death, Faisal went to London where he expressed his alarm at the current situation of Arabs that resulted from the Arab-Jewish conflict and the increased Jewish immigration to Palestine, as the Arab political, social, and economic situation was declining. He asked the British to limit Jewish immigration and land purchases.

==Death==

King Faisal died of a heart attack on 8 September 1933 in Bern, Switzerland. He was 48 years old at the time of his death. Faisal was succeeded on the throne by his eldest son, Ghazi.

A square is named in his honor at the end of Haifa Street, Baghdad, where an equestrian statue of him stands. The statue was knocked down following the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958, but later restored. Another square is named after him in Haifa, Israel, where his remains passed on their way from the Port of Haifa to the airport, to be flown to Baghdad. A broken column on Faisal Square commemorates his early death.

==Marriage and children==
Faisal was married to Sharifa Huzaima bint Nasser and had with her one son and three daughters, and married to Sharifa bint Hamed and had with her one son.
*Princess Azza bint Faisal.
*Princess Rajiha bint Faisal.
*Princess Rafia bint Faisal.
*Ghazi, King of Iraq, born 1912 died 4 April 1939, married his first cousin, Princess Aliya bint Ali, daughter of King Ali of Hejaz.
*Prince Mohammad.

==Film==
Faisal has been portrayed on film at least three times: in David Lean&#x27;s epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), played by Alec Guinness; in the unofficial sequel to &quot;Lawrence&quot;, &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot; (1990), played by Alexander Siddig; and in Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Queen of the Desert&quot; (2015), played by Younes Bouab. On video, he was portrayed in &quot;The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: Chapter 19 The Winds of Change&quot; (1995) by Anthony Zaki.

<text>Raymond Fraser (May 8, 1941 – October 22, 2018) was a Canadian biographer, editor, essayist, memoirist, novelist, poet and short story writer. Fraser published fourteen books of fiction, three of non-fiction, and eight poetry collections. Fraser&#x27;s writings received positive comments from literary figures Farley Mowat, Irving Layton, Louis Dudek, Alden Nowlan, Sheila Watson, Leonard Cohen, Hugh Garner, and Michael Cook.

==Biography==
Born in Chatham, New Brunswick, Raymond Fraser attended St. Thomas University where in his freshman year he played on the varsity hockey and football teams, and served as co-editor with John Brebner of the student literary magazine &quot;Tom-Tom&quot; in his junior year. His 20-year correspondence and friendship with the poet Alden Nowlan date from this period.

During the sixties Fraser worked as a lab technician, a high school teacher, and as editor and freelance writer for a number of tabloid newspapers.

While living in Montreal in 1966, Fraser and poet Leroy Johnson founded the literary magazine &quot;Intercourse: Contemporary Canadian Writing&quot;. In 1971 he cofounded Montreal Story Tellers Fiction Performance Group and the Rank Outsiders Poetry Extravaganza. His first book of fiction, &quot;The Black Horse Tavern&quot; (1973), was published in Montreal by Ingluvin Publications.

Fraser died in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on October 22, 2018, at the age of 77.

==Awards and recognition==
His novel, &quot;The Bannonbridge Musicians&quot; (Ingluvin Publications) was a finalist for the 1978 Governor General&#x27;s Award.

In 2009, following publication of his novel &quot;In Another Life&quot; (Lion&#x27;s Head Press), Fraser received the inaugural Lieutenant-Governor&#x27;s Award for High Achievement in the Arts for English Language Literary Arts.

Five of Fraser&#x27;s books were listed in &quot;Atlantic Canada&#x27;s 100 Greatest Books&quot; (Nimbus Publishing, 2009), a title also shared by three other authors.

In 2012. he was made a member of the Order of New Brunswick, the province&#x27;s highest honour, for his contributions to literature and New Brunswick&#x27;s cultural life.

In May 2016, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from his alma mater, St Thomas University. In 2017, he received the Canadian Senate Sesquicentennial Medal in recognition of valuable service to the nation.

Over the years he received four Canada Council Grants, six New Brunswick Arts Board Grants, and the Canadian Writers&#x27; Trust Woodcock Grant.

<text>The Long Now Foundation, established in 1996, is an American non-profit organization based in San Francisco that seeks to start and promote a long-term cultural institution. It aims to provide a counterpoint to what it views as today&#x27;s &quot;faster/cheaper&quot; mindset and to promote &quot;slower/better&quot; thinking. The Long Now Foundation hopes to &quot;creatively foster responsibility&quot; in the framework of the next 10,000 years. In a manner somewhat similar to the Holocene calendar, the foundation uses 5-digit dates to address the Year 10,000 problem (e.g., by writing the current year &quot;02025&quot; rather than &quot;2025&quot;). The organization&#x27;s logo is , a capital X with an overline, a representation of 10,000 in Roman numerals.

==Projects==
The foundation has several ongoing projects, including a 10,000-year clock known as the &quot;Clock of the Long Now&quot;, the &quot;Rosetta Project&quot;, the &quot;Long Bet Project&quot;, the open source &quot;Timeline Tool&quot; (also known as Longviewer), the &quot;Long Server&quot; and a monthly seminar series.

===Clock of the Long Now===

The purpose of the &quot;Clock of the Long Now&quot; is to construct a timepiece that will operate with minimum human intervention for ten millennia. It is to be constructed of durable materials, to be easy to repair, and to be made of largely valueless materials in case knowledge of the clock is lost or it is deemed to be of no value to an individual or possible future civilization; in this way it is hoped that the Clock will not be looted or destroyed. Its power source (or sources) should be renewable but similarly unlootable. A prototype of a potential final clock candidate was activated on December 31, 1999, and is on display at the Science Museum in London. The Foundation is currently building the &quot;Clock of the Long Now&quot; in Van Horn, Texas.

===Rosetta Project===

The &quot;Rosetta Project&quot; is an effort to preserve all languages that have a high likelihood of extinction over the period from 2000 to 2100. These include many languages whose native speakers number in the thousands or fewer. Other languages with many more speakers are considered by the project to be endangered because of the increasing importance of English as an international language of commerce and culture. Samples of such languages are to be inscribed onto a disc of nickel alloy three inches (7.62 cm) across. A Version 1.0 of the disc was completed on November 3, 2008.

===Long Bet Project===
The &quot;Long Bet Project&quot; was created by The Long Now Foundation to propose and keep track of bets on long-term events and stimulate discussion about the future. The Long Now Foundation describes The Long Bet Project as a &quot;public arena for enjoyably competitive predictions, of interest to society, with philanthropic money at stake.&quot; One example bet would be on whether people will regularly fly on pilotless aircraft by 2030.

Bets that were resolved in 2010 included predictions about peak oil, print on demand, modem obsolescence, and commercially available 100-qubit quantum computers.

An analysis by researcher Gwern Branwen found dozens of bets that had already expired but had not resolved, and many others with poorly defined resolution criteria. Branwen also found that the vast majority of the expired predictions resolved false, so that anyone could make a profit by betting indiscriminately against existing predictions. In light of these and other issues, and the website’s extremely low activity levels (with an average of less than two bets per year), Branwen concluded that the Long Bet Project should be shut down.

===Seminars about long-term thinking===
In November 2003, The Long Now Foundation began a series of monthly seminars about long-term thinking (SALT) with a lecture by Brian Eno. The seminars are held in the San Francisco Bay Area and have focused on long-term policy and thinking, scenario planning, singularity and the projects of the foundation. The seminars are available for download in various formats from The Long Now Foundation. They are intended to &quot;nudge civilization toward making long-term thinking automatic and common&quot;. Topics have included preserving environmental resources, the deep past and deep future of the sciences and the arts, human life extension, the likelihood of an asteroid strike in the future, SETI, and the nature of time.

====Long Now Foundation debate format====

As part of the seminar series, there are occasionally debates on areas of long term concern, such as synthetic biology or &quot;historian vs futurist on human progress&quot;.

The point of Long Now debates is not win-lose. The point is public clarity and deep understanding, leading to action graced with nuance and built-in adaptivity, with long-term responsibility in mind.

In operation, &quot;There are two debaters, Alice and Bob. Alice takes the podium, makes her argument. Then Bob takes her place, but before he can present his counter-argument, he must summarize Alice&#x27;s argument to her satisfaction — a demonstration of respect and good faith. Only when Alice agrees that Bob has got it right is he permitted to proceed with his own argument — and then, when he&#x27;s finished, Alice must summarize it to his satisfaction.&quot;

Mutual understanding is enforced by a reciprocal requirement to describe the other&#x27;s argument to their satisfaction, with the goal being more understanding after the event than there was beforehand.

===The Interval===

Opened in June 2014, The Interval was designed as social space in the foundation&#x27;s Fort Mason facility in San Francisco. The purpose of The Interval is to have a public space where people can come together to discuss ideas and topics related to long-term thinking, as well as provide a venue for a variety of Long Now events. The Interval includes lounge furniture, artifacts from the foundation&#x27;s projects, a library, audio/video equipment, and a bar serving tea and coffee during the day, and cocktails during the night. In October 2014 The Interval was named by Thrillist as one of the best new bars in America.

===Manual for Civilization===
The Manual for Civilization is a living, crowd-curated library of 3,500 books with the purpose of creating a record of humanity and technology for the current generation&#x27;s descendants. The library is curated by the Long Now community and is on display at The Interval, Long Now’s cafe-bar-salon in San Francisco.

===PanLex===
PanLex is a linguistic project whose stated mission is to overcome language barriers to human rights, information, and opportunities. Started in 2004 at the University of Washington’s Turing Center, the project sought to build software that would enable all humans to use their native language to share information, ideas, and emotions with the rest of the world. This research produced a lexical database (TransGraph) designed to support panlingual translation, and a more powerful extension of it (PanDictionary) based on intelligent automated inference. After this work demonstrated the feasibility of the concept, the PanDictionary became the PanLex Database, and PanLex has continued to enlarge, enrich, and modify it by consulting multilingual dictionary and dictionary-like sources. In 2012, PanLex became a project of The Long Now Foundation.

==In popular culture==
Neal Stephenson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Anathem&quot; was partly inspired by the author&#x27;s involvement with the Clock of the Long Now project. As a result of Brian Eno&#x27;s work on the clock project, an album entitled &quot;January 07003 / Bell Studies for The Clock of The Long Now&quot; was released in 2003. English songwriter Owen Tromans released a single entitled &quot;Long Now&quot;, inspired by the foundation, in 2013.

<doc id="194488" wikidata="Q908534" url="?curid=194488" title="Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 / 300i, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a piano sonata in three movements. 

The sonata was published by Artaria in 1784, alongside Nos. 10 and 12 (K. 330 and K. 332).

The third movement of this sonata, the &quot;Rondo alla Turca&quot;, or &quot;Turkish March&quot;, is often heard on its own and regarded as one of Mozart&#x27;s best-known piano pieces.

==Structure==
The sonata consists of three movements:

All of the movements are in the key of A major or A minor; therefore, the work is homotonal. A typical performance of this entire sonata takes about 20 minutes.

===I. &quot;Andante grazioso&quot;===

Since the opening movement of this sonata is a theme and variation, Mozart defied the convention of beginning a sonata with an allegro movement in sonata form. The theme is a siciliana, consisting of an 8-measure section and a 10-measure section, each repeated, a structure shared by each variation.

===II. &quot;Menuetto&quot;===

The second movement of the sonata is a standard minuet and trio movement in A major. 

===III. &quot;Alla turca&quot;===

The last movement, marked &quot;Alla turca&quot;, is popularly known as the &quot;Turkish Rondo&quot; or &quot;Turkish March&quot;.

Mozart himself titled the rondo &quot;Alla turca&quot;. It imitates the sound of Turkish Janissary bands, the music of which was much in vogue at that time.

*Section A: This section, in A minor, consists of a rising sixteenth-note melody followed by a falling eighth note melody over a staccato eighth-note accompaniment. It is eight measures long.
*Section B: This section introduces new material in a melody in thirds and eighth notes before varying the A section with a crescendo before falling back to piano by a modification of Section A.
*Section C: A &quot;forte&quot; march in octaves over an arpeggiated chord accompaniment. The key changes to A major.
*Section D: A &quot;piano&quot; continuous sixteenth note melody over a broken-chord accompaniment. This section is in the relative key, F minor.
*Section E: A &quot;forte&quot; scale-like theme followed by a modification of section D.
*Coda: A &quot;forte&quot; theme consisting mostly of chords (arpeggiated and not) and octaves. There is a brief &quot;piano&quot; restatement of the theme in the middle of the coda followed by a final &quot;forte&quot; restatement before an ending in octaves.

==Relationships to later compositions and arrangements==
The theme of the first movement was used by Max Reger in his &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart&quot; (1914) for orchestra. The Israeli composer Ron Weidberg (b. 1953) used the same theme for a set of variations. Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Blue Rondo à la Turk&quot; (1959) is &quot;not&quot; based on or related to the last movement.

==2014 autograph discovery==
In 2014, Hungarian librarian Balázs Mikusi discovered in Budapest&#x27;s National Széchényi Library four pages from the first and middle movements in Mozart&#x27;s autograph manuscript of the sonata. Until then, only the last page of the last movement, which is preserved in the International Mozarteum Foundation, had been known to have survived. The paper and handwriting of the four pages matched that of the final page of the score, held in Salzburg. The original score is close to the first edition, published in 1784.

In the first movement, however, in bars 5 and 6 of the fifth variation, the rhythm of the last three notes was altered. In the menuetto, the last quarter beat of bar 3 is a C in most editions, but in the original autograph an A is printed. In the first edition, an A is also printed in bar 3, as in the original, but on the other hand a C is printed in the parallel passage at bar 33, mirroring subsequent editions.

On 26 September 2014 Zoltán Kocsis gave the first performance of the rediscovered score, at the National Széchényi Library in Budapest.

<doc id="194491" wikidata="Q16868766" url="?curid=194491" title="Mispronunciation">
<text>In linguistics, mispronunciation is the act of pronouncing a word incorrectly. Languages are pronounced in different ways by different people, depending on factors like the area they grew up in, their level of education, and their social class. Even within groups of the same area and class, people can pronounce words differently.

A standard of pronunciation is the most common way to pronounce a word. Standards vary among groups. Dictionaries include pronunciations. 

Languages constantly change, split up, and diverge. Diversity within languages as a natural consequence of language evolution is now acknowledged. This diversity is studied.

== Pronunciation in dictionaries ==
Early dictionaries, such as that by Samuel Johnson in England and later Noah Webster in the United States played a large role in making spelling more uniform. When dictionaries began to add pronunciation guides, they played a similar role there. At first, American dictionaries (at least) tended to avoid listing pronunciations that they considered non-standard, and thus they played a prescriptive role (the British tradition is far more descriptive). However, following the general trend in linguistics, American dictionaries are now becoming more descriptive while British dictionaries are becoming less so (with Australian ones remaining in between); this is the case in other respects as well as with pronunciation. For example, the pronunciation of the word &quot;nuclear&quot; as if it were spelled &quot;nucular&quot; is one that is frowned upon by some, but the pronunciation is listed in some dictionaries. However, to take this to mean that the pronunciation is considered either &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; is to misunderstand the role that these dictionaries are playing. They are simply reporting current usage.

== Pronunciation change ==
The following are some of the processes by which pronunciation can change. 

=== Omission of phonemes ===
Many words have lost phonemes (consonant or vowel sounds) somewhere in their histories. Sometimes, this changes the standard of pronunciation. For example, the silent &quot;k&quot; at the start of many words in the English language was originally pronounced. However, a word is mispronounced if a phoneme is omitted when it is not normally pronounced that way. For example, some speakers omit the first &quot;c&quot; sound from &quot;Antarctic&quot;, resulting in a pronunciation (&quot;ant-AR-tik&quot;). 

=== Adaptation to a different language ===
Words and names that are adopted from one language to another can be mispronounced because the phonology of the source language is different from that in the destination language.

Proper nouns such as names of people and places are written as foreign words and often given their native pronunciation too.

== Terms ==

* Spelling pronunciation: Pronouncing a word according to its infelicitous or ambiguous spelling.
* Aphesis: The loss of the sound at the start of a word.
* Aspiration: An &quot;h&quot; sound at the beginning of a word. For example, the &quot;h&quot; in honor (British: honour) is not pronounced, but it is in &quot;happy.&quot; As with all pronunciation &quot;rules,&quot; conventions regarding the aspirated &quot;H&quot; differ from region to region. In parts of the US, it is customary to pronounce &quot;herb&quot; without the initial &quot;h&quot; sound, while in the UK, the initial &quot;h&quot; is aspirated. 
* orthoepy
* Epenthesis: The addition of one or more sounds to a word, especially to the interior of a word (&quot;prothesis&quot; at the beginning and &quot;paragoge&quot; at the end are commonly used). Epenthesis may be divided into two types: excrescence, for the addition of a consonant, and anaptyxis for the addition of a vowel. 
* Metathesis: The reversal of letters within a word when pronounced. For example &quot;iron&quot; is pronounced as &quot;iorn.&quot;
* Shibboleth: Any practice that shows one&#x27;s social or regional origin. This usually refers to features of language, and particularly to a word whose pronunciation identifies its speaker as a member of a particular group.
* Spoonerism: The exchange of letters or syllables between two words or even within a word, with comic results—especially when the result changes the speaker&#x27;s intended meaning. 

== Automatic detection ==

Using computational techniques, such as machine learning, it is possible to automatically detect mispronunciations in recorded speech.

<text>Anhalt-Zerbst was a district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts Potsdam-Mittelmark (Brandenburg) and Wittenberg, the city of Dessau and the districts of Köthen, Schönebeck and Jerichower Land.

== History ==
While Zerbst is a small town today, together with Dessau it was one of the two central cities of Anhalt. When the state of Anhalt was dissolved in 1603, one of the successor states was the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. It was a small state with almost no political power. In 1793 the line of the princes became extinct, and Anhalt-Zerbst was annexed by the neighbouring principality of Anhalt-Dessau.

The present district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Zerbst and Roßlau with parts of the former district of Gräfenhainichen. Its borders are roughly identical with the ancient principality.

The district of Anhalt-Zerbst was dissolved in 2007 and divided into the new districts of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Jerichower Land and Wittenberg.

Russian empress, Catherine the Great, was, by birth, a princess of Anhalt-Zerbst.

== Geography ==
Anhalt-Zerbst comprises plain countryside north of the Elbe River. The Elbe enters the district in the east, runs through the southeastern part and then forms the southern and western border of Anhalt-Zerbst. The Elbe banks within the district are part of the Biosphere Reserve Middle Elbe. The north is occupied by the southern portions of the Fläming plateau.

<doc id="194500" wikidata="Q26755" url="?curid=194500" title="Black redstart">
<text>The black redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros) is a small passerine bird in the genus &quot;Phoenicurus&quot;. Like its relatives, it was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family (Turdidae), but is now known to be an Old World flycatcher (Muscicapidae). Obsolete common names include Tithys redstart, blackstart (not to be confused with the species currently known as blackstart) and black redtail.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The first formal description of the black redstart was by the German naturalist Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin in 1774 under the binomial name &quot;Mottacilla ochruros&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Phoenicurus&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by the English naturalist Thomas Forster. Both parts of the scientific name are from Ancient Greek and refer to the colour of the tail. The genus name &quot;Phoenicurus&quot; is from &quot;phoinix&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;-ouros&quot; -&quot;tailed&quot;, and the specific &quot;ochruros&quot; is from &quot;okhros&quot;, &quot;pale yellow&quot; and &quot;-ouros&quot;.

The black redstart is a member of a temperate Eurasian clade, which also includes the Daurian redstart, Hodgson&#x27;s redstart, the white-winged redstart and perhaps Przevalski&#x27;s redstart. The ancestors of the present species diverged from about 3 million years ago (mya) (Late Pliocene) onwards and spread throughout much of Palearctic from 1.5 mya onward. It is not very closely related to the common redstart. As these are separated by different behaviour and ecological requirements and have not evolved fertilisation barriers, the two European species can produce apparently fertile and viable hybrids.

There are a number of subspecies, which differ mainly in the underpart colours of the adult males and, for some forms, calls; different authorities accept between five and seven subspecies. They can be separated into three major groups, according to morphology, biogeography and mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data.

&quot;P. o. phoenicuroides&quot; group. Basal central and eastern Asian forms which diverged from the ancestral stock as the species slowly spread west ( 3–1.5 mya). Females and juveniles light grey brown.
* &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros phoenicuroides&quot; (Moore, F, 1854) – Tian Shan eastwards to Mongolia. Small; adult males have lower breast, belly and flanks deep rufous, pale wing-patch absent, sometimes white forehead. Overall quite similar to a much darker common redstart with black chest. Females and juveniles are similar to common redstart but have an overall sandier, paler colour and often a distinct buff eye-ring.
* &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros murinus&quot; Fedorenko, 2018 – Altai, Tuva, northern China and western Mongolia. Distinguished from the previous Turkestan subspecies by the absence of any contrast in the colour of the head, nape and back, all of which are concolorous dark grey.
* &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros rufiventris&quot; (Vieillot, 1818) – Turkmenistan eastwards through Pamir and Alay Mountains to Himalaya. Usually large; adult males like &quot;P. o. phoenicuroides&quot;, but darker overall, with black back and rufous-chestnut underside. Females with rufous tinge to underside. Exact limits with &quot;P. o. phoenicuroides&quot; unresolved.
** &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros xerophilus&quot;. China east of and between ranges of preceding two. Large; colour pattern like &quot;P. o. phoenicuroides&quot; but paler. Included in &quot;P. o. rufiventris&quot; by many authorities.

&quot;P. o. ochruros&quot; group. Western Asian forms, whose lineage separated from the &quot;gibraltariensis&quot; group c. 1.5–0.5 mya. Females and juveniles intermediate.
* &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros ochruros&quot; (Gmelin, SG, 1774) – Eastern Turkey, Alborz, and Caucasus. Small, somewhat intermediate between &quot;P. o. phoenicuroides&quot; and &quot;P. o. gibraltariensis&quot;. Generally like latter, but rufous underside, pale wing patch weakly developed.
* &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros semirufus&quot; (Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg, 1833) – Levant. Small; adult males somewhat similar to &quot;rufiventris&quot; except in size. Black areas extensive.

&quot;P. o. gibraltariensis&quot; group. European population, which formed as a distinct subspecies probably during the last ice age. Females and juveniles dark grey.
* &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros gibraltariensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Western Europe east to the Crimea and western Turkey. Neck, upper back and shoulders dark slate grey to black in adult males, lighter than face and neck, pale wing patch strongly developed.
** &quot;Phoenicurus ochruros aterrimus&quot;. Iberia and Morocco. Neck, upper back and shoulders black in adult males. Wide intergradation with &quot;P. o. gibraltariensis&quot; and treated as a synonym of it by many authorities.

==Description==
The black redstart is in length and in weight, similar to the common redstart. The adult male is overall dark grey to black on the upperparts and with a black breast; the lower rump and tail are orange-red, with the two central tail feathers dark red-brown. The belly and undertail are either blackish-grey (western subspecies; see Taxonomy and systematics, above) or orange-red (eastern subspecies); the wings are blackish-grey with pale fringes on the secondaries forming a whitish panel (western subspecies) or all blackish (eastern subspecies). The female is grey (western subspecies) to grey-brown (eastern subspecies) overall except for the orange-red lower rump and tail, greyer than the common redstart; at any age the grey axillaries and underwing coverts are also distinctive (in the Common Redstart these are buff to orange-red). There are two distinct forms in first calendar year males at least in western subspecies, with the first (&#x27;carei&#x27;) being similar to females and the second (&#x27;paradoxus&#x27;) approaching adult males but lacking the whitish wing panel that does only develop during post-breeding moult of wing feathers in the second calendar year. This second form is much rarer than the first. 
==Distribution and habitat==
It is a widespread breeder in south and central Europe and Asia and north-west Africa, from Great Britain and Ireland (where local) south to Morocco, east to central China. It is resident in the milder parts of its range, but north-eastern birds migrate to winter in southern and western Europe and Asia, and north Africa. It nests in crevices or holes in buildings.

In Britain, it is most common as a passage and winter visitor, with only 20–50 pairs breeding. On passage it is fairly common on the east and south coasts, and in winter on the coasts of Wales and western and southern England, with a few also at inland sites. Migrant black redstarts arrive in Britain in October or November and either move on or remain to winter, returning eastward in March or April. They also winter on the south and east coasts of Ireland.

The species originally inhabited stony ground in mountains, particularly cliffs, but since about 1900 has expanded to include similar urban habitats including bombed areas during and after World War II, and large industrial complexes that have the bare areas and cliff-like buildings it favours; in Great Britain, most of the small breeding population nests in such industrial areas. It will catch passing insects in flight, and migrants often hunt in coastal tide-wrack for flies or tiny crustaceans. Its quick ducks of head and body are robin-like, and its tail is often flicked. The male has a rattling song and a &quot;tick&quot; call.

Eastern race birds are very rare vagrants in western Europe.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Black redstarts are usually monogamous. They start breeding in mid-April. The nest is built by the female and is typically placed in a crevice or hole in rock or a wall or on a ledge of a building. The nest consists of a loose cup of grass and stems and is lined with hair, wool and feathers. The eggs are laid daily. The clutch consists of 4 to 6 eggs that are usually white but can also be pale blue. On average they measure and weigh . Beginning after the final egg is laid, the eggs are incubated by the female for 13–17 days. The young are cared for and fed by both parents and fledge after 12–19 days.

<doc id="194504" wikidata="Q2702018" url="?curid=194504" title="Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester">
<text>Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, KG, KB, FRS (16025 May 1671) was an important commander of Parliamentary forces in the First English Civil War, and for a time Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s superior.

==Early life==
He was the eldest son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester by his first wife, Catherine Spencer, daughter of Sir William Spencer of Yarnton, Oxfordshire, England, was born in 1602, and was educated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (1618–1622).

==Career==
Montagu accompanied Prince Charles during his 1623 trip to Habsburg Spain in pursuit of the Spanish Match. He was Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire in the &quot;Happy Parliament&quot; of 1623–24, the &quot;Useless Parliament&quot; of 1625, and the Parliament of 1625–26. At the time of Charles I&#x27;s coronation in February 1626, he was made a Knight of the Bath to reward him for his service to Charles in Spain. In May, with help from George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, Montagu was elevated to the House of Lords, receiving his father&#x27;s barony of Kimbolton and being styled Viscount Mandeville as a courtesy title, since his father had been created Earl of Manchester in February when Parliament convened.

His first wife, who was related to the Duke of Buckingham, having died in 1625 after two years of marriage, Mandeville married in 1626 Anne Rich, daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick.

The influence of his father-in-law, who was afterwards admiral on the side of the parliament, drew Mandeville to the popular side in the questions in dispute with the crown, and at the beginning of the Long Parliament he was one of the recognised leaders of the popular party in the Upper House, his name being joined with those of the Five Members of the House of Commons impeached by the king in 1642. At the outbreak of the Civil War, having succeeded his father in the earldom in November 1642, Manchester commanded a regiment in the army of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, and in August 1643 he was appointed Major-General of the parliamentary forces in the eastern counties (the Eastern Association), with Cromwell as his second in command. Manchester developed cyphers to send coded messages to his allies. He soon appointed his provost-marshal, William Dowsing, as a paid iconoclast, touring the churches of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire destroying all &quot;Popish&quot; and &quot;superstitious&quot; imagery, as well as features such as altar-rails.

Having become a member of the Committee of Both Kingdoms in 1644, he was in supreme command at the Battle of Marston Moor but in the subsequent operations his lack of energy brought him into disagreement with Cromwell, and in November 1644 he strongly expressed his disapproval of continuing the war. Cromwell brought the shortcomings of Manchester before Parliament in the autumn of 1644 and in April the following year, anticipating the Self-denying Ordinance, Manchester resigned his command. He took a leading part in the frequent negotiations for an arrangement with Charles, was custodian with William Lenthall of the Great Seal from 1646 to 1648, and frequently presided in the House of Lords. He opposed the trial of the king, and retired from public life during the Commonwealth but after the Restoration, which he actively assisted, he was loaded with honours by Charles II. In 1660, he was nominated by the House of Lords to be one of the Commissioners for the Great Seal of England. In 1667 he was made a General, and he died on 5 May 1671. Manchester was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1661, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1667.

Men of such divergent sympathies as Baxter, Burnet and Clarendon agreed in describing Manchester as a lovable and virtuous man, who loved peace and moderation both in politics and religion.

==Personal life==
Lord Manchester was five times married, leaving children by two of his wives. He married firstly, Susannah Hill on 6 February 1623, at Theobalds. She was a daughter of John Hill of Honiton, Warwickshire, and Dorothy (née Beaumont) Hill (a daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield and sister of Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham). Through her aunt, Susannah was a first cousin of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. They had no children.

He married secondly, 1 July 1625, Lady Anne Rich, daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick and the former Frances Hatton (daughter and heiress of Sir William Newport, who later took the surname Hatton to inherit the estates of his uncle, Sir Christopher Hatton). Before her death on 16 February 1642, they were the parents of three children:

* Robert Montagu, 3rd Earl of Manchester (1634–1682), who married Anne Yelverton, the only daughter of Sir Christopher Yelverton, 1st Baronet.
* Lady Frances Montagu, who married Henry Saunderson.
* Lady Anne Montagu (d. 1689), who married as his second wife her second cousin Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Holland and future 5th Earl of Warwick. 

On 20 December 1642, ten months after the death of his second wife, he married her first cousin, Essex, Lady Bevill. She was the widow of Sir Thomas Bevil and a daughter of Sir Thomas Cheek and the former Lady Essex Rich (a daughter of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick). Before her death on 28 September 1658, they had a daughter:

* Lady Essex Montagu (d. 1677), who married Henry Ingram, 1st Viscount of Irvine in 1661.

In July 1659, Lord Manchester married Eleanor, Dowager Countess of Warwick, as his fourth wife. Eleanor, who had been his second wife&#x27;s stepmother, was a daughter of Sir Richard Wortley and sister of Sir Francis Wortley, 1st Baronet. At the time of their wedding, she had been thrice widowed, first from Sir Henry Lee, 1st Baronet, then Edward Radclyffe, 6th Earl of Sussex and, lastly, of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. The Earl and Countess Eleanor had no children together.

After his fourth wife&#x27;s death in 1666, Lord Manchester was married for a fifth, and final, time to Margaret, Dowager Countess of Carlisle on 31 July 1667. Margaret, a widow of James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle, was the third daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford and the Hon. Katharine Brydges (second daughter and co-heiress of Giles Brydges, 3rd Baron Chandos). She survived him and died in 1676.

==Film portrayal==
Manchester was portrayed by actor Robert Morley in the 1970 film &quot;Cromwell&quot;. He is inaccurately depicted sitting in the House of Commons in Cromwell&#x27;s presence although he had been a member of the Lords since 1626 - &amp; the actor (about 67/ 68 at the time) was considerably older than the historical Manchester, he being only 40 when the English Civil Wars began.

<text>Richard Baxter (12 November 1615 – 8 December 1691) was an English Nonconformist church leader and theologian from Rowton, Shropshire, who has been described as &quot;the chief of English Protestant Schoolmen&quot;. He made his reputation in the late 1630s by his ministry at Kidderminster in Worcestershire, when he also began a long and prolific career as theological writer.

Following the Act of Uniformity 1662, Baxter refused an appointment as Bishop of Hereford and was expelled from the Church of England. He became one of the most influential leaders of the Nonconformist movement, spending time in prison. His views remain controversial within the Calvinist tradition of Predestination because he taught that Christians are placed under a type of faith-law.

==Personal details==
Baxter was born on 12 November 1615 at Rowton, Shropshire, in the home of his maternal grandfather, and baptised at its then parish church at High Ercall, before moving in February 1626 to his parents&#x27; home in Eaton Constantine.

On 10 September 1662, Baxter married Margaret Charlton, who died in 1681.

==Early life==

Richard&#x27;s early education was poor, being mainly in the hands of the local clergy, themselves virtually illiterate. He was helped by John Owen, master of the free school at Wroxeter, where he studied from about 1629 to 1632, and made fair progress in Latin. On Owen&#x27;s advice he did not proceed to Oxford (a step which he afterwards regretted), but went to Ludlow Castle to read with Richard Wickstead, chaplain to the Council of Wales and the Marches.

He was reluctantly persuaded to go to court, and he went to London under the patronage of Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels, with the intention of doing so, but soon returned home, resolved to study divinity. He was confirmed in the decision by the death of his mother.

After three months spent working for the dying Owen as a teacher at Wroxeter, Baxter read theology with Francis Garbet, the local clergyman, adding to his reading (initially in devotional writings, of Richard Sibbes, William Perkins and Ezekiel Culverwell, as well as the Calvinist Edmund Bunny at age 14, and then in the scholastic philosophers) orthodox Church of England theology in Richard Hooker and George Downham, and arguments from conforming puritans in John Sprint and John Burges. In about 1634, he met Joseph Symonds (assistant to Thomas Gataker) and Walter Cradock, two Nonconformists.

==Early ministry, 1638–1660==
With the help of James Berry, who later became a colonel in the New Model Army, in 1638 Baxter became master of the free grammar school at Dudley. He commenced his ministry after being ordained by John Thornborough, Bishop of Worcester and was soon transferred to Bridgnorth, in Shropshire.

Baxter remained at Bridgnorth for nearly two years, during which time he took a special interest in the controversy relating to Nonconformity and the Church of England. He soon became alienated from the Church on several matters; and after the requirement of the &quot;et cetera oath&quot;, he rejected episcopacy in its English form. Although generally regarded as a Presbyterian, he was prepared to accept a modified Episcopalianism, but regarded all forms of church government as secondary to religious practice.

===Kidderminster===
One of the first measures of the Long Parliament was to reform the clergy; with this view, a committee was appointed to receive complaints against them. Among the complainants were the inhabitants of Kidderminster. The vicar George Dance agreed that he would give £60 a year, out of his income of £200, to a preacher who should be chosen by certain trustees. Baxter was invited to deliver a sermon before the people, and was unanimously elected as the minister of St Mary and All Saints&#x27; Church, Kidderminster. This happened in April 1641, when he was twenty-six.

His ministry continued, with many interruptions, for about 19 years; and during that time he accomplished many reforms in Kidderminster and the neighbourhood. He formed the ministers in the country around him into an association, uniting them irrespective of their differences as Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Independents. &quot;The Reformed Pastor&quot; was a book which Baxter published in relation to the general ministerial efforts he promoted.

===The English Civil War and Commonwealth===
When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, like many Baxter tried to avoid taking sides, but Worcestershire was a Royalist stronghold, and he was temporarily retired to the Parliamentarian town of Gloucester. He returned to Worcestershire late in 1642 only to be driven out again, and moved to Coventry, another Parliamentarian stronghold. There he found himself with no fewer than 30 fugitive ministers, among whom were Richard Vines, Anthony Burges, John Bryan and Obadiah Grew. He officiated each Sunday as chaplain to the garrison, preaching a sermon each to the soldiery, and the townspeople and strangers. Included among the congregants were Sir Richard Skeffington, Colonel Godfrey Bosvile, George Abbot the layman scholar, and others. After the Battle of Naseby he took the situation of chaplain to Colonel Edward Whalley&#x27;s regiment, and continued to hold it till February 1647. During these stormy years he wrote his &quot;Aphorisms of Justification&quot;, which on its appearance in 1649, excited great controversy. There were numerous critics Anthony Burges, John Crandon, William Eyre, George Lawson, John Tombes, Thomas Tully, and John Wallis, although Baxter was closest to Christopher Cartwright.

Baxter&#x27;s connexion with the Parliamentary army was a very characteristic one. He joined it that he might, if possible, contract the growth of sectaries in that field, and maintain the cause of constitutional government in opposition to republican tendencies of the time. He regretted that he had not previously accepted Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s offer to become chaplain to the Ironsides. Cromwell avoided him; but Baxter, having to preach before him after he had assumed the Protectorship, chose for his subject the old topic of the divisions of the church, and in subsequent interviews argued with him about liberty of conscience, and even defended the monarchy he had subverted. This contact with Cromwell occurred when Baxter was summoned to London to assist in settling &quot;the fundamentals of religion&quot;.

In 1647, Baxter was staying at the home of Lady Rouse, wife of Sir Thomas Rouse, 1st Baronet, of Rous Lench, Worcestershire. There, though debilitated by illness, he wrote the most of a major work, &quot;The Saints&#x27; Everlasting Rest&quot; (1650).

On his recovery he returned to Kidderminster, where he also became a prominent political leader. His sensitive conscience led him into conflict with almost all the contending parties in state and church. An all-day debate on 1 January 1650, with John Tombes at Bewdley was attended by about 1500 people on each side and ended in confused disorder.

During this period he campaigned for the establishment of a new university in Shrewsbury to serve Wales, utilising buildings that were then used by Shrewsbury School. Lack of funding prevented success, and the premises ultimately became Shrewsbury town library.

==Ministry following the Restoration, 1660–1691==
After the 1660 Stuart Restoration, Baxter moved to London, where he preached until the Act of Uniformity 1662 took effect. His hope that moderate dissenters like himself could remain within the Church of England proved ill-founded, after this objective was obstructed by those on both sides. The Savoy Conference resulted in Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Reformed Liturgy&quot;, though it was cast aside without consideration. Baxter continued to advocate for a comprehensive &quot;national church&quot;, off and on, until his death.

The same reputation which Baxter had obtained in the country he secured in London. The power of his preaching was universally felt, and his capacity for business placed him at the head of his party. He was made a Royal chaplain, and offered the Bishopric of Hereford, but could not accept the offer without conforming. After his refusal, he was not allowed, even before the passing of the Act of Uniformity, to be a curate in Kidderminster, and Bishop George Morley prohibited him from preaching in the Diocese of Worcester.

===Legal troubles===
From 1662 until the indulgence of 1687, Baxter&#x27;s life was constantly disturbed by persecution of one kind or another. He retired to Acton in Middlesex, for the purpose of quiet study, but was placed in prison for keeping a conventicle. Baxter procured a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the court of common pleas.

He was taken up for preaching in London after the licences granted in 1672 were recalled by the King. The meeting house which he had built for himself in Oxendon Street was closed to him after he had preached there only once.

In 1680, he was taken from his house; and though he was released that he might die at home, his books and goods were seized. In 1684, he was carried three times to the sessions house, being scarcely able to stand, and without any apparent cause was made to enter into a bond for £400 in security for his good behaviour.

But his worst encounter was with the Chief Justice, Sir George Jeffreys, in May 1685. He had been committed to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison on the charge of libelling the Church in his &quot;Paraphrase on the New Testament&quot;, and was tried before Jeffreys on this accusation. No authoritative report of the trial exists; if the partisan account on which tradition is based is accepted, Jeffreys was infuriated. Baxter was sentenced to pay 500 marks, to lie in prison till the money was paid, and to be bound to his good behaviour for seven years. Jeffreys is even said to have proposed he should be whipped behind a cart. Baxter was now approaching 70 years old, and remained in prison for 18 months, until the government, hoping to win his influence, remitted the fine and released him.

==Later writings and last years==
Baxter&#x27;s health had grown even worse, yet this was the period of his greatest activity as a writer. He wrote 168 or so separate works, including major treatises such as the &quot;Christian Directory&quot;, the &quot;Methodus Theologiae Christianae&quot;, and the &quot;Catholic Theology&quot;. His &quot;Breviate of the Life of Mrs Margaret Baxter&quot; records the virtues of his wife and tenderness which otherwise might not have been known. A slim devotional work published in 1658 under the title &quot;Call to the Unconverted to Turn and Live&quot; formed one of the core extra-biblical texts of evangelicalism until at least the middle of the 19th century.

The remainder of his life, from 1687 onwards, was passed peacefully. He died in London and his funeral was attended by churchmen as well as dissenters.

==Theology==
Richard Baxter rejected the idea of a limited atonement in favour of a universal atonement, which drew him into a long debate with Calvinist theologian John Owen. Interpreting the kingdom of God in terms of Christ as Christus Victor and Rector of all men, Baxter explained Christ&#x27;s death as an act of universal redemption (penal and vicarious, though substitutionary in explication), in virtue of which God has made a new covenant offering pardon and amnesty to the penitent. Repentance and faith, being obedient to this covenant, are the conditions of salvation.

Baxter insisted that the Calvinists of his day ran the danger of ignoring the conditions that came with God&#x27;s new covenant. Justification, Baxter insisted, required at least some degree of faith as the human response to the love of God.

Baxter&#x27;s theology was set forth most elaborately in his Latin &quot;Methodus Theologiæ Christianæ&quot; (London, 1681); the &quot;Christian Directory&quot; (1673) contains the practical part of his system; and &quot;Catholic Theology&quot; (1675) is an English exposition. His theology made Baxter very unpopular among his contemporaries and even into the next century caused a split among the Dissenters. As summarised by Thomas W. Jenkyn, it differed from the Calvinism on four points:
# The atonement of Christ did not consist in his suffering the identical but the equivalent punishment (i.e., one which would have the same effect in moral government) as that deserved by mankind because of offended law. Christ died for sins, not persons. The benefits of substitutionary atonement are accessible and available to all men for their salvation.
# The atonement is not limited to a select few, but is available to all who will believe in Christ.
# The righteousness that is imputed to the believer in the work of justification is not the righteousness of Christ, but is by virtue of the faith of the believer himself in Christ.
# Every sinner has a distinct agency of his own to exert in the process of his conversion, which is to believe in Christ.

==Legacy==
Richard Baxter is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 14 June.

===Literary legacy and mentions===
AG Matthews, in an article &quot;The Works of Richard Baxter: an Annotated List&quot; (Congregational Historical Society Transactions, XI (1932)) lists 141 books written by Baxter. Geoffrey Nuttall, in his biography of Baxter, published in 1965, reproduces this list, noting that one of the listed works, Fasciculus literarum (1680), was, in fact, written by John Hinckley.

In 1665, his works were translated into German by the Lutheran theologian, Johann Fischer.

In 1674, Baxter cast in a new form the substance of Arthur Dent&#x27;s book &quot;The Plain Man&#x27;s Pathway to Heaven&quot; under the title, &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Family Book&quot;. In this way, Arthur Dent of South Shoebury was a link between Baxter and another great Puritan, John Bunyan.

In 1679 Baxter made one of the very few known allusions to Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s discourse The Garden of Cyrus, critically declaring to newly ordained priests, &quot;You shall have more.. solid truth than those in their learned Network treatises&quot;.

Baxter&#x27;s influence in New England is referenced in the first chapter of the 19th century devotional work &quot;I Will Be A Lady – a book for girls&quot; by Mrs. Tuthill.

In George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Mill on the Floss&quot; Richard Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Saints Everlasting Rest&quot; is listed as one of aunt Glegg&#x27;s books.

A prodigious hymn-writer, he published among others, &#x27;He wants not friends that hath thy love&#x27;.

Max Weber (1864–1920), the German sociologist, made significant use of Baxter&#x27;s works in developing his thesis for &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1904, 1920). Weber takes advantage of Baxter&#x27;s notion that the production of wealth by itself gives glory to God, and is bad only insofar as it gives birth to idleness and &quot;living merrily without care.&quot; Weber quotes Baxter who wrote &quot;you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin.&quot;

Robert K. Merton (1910–2003), founder of the sociology of science and well known for the so-called Merton Thesis, also followed Weber in making use of Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Christian Directory&quot; as &quot;a typical presentation of the leading elements in the Puritan ethos.&quot;

In 2015, on the 400th anniversary of Richard Baxter&#x27;s birth an exhibition of the correspondence between Baxter and Katherine Gell was made. The letters were said to be the basis of a book of Baxter&#x27;s letters which was in preparation.

===Monuments===
Baxter&#x27;s House in Bridgnorth is still standing near the High Street with a name plaque on the front.

The &quot;Richard Baxter Monument&quot; in the civic parish of Wolverley and Cookley (neighbouring Kidderminster) was built around 1850 in memory of Baxter. It is a Grade II listed structure and resides on a hilltop on Blakeshall Common. This tribute of general esteem was erected nearly two centuries after Baxter&#x27;s death, sculpted by Sir Thomas Brock and unveiled 28 July 1875. Originally in the Bull Ring, it was moved to its present site outside St Mary&#x27;s parish church in March 1967.

The &quot;Baxter Monument&quot; in Rowton, Shropshire (the village of his birth) is a squat stone obelisk with a bronze plaque on which is written &quot;Richard Baxter great divine author and eminent citizen of the 17th century. Son of Richard Baxter and Beatrice née Adney born here in Rowton AD 1615. Died in London 1691&quot;. It resides on a triangle of grass at the centre of the village and is probably of late 19th century construction. It was designated a Grade II listed structure in 1983.
There is a portrait of Baxter in Dr Williams&#x27;s Library, Gordon Square, London.

Baxter House, a boarding house at Old Swinford Hospital school in Stourbridge, is named after him. In Kidderminster, Baxter College (formerly Harry Cheshire High School), and a public park, Baxter Gardens, are both named after him.

** Encyclopædia Britannica&#x27;s most useful source was Baxter&#x27;s autobiography, called &quot;Reliquiae Baxterianae&quot; or Mr Richard Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of the most memorable Passages of his Life and Times&quot; (published by Matthew Sylvester in 1696). Edmund Calamy the Younger abridged this work (1702). The abridgment forms the first volume of the account of the ejected ministers; the reply to the accusations which had been brought against Baxter is found in the second volume of Calamy&#x27;s &quot;Continuation&quot;. William Orme&#x27;s &quot;Life and Times of Richard Baxter&quot; appeared in 2 vols. in 1830; it also forms the first volume of &quot;Practical Works&quot; (1830, reprinted 1868). Sir James Stephen&#x27;s paper on Baxter, contributed originally to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, is reprinted in the second volume of his &quot;Essays&quot;. Estimates of Baxter were given by John Tulloch in his &quot;English Puritanism and Its Leaders&quot;, and by Dean Stanley in his address at the inauguration of the statue to Baxter at Kidderminster (see &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, xxxii. 385).

<text>Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish (30 November 1836 – 6 May 1882) was an English Liberal politician and &quot;protégé&quot; of the Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone. Cavendish was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in May 1882 but was killed along with Thomas Henry Burke in what came to be known as the Phoenix Park Murders only hours after his arrival in Dublin, a victim of the Irish National Invincibles organisation.

==Background and education==
Born at Compton Place, Eastbourne, Sussex, Cavendish was the second son of the 7th Duke of Devonshire by his wife, Lady Blanche Howard, fourth daughter of the 6th Earl of Carlisle, and the brother of the Marquess of Hartington, later 8th Duke of Devonshire, who had also been Chief Secretary for Ireland. Cavendish, after being educated at home, matriculated in 1855 at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1858, and then served as a cornet with the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry cavalry.

==Political career==

From 1859 to 1864, Cavendish was private secretary to Lord Granville. He travelled in the United States during 1859 and 1860, and in Spain in 1860. He was elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal for the Northern Division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, 15 July 1865, and retained that office until his death. After serving as private secretary to the prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone, from July 1872 to August 1873 he became a junior Lord of the Treasury, and held office until the resignation of the ministry. He was Financial Secretary to the Treasury from April 1880 to May 1882, when soon after the resignation of William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was appointed to succeed him.

==Death==
In company with the 5th Earl Spencer, the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, he proceeded to Dublin, and took the oath as Chief Secretary at Dublin Castle, on 6 May 1882; but on the afternoon of the same day, while walking in the Phoenix Park in company with Thomas Henry Burke, the Permanent Under-Secretary, he was assassinated by members of the militant Irish nationalist splinter group known as the Irish National Invincibles. Using scalpels and surgical blades, the participants stabbed Lord Frederick and Burke multiple times from behind in an incident that came to be known as the Phoenix Park killings. 

===Burial===
His remains were returned to England and buried in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Edensor, near Chatsworth, on 11 May, where 300 members of the House of Commons and 30,000 other persons followed to the side of the grave. 

===Trial===
The trial of the murderers in 1883 (see James Carey) made it evident that the death of Cavendish was not premeditated, and that he was not recognised by the assassins; the plot was against Burke, and Cavendish was murdered because he happened to be in the company of Burke.

==Family==
Cavendish married, on 7 June 1864, Lucy Caroline Lyttelton, second daughter of the 4th Baron Lyttelton, granddaughter of Sir Stephen Glynne and niece of William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s wife Catherine. She was a maid of honour to the Queen.

A statue of Cavendish can be found in the plaza behind the town hall in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria (formerly and historically in Lancashire), where his father invested heavily in local industries. A window in memory of Cavendish was placed in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, at the cost of the members of the House of Commons. His imposing white Carrara marble tomb can be seen in Cartmel Priory, Cumbria. Cavendish was a council member of Yorkshire College, Leeds, which after his death established the Cavendish Chair of Physics. There is also a memorial fountain to him at Bolton Abbey.

<text>Edward Whalley (c. 1607 – c. 1675) was an English military leader during the English Civil War and was one of the regicides who signed the death warrant of King Charles I of England.

==Early career==
The exact dates of his birth and death are unknown. He was the second son of Richard Whalley, who had been High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1595, by his second wife Frances Cromwell, an aunt of Oliver Cromwell. His great-grandfather was Richard Whalley (1499–1583), a prominent adherent of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, and a Member of Parliament. Edward Whalley is said to have started out as a woollen-draper. During the 1620s and 1630s, he was a farmer in Chadwell St. Mary, Essex, but this farming venture proved unsuccessful. In 1639, Whalley was forced to flee to Scotland to escape from his creditors leaving his wife behind him. On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he took up arms for Parliament, and James Temple obtained a position for him as a cornet in the cavalry troop commanded by Temple&#x27;s cousin, John Fiennes (the son of his uncle, Viscount Saye and Sele). He fought at the Battle of Edgehill and later became major of Cromwell&#x27;s regiment of horse. He distinguished himself in the field, and his conduct at Gainsborough in 1643 was especially praised by Cromwell. He fought at the Battle of Marston Moor, commanded one of Cromwell&#x27;s two regiments of cavalry at the Battle of Naseby and at the capture of Bristol, was then sent into Oxfordshire, took Banbury, and was besieging Worcester when he was superseded, according to Richard Baxter, the chaplain of his regiment, because of his religious orthodoxy.

==Regimental officer==

He supported his regiment in their grievances against Parliament in 1647. When the king was seized by the army, he was entrusted to the keeping of Charles I and his regiment at Hampton Court Palace. Whalley refused to remove Charles&#x27;s chaplains and treated his captive with courtesy, so much so that Charles later wrote him a letter of thanks. In the Second English Civil War, Whalley again distinguished himself as a soldier. He was chosen to be a Commissioner (judge) at the trial of Charles I and was the fourth to sign the king&#x27;s death-warrant, immediately after Cromwell. The King was executed in London on 30 January 1649. 

In April 1649, soldiers in his regiment took part in the Bishopsgate Mutiny. They refused to go on the Irish Expedition until the Levellers&#x27; political demands were met, and they received back pay. They were ordered out of London, and when they refused to go, fifteen soldiers were arrested and court-martialled, of whom six were sentenced to death. Of this six, five were subsequently pardoned while Robert Lockyer, a former Levellers agitator, was shot.

Whalley took part in Cromwell&#x27;s Scottish Expedition, was wounded at the Battle of Dunbar, and in the autumn of 1650, was active in dealing with the situation in the north. The following year, he took part in Cromwell&#x27;s pursuit of Charles II and fought in the Battle of Worcester. He followed and supported Cromwell in his political career, presented the army petition to parliament (August 1652), approved of the protectorate, and represented Nottinghamshire in the parliaments of 1654 and 1656, taking an active part in the prosecution of the Quaker James Naylor. He was one of the administrative major-generals, responsible for Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Warwick, and Leicester. He supported the &quot;Petition and Advice,&quot; except as regards the proposed assumption of the royal title by Oliver Cromwell, and became a member of the newly constituted House of Lords in December 1657.

On Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death, at which he was present, he in vain gave his support to Richard Cromwell. His regiment refused to obey his orders, and the Long Parliament dismissed him from his command as a representative of the army. In November 1659, he undertook an unsuccessful mission to Scotland to arrange terms with George Monck.

==Withdrawal to the colonies==

At the Restoration, Whalley, with his son-in-law, Major-General William Goffe, escaped to North America, and landed at Boston on 27 July 1660, where they were well received by Governor John Endecott and visited by the principal persons of the town. They went about quite openly, and chose to live in Cambridge, about from Boston. During this period, the English Parliament was debating the content of the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. Intelligence reached the colony that all but seven of the regicides would be pardoned. Knowledge of final contents of the Act did not reach the colony until November 1660, and for several months opinion among the leaders of the colony on what to do with Whalley and Goffe was divided.

By February 1661, the Governor seems to have had second thoughts about welcoming the regicides so warmly, and on the 22nd, summoned a court of assistants to discuss their arrest, but the court did not agree to such action. Whalley and Goffe decided they were no longer safe in Cambridge and left on 26 February. Within a few days (on 8 March), orders arrived, via Barbados, from England, for their arrest. Daniel Fisher and his sister Lydia helped to hide Goffe and Whalley.

The two moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where John Dixwell, also condemned as a regicide, was living under the assumed name of James Davids. Arriving on 7 March 1661, they lodged with John Davenport, the local minister. News of the orders for their arrest arrived in New Haven, so Whalley and Goffe used a subterfuge to throw off any pursuit. They made a show of leaving and going to Milford, where they made sure they were seen, but that night they returned in secret to New Haven. They again lodged secretly with Davenport and a number of other sympathizers until 13 May, when they resorted to hiding in some woodland and a cave on Providence Hill (spending some nights in a nearby house). Providence Hill is now known as West Rock, and today the cave is called Judges Cave. In August they moved into a house in Milford belonging to a Mr. Tomkins, another sympathizer, and remained there for two years. In 1664 they were forced to return to the cave when the King&#x27;s commissioners arrived in Boston, but Native Americans revealed the cave while the two were absent, which forced them to move further away from Boston. On 13 October, travelling only by night, they set off for Hadley, about one hundred miles away to the north in western Massachusetts, where the minister, John Russell, had arranged for them to live with him. They remained there undiscovered for fifteen or sixteen years, receiving money from their wives in England and presents from a few supporters who knew where they were in order to pay their host for their support. In the first few years, they were in constant fear of discovery and were much relieved to read in the newspapers that they were thought to have died in Switzerland while living in exile with other regicides. Every attempt by the English government to procure Whalley or Goffe&#x27;s arrest failed. Whalley was alive but in poor health in 1674 and probably did not live long afterwards.

==Family==
Whalley married first on 7 February 1626 at St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church, Stepney, to Judith Duffell (or Duffield) of Rochester, Kent, by whom, besides other children, he had a son John and a daughter, Frances (who married William Goffe, another regicide). His second marriage was to Mary Middleton, sister of Sir George Middleton, by whom he had two sons, Henry and Edward.

==Legacy==
Whalley was commemorated with a New Haven street named for him as were the other two Regicides who found refuge in New Haven: Whalley Avenue, Dixwell Avenue, and Goffe Street diverge from a complex of intersections lying at the northwest end of Broadway. Hadley also has two parallel streets named after Goffe and Whalley, as well as a memorial stone at the former site of John Russell&#x27;s home.

==Popular culture==

Whalley and Goffe appear as the protagonists of British author Robert Harris’s 2022 novel &quot;Act of Oblivion&quot;, which depicts their flight across New England.

<text>Eastwood Lane (May 22, 1879 – January 22, 1951) was an American composer who wrote piano suites and ballet music. His compositions influenced Bix Beiderbecke.

Eastwood Lane was born in Brewerton, New York.

==Compositions for piano ==
* The suite &quot;In Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1913), containing the pieces 
** In Sleepy Hollow 
** On Tappan Zee (A Boat Song)
** Mid-October Afternoon (Reverie) 
** Katrina&#x27;s Waltz
* &quot;Five American Dances&quot; (1919)
* &quot;Adirondack Sketches&quot; (1922), containing the following pieces. Descriptions are from the original sheet music. 
** The Old Guide&#x27;s Story: &quot;Adirondack Guides are proverbially reticent, but theirs is an eloquent silence. At the end of a hard day&#x27;s fishing or hunting when pipes are lit, and sparks from the campfire dart aloft, circling, through the spruce tops like a myriad of fireflies, this silence, if one is patient, will be broken by marvelous tales of adventure in the Big Woods.&quot;
** The Legend of Lonesome Lake: &quot;Deep and dark, with its mirror surface reflecting the conifers on its precipitous shores, Lonesome Lake seems appropriately named. The story goes that a woman who was camping nearby mistaking the cry of a loon for that of a child in distress, followed it through the darkness and plunged over a cliff to death in the lake.&quot;
** Down Stream: &quot;Depicting a little Adirondack stream — now rippling over the shallows, now broadening into deeper, quieter pools, wherein is reflected a moon of carnival immensity, lurking behind the inverted hemlock tops.&quot;
** The Land of the Loon (A Camp-Fire Story): &quot;All lovers of the Adirondacks will recall their first impression of this beautiful bird, its eerie, mournful cry and almost insane laughter. The Indians and the guides regard the loon with superstitious awe; they believe that to injure or kill one means certain misfortune, and many are the stories told of the evil which befell those who were rash enough to harm one.&quot;
** A Dirge for Jo Indian: &quot;Jo Indian was a famous Adirondack Indian who lived and hunted in the vicinity of the mountain bearing his name. Like Chingachgook, Cooper&#x27;s marvelous embodiment of all that is best in the native North American, Jo Indian met his death in a forest fire.&quot; 
** Lumber-Jack Dance: &quot;After a supper in the cook&#x27;s shack such as Paul Bunion, that mythical but mighty figure of Lumber-Jack lore, might have eaten, Pierre tunes up his fiddle. His swaying body and time-thumping boot are irresistible, and soon forgetting the intense cold and toil of the long day, each hardy woodman is pounding the rough floor with his spiked boots suiting his steps and capers of his personal taste and intense need of rhythmical gratification.&quot;
* &quot;Mongoliana&quot; (1922)
* &quot;Eastern Seas&quot; (1925)
* &quot;Sold Down the River&quot; (1928)
* &quot;Pantomimes&quot; (1933)
* &quot;Fourth of July&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Here Are Ladies&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Jesuit&#x27;s Journey&quot; (1947)
* &quot;Central Park&quot;
* &quot;Colonial Suite&quot;
* &quot;Flower of Old Japan&quot;
* &quot;Knee-High to a Grasshopper&quot; 
Three of his pieces, &quot;Sea Burial&quot;, &quot;Persimmon Pucker&quot;, and &quot;Minuet for Betty Schuyler&quot;, were arranged by Ferde Grofe for the orchestra of Paul Whiteman.

<doc id="194517" wikidata="Q547865" url="?curid=194517" title="William Goffe">
<text>William Goffe, 1613/1618 - 1679/1680, was a religious radical from London who fought for Parliament during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Nicknamed “Praying William” by contemporaries, he approved the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, but escaped prosecution as a regicide by fleeing to the New England Colonies.

Goffe held several senior military and political positions under the Commonwealth, including administrator of Berkshire, Sussex and Hampshire during the Rule of the Major-Generals from 1655 to 1657. A close associate of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he was distantly related by marriage, he lost most of his political influence after Richard Cromwell resigned as Lord Protector in April 1659.

Shortly before the Stuart Restoration in May 1660, Goffe sailed for Boston with his father-in-law and fellow regicide General Edward Whalley. Sheltered by Puritan sympathisers in New England, little is known for certain of his life there. It was once suggested he was the Angel of Hadley, a figure who in 1675 allegedly helped repulse an attack by Native Americans, but this is disputed on various grounds. He died sometime after April 1679, the date of his last known letter to his wife, and is thought to have been buried in Hadley, Massachusetts.

==Personal details==

William Goffe was the fourth of five sons born to The Reverend Stephen Goffe (1575–after 1628), and his wife Deborah (1587–1626). The precise date and location of his birth are uncertain; his father was rector of Bramber, Sussex, but lost this position in 1607 for his part in organising a Puritan petition to James I.

His eldest brother Stephen (1605–1681), was baptised in the nearby village of Stanmer, while his mother was buried there in 1626, so Sussex seems most likely. William was probably born between 1613 and 1618, since he became an apprentice in 1634, the maximum age for which was 21, and admitted to the Worshipful Company of Grocers as a freeman in 1642, the minimum age being 24.

The two elder sons, Stephen and John, attended Merton College, Oxford, and followed their father as priests in the Church of England, but took different paths from their younger brother. Stephen acted as a Royalist agent in Europe during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1654. John was removed from his living in Hackington, Kent, for refusing to subscribe to the Presbyterian-inspired 1643 Solemn League and Covenant. His other brothers were also London merchants; James (1611–1656), became a member of the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers, while Timothy (1626-after 1649), was reportedly a Ship chandler.

Sometime around 1650, Goffe married Frances Whalley (1635–1684?), daughter of General Edward Whalley, a cousin of Oliver Cromwell; they had three daughters, Anne, Elizabeth, and Frances.

==Wars of the Three Kingdoms==

In 1634, Goffe was contracted as an Apprentice to William Vaughan, a Presbyterian London drysalter, and member of the Company of Grocers. In early 1642, he was briefly imprisoned for organising a petition demanding that control of the London Trained Bands be transferred from Charles I to Parliament. The First English Civil War began in August, and by July 1643 Goffe was serving as a captain in an infantry regiment led by Colonel Harry Barclay, a Scottish veteran of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Raised in autumn 1642 to reinforce the Parliamentarian field army commanded by the Earl of Essex, in 1643 this unit helped lift the Siege of Gloucester and fought at the First Battle of Newbury. During the 1644 Western Campaign, it was among the 5,000 troops forced to surrender at Lostwithiel in August, but released in time for the Second Battle of Newbury in September. 

Along with his regiment, Goffe transferred to the New Model Army in April 1645, with Edward Harley taking over from Barclay as colonel. Over the next year, this formation served in numerous actions, including the battles of Naseby, Langport and Torrington, as well as the sieges of Bridgwater, Bristol, Berkeley Castle and Exeter. The surrender of Oxford in June 1646 brought the First Civil War to a close, with the exception of a few isolated Royalist garrisons that held out until 1647.

However, victory resulted in increasingly bitter disputes over the post-war political settlement between radicals within the New Model like Cromwell, and moderate MPs in Parliament, the most prominent being Denzil Holles. In July 1647, Goffe was part of a military deputation which demanded Parliament suspend eleven MPs identified as key opponents of the army. As well as Holles, they included Harley, who was replaced as colonel by Thomas Pride, with Goffe promoted to major. 

Like fellow New Model officers such as Generals Thomas Harrison and Robert Overton, both members of the Christian millennialist sect known as the Fifth Monarchists, Goffe was convinced the Second Coming was imminent. This belief influenced his interventions in the Putney Debates, held in late 1647 to reconcile competing demands from different army factions on the details of the peace settlement. Goffe argued Charles I should be put on trial, and suggested those in favour of continuing negotiations with him were preventing the return of Jesus Christ by &quot;thwarting God&#x27;s will&quot;. Since these discussions were being led by Cromwell, who strongly believed all his actions were directed by God, he demanded an apology from Goffe for what he considered a personal insult.

When the Second English Civil War broke out in 1648, Goffe&#x27;s regiment was part of the force which put down the rising in South Wales, including the recapture of Pembroke Castle in April. This was followed by the defeat of the Scottish Engager army at Preston in August, which effectively ended the rebellion. Now a Lieutenant Colonel, Goffe and others argued the renewed fighting was &quot;God&#x27;s punishment&quot; for failing to bring the king to &quot;justice&quot;, a viewpoint which had been adopted by Cromwell. In December 1648, Pride&#x27;s Purge excluded MPs who opposed doing so, and the reduced body known as the Rump Parliament accordingly voted to put Charles on trial. Goffe was one of the fifty-nine judges who approved his execution in January 1649. His Royalist brother Stephen, then serving as chaplain to the exiled Stuart court in The Hague, was chosen to inform Charles II of his father&#x27;s death. 

Although Charles was king of both Scotland and England, the Scottish government was not consulted. In 1650, they responded by crowning his son king of Scotland, and agreeing to restore him to the English throne, leading to the Anglo-Scottish War. Goffe commanded Cromwell&#x27;s own infantry regiment at Dunbar in September 1650, and was subsequently promoted its colonel, then fought at Worcester a year later, two victories that ended the war. Charles II escaped to the Dutch Republic, but defeat resulted in Scotland being incorporated into the Commonwealth of England in 1653, and confirmed Cromwell&#x27;s position as leader of the new republic.

==The Interregnum==
Rewarded for his service with grants of former Crown lands in Hertfordshire, Goffe backed the dismissal of the Rump in April 1653, and its replacement with a nominated body known as Barebone&#x27;s Parliament. However, he supported Parliament&#x27;s dissolution in December 1653, and Cromwell&#x27;s subsequent appointment as Lord Protector. These actions marked his break with former New Model colleagues, both Fifth Monarchist sympathisers like Thomas Harrison, and republicans such as Edmund Ludlow. Goffe became one of The Protectorate&#x27;s most loyal supporters, and was elected MP for Great Yarmouth in the 1654 First Protectorate Parliament.

In early 1655, he helped suppress the pro-Royalist Penruddock uprising, and was promoted major general in October 1655; during the Rule of the Major-Generals, he served as administrator for the region composed of Berkshire, Sussex, and Hampshire. The regime proved both unpopular and expensive, and when elections for a new Parliament were held in September 1656, Goffe was returned as MP for Hampshire. This failed to resolve disputes over the constitutional settlement; one solution was to make Cromwell king, an offer he ultimately refused. Whether Goffe actively supported the idea, or simply accepted it, is unclear. 

The new constitution included a second chamber for the first time since the abolition of the House of Lords in 1649. Known as Cromwell&#x27;s Other House, it included 63 nominated individuals, including Goffe. However, only 42 of the 63 accepted, while Parliament was determined to kill the Other House at birth. As a result, it was dissolved in February 1658 without anything other than a preliminary meeting. When Cromwell died in September, Goffe transferred allegiance to his son and successor as Lord Protector, Richard Cromwell, whose inability to control either Parliament or the New Model led to his resignation in May 1659. This ended Goffe&#x27;s period of influence, although during their struggle with the re-installed Rump Parliament, the military-backed Committee of Safety made him part of a four-man delegation sent in November to seek support from George Monck, military governor in Scotland. This proved unsuccessful.

==Exile and death==

In negotiations leading up to the 1660 Stuart Restoration, a general pardon was agreed for all &quot;crimes&quot; committed since 1642, with certain exceptions, including the regicides. Aware that they faced prosecution and probable execution, Goffe and his father-in-law Edward Whalley sailed for Boston, Massachusetts on 13 May 1660, one day before warrants were issued for their arrest. Arriving on 27 July, one writer has claimed &quot;they were the most prominent public officials from the Mother country ever to land in New England&quot;. They initially lived openly in Cambridge, where they stayed with Daniel Gookin, a prominent member of the colonial administration.

However, at the end of November it was confirmed that they had been excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act passed by Parliament in August, making it impolitic for the Massachusetts authorities to openly protect them. In March 1661, the two fugitives moved on to New Haven, Connecticut, where they were later joined by another regicide, John Dixwell. Here they were housed by the local Puritan minister, John Davenport, before Royalist agents arrived in May seeking to arrest them. Forewarned by local sympathisers, Goffe and Whalley evaded their pursuers by hiding in Judges&#x27; Cave, where they spent most of the next few years.

In 1664, fresh efforts to arrest Whalley and Goffe meant they relocated to Hadley, Massachusetts, where they were sheltered by John Russell. Thereafter, very little is known for certain of their life, although Goffe&#x27;s letters to his wife Frances make it clear he retained his religious and political convictions. Based on these letters and papers discovered a century later, he and Whalley built up a small trading business, and were prosperous enough for Goffe to tell Frances not to send any more money. Whalley died sometime between 1674 and 1675.

In the 19th century, Goffe was suggested as a candidate for being the Angel of Hadley, who in 1675 supposedly helped repulse an attack on the town by Native Americans. However, whether this incident even took place remains disputed, let alone Goffe&#x27;s involvement. In 1676, he reportedly left Hadley for Hartford, Connecticut; his last letter to Frances is dated April 1679, and he probably died shortly thereafter. He is thought to have been buried next to his father-in-law in an unmarked grave at Hadley.

==Legacy==

Various towns in New England have streets commemorating Dixwell, Whalley and Goffe, including Hadley and New Haven. Goffe and Whalley are protagonists in British author Robert Harris’s 2022 novel &quot;Act of Oblivion&quot;, which depicts their flight across New England.

<text>Metal Health is the third studio album by the American heavy metal band Quiet Riot, released on February 28, 1983. The album spawned two hit singles: the Slade cover &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; and &quot;Metal Health&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first album to receive a worldwide release, as the first two were released only in Japan.

&quot;Metal Health&quot; was the first heavy metal album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, replacing The Police&#x27;s &quot;Synchronicity&quot; at number one in November 1983. Due to its commercial success, &quot;Metal Health&quot; is regarded by some as the catalyst that opened the door for hair metal&#x27;s immense popularity throughout the next several years. The album went on to sell more than ten million copies worldwide and over six million in the U.S. alone, being certified six-times platinum by the RIAA.

==Overview==
The band parted ways with bassist Chuck Wright early in the recording process, and replacement Gary Van Dyke was not working out. Vocalist Kevin DuBrow asked the band&#x27;s former bassist Rudy Sarzo to take part in the recording of &quot;Thunderbird&quot;, a song written as a tribute to the band&#x27;s founder Randy Rhoads, who died in a 1982 plane crash. While DuBrow began writing the song while Rhoads was still alive, it wasn&#x27;t completed until after the guitarist&#x27;s death. The partnership was quite fruitful and Sarzo ended up recording several songs with the band, and he ultimately left his spot with Ozzy Osbourne to re-join Quiet Riot as a permanent member.

In support of the album, Quiet Riot opened for Black Sabbath on their Born Again Tour in the US. They also managed to secure a spot at the 1983 US Festival alongside established acts such as Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest. Prior to Quiet Riot&#x27;s US Festival performance, Sarzo was punched in the face backstage by a drunken Osbourne, still bitter over the bassist leaving him to rejoin Quiet Riot several months prior.

Due to the band&#x27;s subsequent failure to match &quot;Metal Health&quot;&#x27;s commercial success, Quiet Riot has at times been referred to as &quot;one-hit wonders&quot;. This is not correct, however, as the band had two songs reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 on the Hot 100, in addition to a subsequent album being certified Platinum by the RIAA for over one million album sales. The title track was ranked No. 35 on VH1&#x27;s 40 Greatest Metal Songs. &quot;Slick Black Cadillac&quot; is a re-recording of a song that appeared on the band&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Quiet Riot II&quot;.

==Artwork==
The album cover art was designed by Stan Watts, who had previously designed the covers for The Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;Best of The Doobies Volume II&quot; (1981), Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Live Evil&quot; (1982) and Martin Briley&#x27;s &quot;One Night with a Stranger&quot; (1983), as well as the poster for the film &quot;The Howling&quot; (1981). Frankie Banali later stated that Quiet Riot had wanted to create an icon for the band, and that Sarzo had suggested something akin to Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1847). While many thought the masked cover model was DuBrow, it was actually Watts himself, whose wife took the photo of him, which he then airbrushed for a &quot;dramatic, high-contrast look&quot;. The mask became so popular that DuBrow wore a similar one on the cover of the band&#x27;s follow-up album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Condition Critical&quot;.

<text>Eddie Lang (born Salvatore Massaro; October 25, 1902 – March 26, 1933) was an American musician who is credited as the father of jazz guitar. During the 1920s, he gave the guitar a prominence it previously lacked as a solo instrument, as part of a band or orchestra, and as accompaniment for vocalists. He recorded duets with guitarists Lonnie Johnson and Carl Kress and jazz violinist Joe Venuti, and played rhythm guitar in the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and was the favoured accompanist of Bing Crosby.

==Biography==
The son of an Italian-American instrument maker, Lang was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up as friends with violinist Joe Venuti. His first instrument was violin when he was seven. He performed on violin in 1917 and became a member of a trio. In 1920, he dropped the violin for banjo and worked with Charlie Kerr, then Bert Estlow, Vic D&#x27;Ippolito, and Billy Lustig&#x27;s Scranton Siren Orchestra. A few years later, he traded the banjo for guitar when he became a member of Red McKenzie&#x27;s Mound City Blue Blowers. He recorded one of the first guitar solos in 1924 on &quot;Deep 2nd Street Blues&quot;. His performances with McKenzie&#x27;s band drew attention, and he found many jobs as a freelance guitarist. Before him, the guitar hadn&#x27;t been a prominent instrument in jazz bands and dance orchestras, playing primarily a rhythm part.

Lang and Joe Venuti recorded with Roger Wolfe Kahn and Jean Goldkette and performed with the Adrian Rollini Orchestra. Lang recorded with blues guitarist Lonnie Johnson under the name Blind Willie Dunn to hide his race and as a tribute to blues guitarist Blind Lemon Jefferson. He also worked with Frankie Trumbauer, Hoagy Carmichael, Annette Hanshaw, Red Nichols, Jack Pettis, Bessie Smith, and Clarence Williams.

===Friendship with Bing Crosby===
In 1929, Lang and Venuti became members of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, and again Lang made an impact. Whiteman was impressed by his ability to learn songs quickly, though Lang had little education and could not read music. During the same year, vocalist Bing Crosby made his first solo recordings. His guitarist was Snoozer Quinn, but for the second session he invited Lang. Their friendship grew when Crosby joined the Whiteman Orchestra on its trip west to Hollywood to make the movie &quot;King of Jazz&quot; in which Lang and Venuti appeared. In 1930, when Crosby was looking for a job in radio, he insisted on having Lang as his accompaniment. Aside from his friendship with Crosby, he had experience accompanying vocalists, such as Rube Bloom and Ruth Etting. When Crosby toured soon after, Lang sat on a stool next to him to share the microphone. Lang&#x27;s wife Kitty, a Ziegfeld girl, was friends with Crosby&#x27;s wife, Dixie. He became a regular in Crosby&#x27;s orchestra in 1932, the same year he appeared in the movie &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932).

==Death==
Lang suffered from occasional laryngitis, chronic sore throat, and digestion problems. After a doctor recommended a tonsillectomy, Crosby urged Lang to have the operation. Assured that the operation was routine, Lang entered Park West Hospital in Manhattan, but he never awoke from the surgery. He died at the age of thirty in 1933. The cause of his death is uncertain. Lang is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.

==Influence==

Lang, along with New Orleans born Lonnie Johnson, were among the first single-string guitar soloists. He played the melody on one string while adding occasional chords. He demonstrated that the guitar could be a solo instrument in addition to being an accompaniment.

While most bands of the time had a banjo player, Lang was skilled enough to make his acoustic guitar heard against the other instruments by using heavy gauge strings and a high action. He was so influential that, according to George Van Eps, banjo players had no choice but to switch to guitar.

George Harrison once cited Lang as one of his favourite guitarists.

Lang played Gibson L-4 and L-5 guitars.

==Honors==
In 1977, Lang&#x27;s recording of &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; with Frankie Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and in 2006 was placed on the U.S. Library of Congress National Recording Registry. He was inducted into the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame (1986) and the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame (2010).

On October 23, 2016, Philadelphia&#x27;s Mural Arts organization dedicated the mural &quot;Eddie Lang: The Father of Jazz Guitar&quot;, by artist Jared Bader. The mural stands by Lang&#x27;s childhood home and the James Campbell School that stood at 8th and Fitzwater where Lang learned to play. The mural was championed by area guitarist Richard Barnes, who started &quot;Eddie Lang Day in Philadelphia&quot; in 2010, an annual charity event.

==Compositions==
Lang&#x27;s compositions, based on the Red Hot Jazz database, include &quot;Wild Cat&quot; with Joe Venuti, &quot;Perfect&quot; with Frank Signorelli, &quot;April Kisses&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Melody Man&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; Places&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue Bottom&quot;, &quot;Bull Frog Moan&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Dreams&quot;, &quot;Feelin&#x27; My Way&quot;, &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Twister&quot;, &quot;Really Blue&quot;, &quot;Penn Beach Blues&quot;, &quot;Wild Dog&quot;, &quot;Pretty Trix&quot;, &quot;A Mug of Ale&quot;, &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot;, &quot;Beating the Dog&quot;, &quot;To To Blues&quot;, &quot;Running Ragged&quot;, &quot;Kicking the Cat&quot;, &quot;Cheese and Crackers&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; Things&quot;, &quot;Blue Guitars&quot;, &quot;Guitar Blues&quot; with Lonnie Johnson, &quot;Hot Fingers&quot;, &quot;Have to Change Keys to Play These Blues&quot;, &quot;A Handful of Riffs&quot;, &quot;Blue Room&quot;, &quot;Deep Minor Rhythm Stomp&quot;, &quot;Two-Tone Stomp&quot;. &quot;Midnight Call Blues&quot;, &quot;Four String Joe&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, and &quot;Pickin&#x27; My Way&quot; with Carl Kress.

<doc id="194531" wikidata="Q1752767" url="?curid=194531" title="Head over Heels (Cocteau Twins album)">
<text>Head over Heels is the second studio album by Scottish alternative rock band Cocteau Twins. The album was released on 24 October 1983 through the label 4AD. It featured the band&#x27;s signature sound of &quot;Guthrie&#x27;s lush guitars under Fraser&#x27;s mostly wordless vocals&quot; and is considered an archetype of early ethereal wave music.

==Background==
Following their 1982 debut album &quot;Garlands&quot;, two EP&#x27;s and a European tour supporting Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Cocteau Twins parted ways with bassist and founder member Will Heggie in mid-1983, leaving Robin Guthrie and Elizabeth Fraser unsure how they would continue. They returned to Scotland to write new songs as a duo and record a new album. Most of the album was written in the studio over a short period of time, Guthrie explained the process as &quot;little of it was really planned, the songs just came together very naturally.&quot;

==Content==
Robin Guthrie described the songs on the album as love songs, explaining: &quot;Whereas &quot;Garlands&quot; contained a lot of &#x27;religious&#x27; imagery (Liz&#x27;s own impressions) the new LP is more concerned with love imagery.&quot; Writing for ZigZag, Jonh Wilde wrote that &quot;Head over Heels&quot; &quot;finds the two remaining Twins willing to explore their sound with more adventure and faith in chance. Piano, sax, and various effects scatter themselves about (with purpose), adding new twists and turns to their enigma. The entrancing atmosphere that dominated their material up to now remains (indeed more potent now) but it is part of a more coherent overall song structure. ‘Head Over Heels’ has a cutting edge, angular and intensely oblique.&quot;

Ned Raggett in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Fraser&#x27;s singing was more direct in the mix than it had been on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Garlands&quot;, and although her lyrics were still often understandable, she &quot;began to shift away from conventional vocabulary towards enigmatic, emotional sound&quot; on &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, journalist Julian Marszalek said that with this album, &quot;Fraser&#x27;s voice became just as much an instrument&quot; as those played by her musicians&quot;, including Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;multi-layered and heavily reverberated guitars&quot;. He also remarked: In Our Angelhood&#x27; probably fits the bill best and it&#x27;s a track that wouldn&#x27;t have sounded out of place on Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;&quot;. &quot;The Tinderbox (Of a Heart)&quot; conveys a sense of menace and danger, while the closing track &quot;Musette and Drums&quot; features sweeping guitars and chimes. Cam Lindsay of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote that Multifoiled&#x27; has a phlegmatic rockabilly lean to it, &#x27;In Our Angelhood&#x27; is both post-punk and proto-shoegaze, and the dizzying &#x27;Sugar Hiccup&#x27; could singlehandedly be the conception of dream pop.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Head over Heels&quot; was released on 24 October 1983 by 4AD. The original United Kingdom and Canadian cassette and CD of &quot;Head over Heels&quot;, and the Brazilian CD versions, also included the &quot;Sunburst and Snowblind&quot; EP. The 2003 CD, remastered by Guthrie, did not include the EP.

In March 2018, the album was repressed on 180g vinyl using new masters created from high definition files transferred from the original analogue tapes.

== Critical reception==
The album was well-received by John Peel, who played the entire record on his radio show.

In the British music press the album received mixed reviews. It was given an 8 out of 10 rating in &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, while &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; were less favourable. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Barney Hoskins praised Elizabeth Fraser&#x27;s singing and the final track &quot;Musette and Drums&quot;, but found most of the album &quot;hollow and vaporous&quot; and that Cocteau Twins overall appeared as a lesser version of Siouxsie and the Banshees. 

&quot;Head over Heels&quot; was ranked at No. 7 in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s End of Year List for 1983.

In 2003, the album was named one of the most eccentric British albums of all time by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine.

==In popular culture==

The song &quot;Sugar Hiccup&quot; was played during the end titles of the fifth episode of series five titled &quot;Doughnuts&quot;, of Scottish sitcom &quot;Two Doors Down&quot; in July 2022.

<doc id="194536" wikidata="Q369283" url="?curid=194536" title="Daniel Pipes">
<text>Daniel Pipes (born September 9, 1949) is an American former professor, Anti-Islam activist, and commentator on foreign policy and the Middle East. He is the president of the Middle East Forum, and publisher of its &quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot; journal. His writing focuses on American foreign policy and the Middle East as well as criticism of Islamism.

After graduating with a doctorate from Harvard in 1978 and studying abroad, Pipes taught at universities including Harvard, Chicago, Pepperdine, and the U.S. Naval War College on a short-term basis but never held a permanent academic position. He then served as director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, before founding the Middle East Forum. He served as an adviser to Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

Pipes is a critic of Islam, and his views have been criticized by Muslim Americans and other academics, many of whom maintain they are Islamophobic or racist. Pipes has made claims about alleged &quot;no-go zones&quot; overrun by Sharia law in Europe and about U.S. President Barack Obama practicing Islam, and has defended Michelle Malkin&#x27;s book &quot;In Defense of Internment: The Case for &#x27;Racial Profiling&#x27; in World War II and the War on Terror&quot;.

Pipes has written sixteen books and was the Taube Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution.

==Early life and education==
The son of Irene (née Roth) and Richard Pipes, Daniel Pipes was born into a Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1949. His parents had each fled German-occupied Poland with their families, and they met in the United States. His father, Richard Pipes, was a historian at Harvard University, specializing in Russia, and Daniel Pipes grew up primarily in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area.

Pipes attended the Harvard pre-school, then received a private school education, partly abroad. He enrolled in Harvard University, where his father was a professor, in the fall of 1967. For his first two years he studied mathematics but said he &quot;found the material too abstract&quot;. After visiting the Sahara Desert in 1968, the Sinai Desert in 1969, and travels in West Africa, he changed his major to Middle Eastern history. He obtained a A.B. in history in 1971. His senior thesis was a study of Al-Ghazali and other Muslim philosophers. After graduating in 1971, Pipes spent two years in Cairo, then earned a PhD in 1978, also from Harvard. He wrote a book on colloquial Egyptian Arabic, published in 1983.

==Career==
===Work in academia===
Pipes returned to Harvard in 1973 and, after further studies abroad (in Freiburg-im-Breisgau and Cairo), obtained a Ph.D. in medieval Islamic history in 1978. His doctoral dissertation eventually became his first book, &quot;Slave Soldiers and Islam&quot;, in 1981. He switched his academic interest from medieval Islamic studies to modern Islam in the late 1970s, with the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Iranian revolution.

He taught world history at the University of Chicago from 1978 to 1982, history at Harvard from 1983 to 1984, and policy and strategy at the Naval War College from 1984 to 1986. In 1982–83, Pipes served on the policy-planning staff at the State Department in 1982–83.

=== Post-academia ===
Pipes largely left academia after 1986, although he taught a course titled &quot;International Relations: Islam and Politics&quot; as a visiting professor at Pepperdine University&#x27;s School of Public Policy in 2007. Pipes told an interviewer from &quot;Harvard Magazine&quot; that he has &quot;the simple politics of a truck driver, not the complex ones of an academic. My viewpoint is not congenial with institutions of higher learning.&quot;

From 1986 on, Pipes worked for think tanks. From 1986 to 1993, he was director of the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) and editor of its journal, &quot;Orbis&quot;. In 1990, he organized the Middle East Forum as a unit of FPRI; it became an independent organization with himself as head in January 1994. Pipes edited its journal, the &quot;Middle East Quarterly&quot;, until 2001. He established Campus Watch as a project of the Middle East Forum in 2002, followed by the Legal Project in 2005, Islamist Watch in 2006, and the Washington Project in 2009.

In 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Pipes for the board of the United States Institute of Peace. A filibuster was launched by Democratic Senators in the United States Senate against Pipes&#x27; nomination. Senator Tom Harkin said that he was &quot;offended&quot; by Pipes&#x27; comments on Islam, and that while &quot;some people call [Pipes] a scholar... this is not the kind of person you want on the USIP.&quot; While defending Pipes&#x27; nomination, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer distanced Bush from Pipes&#x27;s views, saying that Bush &quot;disagrees with Pipes about whether Islam is a peaceful religion&quot;. Pipes obtained the position by recess appointment and served on the board until early 2005. His nomination was protested by Muslim groups in the U.S., and Democratic leaders. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;in trying to prevent Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes from joining the board of the U.S. Institute of Peace, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) are abusing their privilege.&quot;

==&quot;Campus Watch&quot;==
Pipes&#x27; think tank the Middle East Forum established a website in 2002 called Campus Watch, which identified what it saw as five problems in the teaching of Middle Eastern studies at American universities: &quot;analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Campus Watch is the project for which Pipes is &quot;perhaps best known.&quot;

Through Campus Watch, Pipes encouraged students and faculty to submit information on &quot;Middle East-related scholarship, lectures, classes, demonstrations, and other activities relevant to Campus Watch&quot;. The project was accused of &quot;McCarthyesque intimidation&quot; of professors who criticized Israel when it published &quot;dossiers&quot; on eight professors it thought &quot;hostile&quot; to America. In protest, more than a hundred academics demanded to be added to what some called a &quot;blacklist&quot;. In October 2002 Campus Watch removed the dossiers from its website.

==Views==
===Radical and moderate Islam===

Pipes has long expressed alarm about what he believes to be the dangers of &quot;radical&quot; or &quot;militant Islam&quot; to the Western world. In 1985, he wrote in &quot;Middle East Insight&quot; that &quot;[t]he scope of the radical fundamentalist&#x27;s ambition poses novel problems; and the intensity of his onslaught against the United States makes solutions urgent.&quot; In the fall 1995 issue of &quot;National Interest&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Unnoticed by most Westerners, war has been unilaterally declared on Europe and the United States.&quot;

He wrote this in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing; investigative journalist Steven Emerson had said in the aftermath of the bombing that it bore a &quot;Middle Eastern trait.&quot; Pipes agreed with Emerson and told &quot;USA Today&quot; that the United States was &quot;under attack&quot; and that Islamic fundamentalists &quot;are targeting us.&quot; Shortly after this, the bombing was determined by police to have been carried out by American anti-government terrorists Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier.

Pipes wrote in 2007, &quot;It&#x27;s a mistake to blame Islam, a religion 14 centuries old, for the evil that should be ascribed to militant Islam, a totalitarian ideology less than a century old. Militant Islam is the problem, but moderate Islam is the solution.&quot; Pipes described moderate Muslims as &quot;a very small movement&quot; in comparison to &quot;the Islamist onslaught&quot; and said that the U.S. government &quot;should give priority to locating, meeting with, funding, forwarding, empowering, and celebrating&quot; them.

Pipes has praised Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Turkey and the Sudanese thinker Mahmoud Mohamed Taha. In a September 2008 interview by Peter Robinson, Pipes stated that Muslims can be divided into three categories: &quot;traditional Islam&quot;, which he sees as pragmatic and non-violent, &quot;Islamism&quot;, which he sees as dangerous and militant, and &quot;moderate Islam&quot;, which he sees as underground and not yet codified into a popular movement. He elaborated that he did not have the &quot;theological background&quot; to determine what group follows the Koran the closest and is truest to its intent.

===Muslims in Europe===
In 1990, Pipes wrote in &quot;National Review&quot; that Western European societies were &quot;unprepared for the massive immigration of brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and maintaining different standards of hygiene ... Muslim immigrants bring with them a chauvinism that augurs badly for their integration into the mainstream of the European societies.&quot; At that time, he believed Muslim immigrants would &quot;probably not change the face of European life&quot; and might &quot;even bring much of value, including new energy, to their host societies&quot;. New York University academic Arun Kundnani cited the article as &quot;Islamophobic&quot;. Pipes later said &quot;my goal in it was to characterize the thinking of Western Europeans, not give my own views. In retrospect, I should either have put the words &#x27;brown-skinned peoples&#x27; and &#x27;strange foods&#x27; in quotation marks or made it clearer that I was explaining European attitudes rather than my own.&quot;

In 2006, Daniel Pipes said that certain neighborhoods in France were &quot;no-go zones&quot; and &quot;that the French state no longer has full control over its territory.&quot; In 2013, Pipes traveled to several of these neighborhoods and admitted he was mistaken. In 2015 he sent an email to &quot;Bloomberg&quot; saying that there are &quot;no European countries with no-go zones.&quot;

In response to the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy, Pipes wrote that the &quot;key issue at stake&quot; was whether the &quot;West [would] stand up for its customs and mores, including freedom of speech&quot; and the &quot;right to insult and blasphemy&quot;. He supported Robert Spencer&#x27;s call to &quot;stand resolutely with Denmark.&quot; He lauded Norway, Germany and France for their stance on the cartoons and freedom of speech, but criticized Poland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States for giving statements he interpreted as &quot;wrongly apologizing.&quot;

Through his Middle East Forum, Pipes fund-raised for the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders during his trial, according to &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot;. Pipes has praised Wilders as &quot;the unrivaled leader of those Europeans who wish to retain their historic [European] identity&quot; and called him &quot;the most important politician in Europe.&quot; At the same time, he found Wilders&#x27; political program &quot;bizarre&quot; and not to be taken too seriously while criticizing Wilders&#x27; understanding of Islam as &quot;superficial&quot; for being against all of Islam and not just its extreme variant.

===Muslims in the United States===
In October 2001, Pipes said before a convention of the American Jewish Congress: &quot;I worry very much, from the Jewish point of view, that the presence, and increased stature, and affluence, and enfranchisement of American Muslims, because they are so much led by an Islamist leadership, that this will present true dangers to American Jews.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that American Muslims were &quot;enraged&quot; by Pipes&#x27; arguments that Muslims in government and military positions be given special attention as security risks and his opining that mosques are &quot;breeding grounds for militants.&quot; In a 2004 article in &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, Pipes endorsed a defense of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and linked the Japanese-American wartime situation to that of Muslim Americans today.

Pipes has criticized the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which he says is an &quot;apologist&quot; for Hezbollah and Hamas, and has a &quot;roster of employees and board members connected to terrorism&quot;. CAIR, in turn, has said that &quot;Pipes&#x27; writings are full of distortions and innuendo.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; cited Pipes as helping to lead the charge against Debbie Almontaser, a woman with a &quot;longstanding reputation as a Muslim moderate&quot; whom Pipes viewed as a representative of a pernicious new movement of &quot;lawful Islamists.&quot; Almontaser resigned under pressure as principal of Khalil Gibran International Academy, an Arabic-language high school in New York City named after the Christian Arab-American poet. Pipes initially described the school as a &quot;madrassa&quot;, which means school in Arabic but, in the West, carries the implication of Islamist teaching, though he later admitted that his use of the term had been &quot;a bit of a stretch&quot;. Pipes explained his opposition: &quot;It is hard to see how violence, how terrorism will lead to the implementation of sharia. It is much easier to see how, working through the system—the school system, the media, the religious organizations, the government, businesses and the like—you can promote radical Islam.&quot; Pipes had also stated that &quot;Arabic-language instruction is inevitably laden with Pan-Arabist and Islamist baggage.&quot;

===Views on American foreign policy===
Pipes was a firm supporter of the Vietnam War, and when his fellow students occupied the Harvard administration building to protest it in the 1960s, he sided with the administration. Pipes had previously considered himself to be a Democrat, but after anti-war George McGovern gained the 1972 Democratic nomination for President, he switched to the Republican Party. Pipes used to accept being described as a &quot;neoconservative&quot;, once saying that &quot;others see me that way, and, you know, maybe I am one of them.&quot; However, he explicitly rejected the label in April 2009 due to differences with the neoconservative positions on democracy and Iraq, now considering himself a &quot;plain conservative&quot;. 

===Donald Trump and the Republican Party===
In 2016, Pipes resigned from the Republican Party after it endorsed Donald Trump as its 2016 presidential candidate. Yet he announced in a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article of October 20, 2020, that he was voting for Trump in that year&#x27;s presidential election, on the grounds that, &quot;Rather than the person, I advise a focus on a party’s overall outlook... I urge fellow voters to dwell on the strikingly different platforms of the two major parties...and support whichever one better suits their own views; and to do so regardless of the candidates&#x27; many failings.&quot;

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
Pipes supports Israel in the Arab–Israeli conflict and is an opponent of a Palestinian state. He wrote in &quot;Commentary&quot; in April 1990 that &quot;there can be either an Israel or a Palestine, but not both ... to those who ask why the Palestinians must be deprived of a state, the answer is simple: grant them one and you set in motion a chain of events that will lead either to its extinction or the extinction of Israel.&quot; Pipes has proposed a three-state solution to the conflict, in which Gaza would be given to Egypt and the West Bank to Jordan.

In September 2008, he said, &quot;Palestinians do not accept the existence of a Jewish state. Until that change, I don&#x27;t see any point in having any kind of negotiations whatsoever.&quot; He also described the Israeli public as focused on a mistaken policy that he considers to be &quot;appeasement&quot;.

Pipes supported Israel in the 2014 Gaza War stating &quot;the civilized and moral forces of Israel came off well in this face-off with barbarism&quot;. He has also defended the controversial Canary Mission, stating &quot;collecting information on students has particular value because it signals them that attacking Israel is serious business, not some inconsequential game, and that their actions can damage both Israel and their future careers&quot;.

===Iran===
Pipes&#x27; opposition to Iran is long-standing. In 1980, Pipes wrote that &quot;Iran made the transition to a post-oil economy. It is the only major oil exporter to abandon the heady billions and return to live by its own means.&quot; Pipes was critical of the Reagan administration for its role in the Iran–Contra affair, writing that &quot;American actions also helped to legitimize other kinds of help for, and capitulation to, the Ayatollah.&quot;

In 2010, Pipes advocated that U.S. President Barack Obama &quot;give orders for the U.S. military to destroy Iran&#x27;s nuclear-weapon capacity. ... The time to act is now.&quot; He argued that &quot;circumstances are propitious&quot; for the U.S. to initiate a bombing of Iran, and that &quot;no one other than the Iranian rulers and their agents denies that the regime is rushing headlong to build a large nuclear arsenal.&quot; He further stated that a unilateral U.S. bombing of Iran &quot;would require few &#x27;boots on the ground&#x27; and entail relatively few casualties, making an attack more politically palatable.&quot;

Pipes advocates that the U.S. support the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) against the Iranian government. Previously listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and the European Union, Pipes had long advocated a change in that listing. Pipes had described this listing as a &quot;sop to the mullahs&quot;. He writes, &quot;the MEK poses no danger to Americans or Europeans, and has not for decades. It does pose a danger to the malign, bellicose theocratic regime in Tehran.&quot;

===Obama&#x27;s religion conspiracy===
On January 7, 2008, Pipes wrote an article for &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot; claiming that he had &quot;confirmed&quot; that President Obama &quot;practiced Islam&quot;. Media Matters for America responded by exposing Pipes reliance on &quot;disputed &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article&quot;, whose key claims were debunked by Kim Barker in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; on 25 March. Ben Smith, in an article on &quot;Politico&quot;, criticized Pipes for what he said were false or misleading statements about Barack Obama&#x27;s religion, stating that they amounted to a &quot;template for a faux-legitimate assault on Obama&#x27;s religion&quot; and that Pipes&#x27; work &quot;is pretty stunning in the twists of its logic&quot;.

==Reception==
Pipes was included in the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) &quot;Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists&quot; that was removed from the SPLC website after Maajid Nawaz filed a lawsuit. However, on the SPLC website he is still considered an &quot;anti-Muslim mainstay figure&quot; and &quot;anti-Muslim activist&quot; in many &quot;Hatewatch&quot; and &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPLC-Roundup-8/9/2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SPLC-round-up: 6/22/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Bridge Initiative, hosted at Georgetown University and headed by John L. Esposito, analyses and refers to Pipes as an &quot;anti-Muslim figure&quot;, describing his activities as &quot;promoting anti-Muslim tropes&quot; and Pipes as financier of &quot;numerous activists and organizations that spread misinformation about Muslims and Islam&quot;. Pipes has also been described as a part of the counter-jihad movement, though more moderate than others.

Tashbih Sayyed, aformer editor of the &quot;Muslim World Today&quot; and the &quot;Pakistan Times&quot; (not the Pakistani newspaper of the same name), stated about Pipes: &quot;He must be listened to. If there is no Daniel Pipes, there is no source for America to learn to recognize the evil which threatens it... Muslims in America that are like Samson; they have come into the temple to pull down the pillars, even if it means destroying themselves.&quot; Similarly, Ahmed Subhy Mansour, a former visiting fellow at Harvard Law School, writes, &quot;We Muslims need a thinker like Dr. Pipes, who can criticize the terrorist culture within Islam.&quot;

In &quot;The Nation&quot;, Brooklyn writer Kristine McNeil described Pipes in 2003 as an &quot;anti-Arab propagandist&quot; who has built a career out of &quot;distortions... twist[ing] words, quot[ing] people out of context and stretch[ing] the truth to suit his purpose&quot;.

Zachary Lockman, Professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies and History, wrote in 2005 that Pipes &quot;acquired a reputation in Muslim American circles as an &#x27;Islamophobe&#x27; and &#x27;Muslim basher&#x27; whose writings and public utterances aroused fear and suspicion toward Muslims&quot;. He stated that Pipes&#x27;s remarks &quot;could plausibly be understood as inciting suspicion and mistrust of Muslims, including Muslim Americans, and as derogatory of Islam&quot;.

Christopher Hitchens, a fellow supporter of the Iraq War and critic of political Islam, also criticized Pipes, arguing that Pipes pursued an intolerant agenda, was someone who &quot;confuses scholarship with propaganda&quot;, and &quot;pursues petty vendettas with scant regard for objectivity&quot;.

When Pipes was invited to speak at the University of Toronto in March 2005, a letter from professors and graduate students asserted that Pipes had a &quot;long record of xenophobic, racist and sexist speech that goes back to 1990&quot;, but university officials said they would not interfere with Pipes&#x27;s visit.

Professor John L. Esposito of Georgetown University has called Pipes &quot;a bright, well-trained expert with considerable experience&quot;, but accuses Pipes of &quot;selectivity and distortion&quot; when asserting that &quot;10 to 15 percent of the world&#x27;s Muslims are militants&quot;. In summation, Esposito complains that equation of &quot;mainstream and extremist[s] [sic] Islam under the rubric of militant Islam&quot; while identifying &quot;moderate Islam as secular or cultural&quot; can mislead &quot;uninformed or uncritical readers&quot;.

<text>The thumb is the first digit of the hand, next to the index finger. When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit. The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is (compare &quot;hallux&quot; for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is .

==Definition==

===Thumb and fingers===
The English word &quot;finger&quot; has two senses, even in the context of appendages of a single typical human hand:
1) Any of the five terminal members of the hand.
2) Any of the four terminal members of the hand, other than the thumb.

Linguistically, it appears that the original sense was the first of these two: (also rendered as ) was, in the inferred Proto-Indo-European language, a suffixed form of (or ), which has given rise to many Indo-European-family words (tens of them defined in English dictionaries) that involve, or stem from, concepts of fiveness.

The thumb shares the following with each of the other four fingers:
* Having a skeleton of phalanges, joined by hinge-like joints that provide flexion toward the palm of the hand
* Having a dorsal surface that features hair and a nail, and a hairless palmar aspect with fingerprint ridges

The thumb contrasts with each of the other four fingers by being the only one that:
* Is opposable to the other four fingers
* Has two phalanges rather than three. However, recently there have been reports that the thumb, like other fingers, has three phalanges, but lacks a metacarpal bone.
* Has greater breadth in the distal phalanx than in the proximal phalanx
* Is attached to such a mobile metacarpus (which produces most of the opposability)
* Curls horizontally instead of vertically
and hence the etymology of the word: is Proto-Indo-European for &#x27;swelling&#x27; (cf &#x27;tumor&#x27; and &#x27;thigh&#x27;) since the thumb is the stoutest of the fingers.

==Opposition and apposition==

===Humans===
Anatomists and other researchers focused on human anatomy have hundreds of definitions of &quot;opposition&quot;. Some anatomists restrict &quot;opposition&quot; to when the thumb is approximated to the fifth finger (little finger) and refer to other approximations between the thumb and other fingers as &quot;apposition&quot;. To anatomists, this makes sense as two intrinsic hand muscles are named for this specific movement (the opponens pollicis and opponens digiti minimi respectively).

Other researchers use another definition, referring to opposition-apposition as the transition between flexion-abduction and extension-adduction; the &quot;side&quot; of the distal thumb phalanx thus approximated to the palm or the hand&#x27;s radial side (side of index finger) during &quot;apposition&quot; and the &quot;pulp&quot; or &quot;palmar&quot; side of the distal thumb phalanx approximated to either the palm or other fingers during &quot;opposition&quot;.

Moving a limb back to its neutral position is called reposition and a rotary movement is referred to as circumduction.

Primatologists and hand research pioneers John and Prudence Napier defined opposition as: &quot;A movement by which the pulp surface of the thumb is placed squarely in contact with  or diametrically opposite to  the terminal pads of one or all of the remaining fingers.&quot; For this &quot;true&quot;, pulp-to-pulp opposition to be possible, the thumb must rotate about its long axis (at the carpometacarpal joint). Arguably, this definition was chosen to underline what is unique to the human thumb.

===Other primates===

* Primates fall into one of six groups:
** Thumbless: spider monkey and colobus
** Nonopposable thumbs: tarsiers (which are found in the islands of Southeast Asia), marmosets (which are New World monkeys)
** Pseudo-opposable thumbs: all strepsirrhines (lemurs, pottos and lorises) and Cebidae (capuchin and squirrel monkeys, which are New World monkeys)
** Opposable thumbs: Old World monkeys (Circopithecidae) except colobus, and all great apes
** Opposable with comparatively long thumbs: gibbons (or lesser apes)
** Yet to be classified: other New World monkeys (tamarins, Aotidae: night or owl monkeys, Pitheciidae: titis, sakis and uakaris, Atelidae: howler and woolly monkeys)

The spider monkey compensates for being virtually thumbless by using the hairless part of its long, prehensile tail for grabbing objects. In apes and Old World monkeys, the thumb can be rotated around its axis, but the extensive area of contact between the pulps of the thumb and index finger is a human characteristic.

&quot;Darwinius masillae&quot;, an Eocene primate transitional fossil between prosimian and simian, had hands and feet with highly flexible digits featuring opposable thumbs and halluces.

===Other placental mammals===
* Giant pandas — five clawed fingers plus an extra-long sesamoid bone beside the true first finger that, though not a true finger, works like an opposable thumb.
* Most rodents have a partly opposable toe on each front paw, letting them grasp.
** In some &quot;mice&quot;, the hallux (&quot;big toe&quot;) is clawless and fully opposable, including arboreal species such as &quot;Hapalomys&quot;, &quot;Chiropodomys&quot;, &quot;Vandeleuria&quot;, and &quot;Chiromyscus&quot;; and saltatorial, bipedal species such as &quot;Notomys&quot; and possibly some Gerbillinae.
** The East African maned rat (&quot;Lophiomys imhausi&quot;), an arboreal, porcupine-like rodent, has four fingers on its hands and feet and a partially opposable thumb.

Additionally, in many polydactyl cats, both the innermost toe and outermost toe (pinky) may become opposable, allowing the cat to perform more complex tasks.

===Marsupials===

* In most phalangerid marsupials (a family of possums) except species &quot;Trichosurus&quot; and &quot;Wyulda&quot;, the first and second toes of the forefoot are opposable to the other three. In the hind foot, the first toe is clawless but opposable and provides firm grip on branches. The second and third toes are partly syndactylous, united by skin at the top joint while the two separate nails serve as hair combs. The fourth and fifth toes are the largest of the hind foot.
* Koalas have five toes on their fore and hind feet with sharp curved claws except for the first toe of the hind foot. The first and second toes of the forefeet are opposable to the other three, which enables the koala to grip smaller branches and search for fresh leaves in the outer canopy. Similar to the phalangerids, the second and third toes of the hind foot are fused but have separate claws.
* Opossums are New World marsupials with opposable thumbs in the hind feet giving these animals their characteristic grasping capability (with the exception of the water opossum, the webbed feet of which restrict opposability).
* The mouse-like microbiotheres were a group of South American marsupials most closely related to Australian marsupials. The only extant member, &quot;Dromiciops gliroides&quot;, is not closely related to opossums but has paws similar to these animals, each having opposable toes adapted for gripping.

===Reptiles===
* The front feet of chameleons are organized into a medial bundle of toes 1, 2 and 3, and a lateral bundle of toes 4 and 5, and the hind feet are organized into a medial bundle of toes 1 and 2, and a lateral bundle of toes 3, 4 and 5.

===Dinosaurs===
* Dinosaurs belonging to the family of bird-like dinosaur Troodontidae had a partially opposable finger. It is possible that this adaptation was used to better manipulate ground objects or moving undergrowth branches when searching for prey.
* The small predatory dinosaur &quot;Bambiraptor&quot; may have had mutually opposable first and third fingers and a forelimb manoeuvrability that would allow the hand to reach its mouth. Its forelimb morphology and range of motion enabled two-handed prehension, one-handed clutching of objects to the chest, and use of the hand as a hook.
* &quot;Nqwebasaurus&quot; — a coelurosaur with a long, three-fingered hand which included a partially opposable thumb (a &quot;killer claw&quot;).

In addition to these, some other dinosaurs may have had partially or completely opposed toes in order to manipulate food and/or grasp prey.

====Birds====
* Most birds have at least one opposable toe on the foot, in various configurations, though these are seldom called &quot;thumbs&quot;. They are more often known simply as halluxes.

====Pterosaurs====
* The wukongopterid pterosaur &quot;Kunpengopterus&quot; bore an opposable first toe on each wing. The presence of opposable thumbs in this taxon is thought to be an arboreal adaptation.

===Amphibians===
* &quot;Phyllomedusa&quot;, a genus of frogs native to South America.

==Human anatomy==

===Skeleton===
The skeleton of the thumb consists of the first metacarpal bone which articulates proximally with the carpus at the carpometacarpal joint and distally with the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This latter bone articulates with the distal phalanx at the interphalangeal joint. Additionally, there are two sesamoid bones at the metacarpophalangeal joint.

===Muscles===

The muscles of the thumb can be compared to guy-wires supporting a flagpole; tension from these muscular guy-wires must be provided in all directions to maintain stability in the articulated column formed by the bones of the thumb. Because this stability is actively maintained by muscles rather than by articular constraints, most muscles attached to the thumb tend to be active during most thumb motions.

The muscles acting on the thumb can be divided into two groups: The extrinsic hand muscles, with their muscle bellies located in the forearm, and the intrinsic hand muscles, with their muscle bellies located in the hand proper.

====Extrinsic====

A ventral forearm muscle, the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) originates on the anterior side of the radius distal to the radial tuberosity and from the interosseous membrane. It passes through the carpal tunnel in a separate tendon sheath, after which it lies between the heads of the flexor pollicis brevis. It finally attaches onto the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve (C7-C8) It is a persistence of one of the former contrahentes muscles that pulled the fingers or toes together.

Three dorsal forearm muscles act on the thumb:

The abductor pollicis longus (APL) originates on the dorsal sides of both the ulna and the radius, and from the interosseous membrane. Passing through the first tendon compartment, it inserts to the base of the first metacarpal bone. A part of the tendon reaches the trapezium, while another fuses with the tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis brevis. Except for abducting the hand, it flexes the hand towards the palm and abducts it radially. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-C8).

The extensor pollicis longus (EPL) originates on the dorsal side of the ulna and the interosseous membrane. Passing through the third tendon compartment, it is inserted onto the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It uses the dorsal tubercle on the lower extremity of the radius as a fulcrum to extend the thumb and also dorsiflexes and abducts the hand at the wrist. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-C8).

The extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) originates on the ulna distal to the abductor pollicis longus, from the interosseus membrane, and from the dorsal side of the radius. Passing through the first tendon compartment together with the abductor pollicis longus, it is attached to the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It extends the thumb and, because of its close relationship to the long abductor, also abducts the thumb. It is innervated by the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7-T1).

The tendons of the extensor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis form what is known as the anatomical snuff box (an indentation on the lateral aspect of the thumb at its base) The radial artery can be palpated anteriorly at the wrist (not in the snuffbox).

====Intrinsic====

There are three thenar muscles:

The abductor pollicis brevis (APB) originates on the scaphoid tubercle and the flexor retinaculum. It inserts to the radial sesamoid bone and the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the median nerve (C8-T1).

The flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) has two heads. The superficial head arises on the flexor retinaculum, while the deep head originates on three carpal bones: the trapezium, trapezoid, and capitate. The muscle is inserted onto the radial sesamoid bone of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It acts to flex, adduct, and abduct the thumb, and is therefore also able to oppose the thumb. The superficial head is innervated by the median nerve, while the deep head is innervated by the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).

The opponens pollicis originates on the tubercle of the trapezium and the flexor retinaculum. It is inserted onto the radial side of the first metacarpal. It opposes the thumb and assists in adduction. It is innervated by the median nerve.

Other muscles involved are:

The adductor pollicis also has two heads. The transversal head originates along the entire third metacarpal bone, while the oblique head originates on the carpal bones proximal to the third metacarpal. The muscle is inserted onto the ulnar sesamoid bone of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It adducts the thumb, and assists in opposition and flexion. It is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).

The first dorsal interosseous, one of the central muscles of the hand, extends from the base of the thumb metacarpal to the radial side of the proximal phalanx of the index finger.

=== Variations ===

There is a variation of the human thumb where the angle between the first and second (proximal and distal) phalanges varies between 0° and almost 90° when the thumb is in a thumbs-up gesture.

It has been suggested that the variation is an autosomal recessive trait, called a hitchhiker&#x27;s thumb, with homozygous carriers having an angle close to 90°. However this theory has been disputed, since the variation in thumb angle is known to fall on a continuum and shows little evidence of the bi-modality seen in other recessive genetic traits.

Other variations of the thumb include brachydactyly type D (which is a thumb with a congenitally short distal phalanx), a triphalangeal thumb (which is a thumb which has 3 phalanges instead of the usual two), and polysyndactyly (which is a combination of radial polydactyly and syndactyly).

===Grips===

One of the earlier significant contributors to the study of hand grips was orthopedic primatologist and paleoanthropologist John Napier, who proposed organizing the movements of the hand by their anatomical basis as opposed to work done earlier that had only used arbitrary classification. Most of this early work on hand grips had a pragmatic basis as it was intended to narrowly define compensable injuries to the hand, which required an understanding of the anatomical basis of hand movement. Napier proposed two primary prehensile grips: the &quot;precision grip&quot; and the &quot;power grip&quot;. The precision and power grip are defined by the position of the thumb and fingers where:
* The power grip is when the fingers (and sometimes palm) clamp down on an object with the thumb making counter pressure. Examples of the power grip are gripping a hammer, opening a jar using &quot;both your palm and fingers&quot;, and during pullups.
* The precision grip is when the intermediate and distal phalanges (&quot;fingertips&quot;) and the thumb press against each other. Examples of a precision grip are writing with a pencil, opening a jar &quot;with the fingertips alone&quot;, and gripping a ball (only if the ball is not tight against the palm).
Opposability of the thumb should not be confused with a precision grip as some animals possess semi-opposable thumbs yet are known to have extensive precision grips (Tufted Capuchins for example). Nevertheless, precision grips are usually only found in higher apes, and only in degrees significantly more restricted than in humans.

The pad-to-pad pinch between the thumb and index finger is made possible because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the distal phalanx of the index finger. Most non-human primates have to flex their long fingers in order for the small thumb to reach them.

In humans, the distal pads are wider than in other primates because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the distal pads can therefore conform to uneven surfaces while pressure is distributed more evenly in the finger tips. The distal pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.

In robotics, almost all robotic hands have a long and strong opposable thumb. Like human hands, the thumb of a robotic hand also plays a key role in gripping an object. One inspiring approach of robotic grip planning is to mimic human thumb placement.
 In a sense, human thumb placement indicates which surface or part of the object is good for grip. Then the robot places its thumb to the same location and plans the other fingers based on the thumb placement.

The function of the thumb declines physiologically with aging. This can be demonstrated by assessing the motor sequencing of the thumb.

==Human evolution==
A primitive autonomization of the first carpometacarpal joint (CMC) may have occurred in dinosaurs. A real differentiation appeared an estimated 70 mya in early primates, while the shape of the human thumb CMC finally appears about 5 mya. The result of this evolutionary process is a human CMC joint positioned at 80° of pronation, 40 of abduction, and 50° of flexion in relation to an axis passing through the second and third CMC joints.

Opposable thumbs are shared by some primates, including most catarrhines. The climbing and suspensory behaviour in orthograde apes, such as chimpanzees, has resulted in elongated hands while the thumb has remained short. As a result, these primates are unable to perform the pad-to-pad grip associated with opposability. However, in pronograde monkeys such as baboons, an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle has led to reduced finger length and thus hand proportions similar to those of humans. Consequently, these primates have dexterous hands and are able to grasp objects using a pad-to-pad grip. It can thus be difficult to identify hand adaptations to manipulation-related tasks based solely on thumb proportions.

The evolution of the fully opposable thumb is usually associated with &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, a forerunner of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. This, however, is the suggested result of evolution from &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (around 1 mya) via a series of intermediate anthropoid stages, and is therefore a much more complicated link.

Modern humans are unique in the musculature of their forearm and hand. Yet, they remain autapomorphic, meaning each muscle is found in one or more non-human primates. The extensor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis longus allow modern humans to have great manipulative skills and strong flexion in the thumb.

However, a more likely scenario may be that the specialized precision gripping hand (equipped with opposable thumb) of &quot;Homo habilis&quot; preceded walking, with the specialized adaptation of the spine, pelvis, and lower extremities preceding a more advanced hand. And, it is logical that a conservative, highly functional adaptation be followed by a series of more complex ones that complement it. With &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, an advanced grasping-capable hand was accompanied by facultative bipedalism, possibly implying, assuming a co-opted evolutionary relationship exists, that the latter resulted from the former as obligate bipedalism was yet to follow. Walking may have been a by-product of busy hands and not vice versa.

HACNS1 (also known as Human Accelerated Region 2) is a gene enhancer &quot;that may have contributed to the evolution of the uniquely opposable human thumb, and possibly also modifications in the ankle or foot that allow humans to walk on two legs&quot;. Evidence to date shows that of the 110,000 gene enhancer sequences identified in the human genome, HACNS1 has undergone the most change during the human evolution since the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor.

<text>3 Feet High and Rising is the debut studio album by the American hip hop group De La Soul, released on February 6, 1989, by Tommy Boy Records. It was the first of three collaborations with the producer Prince Paul, and was the critical and commercial peak of both parties. The album title comes from the Johnny Cash song &quot;Five Feet High and Rising&quot;. The album contains the singles &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;, &quot;The Magic Number&quot;, &quot;Buddy&quot;, and &quot;Eye Know&quot;.

The album was a critical and commercial success. It is consistently placed on lists of the greatest albums of all time by noted critics and publications, with Robert Christgau calling it &quot;unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard&quot;. In 1998, it was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Rap Albums&quot; and in 2020 was ranked 103 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. It was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. As of 2023, it is the only De La Soul album to be certified platinum by the RIAA.

Along with the rest of De La Soul&#x27;s back catalog, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; was not made available for digital purchase or streaming until 2023, due to concerns about the legality of the samples for digital releases.

==Musical style==
Released amid the late-1980s boom in gangsta rap, which gravitated towards hardcore, confrontational, violent lyrics, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; stood out from this trend by showcasing De La Soul&#x27;s more positive style. The mirth and intelligence of De La Soul&#x27;s self-presentation led many observers to label them a &quot;hippie&quot; group, a characterization that De La Soul&#x27;s members have consistently disputed. On the album, De La Soul sought to explicitly distance themselves from gangsta rap by &quot;lampoon[ing] emerging tropes&quot; such as the growing materialism within the genre. Their lyrics are instead characterized by a variety of &quot;bizarre and surreal&quot; choices of subject matter, such as dandruff, gardening metaphors, and &quot;Dr. Dolittle-esque interactions with animals&quot;.

The album features a recurring lyrical motif of the &quot;D.A.I.S.Y. Age&quot;, an acronym that stands for &quot;Da Inner Sound, Y&#x27;all&quot;. Group member Posdnuos has described the daisy motif as intended to indicate the group&#x27;s &quot;sunnier&quot;, more playful ethos. 

&quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; uses a sample-heavy production style; in addition to sampling from funk and soul tracks, as was popular in the hip-hop of the era, the album also draws from sources such as doo-wop, psychedelic rock, and children&#x27;s music. It has been described as &quot;the first psychedelic hip-hop record&quot;. The album has also been noted for its use of unconventional song structures. Posdnuos recounts that the group used Casio&#x27;s RZ-1 drum machine and an Eventide-brand harmonizer to record, manipulate, and combine their samples on the album.

The album is also known for its quiz show-themed series of skits, leading it to be frequently credited with inventing or popularizing the hip-hop skit.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s artwork was designed by Toby Mott of the British art collective the Grey Organisation (GO), who had relocated to New York City after their attack on Cork Street&#x27;s art galleries and subsequent prosecution.

De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;D.A.I.S.Y. Age&quot; concept inspired the design of the album cover, as Mott describes in his essay &quot;Hip Hop in The Daisy Age&quot;: 
Group member Trugoy has stated that De La Soul was not originally interested in the flower-adorned cover that the album ultimately featured; instead, he said the group had wanted an album cover that featured &quot;an elevator halfway up with just our faces.&quot;

==Reception and influence==
&quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. &quot;An inevitable development in the class history of rap, [De La Soul is] new wave to Public Enemy&#x27;s punk&quot;, wrote Robert Christgau of the album in his 1989 &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Their music is maddeningly disjunct, and a few of the 24-cuts-in-67-minutes (too long for vinyl) are self-indulgent, arch. But their music is also radically unlike any rap you or anybody else has ever heard — inspirations include the Jarmels and a learn-it-yourself French record. And for all their kiddie consciousness, junk-culture arcana, and suburban in-jokes, they&#x27;re in the new tradition — you can dance to them, which counts for plenty when disjunction is your problem.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Michael Azerrad called &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; &quot;(o)ne of the most original rap records ever to come down the pike&quot;, and described it as an &quot;inventive, playful&quot; record which &quot;stands staid rap conventions on their def ear.&quot; When &quot;The Village Voice&quot; held its annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1989, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; was ranked at number one, outdistancing its nearest opponent (Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Freedom&quot;) by 21 votes and 260 points.

Sampling artists as diverse as Johnny Cash, Hall &amp; Oates, Steely Dan and the Turtles, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; is often viewed as the stylistic beginning of 1990s alternative hip hop (and especially jazz rap). Writing in retrospect for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin credits Prince Paul for helping &quot;create progressive hip hop&quot; with his production on &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, while author John Riordan says &quot;its comedy skits and positive lyrics established the group as a progressive hip-hop act at odds with the increasingly violent image of mainstream rap.&quot; Phil Witmer of &quot;Noisey&quot; cites De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;sampledelia&quot; on the album as an &quot;old-school&quot; example of sampling being applied to &quot;jarring, collage-like effect&quot;. &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; is also credited with introducing the hip hop skit, a style of comedic sketch used both to introduce rap albums and as interludes between songs.

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the R&amp;B/Hip Hop charts and No. 24 in the Top 200.

===Retrospective opinion===
&quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; has been included on numerous &quot;best-of&quot; lists. In 1998, the album was included in &quot;The Source&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list. It was ranked number 346 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the ranking in a 2012 revision of the list, then rising to number 103 in a 2020 revision. &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; was voted number 138 in the 2000 edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, while in 2005, it ranked 88th in a survey held by British television&#x27;s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at No. 20 in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at No. 9 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. &quot;Spex&quot; listed &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; at No. 5 on its list of the Top 100 Albums of the Century. The album has also been ranked as among the top albums of 1989 by publications including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Face&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, &quot;Sounds&quot;, &quot;OOR&quot;, and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

An NPR retrospective, published in 2023, stated that &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; &quot;reshaped the public imagination of what hip-hop could be&quot;, and that it &quot;still sounds wondrous and weird&quot; in the musical landscape of the 2020s.

Electronica artist James Lavelle cited &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; as one of his favorite albums. &quot;It was definitely a reaction to the slightly more hardcore area of what was going on in hip hop. As a concept record, it&#x27;s probably one of the best ever. It&#x27;s like the Pink Floyd of hip hop, their &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; – the way it musically and sonically moves around, but also the use of language was so unusual and out there.&quot;

Macy Gray felt it was &quot;the best record of the past 15 years&quot; in a &quot;Q&quot; magazine, describing De La Soul as &quot;like the Beatles of hip hop.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, meanwhile, described &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; as &quot;the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; of hip hop&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; was among 25 albums chosen as additions to the Library of Congress&#x27; 2010 National Recording Registry for being cultural and aesthetical and also for its historical impact.

The track &quot;The Magic Number&quot; was used in the end credits of the 2021 film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; as a reference to the three iterations of Peter Parker that appear in the film.

== Digital release ==
&quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, along with the rest of De La Soul&#x27;s catalogue up until their 2004 release, &quot;The Grind Date&quot;, was not made available for digital purchase or streaming until March 3, 2023, due to concerns about the legality of the samples for digital releases. Tommy Boy enlisted the music licensing company DMG Clearances to secure clearance for the samples, but talks failed with many of the copyright holders, as they were reticent to become involved with ongoing conflicts between De La Soul and Tommy Boy. After Tommy Boy was acquired by Reservoir Media, DMG Clearances restarted talks in January 2022 and negotiated licenses for most of the samples. De La Soul interpolated or replayed samples that could not be cleared.

==Track listing==

In 2002, Campus Watch created a controversy when it compiled these reports into &#x27;dossiers&#x27; critical of various professors at institutes of higher learning in the United States, in which it detailed their supposedly &quot;anti-Israeli statements&quot;. In response to the posting of the dossiers on its website, many individuals sent harassing emails and phone calls to the profiled professors, and the website was widely condemned in the media for supposedly engaging in &quot;McCarthyesque&quot; intimidation. The Campus Watch project was derided as a &quot;War on Academic Freedom&quot;; in protest, more than 100 academics asked to be listed along with those accused by Campus Watch. The response of Judith Butler, a comparative literature professor at Berkeley, was circulated on the Internet:

:I have recently learned that your organization is compiling dossiers on professors at U.S. academic institutions who oppose the Israeli occupation and its brutality, actively support Palestinian rights of self-determination as well as a more informed and intelligent view of Islam than is currently represented in the U.S. media. I would be enormously honored to be counted among those who actively hold these positions and would like to be included in the list of those who are struggling for justice.

Rashid Khalidi, a professor at Columbia University who was the subject of a critical dossier on the website, suggested that the Campus Watch campaign was an attempt to silence legitimate criticism, &quot;by tarring it with the brush of anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism, truly loathsome charges.&quot; Khalidi taped an anonymous phone call he received, subsequent to the Campus Watch dossier publication, that says: &quot;Khalidi, Columbia alumni love Campus Watch because they keep an eye on thugs like you. We have our eye on you. You&#x27;d better watch out.&quot;

After two weeks, Campus Watch removed the dossiers from its website.
It continues to collect information from students, though it no longer publishes such dossiers. According to Juan Cole, one of the professors who was subject to Campus Watch&#x27;s dossiers, the website continued to spread false information about him even after the dossiers were removed: &quot;The removal of the individual dossiers is merely a cosmetic change, since the same academics are still being spied on, only under the rubric of spying on their campuses instead.&quot;

== Criticism ==
An article in &quot;The Nation&quot; suggests that Daniel Pipes is &quot;an anti-Arab propagandist&quot;, and his Campus Watch project aims to &quot;smear&quot; academics critical of the Israeli occupation or of American foreign policy. Campus Watch&#x27;s project was identified, in &quot;The Nation&quot; and elsewhere, as resembling a decades-old AIPAC project:
:In 1979 the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) formed its Political Leadership Development Program, which &quot;educates and trains young leaders in pro-Israel political advocacy,&quot; enlisting hundreds of college students to collect information on pro-Palestinian professors and student organizations. By 1983 the program had attracted more than 5,000 students on 350 campuses in all fifty states. The next year the findings were published as The AIPAC College Guide: Exposing the Anti-Israel Campaign on Campus, which surveyed 100 campuses and instructed students on how best to counter a &quot;steady diet of anti-Israel vituperation.&quot; Around the same time, the Anti-Defamation League covertly distributed a twenty-one-page booklet containing &quot;background information on pro-Arab sympathizers active on college campuses&quot; who &quot;use their anti-Zionism as merely a guise for their deeply felt anti-Semitism.&quot;

Joel Beinin, who has often been criticized by Campus Watch, has accused Daniel Pipes of being &quot;beholden to Israeli right wing politics.&quot;
According to Beinin, &quot;After failing in his own pursuit of an academic career, Pipes has evidently decided to take revenge on the scholarly community that rejected him&quot;, in the form of the Campus Watch website. Pipes strongly denied Beinin&#x27;s charges, writing that he was &quot;offered a tenure-track position and turned it down, preferring to write than teach&quot;. while simultaneously attacking Beinin &quot;of credentialitis, the disease that places more emphasis on qualifications than achievements&quot; and the fact that &quot;Harvard&#x27;s doctoral program in history turned him down but awarded me a Ph.D..&quot; Beinin has also alleged that Campus Watch &quot;makes comments&quot; about the ethnic and cultural background of scholars.

In their book &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt wrote that
:The Lobby also monitors what professors write and teach. In September 2002, for example, Martin Kramer and Daniel Pipes, two passionately pro-Israel neoconservatives, established a website (Campus Watch) that posted dossiers on suspect academics and encouraged students to report remarks or behavior that might be considered hostile to Israel. This transparent attempt to blacklist and intimidate scholars prompted a harsh reaction, and Pipes and Kramer later removed the dossiers, but the website still invites students to report &quot;anti-Israel&quot; activity.
Pipes responded to part of the Mearsheimer and Walt allegations, writing
:This account is inaccurate in several ways (e.g. Martin Kramer had no role in founding Campus Watch), but I write specifically to state that no &#x27;Lobby&#x27; told me to start Campus Watch. Neither the Middle East Forum nor myself has ever taken orders from some mythical &#x27;Lobby&#x27;, and specifically I decided to establish Campus Watch on my own, without direction from any outside source. I challenge Mearsheimer and Walt to provide their information that connects this &#x27;Lobby&#x27; to my decision to establish Campus Watch.
Later he wrote that &quot;Mearsheimer and Walt unconditionally concede they have no information about the alleged “lobby” giving me orders concerning Campus Watch, confirming the falsehood of their initial claim&quot; and furthermore added
:Campus Watch is to Middle East studies as political analysis to politics, film criticism to movies, and consumer reports to manufacturing; we provide assessments for the public. Unlike politicians, actors, and business executives, who accept criticism with good grace, academics howl with umbrage at being judged.

=== Response ===
According to Campus Watch, it &quot;critiques Middle East studies in North America regardless of whether they address Israel.&quot; In response to what it refers to as &quot;a campaign of vilification and distortion&quot; by critics, Campus Watch states:
:* Campus Watch supports the unencumbered freedom of speech of all scholars, regardless of their views.
:* Campus Watch takes no position on individual academic appointments.
:* Academic freedom does not mean freedom from criticism; to the contrary, no one enjoys privileges in the free marketplace of ideas.
:* The charge of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; has come up so often that we address this in a separate study which demonstrates why the charge is ignorant, intolerant, and ultimately self-serving.
:* We challenge scholars of Middle Eastern studies to abandon the crude resort to insults and engage Campus Watch on the substance of our analysis.

<doc id="194543" wikidata="Q2714210" url="?curid=194543" title="Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex">
<text>Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex (13 July 1683), also spelt Capel, of Cassiobury House, Watford, Hertfordshire, was an English statesman.

== Early life ==
He was the son of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham (executed in 1649) by his wife Elizabeth Morrison, daughter and heiress of Sir Charles Morrison, 1st Baronet (1587–1628) of Cashiobury House, Watford, Hertfordshire. He was baptised on 2 January 1632.

== Youth ==
In June 1648, then a sickly boy of sixteen, he was taken by Lord Fairfax&#x27;s soldiers from Hadham to Colchester in Essex, which town his father was defending, and was carried every day around the works with the hope of inducing Lord Capell to surrender the town.

== Political career ==
At the Restoration of the Monarchy, he was created on 20 April 1661 Viscount Malden and Earl of Essex, the latter earldom having become extinct on the death of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. It was granted with special remainder to the male issue of his father. Capell was also appointed Lord Lieutenant of Hertfordshire and a few years later Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire.

Early on he showed himself antagonistic to the court, to Roman Catholicism, and to the extension of the royal prerogative. Denzil Holles and Capell were deemed by King Charles II &quot;stiff and sullen men,&quot; who would not yield against their convictions to his solicitations. In 1669 he was sent as ambassador to King Christian V of Denmark, in which capacity he gained credit by refusing to strike his flag to the governor of Kronborg.

In 1672 he was made a Privy Councillor and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It is clear that he was aligned to Charles&#x27;s policy in 1672 and supported the Declaration of Indulgence especially in so far as it affected dissenters (and potentially extending this to Catholics, but this was always an ambiguous point). 

Essex had already developed a well-known tolerance towards and association with dissenters of all types, but subsequent events showed that this latitude did not apply to Catholics. He remained in office until 1677, and his administration was greatly commended by Burnet and James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, the former describing it &quot;as a pattern to all that come after him&quot;. Burnet&#x27;s viewpoint was not however unbiased, and whilst the administration of Essex&#x27;s brother as Lord Deputy in 1696 followed such a high-minded approach, his predecessors, such as Clarendon, Tyrconnel and Ormond&#x27;s own last period as viceroy could not be said to have followed Essex&#x27;s model. He paid close attention to Irish interests, and took immense pains to understand the constitution and the political necessities of the country, appointing men of real merit to office, and maintaining exceptional independence from solicitation and influence.

He proved to be a conscientious viceroy and, unlike so many other politicians of his age, he quickly showed an acumen for understanding accounts which was to lead to all kinds of challenges with the undertaking of Lord Ranelagh and his partners and with the same lord when he became vice-treasurer of Ireland in 1675. His conflict with Lord Ranelagh, to whom had been assigned the Irish revenues on condition of his supplying the requirements of the crown up to 1675, and whose accounts Essex refused to pass, was in many ways the principled struggle which was ultimately to lead to his recall – it was also an early sign as to how out of step Essex&#x27;s rectitude was with his contemporaries. He also strongly opposed the lavish gifts of forfeited estates to court favourites and mistresses, prevented the grant of Phoenix Park to the Duchess of Cleveland, and refused to encumber the administration by granting reversions. Finally, the intrigues of his enemies at home, and Charles&#x27;s continual demands for money, which Ranelagh undertook to satisfy, brought about his recall in April 1677.

He immediately joined the country party and the opposition to Lord Danby&#x27;s government, and on the latter&#x27;s fall in 1679 was appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and the same year a member of Sir William Temple&#x27;s new-modelled Council. Essex is often looked upon as a surprise appointment to his key treasury role, but, based on his experience in Ireland and his ability to go &#x27;toe to toe&#x27; with Danby on financial matters, it was in fact a sensible choice for Charles, and gave him the best option for balancing his financial options as the events leading to the Popish plot and Exclusion began to unfold. Essex followed the lead of Lord Halifax, who advocated not the exclusion of James, but the limitation of his sovereign powers, and looked to the Prince of Orange rather than to the Duke of Monmouth as the leader of Protestantism, incurring thereby the hostility of Lord Shaftesbury, but at the same time gaining the confidence of Charles.

He was appointed by Charles together with Halifax to hear the charges against the Duke of Lauderdale. In July 1679 he wrote a wise and statesmanlike letter to the king, advising him to renounce his project of raising a new company of guards. Together with Halifax, he urged Charles to summon the parliament, and after his refusal resigned the treasury in November, the real cause being, according to one account, a demand upon the treasury by the duchess of Cleveland for £25,000, according to another &quot;the niceness of touching French money,&quot; &quot;that makes my Lord Essex&#x27;s squeasy stomach that it can no longer digest his employment.&quot; This again is no surprise, for Essex&#x27;s high principles and sense of personal integrity, and probably his experience of the previous seven years, had made him less pliable and tolerant of the ambiguities in royal policy that made him able to support the Stop of the Exchequer and Royal Declaration of Indulgence in early 1672.

Subsequently, his political attitude underwent a change, the exact cause of which is not clear—probably a growing conviction of the dangers threatened by a Roman Catholic sovereign of the character of James. He now, in 1680, joined Shaftesbury&#x27;s party and supported the Exclusion Bill, and on its rejection by the Lords carried a motion for an association to execute the scheme of expedients promoted by Halifax. On 25 January 1681 at the head of fifteen peers he presented a petition to the king, couched in exaggerated language, requesting the abandonment of the session of parliament at Oxford. He was a jealous prosecutor of the Roman Catholics in the Popish Plot, and voted for Lord Stafford&#x27;s attainder. On the other hand, he interceded for Archbishop Plunkett, implicated in the pretended Irish Plot, but the King angrily replied that in view of Essex&#x27;s closeness to Shaftesbury, Plunkett&#x27;s blood was on his head: &quot;you could have saved him but would not, I cannot save him for I dare not&quot;. Essex, however, refused to follow Shaftesbury in his extreme courses, declined participation in the latter&#x27;s design to seize the Tower in 1682, and on Shaftesbury&#x27;s consequent departure from England became the leader of Monmouth&#x27;s faction, in which were now included Lord Russell, Algernon Sidney, and Lord Howard of Escrick.

Essex took no part in the wilder schemes of the party, but after the discovery of the Rye House Plot in June 1683, and the capture of the leaders, he was arrested at Cassiobury and imprisoned in the Tower.

== Rebuilds Cassiobury House ==

Between about 1677 and 1680, Arthur Capell rebuilt Cassiobury House in Watford, an ancient Tudor house inherited from his mother, Elizabeth Morrison, daughter and heiress of Sir Charles Morrison, 1st Baronet (1587–1628). At this time, Capell had moved the family seat from Hadham Hall to Cassiobury. The lavish reconstruction was undertaken by the architect, Hugh May. Capell also engaged the services of the leading wood carver of the day, Grinling Gibbons, and of the painter, Antonio Verrio, to create a sumptuous interior. The gardener, Moses Cook, also worked on the estate and dedicated his book &quot;The Manner of Raising, Ordering and Improving Forrest Trees&quot; (1679) to Capell.

This noted country house, stood for 250 years, until 1927, when like many other British country houses, it was demolished.

== Marriage and children ==
Arthur Capell married Lady Elizabeth Percy, daughter of Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland and Lady Anne Cecil, by whom he had children:
*Algernon Capell, 2nd Earl of Essex (1670–1710), only son and heir, who succeeded him in the earldom.
*Lady Anne Capell, wife of Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle.

== Death ==
The Earl of Essex died in the Tower of London on 13 July 1683, having been convicted of participation in the Rye House Plot against the King and his brother, and was said to have been discovered in his chamber with his throat cut whilst a prisoner awaiting execution for treason. According to Britton, the Earl of Essex&#x27;s death, by suicide, was controversial:

&quot;Lawrence Braddon., Gent of the Middle Temple states himself &#x27;upwards of 5 years persecuted or imprisoned for endeavouring to discover this murther the third day after the same was committed&#x27; &quot; The Dictionary of National Biography entry for Braddon says:-

&quot;When the Earl of Essex died in the Tower in 1683, Braddon adopted the belief that he had been murdered, and worked actively to collect sufficient evidence to prove the murder. He set on foot inquiries on the subject in London, and when a rumour reached him that the news of the earl&#x27;s death was known at Marlborough on the very day of, if not before, the occurrence, he posted off thither. When his action became known at court, he was arrested and put under restraint. For a time he was let out on bail, but on 7 Feb. 1683–4 he was tried with Mr. Hugh Speke at the king&#x27;s bench on the accusation of conspiring to spread the belief that the Earl of Essex was murdered by some persons about him, and of endeavouring to suborn witnesses to testify the same. Braddon was found guilty on all the counts, but Speke was acquitted of the latter charge. The one was fined 1,000l. and the other 2,000l., with sureties for good behaviour during their lives. Braddon remained in prison until the landing of William III, when he was liberated.&quot;

His death was attributed, quite groundlessly, to Charles and James, and the evidence points clearly if not conclusively to suicide, his motive being possibly to prevent an attainder and preserve his estate for his family. Gilbert Burnet, who knew Essex well, accepted that his death was suicide since Essex had often spoken of suicide as an honourable course. Lord Ailesbury wrote: &quot;The Earl asked very coldly for a razor to cut his nails, and being accustomed so to do gave no manner of suspicion. He went into a small closet,&quot; where his servant afterwards found him &quot;dead and wallowing in blood&quot;... the assumption being that the reason he &quot;cutt his own throat with a knife&quot; was because of his knowledge of the Rye House Plot. The King, who seemed genuinely distressed at the news of his death, remarked that Essex should have known that he would spare him, &quot;for I owe him a life&quot;, Essex&#x27;s father having died in the service of Charles I.

== Legacy ==
He was known as a statesman of strong and sincere patriotism, just and unselfish, conscientious and laborious in the fulfilment of public duties, and blameless in his official and private life. John Evelyn describes him as &quot;a sober, wise, judicious and pondering person, not illiterate beyond the rule of most noblemen in this age, very well versed in English history and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical and every way accomplished&quot;; and declares he was much deplored, few believing he had ever harboured any seditious designs. Capel Street in Dublin&#x27;s north inner city is named after him.

<doc id="194546" wikidata="Q749154" url="?curid=194546" title="The Chronic">
<text>The Chronic is the debut studio album by American record producer and rapper Dr. Dre. It was released on December 15, 1992, by his record label Death Row Records along with Interscope Records and distributed by Priority Records. The recording sessions took place at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.

&quot;The Chronic&quot; was Dr. Dre&#x27;s first solo album after he departed the West Coast hip hop group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute. It includes insults towards Ruthless Records and its owner, former N.W.A member and assembler Eazy-E. It features many appearances by then-emerging American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for boosting his solo career. The album&#x27;s title derives from a slang term for high-grade cannabis, and its cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. In 2023, to celebrate its 30th anniversary, the album was reissued by Dr. Dre&#x27;s current label Aftermath Entertainment, Death Row Records, and Interscope Records.

&quot;The Chronic&quot; reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has been certified triple platinum with sales of three million copies in the United States, making Dre one of the top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. &quot;The Chronic&quot; spent eight months in the Billboard Top 10. The album&#x27;s three singles became top ten &quot;Billboard&quot; singles. &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Rap Singles and Hot R&amp;B Singles charts.

Dr. Dre&#x27;s production popularized the G-funk subgenre within gangsta rap. &quot;The Chronic&quot; has been widely regarded as one of the most important and influential albums of the 1990s and one of the best-produced hip-hop albums. In 2019, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Music ==
=== Production ===
The production on &quot;The Chronic&quot; was seen as innovative and ground-breaking, and received universal acclaim from critics. AllMusic commented on Dr. Dre&#x27;s efforts, &quot;Here, Dre established his patented G-funk sound: fat, blunted Parliament-Funkadelic beats, soulful backing vocals, and live instruments in the rolling basslines and whiny synths&quot; and that &quot;For the next four years, it was virtually impossible to hear mainstream hip-hop that wasn&#x27;t affected in some way by Dre and his patented G-funk.&quot; Unlike other hip hop acts (such as The Bomb Squad) that sampled heavily, Dr. Dre only utilized one or few samples per song. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, where Dr. Dre was listed at number 56, Kanye West wrote on the album&#x27;s production quality: &quot;&quot;The Chronic&quot; is still the hip-hop equivalent to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. It&#x27;s the benchmark you measure your album against if you&#x27;re serious.&quot;

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the production, writing &quot;The bottom register is swampy synthesizer bass lines that openly emulate Parliament-Funkadelic; the upper end is often a lone keyboard line, whistling or blipping incessantly. In between are wide-open spaces that hold just a rhythm guitar, sparse keyboard chords.&quot; Pareles observed that the songs &quot;were smoother and simpler than East Coast rap, and [Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg] decisively expanded the hip-hop audience into the suburbs.&quot; Until this point, mainstream hip hop had been primarily party music (for example, Beastie Boys) or pro-empowerment and politically charged (for example, Public Enemy or X-Clan), and had consisted almost entirely of samples and breakbeats. Dr. Dre ushered in a new musical style and lyrics for hip hop. The beats were slower and mellower, samples from late 1970s and early 1980s funk music. By mixing these early influences with original live instrumentation, a distinctive genre known as G-funk was created.

=== Lyrics ===
The album&#x27;s lyrics caused some controversy, as the subject matter included sexism and violent representations. It was noted that the album was a &quot;frightening amalgam of inner-city street gangs that includes misogynist sexual politics and violent revenge scenarios&quot;.
Most of the N.W.A members were addressed on the album; Eazy-E and Ice Cube were dissed on the second single &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day&quot;, while MC Ren however was shouted out on the album&#x27;s intro. Dr. Dre&#x27;s of former bandmate, Eazy-E, resulted in vicious lyrics, which were mainly aimed at offending his enemy with homosexual implications, although it was noted to have &quot;a spirited cleverness in the phrasing and rhymes; in other words, the song is offensive, but it&#x27;s &quot;creatively&quot; offensive&quot;.

Snoop Dogg, who had a significant role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was stated that, &quot;Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop&#x27;s distinctive style made him a superstar before he&#x27;d even released a recording of his own&quot; and that his involvement was as important to the album&#x27;s success as its production. Touré of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarks that &quot;While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws.&quot; Snoop Dogg later commented on the &quot;reality&quot; of his lyrics, stating, &quot;My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can&#x27;t rap about something I don&#x27;t know. You&#x27;ll never hear me rapping about no bachelor&#x27;s degree. It&#x27;s only what I know and that&#x27;s that street life. It&#x27;s all everyday life, reality.&quot;

Snoop Dogg also spoke on the surprise of him performing on every song, &quot;When I listen back to &quot;The Chronic&quot; album, I’m like, how the fuck was I on damn near every song? I was whoopin’ niggas! They would be going home to go get chicken, I’d be in that motherfucker all night. If Dre even had half of a beat or had the drums, I’d write some shit to the drums and come up with a melody. Before you know it, I’m on a song.” 

Sheldon Pearce for Pitchfork (website) wrote, &quot;Snoop was at the center of a writer’s room that Dre had taken to calling the Death Row Inmates: The D.O.C., rapper-producer Daz Dillinger and RBX (two of Snoop’s cousins), Kurupt, Lady of Rage (who Dre flew in from Manhattan), Snoop’s group 213 with Dre’s stepbrother Warren G and a little-known singer named Nate Dogg, and the First Lady of Death Row, the R&amp;B vocalist Jewell. This oddball crew convened at Dre’s Calabasas mansion and the Solar studios with musicians Colin Wolfe and Chris “The Glove” Taylor, smoking, bonding, writing, and recording, punching in and exchanging ideas. Dre gave shape to L.A.’s present and future. His dispatch from inside a city in transition not only furthered its sense of place in the world beyond but helped affect the place it was becoming.&quot;

Dre’s &quot;Chronic&quot; cowriter, multi-instrumentalist Colin Wolfe, told Wax Poetics in 2014, “At the same time [Dre and I] were like, ‘We need to do some P-Funk–sounding shit, We wanted to make a real Parliament-Funkadelic album.” 

== Singles ==
Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot;, &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day&quot; and &quot;Let Me Ride&quot;.

&quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; was released as the first single on November 19, 1992. It peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks and Hot Rap Singles. It sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Platinum on March 24, 1993. The song was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1994 Grammy Awards, but lost to Digable Planets&#x27; &quot;Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)&quot;. Steve Huey of AllMusic named it &quot;&quot;the&quot; archetypal G-funk single&quot; and added &quot;The sound, style, and performances of &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; were like nothing else on the early-&#x27;90s hip-hop scene.&quot; He praised Snoop Dogg&#x27;s performance, stating &quot;[Snoop Dogg&#x27;s] flow was laconic and relaxed, massively confident and capable of rapid-fire tongue-twisters, but coolly laid-back and almost effortless at the same time&quot;. It was voted in a VH1 poll as the 13th best song of the 1990s.

&quot;Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody&#x27;s Celebratin&#x27;)&quot; was released as the second single on May 20, 1993, and like the previous single, it was a hit on multiple charts. It reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number six on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. It sold over 800,000 units and the RIAA certified it Gold on October 8, 1993. Allmusic writer Steve Huey stated that the song was &quot;a classic hip-hop single&quot;, citing Dr. Dre&#x27;s production as &quot;impeccable as ever, uniting his signature whiny synth melodies with a halting, descending bass line, a booming snare, and soulful female vocals in the background&quot; and alluded to Snoop Dogg, stating &quot;Attitude was something Snoop had by the boatload, his drawling, laid-back delivery projecting unassailable control – it sounded lazy even though it wasn&#x27;t, and that helped establish Snoop&#x27;s don&#x27;t-give-a-damn persona.&quot; The track contains direct insults to rappers East coast rapper Tim Dog, 2 Live Crew member Luke, and Dre&#x27;s former accomplices Eazy-E &amp; Ice Cube.

&quot;Let Me Ride&quot; was released as a cassette single on September 13, 1993. It experienced moderate success on the charts, reaching number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number three on the Hot Rap Singles. The song won Dr. Dre Best Rap Solo Performance at the 1994 Grammy Awards. On this song and &quot;Nuthin but a &quot;G&quot; Thang&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that Dr. Dre&#x27;s verses were delivered with a &quot;hypnotically intimidating ease&quot; and made the songs feel like &quot;dusk on a wide-open L.A. boulevard, full of possibility and menace&quot;.

== Album cover ==
The album cover was heavily inspired by the &quot;We Want Eazy&quot; single cover (which was also intended to be a tribute to Zig-Zag Cigarette rolling papers by Zig-Zag. Zig-Zag rolling papers are commonly known in cannabis culture to be used to roll up cannabis).

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Havelock Nelson wrote that the album &quot;drops raw realism and pays tribute to hip-hop virtuosity.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it &quot;storms with rage, strolls with confidence, and reverberates with a social realism that&#x27;s often ugly and horrifying&quot;. Matty C of &quot;The Source&quot; claimed that Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Slick Rick-esque style&quot; produces &quot;new ground for West Coast MCs&quot; and that the album is &quot;an innovative and progressive hip-hop package that must not be missed.&quot; Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; found &quot;Dre&#x27;s prowess as beat-master and street preacher&quot; to be &quot;undeniable&quot;. Jonathan Gold of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that, although the rappers lack &quot;quick wit&quot; and &quot;rhythmic virtuosity&quot;, Dre&#x27;s artistry is &quot;on a par with Phil Spector&#x27;s or Brian Wilson&#x27;s.&quot; Gold argued that, because Dre recreates rather than samples beats and instrumental work, the finished album&#x27;s fidelity is not inflected by that of &quot;scratchy R&amp;B records that have been played a million times&quot;, unlike productions from East Coast hip hop.

Greg Kot was less enthusiastic in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, deeming &quot;The Chronic&quot; superficial, unrefined entertainment, while writing that &quot;Dre combines street potency with thuggish stupidity in equal measure.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau dismissed it as &quot;sociopathic easy-listening&quot; and &quot;bad pop music&quot; whose innovation—Dre&#x27;s departure from sampling—is not inspired by contemporary P-Funk, but rather blaxploitation soundtracks, which led him to combine preset bass lines with imitations of &quot;Bernie Worrell&#x27;s high keyb sustain, a basically irritating sound that in context always signified fantasy, not reality—stoned self-loss or, at a best Dre never approaches, grandiose jive.&quot; He felt that the brutal lyrical threats were vague and lacked detail, but that Snoop Dogg rhymed &quot;&quot; and less dully than Dre. &quot;Select&quot;″s Adam Higginbotham opined that &quot;The Chronic&quot; was not as strong as releases from other gangster rap artists such as Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob and found it neither as &quot;musically sharp, nor as lyrically smart as the latter&quot;. His review concluded that the album sounded like &quot;all the pedestrian bits from &quot;The Predator&quot;&quot;, but that it was still better than anything Eazy-E had released. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; noted that &quot;all of Dre&#x27;s production wizardry can&#x27;t mask the nasty misogyny that is essential to his mythos.&quot;

In a retrospective piece, Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;The Chronic&quot; and Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot; &quot;made the gangsta life sound like a party occasionally interrupted by gunplay&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey compared Dr. Dre to his inspiration, George Clinton, stating &quot;Dre&#x27;s just as effortlessly funky, and he has a better feel for a hook, a knack that improbably landed gangsta rap on the pop charts&quot;. Rhapsody writer Brolin Winning named the album as &quot;an untouchable masterpiece of California Gangsta Rap&quot; and that it had &quot;track after track of G-Funk gems&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was noted that &quot;Dre funked up the rhymes with a smooth bass-heavy production style and the laid-back delivery of then-unknown rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Josh Tyrangiel states that Dr. Dre created &quot;a sound that defined early 90s urban L.A. in the same way that Motown defined 60s Detroit&quot;. Laura Sinagra, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), said that &quot;The Chronic&quot; &quot;features system-busting Funkadelic beats designed to rumble your woofer while the matter-of-fact violence of the lyrics blows your smoke-filled mind&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In 1994, &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &quot;G&quot; Thang&quot; and &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; were nominated at the 36th Grammy Awards, with the latter winning Best Rap Solo Performance for Dr. Dre. That year, readers of &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot; voted it the fourth best album of all time, leading the magazine to speculate, &quot;In a few years&#x27; time, it could even be remembered as &quot;the&quot; best rap album of all time.&quot;

&quot;The Chronic&quot; was included in &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century, and the magazine later included it in their list of the Top 10 Rap Albums of All Time, dubbing it a &quot;decade-defining opus&quot;. The record was voted as one of the top 10 pop albums of the 1990s by the music writers of The Associated Press. The record was ranked eighth in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;90 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;, and in 2005, it was ranked at number thirty-five in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Chronic&quot; at number 138 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and at 37 in their 2020 update. In 2005, MTV Networks listed &quot;The Chronic&quot; as the third greatest hip hop album in history. The following year, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it as one of &quot;The All-&quot;Time&quot; 100 Albums&quot;. In a retrospective issue, &quot;XXL&quot; magazine awarded &quot;The Chronic&quot; a perfect &quot;XXL&quot; rating. &quot;The Source&quot;, who originally gave the album a rating of 4.5 out of 5 mics in 1993, would later include it in their list of the 100 Best Rap Albums; in 2008, the magazine&#x27;s former editor Reginald Dennis remarked that he &quot;would have given it a five&quot; in retrospect—the magazine&#x27;s editors had a strict rule forbidding five-mic ratings at the time—and that &quot;no one could have predicted the seismic shift that this album would produce&quot;. &quot;The Chronic&quot; is listed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
As of 2015, the album has sold 5.7 million copies in the United States, and was certified Triple Platinum by RIAA on November 3, 1993. It is Dr. Dre&#x27;s second-bestselling album, as his follow-up album, &quot;2001&quot;, was certified sextuple Platinum. The album first appeared on music charts in 1993, peaking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number three, and peaking on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums at number one. &quot;The Chronic&quot; spent eight months in the Billboard Top 10. The album&#x27;s three singles became top ten &quot;Billboard&quot; singles. &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &quot;G&quot; Thang&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at number one on both the Hot Rap Singles and Hot R&amp;B Singles charts. &quot;Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody&#x27;s Celebratin&#x27;)&quot; became a top ten single on four different charts, including the Hot R&amp;B Singles (number 6) and the Hot 100 (number 8).

&quot;The Chronic&quot; didn&#x27;t chart on the UK Albums Chart until 2000. It re-entered the charts in 2003, peaking on the Ireland Albums Top 75 at number 48, and on the UK Albums Top 75 in 2004 at number 43. As of 2015, it has sold 260,814 copies there.

== Legacy ==

Having split from N.W.A, Dr. Dre&#x27;s first solo album established him as one of the biggest hip hop stars of his era. Yahoo! Music writer S.L. Duff wrote of the album&#x27;s impact on his status in hip hop at the time, stating &quot;Dre&#x27;s considerable reputation is based on this release, alongside his production technique on Snoop&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot;&quot; and his early work with N.W.A. Whatever one thinks of the over-the-top bravado rapping, the tracks and beats Dre assembled are beyond reproach&quot;. &quot;The Chronic&quot; brought G-funk to the mainstream – a genre defined by slow bass beats and melodic synthesizers, topped by P-Funk samples, female vocals, and a laconic, laid-back lyrical delivery referred to as a &quot;lazy drawl&quot;. The album takes its name from a slang term for premium grade cannabis, chronic. The album cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. Robert Christgau said that, although he &quot;can&#x27;t stand&quot; it, he respects &quot;The Chronic&quot; &quot;for its influence and iconicity&quot;.

The album launched the careers of West Coast hip hop artists, including Snoop Doggy Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and Warren G, Dr. Dre&#x27;s stepbrother – all of whom pursued successful commercial careers. &quot;The Chronic&quot; is widely regarded as the album that re-defined West Coast hip hop, demonstrated gangsta rap&#x27;s commercial potential as a multi-platinum commodity, and established G-funk as the most popular sound in hip hop music for several years after its release, with Dr. Dre producing major albums that drew heavily on his production style. The album&#x27;s success established Death Row Records as a dominant force in 1990s hip hop. It has been re-released three times, first as a remastered CD, then as a remastered DualDisc with enhanced stereo and four videos, and in 2009 as &quot;The Chronic Re-Lit&quot; with a bonus DVD containing a 30-minute interview and 7 unreleased tracks. On April 20, 2020, the album was distributed across all major streaming services, as it had previously been an Apple Music exclusive since 2015.

However, on March 13, 2022, the album (along with several other Death Row albums) was removed from streaming services, with speculation that Snoop Dogg (who had acquired the label the previous month) wanted to turn the albums into NFTs. In January 2023, it was reported that as part of a deal with Universal Music Group and Shamrock Holdings for his music assets, the masters for the album were set to transfer from Death Row back to Dre in August of the same year, with the masters then being transferred to UMG as part of the deal. The following month, Dre announced that he has regained control of rights to the album (through his company Ary, Inc.) and restored the album to streaming services through the album&#x27;s original distributor, Interscope Records.

<text>The Shebaa Farms, also spelled Sheba&#x27;a Farms (, &#x27;; &quot;Havot Sheba‘a),&quot; also known asMount Dov (), is a strip of land on the Lebanese–Syrian border that is currently occupied by Israel. Lebanon claims the Shebaa Farms as its own territory, and Syria agrees with this position. Israel claims it is part of the Golan Heights, Syrian territory that it has occupied since 1967 and effectively annexed in 1981. This dispute plays a significant role in contemporary Israel–Lebanon relations.

The territory is named for the farms within it which were historically tended by the inhabitants of the Lebanese town of Shebaa. It is about long and wide. The French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon administration did not demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria, nor was this done later by Lebanese and Syrian governments. Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that inhabitants paid taxes to the Lebanese government. From the early 1950s to Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Golan Heights in the Six-Day War, Syria was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruling power. In 1978 Israel invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon. In 1981, the Golan Heights, including the Shebaa Farms, were annexed by Israel, a move not recognized by the international community. Israel considers it part of the Golan Heights and continues to hold it, along with the Golan, under military occupation.

The territory has been a flashpoint for violence since Israel withdrew from Lebanon in May 2000. Hezbollah claimed that the withdrawal was not complete because Shebaa was on Lebanese – not Syrian – territory. Following the Israeli withdrawal, the UN certified the completion of Israel&#x27;s pullout.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC/6878&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later the United Nations Secretary General issued a statement proposing the area for the operations of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon; in the statement the controversy was described, with 81 different maps being studied; the UN concluded that there is no evidence of the abandoned farmlands being Lebanese, but proposed to maintain the existing boundaries of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Syria (which had included the Shebaa Farms since 1967) &quot;without prejudice&quot; to any future agreement between Syria and Lebanon.

Low-level conflict continued in the area from 2000 to 2006 and in early 2015. In August 2008, the president of Lebanon, Michel Suleiman, stated: &quot;The countdown for liberating the rest of our lands has begun. And today I confirm the [use] of all available and legitimate means to achieve this goal&quot;.

==Geography==
Shebaa Farms is an area about long, and wide; about ; 5,400 acres). The area contains 14 farms. Shebaa Farms is located about southwest of the Lebanese village of Shebaa, and about northwest of the Druze village of Majdal Shams. Shebaa Farms is on the southeastern side of a long, broad ridge descending to the southwest from Mount Hermon. The northwestern edge of the area corresponds to the international Lebanese–Syrian border recognized by the United Nations along that ridge. The southeastern edge follows Wadi al-Asal (Nahal Si&#x27;on), a 16 km long wadi that flows into Israel, draining a portion of the relatively precipitation-rich Hermon ridge in the northern Golan Heights. These &quot;edges&quot; are connected by the Shebaa Farms area&#x27;s northeastern limit 2.5 km east of IDF military camp at Har Dov as defined by a 2007 UN report.

The same report defines the southwestern limit as a line roughly following the foot of the ridge and starting at just over a kilometer northwest of Banias, then running northwest to the international Lebanese–Syrian border&#x27;s sharp turning point 3.4 km east of Ghajar and 1.0 km &quot;south of the (Lebanese) village of El Majidiye.&quot; This southwestern limit of Shebaa Farms comes within about 1 km of the 1949 Armistice Line, international border between Israel and Syria. The only overland route between Lebanon and Syria south of the Mount Hermon ridge used to run between these two lines. The small farms in this area have not been used since the Six-Day War. The area includes heights overlooking parts of southern Lebanon and Israel to the west. Elevations range from about 250 to about 1,500 m (825–4,940 ft).

==Terminology==
Lebanese press and officials often refer to the northern, higher part of the Shebaa Farms, just southeast of the Lebanese village of Kafr Shuba, as the Kafr Shuba Hills. The wide mountainous ridge in that part is called Jabel Rus (the mountain of the heads) in Arabic.

Israel refers to this northern, higher part as &quot;Har Dov&quot; (Mount Dov) after Dov Rodberg, an IDF officer killed there in 1970.

==History==

Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that some local inhabitants regarded themselves as part of Lebanon, but after the French mandate ended in 1946 the land was administered by Syria, and represented as such on maps of the time, Syrian and Lebanese military maps. Shebaa Farms were then occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Syria accepts the Lebanese claim on Shebaa Farms, but refuses any binding demarcation.

When Israel captured the Golan Heights in 1967, Shebaa Farms was considered Syrian territory. Lebanon was not an active participant in the war. In 1981 Israel extended Israeli law to the region under its Golan Heights Law. The United Nations Security Council declared this extension of &quot;[Israeli] laws, jurisdiction and administration... null and void and without international legal effect&quot; in Resolution 497, which was not passed with Chapter VII enforcement powers.

A controversy arose following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Southern Lebanon on 24 May 2000. On 18 June 2000, the United Nations affirmed that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon, in accordance with Resolution 425. Syria and Lebanon disputed the United Nations certification that Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon was complete. Hezbollah cites the occupation of Shebaa Farms as one reason for its continued attacks on Israel.

For decades the international diplomatic community has requested that Syria and Lebanon take steps to determine the exact boundary and officially register the demarcated border with the United Nations. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has refused. On 31 October 2007, the definition of the physical extent of the Shebaa Farms area by former UN cartographer Miklos Pinther was released by the UN. This could be a prelude to an eventual negotiated demarcation of the territory. By October 2013, neither party had officially responded to the proposal.

===Territorial dispute===

The dispute over the sovereignty of Shebaa Farms resulted in part from the failure of the French Mandate administrations, and subsequently the Lebanese and Syrian governments, to demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria. Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that local inhabitants paid taxes to the Lebanese government, while French officials expressed confusion as to the actual location of the border. One French official in 1939 declared that the uncertainty was sure to cause trouble in the future.

The region continued to be represented in the 1930s and 1940s as Syrian territory, under the French Mandate. Detailed maps showing the border were produced by the French in 1933, and again in 1945. After the French Mandate ended in 1946, the land was administered by Syria and represented as such on maps of the time.

Border disputes erupted from time to time, also with respect to land ownership in other border villages. Syria and Lebanon formed a joint Syrian-Lebanese border committee in the late 1950s to demarcate a border between the two nations. In 1964, the committee suggested that the area be deemed the property of Lebanon and recommended that the international border be reestablished consistent with its suggestion. Neither Syria nor Lebanon adopted the committee&#x27;s suggestion, and neither country took any action along the suggested lines. Thus, maps of the area continued to reflect the area as being in Syria. Even maps of both the Syrian and Lebanese armies continued to demarcate the region within Syrian territory.

A number of local residents regarded themselves as Lebanese but the Lebanese government showed little interest in their views. The Syrian government administered the region, and on the eve of the 1967 war, the region was under effective Syrian control.

In 1967 most Shebaa Farms land owning farmers lived outside the Syrian-controlled region, across the Lebanese–Syrian border, in the Lebanese village of Shebaa. After the Six-Day War, the landowners were no longer able to farm it.

===Operation Litani===
In 1978 Israel invaded southern Lebanon in Operation Litani. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 425, calling on Israel &quot;to withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebanese territory&quot;. The phrase &quot;all territory&quot; was used in Resolution 425, in contrast to the language in Resolution 242 (1967), which led to semantic disputes.

On 22 May 2000, Israel completed its withdrawal from southern Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 425. The UN certified the completion of Israel&#x27;s pullout.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC/6878&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks by Hezbollah ===
Between 2000 and 2005, Hezbollah attacked the IDF at Shebaa/Har Dov 33 times, resulting in seven Israeli soldiers killed in action, three taken prisoner, and dozens wounded.

On 26 April 2024, an Israeli Bedouin truck driver was killed at Har Dov during infrastructure works as a result of an anti-tank missile strike by Hezbollah.

== Positions==

=== Lebanon===
In 2000, Lebanon disputed Israel&#x27;s compliance with Resolution 425. Lebanon claimed that the Shebaa Farms area was actually Lebanese and demanded that the Israelis should therefore withdraw from there as well. Lebanon asserted that the UN certification of the Israeli withdrawal was &quot;invalid&quot;, because of Lebanon&#x27;s claim to the farms.

Lebanese officials point to land deeds, stamped by the Lebanese government, that were held by a number of area residents in the 1940s and 1950s. The Lebanese claim to this area is asserted by Hezbollah for its hostilities with Israel and its cross-border attacks after the Israeli withdrawal. Senior Lebanese officials also linked the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Shebaa to Hezbollah&#x27;s disarmament. &quot;If the U.S. and friendly countries help us achieve the withdrawal of Israel from Shebaa Farms, this would make it possible for the Lebanese forces to be the sole owner of weapons and arms in the country&quot;, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Seniora said. Those comments were echoed by Lebanese President Émile Lahoud who said that &quot;the resistance should be kept until a just and comprehensive peace is achieved in the region&quot;, adding that &quot;if the Lebanese army were deployed along the borders (with Israel) ... it would be turned into a police force to protect Israel&#x27;s borders, and this is not acceptable.&quot;

Walid Jumblatt, a Lebanese Druze politician and leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, stated that Lebanon has no claims to the Shebaa Farms. The prime minister and president stated that Lebanon has a claim to the area. On 28 August 2006, Hezbollah fighters withdrew from positions facing Israeli occupation lines in the Shebaa Farms area.

Maps published on the Lebanese army website show different versions of the Lebanese southern border. The Shebaa Farms are not marked on the maps but it is evident from one map that the border runs north of the Shebaa Farms, while another map marks the border south of the farms.

According to the Arab newspaper, &quot;Al-Hayat&quot;, &quot;The issue over these farms was created to justify resistance operations from Lebanon after the UN had created the Blue Line following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon. The Shebaa Farms were placed inside Syrian territory. Syria, which claims that the farms are Lebanese, has not presented a single document to the UN to prove it. Moreover, Syria refuses to demarcate its borders with Lebanon.&quot;

=== Syria ===
Syria has supported Lebanon&#x27;s claim that the Shebaa Farms are part of Lebanon and not Syrian territory, at the UN and in official government press releases. But at other times it has made contrary statements. On 16 May 2000, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Shara, indicated to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a telephone conversation that Syria supported Lebanon&#x27;s claim. This was made public in the UN Press Release SC/6878 of 18 June 2000 which stated: &quot;Concerning the Shab&#x27;a farmlands, both Lebanon and Syria state that this land belongs to Lebanon.&quot;

On 21 January 2006, President of Syria Bashar al-Assad spoke before the convention of the Arab Lawyers Union in Damascus which was translated into English by the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) He said there are two legal requirements for demarcating the border: first, the complaint must be registered with the UN; and second, engineers must precisely define the border. As neither Syria nor Lebanon have access to the area, Assad argues that resolution is waiting on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territory.

In an interview with Assad reported by SANA on 24 August 2006, Assad flatly refused demarcation of the Syrian/Lebanese border near Shebaa Farms before a withdrawal of Israeli troops.

Former Vice President of Syria Abdel-Halim Khaddam, in an interview with the Lebanese Future Television on 27 August 2006, said: &quot;Saying that the farms are occupied, and hence cannot be demarcated, is nothing but a pretext. The demarcation would not take more than an hour if there was a political will.&quot;

In a 28 February 2011 one-on-one meeting with an American diplomat, Assad declared that both Shebaa Farms and Kfar Shuba Hills were Syrian territory and not Lebanese.

=== Israel===
Israel claims that the area is not covered by UN Security Council Resolution 425, which governed Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon, stating that the Farms were not Lebanese territory. In support of that view, Israel points to the fact that the UN certified Israel&#x27;s pullout from Lebanon as having been completed.

Israel says the land was Syrian when it was captured during the Six-Day War, and the dispute is being used by Hezbollah to continue its attacks on Israel.

=== US ===
John Bolton, in his capacity as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, said on 26 April 2006: &quot;I think the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence is that Shebaa Farms is Syrian territory.&quot;

Former US president Jimmy Carter suggested in &quot;the Washington Post&quot; on 1 August 2006, that: &quot;Israel should withdraw from all Lebanese territory, including Shebaa Farms.&quot;

In June 2008, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Beirut, stating that &quot;the United States believes that the time has come to deal with the Shebaa Farms issue ... in accordance with [U.N. Security Council Resolution] 1701.&quot;

=== UN ===

The United Nations certified Israel&#x27;s pullout under Resolution 425 as conforming to the &quot;withdrawal line&quot; it had laid down in accordance with the maps at its disposal &quot;for the practical purpose of confirming the Israeli withdrawal&quot;. At the same time the UN noted that its decision was &quot;without prejudice to future border agreements between the Member States concerned,&quot; referring to Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. The UN stated:
:&quot;On May 15, 2000, the United Nations received a map, dated 1966, from the Government of Lebanon which reflected the Government&#x27;s position that these farmlands were located in Lebanon. The United Nations is in possession of ten other maps issued after 1966 by various Lebanese government institutions, including the Ministry of Defense and the army, all of which place the farmlands inside the Syrian Arab Republic. The United Nations has also examined six maps issued by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, including three maps since 1966, which place the farmlands inside the Syrian Arab Republic.&quot;

In April 2002, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said:
:&quot;With reference to the disturbances along the Blue Line emanating from Lebanese territory, I call on the Government of Lebanon and all relevant parties to condemn and prevent such violations. The Security Council itself confirmed in June 2000 that Israel had withdrawn from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolutions 425 and 426. Attacks at any point along the Blue Line, including in the Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights, are violations of Security Council resolutions. Respect for decisions of the Security Council is the most basic requirement of international legitimacy.&quot;

On 20 January 2005, UN Secretary-General&#x27;s report on Lebanon stated:
:&quot;The continually asserted position of the Government of Lebanon that the Blue Line is not valid in the Shab&#x27;a farms area is not compatible with Security Council resolutions. The Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for purposes of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978). The Government of Lebanon should heed the Council’s repeated calls for the parties to respect the Blue Line in its entirety.&quot;

The BBC quoted Timur Goksel, then spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as saying that &quot;no-one disputed that the village of Shebaa itself was in Lebanon, but most of the farms fell into an undefined area that may be either in Lebanon or Syria&quot; and although the UN was not a &quot;boundary marking authority [...] on all maps the UN has been able to find, the farms are seen on the Syrian side [of the border].&quot;

In 2006, Terje Rød-Larsen, the UN special envoy on implementation of Resolution 1559, declared that &quot;the Shaba Farms area is not part of Lebanon. Therefore, any Lebanese &#x27;resistance&#x27; to &#x27;liberate&#x27; the area from continued Israeli occupation cannot be considered legitimate.&quot;

Following the Israeli war against Hezbollah in 2006, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 called for the &quot;Delineation of the international borders of Lebanon, especially in those areas where the border is disputed or uncertain, including in the Shebaa Farms area.&quot;

=== Arab League ===
The Arab League backed Lebanon&#x27;s claim with a communique issued at Arab League&#x27;s 13th session in 2001, asking for &quot;complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining occupied Lebanese territory up to the internationally recognized borders, including the Shab`a farmlands&quot;.

A joint meeting of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in November 2023 passed a resolution which called for an &quot;end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including East Al-Quds, the occupied Syrian Golan, and the Lebanese Shebaa Farms, Kafr Shuba hills, and the outskirts of the town of al-Mari, and the implementation of the two-state
solution.&quot;

=== Historical documents ===
In 2002, Asher Kaufman of the Harry S. Truman Research Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, discovered previously unknown documents in French government archives. In one, French litigants in a private dispute entered into a private commercial agreement that suggested that the border should put the Farms in Lebanon. Two other documents, from 1937 and 1939, were reports from the administrative councilor of south Lebanon and the head of the Services Spéciaux in the Syrian town of Quneitra. They noted a discrepancy between the border, as determined by the 1:200,000 Ottoman map, and their view of the &quot;reality&quot; in the region. Collecting &quot;unofficial information&quot; from &quot;various sources,&quot; they concluded that in their view the area was Lebanese. Their conclusion was based on the facts that: a) some area residents paid taxes to Lebanon; and b) three or four sheep pens in the Farms belonged to residents of the Lebanese village of Shaba.

In a book published in 1988, Moshe Brawer, an Israeli geographer, mentions two French maps published in 1932 and 1946, the former shows the farm area as being part of Lebanon while the latter shows the area as a Syrian territory.

<text>Freddie Keppard (sometimes rendered as Freddy Keppard; February 27, 1890 – July 15, 1933) was an American jazz cornetist who once held the title of &quot;King&quot; in the New Orleans jazz scene. This title was previously held by Buddy Bolden and succeeded by Joe Oliver.

==Early life and career in New Orleans==
Keppard (pronounced in the French fashion, with relatively even accentuation and a silent &quot;d&quot;) was born in the Creole of Color community of downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. 

Born in 1890, Keppard was Buddy Bolden&#x27;s junior by thirteen years and Louis Armstrong&#x27;s senior by eleven years. Keppard&#x27;s father, Louis Keppard Sr., had been a New Orleans man and had worked as a cook in the Vieux Carré until his early death. His mother, Emily (Peterson) Keppard, was from St. James parish. His older brother, Louis, was his elder by two years and also became a professional musician later in life. The first tune they learned to play together was called &quot;Just Because She Made Dem Goo-Goo Eyes&quot;, a tune by Hughie Cannon and popular New Orleans minstrel show star John Queen, published in 1900. 

Keppard was raised on Villere Street in New Orleans in a home environment filled with music. His mother first started him on the violin, while his brother Louis first played guitar. When he was still a young boy, he and Louis, who by then had become an aspiring guitarist, would disguise their age from police by putting on long pants before going to Basin Street to shine shoes for a nickel a shine, hoping to get in on the music scene and get advice or even tutelage from their favorite musicians in the District while shoe-shining. 

As such, Keppard did not receive any formal musical training and may have been a non-reader who, instead of reading arrangements, most likely learned all of his parts by ear and used his powerful and imaginative abilities to improvise parts that were even better.

Freddie played violin, mandolin, and accordion before switching to cornet. By the time he was ten years old, Freddie had already learned to play mandolin and was performing in a duo with Louis around their neighborhood. He did not begin playing cornet until he was sixteen. 

This is most likely because, according to Louis Keppard, one strategy available to aspiring string players in those days was to switch to brass instruments in order to get more job opportunities with brass bands in parades. The Keppards&#x27; mother apparently &quot;didn&#x27;t think much of this music&quot; until she saw them in their band uniforms, at which point Louis recalled that she became very proud.

As Freddie and Louis grew older, both brothers became band leaders in their own right and became part of the competitive New Orleans jazz scene. Freddie Keppard organized the Olympia Orchestra around 1905. This band featured Alphonse Picou on clarinet. As a Creole band, the Olympia Orchestra would have been expected to play a wide repertoire for a variety of gigs, and therefore could play &quot;legitimate&quot; enough to get society jobs, yet &quot;hot&quot; enough to get jobs at the uptown jazz halls a few years later. Louis Keppard led the Magnolia Orchestra, which became the regular band at Huntz&#x27;s and Nagel&#x27;s cabaret on Iberville in the District. The Magnolia Orchestra included Joe Oliver on cornet, who would later succeed Keppard&#x27;s title as &quot;King&quot; by winning a &quot;cutting contest&quot; against him.

After playing with the Olympia Orchestra, Freddie Keppard joined Frankie Dusen&#x27;s Eagle Band, taking the place recently vacated by Buddy Bolden. Soon after Bolden was off the music scene, Keppard was proclaimed &quot;King Keppard&quot; as the city&#x27;s top horn player (see: jazz royalty). This was mostly because he kept Buddy&#x27;s style, which was popular but had not been recorded. Indeed, many contemporaries have testified that Keppard&#x27;s playing style was the closest to Bolden&#x27;s that can be found in the history of jazz recordings and can be considered a more musical and sophisticated extension of Bolden&#x27;s style: rugged and forceful, clipped and more staccato, and rhythmically closer to ragtime than later New Orleans jazz.

==Original Creole Orchestra==

Sometime in either late 1911 or early 1912, bassist Bill Johnson, who had been making his career in Los Angeles, California since 1909, started the initiative to organize an &quot;Original Creole Ragtime Band&quot; to play the New Orleans style across the country. He invited players from his hometown of New Orleans, including Freddie Keppard, to join him in this enterprise. After Keppard accepted his invitation to play cornet for this band, Johnson managed to get Eddie Vinson on trombone, George Baquet on clarinet, Norwood Williams on guitar, Jimmy Palao on violin, and later Dink Johnson on drums. This group went on the Orpheum Theatre circuit out of San Francisco in 1913 as the &quot;Original Creole Orchestra&quot;.

In the following years, the band would tour Chicago and New York. In their 1915 performance at the Winter Garden, for a show entitled &quot;Town Topics&quot;, the group was billed as &quot;That Creole Band.&quot; Thus, Freddie Keppard was among the first musicians as well as the first cornetist to take the New Orleans ensemble style outside of the city. 

In 1914, Keppard&#x27;s band performed in Canada, at the Pantages Playhouse Theatres in Winnipeg, the first ever jazz performance outside the United States. This was the beginning of jazz as an international art form, although the name jazz was still a couple years in the future, the band performing as a ragtime band at the time.

Keppard, who signed one photograph of himself with a caption describing himself as the &quot;star cornetist&quot; of the &quot;Creole Ragtime Band,&quot; probably considered himself the star of the Original Creole Orchestra. Although he was the youngest member of the band, he is perhaps the most well-known of all of its members and is more often mentioned in histories of jazz. This is most likely because he was one of the few members to make surviving recordings. Because of his relative fame compared to the other band members, many assume that the Creole Band was led by Keppard. There is, however, no evidence that Keppard played any major role in the organization of the band (planning tours and events, choosing songs for the repertoire, signing contracts, etc.). As such, Bill Johnson was most likely the leader of the group.

From 1915 to 1917, the Original Creole Orchestra (sometimes also rendered as the &quot;Original Creole Band&quot;) landed jobs at Loew&#x27;s Orpheum, Lexington Opera House, and the Columbia Theater, as well as a return performance to the Winter Garden. Newspaper reviewers in New York commented on the &quot;rather ragged selection&quot; of the band&#x27;s repertoire as well as the &quot;comedy effect of the clarinet,&quot; a testament to the American public&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the &quot;hot&quot; style of New Orleans. During the band&#x27;s time on the east coast, other personnel who came to play in the Original Creole Orchestra included Bab Frank on piccolo and Big Eye Louis Nelson (De Lisle) on clarinet.

The Original Creole Orchestra, after touring the Vaudeville circuit, gave other parts of the USA a first taste of the music that was not yet known as &quot;jazz&quot;. While playing a successful engagement in New York City in 1915, the band was offered a chance to record for the Victor Talking Machine Company. This would probably have been the first jazz recording. An often repeated story says that Keppard didn&#x27;t want to record because then everyone else could &quot;steal his stuff.&quot; This fear, however, was not too far-fetched if we think forward to the Alligators in Chicago taking King Olivers&#x27; material, such as in the case of the recording of Oliver&#x27;s &quot;Eccentric&quot; by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. Another well known story is that he was so worried about being copied that he sometimes played with a handkerchief over his hand to conceal his fingering. Keppard&#x27;s famous tendency to hide his fingerings during performances, however, was most likely a publicity stunt intended only to amuse the crowd. After all, a real musician would steal by ear and not by eye. In any case, the recording company offered him a $25 flat fee to make a record (a fairly standard rate for non-star performers at the time), far less than he was earning on the Vaudeville circuit. His retort to this offer, according to Lawrence Gushee, was: &quot;Twenty-Five dollars? I drink that much gin in a day!&quot; The reminiscences of the other members of the Creole Orchestra reveal that another factor was that the Victor representative had asked them to make a &quot;test recording&quot; without pay. The band balked, fearing it was a ploy to have them make records without being paid. Another popular rumor which traveled through some of the New York jazz circles for some time also suggested that Keppard had refused to record because he had been afraid of being cheated by the record company and had demanded the same fees as that of the Victor Company&#x27;s highest paid and best-selling artist of the time, Enrico Caruso.

The band continued touring successfully until the group finally broke up in 1918. According to Dave Peyton, who had been the leader of the Grand Theater Orchestra in 1915, the Original Creole Band had been so popular when the group hit Chicago that they &quot;were bidded for by every theatrical agency in the city.&quot; They were so popular, in fact, that, a few years after the band dissolved, Peyton asserted that &quot;when they hit Broadway they were a great sensation and would be on the road today were it not for dissatisfaction among themselves and the loss of several of their members by death.&quot;

==Career in Chicago==
About 1917, Keppard settled in Chicago, which would remain his home (except for briefly going to the East Coast to work with Tim Brymn&#x27;s band about 1920). Soon after he had settled himself into the Chicago jazz scene, however, King Oliver became Chicago&#x27;s &quot;cornet king&quot; and was said to have attracted crowds by &quot;thrusting his horn out of a window and blowing Keppard down.&quot; Nevertheless, Keppard did well in finding continuous employment with a wide range of bandleaders, at one point leading his own group with Jimmie Noone on clarinet and Paul Barbarin on drums.

Keppard worked in Chicago both as a soloist and with the bands of Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, Erskine Tate, Doc Cook (for several years), Don Pasqual, Lil Hardin Armstrong, Ollie Powers, and John Wycliffe, all of which were highly respected local bands. Keppard was one of the first to bring jazz to the West Coast.

Don Pasqual, who played reed instruments for Doc Cook for some time, had much to say about Keppard&#x27;s contributions to Doc Cook&#x27;s band:

After he found steady employment in Chicago, Keppard&#x27;s style helped create a demand for more New Orleans groups, paving the way for other New Orleans players seeking to migrate north. Throughout his travels, Keppard sent back clippings to his fellow musicians in New Orleans, encouraging other bands to take their chances on the cross-country circuits.

==Recordings==
Sidney Bechet believed it was because Keppard was a &quot;good-time guy&quot; that he refused the Victor Company&#x27;s offer to make the first jazz recordings while he was still playing with the Original Creole Orchestra. In other words, he simply didn&#x27;t want to make the recordings because the Victor Company represented big business and commercialization. Thus, if Keppard had agreed to make recordings for them with the Original Creole Band, the music would no longer have been for pure enjoyment but would have been turned into a commodity.

In the Victor Company files, there is a listing for an unnumbered test recording for a song called &quot;Tack &#x27;em Down&quot; made by the &quot;Creole Jass Band&quot; on December 2, 1918 nearly two years after Keppard&#x27;s first performance in New York. This recording may have been Keppard and the Original Creole Band.

The first recordings of New Orleans/Dixieland jazz came out in the 1920s, nearly two decades after the &quot;hot&quot; New Orleans sound and style had first been developed. By the time musicians of color like Freddie Keppard were recording, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, an all-white band, had already made the first jazz recordings and had dominated the market for jazz recordings with their million-dollar hit &quot;Livery Stable Blues.&quot; The ODJB&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; came from a song Freddie Keppard performed. According to Keppard&#x27;s contemporaries, the barnyard effects in the ODJB&#x27;s version were jokes. As Mutt Carey, a fellow New Orleans trumpeter recalled, when Keppard was feeling good, &quot;he&#x27;d get devilish sometimes and he&#x27;d neigh on the trumpet like a horse&quot; to be humorous.

Musicians from Keppard&#x27;s time who had either worked with him or heard him play praised his technical abilities and creativity. Mutt Carey, while respecting King Oliver, spoke of Keppard as the king of New Orleans jazz, calling him the best cornetist before Louis Armstrong.

Willie Humphrey, a New Orleans jazz clarinetist, had also played with Freddie Keppard around the summer of 1919, at a time when half of New Orleans followed Joe Oliver and half the town followed Keppard. Humphrey recalled that Keppard was known as the musician&#x27;s musician, Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s favorite musician, and &quot;everybody&#x27;s all-star.&quot;

Jelly Roll Morton said of Freddie Keppard that he &quot;had the best ear, the best tone, and the most marvelous execution I ever heard.&quot; Buster Bailey, a clarinetist who played with both Joe Oliver and Louis Armstrong, recalled that Keppard &quot;could play as soft and as loud, as sweet and as rough, as you would want.&quot; Alberta Hunter, a blues singer and another artist who had been largely forgotten until she made her comeback in her eighties, also wondered why Freddie Keppard was often overlooked or unmentioned in many accounts of the histories of jazz. &quot;You know,&quot; she reportedly said, &quot;he doesn&#x27;t get the credit he should get.&quot;

Some of the commentary on Keppard&#x27;s playing, however, is admittedly quite contradictory. Of those who spoke of Keppard as a &quot;freak player,&quot; most referred to him in this way because of his ability to utilize a variety of mutes and playing techniques, such as flutter-tonguing and half-valving. Others, however, insist that Keppard was a &quot;much straighter player&quot; than Joe Oliver. Additionally, while qualified listeners like Jelly Roll Morton were full of praise for Keppard&#x27;s playing style, others like the younger Louis Armstrong is said to have described Keppard&#x27;s playing as &quot;fancy&quot; (in an unflattering sense of the word).

Keppard made all his known recordings in Chicago from 1923 to 1927. The only recordings he is certainly on are three sides under his own name (&quot;Freddie Keppard&#x27;s Jazz Cardinals&quot;), two with Erskine Tate&#x27;s Vendome Orchestra, and a dozen with Doc Cook&#x27;s Orchestra. These feature Keppard on second cornet. Second cornet was the logical and quite demanding seat for the premier cornetist in a two-cornet band, as evidenced by Louis Armstrong&#x27;s role (one example of many) in similar sized bands and orchestras around the same period. His &quot;Stockyard Strut&quot; is an improvisation on the chords of &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. Keppard contributed to the Doc Cook recordings, where he plays the &#x27;walking-talking&#x27; style of Stomp Cornet that pre-dates jazz by about a half generation. It follows ragtime by the same margin. Keppard may have appeared on a few other recordings; many more are often dubiously attributed to him. Keppard was widely imitated both in New Orleans and Chicago, including contemporaneous and highly regarded players such as Louis Panico and Frank Guarente. Other recordings Keppard made include songs titled &quot;Salty Dog,&quot; &quot;Adam&#x27;s Apple,&quot; &quot;Stomp Time Blues,&quot; and &quot;Messing Around.&quot;

Several musicians with clear memories of Buddy Bolden said that Freddie Keppard sounded the most like Bolden of anyone who recorded. This is how many jazz historians propose that Keppard got his fame but also how he lost it. Keppard did not have a sound of his own and he came up in between Buddy, Oliver, and Armstrong. Keppard was extremely talented but was not unique. Others, like Lawrence Gushee, insist that Keppard did have a unique approach to playing the cornet, which simply became overshadowed by Louis Armstrong&#x27;s powerful influence. Gushee describes Keppard as &quot;frequently on top of the beat or [anticipating] it,&quot; making his &quot;phrasing excitable, even tense.&quot; Whereas &quot;Armstrong seems to favor extended four or eight-measure structure, Keppard [built] his units out of shorter modules&quot; underscored by vibrato. Gushee also argues that Keppard used a much more &quot;rapid vibrato, more like an ornament, that could be used anyplace in a phrase.&quot; Armstrong and Keppard met, but unfortunately, their first encounter was a letdown; instead of playing with Armstrong on the band stand, Keppard left in order to talk to customers, including an attractive blonde.

Many contemporaries said that either Keppard was past his prime when he recorded or that his recordings do not do him justice, as Keppard&#x27;s health was already declining by the time he recorded in 1926. Even with the constraints, the recordings demonstrate that Keppard was a very proficient player and an adventurous improviser. Keppard&#x27;s style is much more raggy and characterized by a &quot;brusque and staccato style&quot; compared to Oliver&#x27;s blues-tinged style. While Oliver had more admirers, to some extent preference was a matter of taste. Jelly Roll Morton, Lil Hardin Armstrong, and Wellman Braud all thought Keppard superior to Oliver.

Keppard suffered from alcoholism and tuberculosis in his final years, although he continued performing despite illnesses. He was still playing loud in the early 1930s in Chicago, although, according to contemporaries, no longer very well. By 1932, Keppard was restricted in his employment most likely due to his continued physical degradation. According to medical records, he was unable to work by December 1932. He died in Chicago in 1933, largely forgotten. However, trumpet player Bob Shoffner recalled that in 1931 when Louis Armstrong&#x27;s band had been preparing to leave Chicago on a tour bus, Armstrong instructed the bus driver to stop in front of Keppard&#x27;s apartment. The band went up the stairs to offer their greetings to the &quot;old-timer.&quot;

<doc id="194551" wikidata="Q297816" url="?curid=194551" title="Sammy Davis Jr.">
<text>Samuel George Davis Jr. (December 8, 1925 – May 16, 1990) was an American singer, actor, comedian, dancer, and musician.

At age two, Davis began his career in Vaudeville with his father Sammy Davis Sr. and the Will Mastin Trio, which toured nationally, and his film career began in 1933. After military service, Davis returned to the trio and became a sensation following key nightclub performances at Ciro&#x27;s (in West Hollywood) in 1951, including one after the Academy Awards ceremony. With the trio, he became a recording artist. In 1954, at the age of 29, he lost his left eye in a car accident. Several years later, he converted to Judaism, finding commonalities between the oppression experienced both by black Americans and Jewish communities. In 1958, he faced a backlash for his involvement with a white woman at a time when interracial relationships were taboo in the U.S. and when interracial marriage was not legalized nationwide until 1967.

Davis had a starring role on Broadway in &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; with Chita Rivera (1956). In 1960, he appeared in the Rat Pack film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;. He returned to the stage in 1964 in a musical adaptation of Clifford Odets&#x27;s &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. Davis was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance. The show featured the first interracial kiss on Broadway. In 1966, he had his own TV variety show, titled &quot;The Sammy Davis Jr. Show&quot;. While Davis&#x27;s career slowed in the late 1960s, his biggest hit, &quot;The Candy Man&quot;, reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1972, and he became a star in Las Vegas, earning him the nickname &quot;Mister Show Business&quot;. Davis&#x27;s popularity helped break the race barrier of the segregated entertainment industry. One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. &quot;Handicap?&quot; he asked. &quot;Talk about handicap. I&#x27;m a one-eyed Negro who&#x27;s Jewish.&quot; This was to become a signature comment.

After reuniting with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin in 1987, Davis toured with them and Liza Minnelli internationally, before his death in 1990. He died in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, and his estate was the subject of legal battles after the death of his wife. His final album was a Country Music Album, a departure from his usual musical style. Davis was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award for his television performances. He was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1987, and in 2001, he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2017, Davis was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Davis was born on December 8, 1925, in the Harlem district of Manhattan in New York City, the son of African American entertainer and stage performer Sammy Davis Sr. (1900–1988) and Cuban-American tap dancer and stage performer Elvera Sanchez (1905–2000). During his lifetime, Davis stated that his mother was Puerto Rican and born in San Juan. However, in the 2003 biography &quot;In Black and White&quot;, author Wil Haygood wrote that Davis&#x27;s mother was born in New York City to Cuban parents who were of Afro-Cuban background, and that Davis claimed he was Puerto Rican because he feared anti-Cuban backlash would hurt his record sales. Davis&#x27;s parents were vaudeville dancers. As an infant, he was reared by his paternal grandmother. When he was three years old, his parents separated. His father, not wanting to lose custody of his son, took him on tour.
Davis learned to dance from his father and his godfather Will Mastin. Davis joined the act as a child, and they became the Will Mastin Trio. Throughout his career, Davis included the Will Mastin Trio in his billing. Mastin and his father shielded him from racism, for example by dismissing race-based snubs as jealousy. However, when Davis served in the United States Army during World War II, he was confronted by strong prejudice. He later said: &quot;Overnight the world looked different. It wasn&#x27;t one color any more. I could see the protection I&#x27;d gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I&#x27;d never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I&#x27;d walked through a swinging door for 18 years, a door which they had always secretly held open.&quot; At age seven, Davis played the title role in the film &quot;Rufus Jones for President&quot;, in which he sang and danced with Ethel Waters. He lived for several years in Boston&#x27;s South End and reminisced years later about &quot;hoofing and singing&quot; at Izzy Ort&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grille.

===Military service===
In 1944, during World War II, Davis was drafted into the U.S. Army at age 18. He was frequently abused by white soldiers from the South and later recounted: &quot;I must have had a knockdown, drag-out fight every two days.&quot; His nose was broken numerous times and permanently flattened. At one point he was offered a beer laced with urine.

He was reassigned to the Army&#x27;s Special Services branch, which put on performances for troops. At one show he found himself performing in front of soldiers who had previously racially abused him. Davis, who earned the American Campaign Medal and World War II Victory Medal, was discharged in 1945 with the rank of private. He later said, &quot;My talent was the weapon, the power, the way for me to fight. It was the one way I might hope to affect a man&#x27;s thinking.&quot;

==Career==
===1940s===
Following his discharge from the Army, Davis rejoined the family dance act, which played at clubs around Portland, Oregon. He also recorded blues songs for Capitol Records in 1949 under the pseudonyms Shorty Muggins and Charlie Green.

===1950s===

In March 1951, the Will Mastin Trio appeared at Ciro&#x27;s as the opening act for headliner Janis Paige. They were to perform for only 20 minutes, but the reaction from the celebrity-filled crowd was so enthusiastic, especially when Davis launched into his impressions, that they performed for nearly an hour, and Paige insisted the order of the show be flipped. Davis began to achieve success on his own and was singled out for praise by critics, releasing several albums.

In 1953, Davis was offered his own television show on ABC, &quot;Three for the Road—with the Will Mastin Trio&quot;. The network spent $20,000 filming the pilot, which presented African Americans as struggling musicians, not slapstick comedy or the stereotypical mammy roles of the time. The cast included Frances Davis, who was the first black ballerina to perform for the Paris Opera, actresses Ruth Attaway and Jane White, and Frederick O&#x27;Neal, who founded the American Negro Theater. The network could not get a sponsor, so the show was dropped.
In 1954, Davis was hired to sing the title song for the Universal Pictures film &quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot;. In 1956, he starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, which was panned by critics but was a commercial success, closing after 383 performances.

In 1958, Davis was hired to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest for the famed fourteenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by Leon Hefflin Sr., held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were Little Willie John, Sam Cooke, Ernie Freeman, and Bo Rhambo. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.

In 1959, Davis became a member of the Rat Pack, led by his friend Frank Sinatra, which included fellow performers Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Initially, Sinatra called the gathering &quot;the Clan&quot;, but Davis voiced his opposition, saying that it reminded people of the Ku Klux Klan. Sinatra renamed the group &quot;the Summit&quot;. One long night of poker that went on into the early morning saw the men drunken and disheveled. As Angie Dickinson approached the group, she said, &quot;You all look like a pack of rats.&quot; The nickname caught on, and they were then called the Rat Pack, the name of the earlier group led by Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, who originally made the remark about the &quot;pack of rats&quot; they associated with.

===1960s===
The group around Sinatra made several movies together, including &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960), &quot;Sergeants 3&quot; (1962), and &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; (1964), and they performed onstage together in Las Vegas. In 1964, Davis was the first African American to sing at the Copacabana night club in New York.

Davis was a headliner at The Frontier Casino in Las Vegas, but owing to Jim Crow practices in Las Vegas, he was required (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house on the west side of the city instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other black artists could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places that practiced racial segregation.

Canada provided opportunities for performers like Davis unable to break the color barrier in American broadcast television, and in 1959 he starred in his own TV special, &quot;Sammy&#x27;s Parade&quot;, on the Canadian network CBC. It was a breakthrough event for the performer, as in the United States in the 1950s corporate sponsors largely controlled the screen: &quot;Black people [were] not portrayed very well on television, if at all&quot;, according to Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.
In 1964, Davis was starring in &quot;Golden Boy&quot; at night and shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When he could get a day off from the theater, he recorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis felt he was cheating his family of his company, but he said he was incapable of standing still.

On December 11, 1967, NBC broadcast a musical-variety special featuring Nancy Sinatra, titled &quot;Movin&#x27; with Nancy&quot;. In addition to the Emmy Award-winning musical performances, the show is notable for Nancy Sinatra and Davis greeting each other with a kiss, one of the first black-white kisses on American television.

Davis had a friendship with Elvis Presley in the late 1960s, as they both were top-draw acts in Las Vegas at the same time. Davis was in many ways just as reclusive during his hotel gigs as Elvis was, holding parties mainly in his penthouse suite that Elvis occasionally attended. Davis sang a version of Presley&#x27;s song &quot;In the Ghetto&quot; and made a cameo appearance in Presley&#x27;s 1970 concert film &quot;&quot;. One year later, he made a cameo appearance in the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, but the scene was cut. In Japan, Davis appeared in television commercials for coffee and Suntory Whiskey. In the United States he joined Sinatra and Martin in a radio commercial for a Chicago car dealership.

Although he was still popular in Las Vegas, he saw his musical career decline by the late 1960s. He had a No. 11 hit (No. 1 on the Easy Listening singles chart) with &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Be Me&quot; in 1969. He signed with Motown to update his sound and appeal to young people.

===1970s–1980s===

Davis had an unexpected No. 1 hit with &quot;The Candy Man&quot; with MGM Records in 1972. He did not particularly care for the song and was chagrined that he had become known for it, but Davis made the most of his opportunity and revitalized his career. Although he enjoyed no more Top 40 hits, he did enjoy popularity with his 1976 performance of the theme song from the &quot;Baretta&quot; television series, &quot;Baretta&#x27;s Theme (Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow)&quot; (1975–1978), which was released as a single (20th Century Records).

On May 27–28, 1973, Davis hosted (with Monty Hall) the first annual 20-hour Highway Safety Foundation telethon. Guests included Muhammad Ali, Paul Anka, Jack Barry, Joyce Brothers, Ray Charles, Dick Clark, Roy Clark, Howard Cosell, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Joe Franklin, Cliff Gorman, Richie Havens, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Hal Linden, Rich Little, Butterfly McQueen, Minnie Pearl, Boots Randolph, Tex Ritter, Phil Rizzuto, The Rockettes, Nipsey Russell, Sally Struthers, Mel Tillis, Ben Vereen, and Lawrence Welk. It was a financial disaster. The total amount of pledges was $1.2 million. Actual pledges received were $525,000.

Davis was a huge fan of daytime television, particularly the soap operas produced by the American Broadcasting Company. He made a cameo appearance on &quot;General Hospital&quot; and had a recurring role as Chip Warren on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, for which he received a 1980 Daytime Emmy Award nomination. He was also a game show fan, appearing on &quot;Family Feud&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Tattletales&quot; with his wife Altovize in the 1970s.

In 1988, Davis was billed to tour with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, but Sinatra and Martin had a falling out. Liza Minnelli replaced Martin on the tour dubbed as &quot;The Ultimate Event&quot;. During the tour in 1989, Davis was diagnosed with throat cancer; his treatments prevented him from performing.

==Political beliefs and activism==

Davis was a registered Democrat and supported John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 election campaign as well as Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1968 campaign. He went on to become a close friend of President Richard Nixon (a Republican) and publicly endorsed him at the 1972 Republican National Convention. Davis also made a USO tour to South Vietnam at Nixon&#x27;s request.

In February 1972, during the later stages of the Vietnam War, Davis went to Vietnam to observe military drug abuse rehabilitation programs and talk to and entertain the troops. He did this as a representative from President Nixon&#x27;s Special Action Office For Drug Abuse Prevention. He performed shows for up to 15,000 troops; after one two-hour performance he reportedly said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been so tired and felt so good in my life.&quot; The U.S. Army made a documentary about Davis&#x27;s time in Vietnam performing for troops on behalf of Nixon&#x27;s drug treatment program.
Nixon invited Davis and his wife Altovize to sleep in the White House in 1973, the first time African Americans were invited to do so. The Davizes spent the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Davis later said he regretted supporting Nixon, accusing him of making promises on civil rights that he did not keep.

:&quot;By early 1973, a desperate Sy Marsh (Davis&#x27;s agent) told (Jesse) Jackson that Davis really needed help getting out of the Nixon imbroglio (1972 reelection endorsement). &quot;Jesse (Jackson) said, &#x27;If you can come up with $25,000 for my charity (Operation PUSH), then (have Davis) come to Chicago,&#x27;&quot; Marsh recalls.&quot;

Davis later supported Jesse Jackson″s 1984 campaign for president.

==Personal life==
===Accident and conversion to Judaism===

Davis nearly died in an automobile accident on November 19, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. During the previous year, he had started a friendship with comedian and host Eddie Cantor, who had given him a mezuzah. Instead of putting it by his door as a traditional blessing, Davis wore it around his neck for good luck. The only time he forgot it was the night of the accident.

The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Route 66 at Cajon Boulevard and Kendall Drive, when a driver, who missed turning at the fork, backed up her car in Davis&#x27;s lane and he drove into her car. Davis consequently lost his left eye to the bullet-shaped horn button (a standard feature in 1954 and 1955 Cadillacs). His friend, actor Jeff Chandler, said he would give one of his own eyes to keep Davis from total blindness. Davis wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident. The singer was featured with the patch on the cover of his debut album and appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; wearing the patch. Later, Davis was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore for the rest of his life.

In the hospital, Eddie Cantor described to Sammy the similarities between Jewish and Black cultures. Davis, born to a Catholic mother and Baptist father, was raised Catholic and began studying Jewish history as an adult, converting to Judaism several years later in 1960. One passage from his readings (from the book &quot;A History of the Jews&quot; by Abram L. Sachar), describing the endurance of the Jewish people, interested him in particular: &quot;The Jews would not die. Three millennia of prophetic teaching had given them an unwavering spirit of resignation and had created in them a will to live which no disaster could crush.&quot; The accident marked a turning point in Davis&#x27;s career, taking him from a well-known entertainer to a national celebrity.

=== Relationships and marriages ===
In 1957, Davis was involved with actress Kim Novak, who was under contract with Columbia Pictures. Because Novak was white, Harry Cohn, the president of Columbia, gave in to his worries that backlash against the relationship could hurt the studio. There are several accounts of what happened, but they agree that Davis was threatened by organized crime figures close to Cohn. According to one account, Cohn called racketeer John Roselli, who was told to inform Davis that he must stop seeing Novak. To try to scare Davis, Roselli had him kidnapped for a few hours. Another account relates that the threat was conveyed to Davis&#x27;s father by mobster Mickey Cohen. Davis was threatened with the loss of his other eye or a broken leg if he did not marry a black woman within two days. Davis sought the protection of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana, who said that he could protect him in Chicago and Las Vegas but not California.

Davis briefly married black dancer Loray White in 1958 to protect himself from mob violence; Davis had previously dated White, who was 23, twice divorced, and had a six-year-old child. He paid her a lump sum – $10,000 or $25,000 – to engage in a marriage on the condition that it would be dissolved before the end of the year. Davis became inebriated at the wedding and attempted to strangle White en route to their wedding suite. Checking on him later, Davis&#x27;s personal assistant Arthur Silber Jr. found Davis with a gun to his head. Davis despairingly said to Silber, &quot;Why won&#x27;t they let me live my life?&quot; The couple never lived together and commenced divorce proceedings in September 1958. The divorce was granted in April 1959.
In 1959, Davis had &quot;a short, stormy, exciting relationship&quot; with Nichelle Nichols.
In 1960, there was another racially charged public controversy when Davis married white, Swedish-born actress May Britt in a ceremony officiated by Rabbi William M. Kramer at Temple Israel of Hollywood. While interracial marriage had been legal in California since 1948, anti-miscegenation laws in the U.S. still stood in 23 states, and a 1958 opinion poll revealed only 4% of Americans supported marriage between black and white spouses. During 1964–66, Davis received racist hate mail while starring in the Broadway adaptation of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, in which his character is in a relationship with a white woman, paralleling his own interracial relationship. At the time Davis appeared in the musical, although New York had no laws against it, debate about interracial marriage was still ongoing in America as &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; was being fought. It was only in 1967, after the musical finished, that anti-miscegenation laws in all states were ruled unconstitutional (via the 14th Amendment adopted in 1868) by the U.S. Supreme Court.

May Britt&#x27;s and Davis&#x27;s daughter Tracey Davis (July 5, 1961 – November 2, 2020)&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews/tracey-davis-sammy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forward/458921&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/tracey-davis-dead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; alleged in a 2014 book that the marriage to Britt also resulted in President Kennedy refusing to allow Davis to perform at his inauguration. The snub was confirmed by director Sam Pollard, who revealed in a 2017 &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary that Davis&#x27;s invitation to perform at the inauguration was abruptly canceled on the night of JFK&#x27;s inaugural party.

In addition to Tracey, Davis and Britt adopted two sons, Mark and Jeff. Davis performed almost continuously and spent little time with his wife. They divorced in 1968 after Davis admitted to an affair with singer Lola Falana.

In 1968, Davis started dating Altovise Gore, a dancer in &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. They were married on May 11, 1970, by Reverend Jesse Jackson and adopted a son, Manny, in 1989. They remained married until his death in 1990. Toward the end of their marriage, Altovise Davis was sharing her mansion with Davis&#x27; girlfriend.

Davis was openly bisexual.

=== Interests ===
Davis was an avid photographer who enjoyed shooting pictures of family and acquaintances. His body of work was detailed in a 2007 book by Burt Boyar titled &quot;Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr.&quot; &quot;Jerry [Lewis] gave me my first important camera, my first 35 millimeter, during the Ciro&#x27;s period, early &#x27;50s&quot;, Boyar quotes Davis as saying &quot;And he hooked me.&quot; Davis used a medium format camera later on to capture images. Boyar reports that Davis had said, &quot;Nobody interrupts a man taking a picture to ask... &#x27;What&#x27;s that nigger doin&#x27; here?&#x27;&quot;. His catalog includes rare photos of his father dancing onstage as part of the Will Mastin Trio and intimate snapshots of close friends Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, James Dean, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, and Marilyn Monroe. His political affiliations also were represented, in his images of Robert Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. His most revealing work comes in photographs of wife May Britt and their three children, Tracey, Jeff and Mark.

Davis was an enthusiastic shooter and gun owner. He participated in fast-draw competitions. Johnny Cash recalled that Davis was said to be capable of drawing and firing a Colt Single Action Army revolver in less than a quarter of a second. Davis was skilled at fast and fancy gunspinning and appeared on television variety shows showing off this skill. He also demonstrated gunspinning to Mark on &quot;The Rifleman&quot; in &quot;Two Ounces of Tin&quot;. He appeared in western films and as a guest star on several television westerns.

Davis experimented with Satanism following his 1968 divorce. He became a warlock in the Church of Satan and was a friend of its High Priest, Anton LaVey. Even after cutting ties with the Church, he continued to perform Satanic rituals.

===Health===
After Davis&#x27;s marriage to May Britt ended in 1968, Davis turned to alcohol. He also &quot;found solace in drugs, particularly cocaine and amyl nitrite&quot; and experimented with pornography.

After a bout with cirrhosis due to years of drinking, Davis announced his sponsorship of the Sammy Davis Jr. National Liver Institute in Newark, New Jersey in 1985.

====Final illness and death====

In August 1989, Davis began to develop symptoms of cancer – a tickle in his throat and an inability to taste food. Doctors found a malignant tumor in Davis&#x27;s throat. He was a heavy smoker and had often smoked up to four packs of cigarettes a day as an adult. When told that surgery (laryngectomy) offered him the best chance of survival, Davis replied he would rather keep his voice than have a part of his throat removed; he was treated with definitive radiation therapy. His larynx was later removed when his cancer recurred. He was released from the hospital on March 13, 1990.

Davis died of complications from throat cancer two months later at his home in Beverly Hills, California, on May 16, 1990, at age 64. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. On May 18, 1990, two days after his death, the neon lights of the Las Vegas Strip were darkened for ten minutes as a tribute.

=== Estate ===
Davis left the bulk of his estate, estimated at $4,000,000 (U.S.), to his widow Altovise Davis, but he owed the IRS $5,200,000, which after interest and penalties had increased to over $7,000,000. Altovise became liable for his debt because they had filed jointly and she had co-signed their tax returns. She was forced to auction his personal possessions and real estate. Some of his friends in the industry, including Quincy Jones, Joey Bishop, Ed Asner, Jayne Meadows, and Steve Allen, participated in a fundraising concert at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. Altovise and the IRS reached a settlement in 1997. After she died in 2009, their son Manny was named executor of the estate and majority-rights holder of his intellectual property.

<text>Annaberg is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the Czech Republic and the districts of Aue-Schwarzenberg, Stollberg and Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis. Its colors are pink, green, and blue.

== History ==
In the Middle Ages the Ore Mountains were virtually unsettled and covered by dense forests. The towns of Annaberg and Buchholz (merged in 1945 to form Annaberg-Buchholz) were founded by the turn of the 16th century due to the discovery of silver and tin deposits. Now men from the Saxon lowlands moved into the mountains and founded many small towns and villages.

The district of Annaberg was established in 1874. By the late 19th century, mining, formerly of great importance, had been diverted to other localities, and the government department relating to it had moved to Marienberg in 1856. Annaberg, however, continued to be an important center for the manufacture of lace and fringes, which latter industry was introduced about 1590 by Protestant refugees from Spanish oppression in Flanders.

The district of Annaberg became a part of the new district Erzgebirgskreis on 1 August 2008. The district Erzgebirgskreisconsists of the former districts of Annaberg, Stollberg, Aue-Schwarzenberg and Mittlerer Erzgebirgskeis (Marienberg).

== Geography ==
The district was located in the western Ore Mountains on the Czech Republic–Germany border. It extended from the highest mountains on the border to more gentle hilly country in the north. The town of Oberwiesenthal is the highest located city of Germany. It is situated on the foot of the Fichtelberg, the second highest peak of the Ore Mountains at .

<doc id="194557" wikidata="Q679150" url="?curid=194557" title="Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)">
<text>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is the debut studio album by the American hip-hop collective Wu-Tang Clan, released on November 9, 1993, by Loud Records and RCA Records. The recording sessions took place during late 1992 to early 1993 at Firehouse Studio in New York City, and the album was produced by the group&#x27;s de facto leader RZA. Its title originates from the martial arts films &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973) and &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot; (1978).

The distinctive, gritty sound of &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; created a blueprint for hardcore hip-hop during the 1990s, and helped return New York City hip-hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip-hop production, while the group members&#x27; explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent rap records. Serving as a landmark release in the era of hip-hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast rappers, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.

Despite its raw, underground sound, the album had surprising chart success, peaking at number 41 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 30,000 copies in its first week on sale. By 1995, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and in October 2018 it was certified triple platinum. Initially receiving positive reviews from most music critics, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; has since been widely regarded as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. In 2020, the album was ranked 27th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s updated list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Background ==
In the late 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the All in Together Now Crew. Each member recorded under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York City rap scene and was recognized by rapper Biz Markie. By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released &quot;Words from the Genius&quot; (1991) on Cold Chillin&#x27; Records and Prince Rakeem released &quot;Ooh I Love You Rakeem&quot; (1991) on Tommy Boy Records. Both were soon dropped by their labels. Embittered but unbowed, they refocused their efforts and on new monikers; The Genius became GZA (pronounced &quot;jizza&quot;), while Prince Rakeem became RZA (pronounced &quot;rizza&quot;). RZA discussed the matter in the book &quot;The Wu-Tang Manual&quot; (2005), stating &quot;[Tommy Boy] made the decision to sign House of Pain over us. When they dropped me, I was thinking, &#x27;Damn, they chose a bunch of whiteboy shit over me.

RZA began collaborating with Dennis Coles, later known as Ghostface Killah, another rapper from the Stapleton Houses in Staten Island. The duo decided to create a hip-hop group whose ethos would be a blend of &quot;Eastern philosophy picked up from kung fu movies, watered-down Five-Percent Nation preaching picked up on the New York streets, and comic books.&quot;

== Recording and production ==
&quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; was recorded at Firehouse Studio in New York City. The album was produced, mixed, arranged, and programmed by RZA, and was mastered at The Hit Factory in New York City by Chris Gehringer. Because of an extremely limited budget, the group was only able to record in a small, inexpensive studio; with up to eight of the nine Wu-Tang members in the studio at once, the quarters were frequently crowded. To decide who appeared on each song, RZA forced the Wu-Tang rappers to battle with each other. This competition led to the track &quot;Meth Vs. Chef&quot;, a battle between Method Man and Raekwon over the rights to rap over RZA&#x27;s beat; this track was left off the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s debut album but surfaced on Method Man&#x27;s debut, &quot;Tical&quot; (1994).

Group leader RZA produced &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; by creating sonic collages from classic soul samples and clips from martial arts movies &quot;Shaolin and Wu Tang&quot; (1983) and &quot;Ten Tigers from Kwangtung&quot; (1979). He complemented the rappers&#x27; performances with &quot;lean, menacing beats that evoked their gritty, urban surroundings more effectively than their words,&quot; according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. The use of soul samples and various esoteric clips, and the technique by which RZA employed them in his beats was unique and largely unprecedented in hip-hop. The gritty sound of &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; is due, at least in part, to the use of cheap equipment to produce the album.

== Music and lyrics ==
According to music journalist Ben Yew, the minimalist means of production plays directly into the music&#x27;s &quot;street&quot; aesthetic. &quot;Because [RZA] didn&#x27;t have the best mixing or recording equipment, the album is wrought with a &#x27;dirty&#x27; quality—the drums have more bass and are more hard-hitting than they are crisp and clean; the samples have an eerie, almost haunting type of echo; and the vocals, because each member&#x27;s voice is already aggressive and gritty, perfectly match the production.&quot; Although Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard is given co-production credit on &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin and Method Man is co-credited for &quot;Wu-Tang Clan Ain&#x27;t Nuthing ta F&#x27; Wit&quot;, critics and admirers universally credit RZA with developing what &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called a &quot;dusty yet digital production style [that] helped legitimize the use of more diverse sample sources to the hardcore New York rap massive, breaking away from James Brown based beats and embracing a style that turned the &quot;Underdog&quot; theme into the menacing coda for a group of underground terrorists.&quot;

&quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; ushered in a new standard for hip-hop at a time when hip-hop music was dominated by the jazz-influenced styles of A Tribe Called Quest, the Afrocentric viewpoints of Public Enemy, and the rising popularity of West Coast gangsta rap. The album&#x27;s explicit, humorous and free-associative lyrics have been credited for serving as a template for many subsequent hip-hop records. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as possessing an aesthetic that was &quot;low on hype and production values [and] high on the idea that indigence is a central part of blackness&quot;. While the lyrical content on &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; generally varies from rapper to rapper, the basic themes are the same—urban life, martial arts movies, comic book references, and marijuana—and the setting is invariably the harsh environment of New York City. AllMusic contributor Steve Huey praises the lyricists for their originality and caustic humor, stating &quot;Some were outsized, theatrical personalities, others were cerebral storytellers and lyrical technicians, but each had his own distinctive style ... Every track on &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; is packed with fresh, inventive rhymes, which are filled with martial arts metaphors, pop culture references (everything from &quot;Voltron&quot; to Lucky Charms cereal commercials to Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;The Way We Were&quot;), bizarre threats of violence, and a truly twisted sense of humor.&quot;

With the exception of &quot;Method Man&quot; and GZA&#x27;s &quot;Clan in da Front&quot;, every song features multiple rappers contributing verses of varying lengths. The verses are essentially battle rhymes, mixed with humor and outsized tales of urban violence and drug use. There is some debate about whether the lyrics on &quot;36 Chambers&quot; are properly classified as gangsta rap or something else entirely. In a &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine review, writer Gavin Mueller evokes the bleakness of the Wu-Tang world view:

All nine original Wu-Tang Clan members contribute vocals on &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot;. Masta Killa only appears on one track, contributing the last verse of &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin, but all the other rappers appear on at least two songs. Method Man and Raekwon are the most prolific of the group, featured on eight tracks. Though the performers have widely differing techniques, the chemistry between them is a key ingredient of the album&#x27;s success. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; asserts that &quot;Half the charm is in the cast&#x27;s idiosyncrasies: ODB&#x27;s hovering sing-song, Raekwon&#x27;s fake stutter, Ghostface&#x27;s verbal tics, Method Man&#x27;s hazy, dusted voice.&quot;

== Title and packaging ==
Part of the album&#x27;s title originates from the Five Percent philosophy, known to adherents as the Supreme Mathematics, which attaches the number 9 with the meaning &quot;to bring into existence&quot;. Because the Wu-Tang Clan was made of nine members, each of whom has four chambers of the heart, the album was subtitled &quot;36 Chambers&quot;, being the total of the nine hearts of the members.

In reference to the 1978 kung fu film &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot; that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to be ahead, and more advanced over others, with &quot;knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons&quot;. Also, while the human body has 108 pressure points (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9). The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. All of this is the basis for the album title, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36. However, this is just a theory; the true significance of the title is not definitively known. The first part of the title is taken from the 1973 film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and aforementioned &quot;Shaolin and Wu Tang&quot;.

The album&#x27;s front cover image was photographed by Daniel Hastings. It features only six members of the Wu-Tang Clan: RZA, GZA, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon; member U-God was in jail for a parole violation at the time, while Method Man had been arrested earlier that day for marijuana possession. As not every member of the group was present for the shoot, the six members who were donned stocking masks to conceal their faces. The album cover photo was shot inside Angel Orensanz Center, then an abandoned and ruined synagogue. The group was photographed in front of a large foamcore rendering of the Wu-Tang Clan logo, on a set lit with tungsten lights, strobe lights, and candles. Hastings also took several photographs of the group under the Queensboro Bridge, which were featured in the album&#x27;s packaging.

== Singles ==
&quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; and &quot;Tearz&quot; were the first tracks recorded by the Wu-Tang Clan, released independently by the group as a 12-inch single in December 1992. &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; is a free-associative and braggadocious battle rap featuring eight of the nine Wu-Tang Clan members. The track was also edited to scratch out all profanity, save for repeated use of the word &quot;nigga&quot;. An uncensored version known as the &quot;Bloody Version&quot; was released on the 2004 compilation album, &quot;Legend of the Wu-Tang: Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. &quot;Tearz&quot; tells two stories: RZA&#x27;s little brother getting shot and Ghostface Killah recounting the story of a man who contracts HIV after having unprotected sex. The singles were independently released as, &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot;/&quot;After the Laughter Comes Tears&quot;, which RZA financed by demanding $100 (USD) from each rapper who wanted a verse on the A-side. The single was re-released in a much larger pressing, with &quot;Method Man&quot; as the B-side.

&quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, featuring Raekwon and Inspectah Deck, was the second single from the album, and the first new A-side to be released after the group signed with Loud/RCA. The lyrics deal with the struggle of poverty, and the desire to earn money by any means. It was the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s most successful single, reaching number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Tracks chart. The single topped the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. Wu-Tang&#x27;s &quot;Can It Be All So Simple&quot;, featuring Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, was the album&#x27;s third single. The single failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but reached number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart in 1994. A remix of the song was included on Raekwon&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; (1995).

Wu-Tang made music videos for the three A-sides and the B-side songs including &quot;Method Man&quot;, &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin, and &quot;Wu-Tang Clan Ain&#x27;t Nuthing ta Fuck Wit&quot;. As the group&#x27;s profile increased, the quality of their videos improved; though the &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; video resembled a home movie, later videos were directed by rising hip-hop music video director Hype Williams. The videos received almost no airplay on MTV but were extremely popular on video-by-request channels such as The Box. Touré wrote in his 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review that, &quot;in Brooklyn, N.Y., right now and extending back a few months, the reigning fave is the Wu-Tang Clan, who are to the channel what Guns N&#x27; Roses are to MTV.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; was received positively by contemporary critics. In an article for &quot;The Source&quot;, The Ghetto Communicator wrote &quot;This record is harsh, but so is the world that we live in. For B-boys n&#x27;girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you&#x27;ve been waiting for&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, &quot;Enter&quot; has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven&#x27;t heard since rap was pop&#x27;s best-kept secret.&quot; Touré was less enthusiastic in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, praising the album&#x27;s sound, but noting that &quot;Wu-Tang ... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self.&quot; He added, &quot;This is hip-hop you won&#x27;t find creeping up the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods.&quot; However, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and reached number eight on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.

===Retrospect===

Over time, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; became one of the most highly regarded albums in hip-hop. The album was originally given a rating of 4.5 mics out of 5 in &quot;The Source&quot; magazine in 1994; however, it was given a classic 5 mic rating in a later issue of the magazine. Similar to &quot;The Source&quot;, &quot;XXL&quot; magazine gave the album a classic rating of &quot;XXL&quot; in its retrospective 2007 issue. In the book &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; has a critical rating of 8/10 from &quot;Spin&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the album among the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, asserting that &quot;East-coast hip-hop made a return in 1993.&quot; The magazine later listed it as one of the &quot;Essential Albums of the 90s&quot; and &quot;100 Best Debut Albums of All Time.&quot; &quot;The Source&quot; cited &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; as one of the &quot;100 Best Rap Albums&quot;, while also naming &quot;Protect Ya Neck/Method Man&quot; and &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; among the &quot;100 Best Rap Singles&quot;. MTV declared it among &quot;The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time&quot;, while &quot;Blender&quot; named the album among the &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot;. Jon Caramanica, contributing author to &quot;Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide&quot; described it &quot;as timeless an album as hip-hop has ever seen.&quot;

Publications based outside of the United States have acclaimed &quot;36 Chambers&quot; as well; Australia&#x27;s &quot;Juice&quot; magazine placed it at number 40 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;, and &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; ranked it number 59 on a list of &quot;The 100 Best Albums 1986–1996&quot;. In naming &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; one of the 50 best albums of the 1990s, Pitchfork Media staff member Rollie Pemberton summed up the album&#x27;s critical recognition by writing:

In a retrospective review, Robert Christgau found the Wu-Tang Clan &quot;grander&quot; and &quot;goofier&quot; than their West Coast contemporaries and concluded, &quot;Expect the masterwork this album&#x27;s reputation suggests and you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed—it will speak directly only to indigenous hip hoppers. Expect a glorious human mess, as opposed to the ominous platinum product of their opposite numbers, and you&#x27;ll realize the dope game isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s dead-end street&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
=== East Coast hip-hop ===
Adam Heimlich of the &quot;New York Press&quot; considers the album a touchstone of hardcore hip-hop, a gritty, stripped-down, dark and violent subgenre of hip-hop and the signature sound of New York City&#x27;s rap scene during the mid-1990s. He writes that &quot;the Wu-Tang Clan ... all but invented 90s New York rap, back when the notion of an East Coast gangsta still meant Schoolly D or Kool G. Rap ... [They] designed the manner and style in which New York artists would address what Snoop and Dre had made rap&#x27;s hottest topics: drugs and violence.&quot; As the album helped return New York City hip-hop to national prominence, a new generation of New York rappers, many of them inspired by the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s example, released a flurry of classic albums that later became known as the East Coast Renaissance. &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; has been recognized by critics as a landmark album in the movement. AllMusic indicates that the success of the album paved the way for Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.

At the time of the album&#x27;s release, mainstream hip-hop was dominated by the West Coast. &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; (along with Nas&#x27; critically acclaimed &quot;Illmatic&quot; and the commercial success of The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Ready to Die&quot;) was able to shift the emphasis away from the melodious, synthesizer-driven G-funk and restore interest into the East Coast hip-hop scene. According to one columnist, &quot;When &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang: The 36 Chambers&quot; first graced the pages of rap lore in 1993, Dr. Dre&#x27;s funk-filled, West Coast gangster rap dominated the business. Though this initial dominance was difficult to overcome, Wu-Tang still managed to carve out a piece of rap history.&quot;

=== Hip-hop production ===
RZA&#x27;s production on &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; had a profound and significant influence on subsequent hip-hop producers. The distinctive sound of &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; has been credited with creating a blueprint for hardcore hip-hop in the mid-1990s. Blackfilm.com asserts that &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot;&#x27;s production formula &quot;transformed the sound of underground rap into mainstream formula, and virtually changed the face of contemporary music as popsters once knew it.&quot; Many successful rap producers have admitted to the influence of RZA&#x27;s beats on their own production efforts. 9th Wonder, a producer and former member of Little Brother, is one of many whose vocal sampling styles are inspired by RZA. The album&#x27;s reliance on soul music samples was novel at the time, but 21st-century producers such as The Alchemist, Kanye West, and Just Blaze now rely on this technique. According to Allmusic, the production on two Mobb Deep albums, &quot;The Infamous&quot; (1995) and &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; (1996), are &quot;indebted&quot; to RZA&#x27;s early production with Wu-Tang Clan. In addition, the soul singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, citing its creative approach and &quot;energy&quot; of the contributors.

The album would come to preview further work fueled by both cinematic samples and inter-woven genres.

=== Subsequent Wu-Tang work ===
Following &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot;″s success, the individual members of the group negotiated and signed solo contracts with a variety of different labels: Method Man signed with Def Jam, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard with Elektra, GZA with Geffen Records, and Ghostface Killah with Epic Records. This expansion across the music industry was an element of RZA&#x27;s stated plan for industry-wide domination, wherein &quot;All Wu releases are deemed to be 50 percent partnerships with Wu-Tang Productions and each Wu member with solo deal must contribute 20 percent of their earnings back to Wu-Tang Productions, a fund for all Wu members&quot;.

On &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot;″s effect on the group and the music industry, the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot;″s Aaron Justin-Szopinski wrote &quot;The Wu showed us that a hip-hop group can control its own destiny in the tangled web of the industry. It owns publishing rights, controls its samples and has 90% influence over its career. And that control, that outlook for the future, is what makes it the best.&quot; Wu-Tang Clan have released seven subsequent group albums since &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot;, including &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; (1997), which is certified as a quadruple platinum record. None of the subsequent Wu-Tang Clan albums have garnered the critical accolades that their debut was accorded.

In 2013, the group reunited, at the behest of RZA, for an album and tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of the album″s release. The album was titled &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and the tour included dates throughout the United States, Europe, and Russia. All original members of the group who performed on &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang&quot; participated in both the tour and reunion album, excepting Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004.

<text>Rocket to Russia is the third studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, and was released on November 4, 1977, through Sire Records. It is the band&#x27;s last album to feature original drummer Tommy Ramone, who left the band in 1978 to focus on production. The album&#x27;s origins date back to the summer of 1977, when &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; was released as a single. That summer was known as the peak of the punk rock genre since many punk bands were offered recording contracts. The album&#x27;s recording began in August 1977, and the band had a considerably larger budget with Sire allowing them between $25,000 and $30,000; much of this money went toward the album&#x27;s production rather than recording.

The album&#x27;s cover art was directed by John Gillespie. John Holmstrom and guitarist Johnny Ramone both worked on illustration, with the entire back cover contemplating a military theme, while the inner sleeve artwork depicted many of the themes portrayed in songs. The subject matter of songs varied throughout the album, though nearly all the tracks on the album incorporated humor into the lyrics. The musical style showed more of a surf rock influence, and many songs had minimal structuring.

The album received positive reviews, with many critics appreciating the matured production and sound quality as compared to &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;″s predecessors. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it his favorite Ramones album as it contained several hooks and featured more variety of tempos. The album was not as commercially successful as the band had hoped, peaking at number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Band members blamed the Sex Pistols for their lack of sales, saying that they changed the punk image for the worse. The album was ranked at number 106 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2012, and was ranked number 385 in the 2020 edition.

== Background ==
In the summer of 1977, the single &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; was released shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Leave Home&quot;. This period was extremely significant to the punk rock genre, as it was the initial wave of New York City&#x27;s underground punk bands receiving recording contracts. New York-based clubs CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City began to see bigger audiences crowd in to hear these bands. Punk fans commonly believed that this musical style would soon top the market, to which author Tom Carson explains: &quot;To be in New York that summer was to have some sense of what it might have been like to live in San Francisco in 1966 or &#x27;67, or in London when the Beatles and the [Rolling] Stones first hit.&quot;

== Recording and production ==
Sire Records allowed the band between $25,000 and $30,000 to fully record and produce the album, which is a considerably larger budget compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums. The band spent most of the money Sire had given them on the album&#x27;s production value. The studio rent was $150 per hour, usually using the first take of a song as its final recording. Johnny explained that &quot;it&#x27;s best to do it quickly ... You do not wanna sit there and bullshit. It&#x27;s your money they&#x27;re spending.&quot;

The recording began on August 21, 1977, and took place in Midtown Manhattan at Mediasound Studios, a premises of a former Episcopalian Church. On the first day of sessions, guitarist Johnny Ramone brought a copy of the Sex Pistols&#x27; single &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; with him, remarking that their type of music &quot;robbed&quot; the band. He emphasized that the album&#x27;s sound engineer Ed Stasium needed to incorporate better production than that of the Sex Pistols, to which Stasium replied &quot;no problem.&quot; Johnny relates: &quot;These guys ripped us off and I want to sound better than this.&quot;

Although the album cites Tony Bongiovi and Tommy Ramone (credited as T. Erdelyi) as the head producers, much of the album&#x27;s production was done by Stasium; Johnny went so far as to insist that Bongiovi was &quot;not even there&quot; during the band&#x27;s recording sessions. &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;″s final mastering was mainly done in Bongiovi&#x27;s Power Station studio. Infamous record producer Phil Spector offered to fabricate &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, but the band declined, feeling as though the album would not be the same without Tommy and Bongiovi.

== Title and packaging ==

The album was released on November 4, 1977, under the name &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, although it had a working title of &quot;Get Well&quot;. John Gillespie directed the artwork on the album, and the cover photo was taken by Danny Fields. Arturo Vega is credited as Artistic Coordinator, and &quot;Punk&quot; magazine editor John Holmstrom illustrated for the album. Holmstrom and Johnny collaborated on the back cover&#x27;s concept, eventually conceiving a military theme with an anti-communist cartoon drawing. The back cover art depicts a &quot;pinhead&quot; riding a rocket from the United States to Russia. The drawing features many landmarks which pertain to their global position, including The Empire State Building and Capitol Building, and Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral in Moscow, along with highly stereotypical caricatures of certain ethnicities. The original artwork is now featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. The inside sleeve features cartoon illustrations of each song&#x27;s basic concept.

== Lyrics and composition ==
Compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums, the songs from &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; were more surf music and bubblegum pop influenced. But similar to their previous releases, the lyrics integrated humor, specifically black comedy with themes circling mental disorders and psychiatry.

The album opens with &quot;Cretin Hop&quot;, which pays homage to Ramones fans, and was inspired by Cretin Avenue of St. Paul, Minnesota, named after former bishop Joseph Crétin. When the piece was performed at concerts, the band would pogo dance on stage. &quot;Rockaway Beach&quot; was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone, and was inspired by the Beach Boys along with other surf music bands. The title refers to a neighborhood and beach in Queens which Dee Dee was a fan of, as confirmed by Tommy and Joey. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; is composed of three chords and features minimal text composition. The song is among the first pieces written by the band and was originally recorded as a demo that was released on the 2001 expanded edition of the Ramones debut album. &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; was written by Joey, who explains that the lyrics are about a young female outsider named Sheena who strayed away from the popular disco and surf music and instead visited nightclubs and listened to punk rock. The mid-tempo song deviates from a three-chord pattern and starts off with Dee Dee shouting &quot;Four!&quot;, which, according to engineer Ed Stasium, was the result of Dee Dee starting his iconic countdown before the tape started rolling. This is followed by guitar riffs deemed to have a &quot;raucous&quot; texture by author Tom Carson. The author also suggests that these chords &quot;bump[ed]&quot; into each other until the song&#x27;s fade-out ending.

&quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family&quot; is a caricature of the conditions which 20th-century middle-class American families lived in. The song&#x27;s lyrics depict a dysfunctional family where the father is a lying homosexual, the mother is addicted to prescription drugs, the infant has chills. The writing also tells of how the family are friends with the President of the United States and the Pope and indicate that the family sells &quot;dope&quot;. The song fades out with various different lines taken from fake dialogue, which illustrate a side of Joey&#x27;s personality according to his brother Mickey Leigh.

Side B of the album begins with &quot;Teenage Lobotomy&quot;, which deals with the brain surgical operation lobotomy. The lyrics outline how this procedure can cause serious consequences to the brain, with the line &quot;Gonna get my Ph.D, I&#x27;m a teenage lobotomy.&quot; The composition features more complex melodies than that of other songs from the album, with Stasium proclaiming it to be a &quot;mini-Ramones Symphony&quot;. &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; is the first album to feature two cover songs: &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; (originally performed by Bobby Freeman) and &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; (originally performed by the Trashmen).

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; was well received by critics, and was often given a positive review. Many critics appreciated the band&#x27;s progression of sound quality and production value, as opposed to the album&#x27;s predecessors. 

Critic Robert Christgau reaffirms that the album&#x27;s content evolved significantly since previous releases. Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he noted that the album had &quot;something for everyone&quot; and called it a &quot;ready-made punk-rock classic.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Dave Marsh began his review of the album by stating: &quot;&quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; is the best American rock &amp; roll of the year and possibly the funniest rock album ever made.&quot; Like other critics, Marsh recognized the advanced sound quality, explaining that &quot;the guitars still riff relentlessly, but they are freer within the murky sound, and the songs give them much more to work with.&quot;

John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; the band&#x27;s best album &quot;because the humor and the role-playing have become more overt than ever.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; labeled it &quot;an important breakthrough album,&quot; and praised the &quot;inspired lunacy.&quot; UPI listed &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; as the second best album of 1977, writing that the Ramones were &quot;the undisputed kings of American Punk.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine, a music critic at AllMusic, said that the production &quot;only gives the Ramones&#x27; music more force.&quot; He stated that although it lacks the revolutionary impact that their debut had, &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; is the band&#x27;s &quot;most listenable and enjoyable album&quot; because of its surplus of hooks and varying tempo.

== Commercial performance ==
Although the band expected the album to spawn a few hit songs, &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; sold few records. The album charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 49, making this album one of the most successful of the Ramones&#x27; releases. It also debuted at number 31 on the Swedish charts, 36 on the Canadian charts, and 60 on the UK Albums Chart.

The lack of record sales was largely due to fellow punk band Sex Pistols turning people off the genre &quot;with their antisocial behavior,&quot; as put by author Brian J. Bowe. Rock music historian Legs McNeil relates: &quot;Safety pins, razor blades, chopped haircuts, snarling, vomiting—everything that had nothing to do with the Ramones was suddenly in vogue, and it killed any chance &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; had of getting any airplay.&quot; Joey also insisted that the Sex Pistols were partially responsible for the low sale numbers, concluding that before &quot;60 Minutes&quot; focused on the Sex Pistols, &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; had decent airplay. After this, Joey asserted that &quot;everyone flipped out and then things changed radically. It really kind of screwed things up for ourselves.&quot;

== Tommy&#x27;s departure ==
Drummer Tommy, who had also worked to co-produce the album, was troubled by the lack of sales and began debating on continuing with the Ramones. He also considered touring to be &quot;depressing&quot;, and that the audience at unfamiliar gigs were &quot;a bunch of very eccentric, high-strung, crazy people, from one shit-hole club to another.&quot; The drummer left the band in 1978 but continued as producer on their next album &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;. He said:

<doc id="194570" wikidata="Q246110" url="?curid=194570" title="Garamond">
<text>Garamond is a group of many serif typefaces, named for sixteenth-century Parisian engraver Claude Garamond, generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime. Garamond-style typefaces are popular to this day and often used for book printing and body text.

Garamond&#x27;s types followed the model of an influential typeface cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and are in what is now called the old-style of serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured, upright design.

Following an eclipse in popularity in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, many modern revival faces in the Garamond style have been developed. It is common to pair these with italics based on those created by his contemporary Robert Granjon, who was well known for his proficiency in this genre. However, although Garamond himself remains considered a major figure in French printing of the sixteenth century, historical research has increasingly placed him in context as one artisan punchcutter among many active at a time of rapid production of new typefaces in sixteenth-century France, and research has only slowly developed into which fonts were cut by him and which by contemporaries; Robert Bringhurst commented that &quot;it was a widespread custom for many years to attribute almost any good sixteenth-century French font&quot; to Garamond. As a result, while &quot;Garamond&quot; is a common term in the printing industry, the terms &quot;French Renaissance antiqua&quot; and &quot;Garalde&quot; have been used in academic writing to refer generally to fonts on the Aldus-French Renaissance model by Garamond and others.

In particular, many &#x27;Garamond&#x27; revivals of the early twentieth century are actually based on the work of a later punchcutter, Jean Jannon, whose noticeably different work was for some years misattributed to Garamond. The most common digital font named Garamond is Monotype Garamond. Developed in the early 1920s and bundled with Microsoft Office, it is a revival of Jannon&#x27;s work.

==Characteristics==

Some distinctive characteristics in Garamond&#x27;s letterforms are an &#x27;e&#x27; with a small eye and the bowl of the &#x27;a&#x27; which has a sharp turn at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters on the model of Roman square capitals. The &#x27;M&#x27; is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the &#x27;R&#x27; extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like &#x27;d&#x27; have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic &#x27;h&#x27; bends inwards. Garamond types have quite expansive ascenders and descenders; printers at the time did not use leading.
Besides general characteristics, writers on type have generally praised the even quality of Garamond&#x27;s type: John A. Lane describes his work as &quot;elegant and executed with consummate skill...to a higher standard than commercial interest demanded&quot;; H. D. L. Vervliet wrote that in his later &quot;Gros-Canon&quot; and &quot;Parangonne&quot; types (meaning sizes of around 40pt and 18pt respectively) he had achieved &quot;a culmination of Renaissance design. The elegant line and subdued emphasis show the classic search for silent and transparent form&quot;.

Modern Garamond revivals also often add a matching bold and &#x27;lining&#x27; numbers at the height of capital letters, neither of which were used during the Renaissance; Arabic numerals in Garamond&#x27;s time were engraved as what are now called text figures, styled with variable height like lower-case letters.

==History==
===Garamond’s life and his roman type===

Garamond worked as an engraver of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. Garamond cut types in the &#x27;roman&#x27;, or upright style, in italic, and Greek. In the period of Garamond&#x27;s early life roman type had been displacing the blackletter or Gothic type which was used in some (although not all) early French printing. Though his name was generally written as &#x27;Garamont&#x27; in his lifetime, the spelling &#x27;Garamond&#x27; became the most commonly used form after his death. H. D. L. Vervliet, the leading contemporary expert on French Renaissance printing, uses Garamont consistently.
The roman designs of Garamond which are his most imitated were based on a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by engraver Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book &quot;De Aetna&quot;, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius&#x27; first printing in the Latin alphabet. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed &quot;De Aetna&quot; as something of a pilot project, a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius&#x27; norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the &#x27;e&#x27; should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since. French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously examined Manutius&#x27;s work (and, it is thought, &quot;De Aetna&quot; in particular) as a source of inspiration: Garamond&#x27;s roman, italic and Greek typefaces were all influenced by types used by Manutius.
An event which was to particularly define the course of the rest of Garamond&#x27;s career came starting on 6 September 1530, when the printer Robert Estienne began to introduce a set of three roman types adapting the single roman type used in &quot;De Aetna&quot; to a range of sizes. These typefaces, with their &quot;light colour and precise cut&quot; were extremely influential and other Parisian printers immediately introduced copies. The largest size &quot;Gros-canon&quot; (42.5pt) particularly became a &quot;phenomenon&quot; in Paris: never before had a roman type been cut in so large a size. The designs copied Manutius&#x27;s type even to the extent of copying the &#x27;M&#x27; shown in &quot;De Aetna&quot; which, whether intentionally or due to a casting defect, had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right. This form was to appear in many fonts of the period, including Garamond&#x27;s earlier ones, although by the end of his career he had switched to mostly using an M on the Roman capital model with a serif at top right.

The period from 1520 to around 1560, encompassing Garamond&#x27;s career, was an extremely busy period for typeface creation. Many fonts were cut, some such as Robert Estienne&#x27;s for a single printer&#x27;s exclusive use, others sold or traded between them (increasingly over time). The many active engravers included Garamond himself, Granjon, Guillaume Le Bé, particularly respected for his Hebrew fonts, Pierre Haultin, Antoine Augereau (who may have been Garamond&#x27;s master), Estienne&#x27;s stepfather Simon de Colines and others. This period saw the creation of a pool of high-quality punches and matrices, many of which would remain used for the next two centuries.

Little is known about Garamond&#x27;s life or work before 1540, although he wrote in a preface of having cut punches for type since childhood. He worked for a variety of employers on commission, creating punches and selling matrices to publishers and the government. Garamond&#x27;s typefaces were popular abroad, and replaced Griffo&#x27;s original roman type at the Aldine Press in Venice. He also worked as a publisher and bookseller. By 1549, a document from theologian Jean de Gagny specified that the goldsmith Charles Chiffin, who had cut an italic for his private printing press, should receive payment at the rate of &quot;the best punchcutter in this city after master Claude Garamont&quot;, clearly showing that he was considered the pre-eminent punchcutter in Paris at this time.

Vervliet concludes that Garamond created thirty-four typefaces for which an attribution can be confidently made (17 roman, 7 italic, 8 Greek, 2 Hebrew) and another three for which the attribution is problematic (one each of roman, Greek and Hebrew). If Garamond distributed specimens of his typefaces, as later punchcutters and typefounders did, none is known to survive, although one unsigned specimen in the Plantin-Moretus Museum collection, presenting a synopsis of his late &quot;Parangon&quot; type, may have been made around the time of his death or soon after.

While some records such as Christophe Plantin&#x27;s exist of what exact types were cut by Garamond himself, many details of his career remain uncertain: early estimates placed Garamond&#x27;s date of birth around 1480, but modern opinion proposes much later estimates. A document called the Le Bé Memorandum (based on the memories of Guillaume Le Bé, but collated by one of his sons around 1643) suggests that Garamond finished his apprenticeship around 1510. This is considered unlikely by modern historians since his mother was still alive when he died in 1561 and little is known of him before around 1540.

One particular question about Garamond&#x27;s early career is whether he cut the typefaces used by Estienne from 1530. Because of Garamond&#x27;s known connection with Estienne in his later career, it has been assumed that he cut them, but this was not mentioned in contemporary sources: Vervliet suggests that these &#x27;Estienne typefaces&#x27; were not cut by Garamond and that his career began somewhat later. Vervliet suggests that the creator of this set of typefaces, sometimes called the &#x27;Estienne Master&#x27;, may have been a &#x27;Master Constantin&#x27;, recorded in the Le Bé Memorandum as a master type engraver of the period before Garamond but about whom nothing is otherwise known and to whom no obvious other body of work can be ascribed. If so, his disappearance from history (perhaps due to an early death, since all his presumed work appeared in just four years from 1530 to 1533) and the execution of Augereau on a charge of heresy in 1534 may have allowed Garamond&#x27;s reputation to develop in the following decade.

Regardless of these questions about his early career, Garamond&#x27;s late career is well-recorded, with most of his later roman types (in Lane&#x27;s view, his best work) preserved in complete sets of matrices at the Museum Plantin-Moretus, which has allowed example sets of characters to be cast, with further documentation and attributions from later inventories and specimen sheets. Of the Garamond types preserved, all include small capitals apart from the &quot;gros-canon&quot;, and the &quot;parangonne&quot; uniquely includes terminal swash forms for a e m n r t (two forms) and z.

====Italics====

Garamond cut more roman types than italics, which at the time were conceived separately to roman types rather than designed alongside them as complementary matches.

Italics had again been introduced by Manutius in 1500; the first was cut by Griffo. This first italic used upright capitals, copying a popular style of calligraphy. The modern italic style of sloped capitals first appeared in 1527 and only slowly became popular. Accordingly, many of Garamond&#x27;s italics were quite small and had upright capitals. Some of his italics did have sloped capitals, although Vervliet did not feel he integrated them effectively into the typeface design, &quot;sloped capitals were (and stayed) a weakness in his designs.&quot;

Garamond&#x27;s italics were apparently not as used as widely as Granjon&#x27;s and Haultin&#x27;s, which spread widely across Europe. For example, on the 1592 Berner specimen, most of the romans were by Garamond but at least all but one, and probably all, of the italics are Granjon&#x27;s. Similarly in the 1643 &quot;Imprimerie royale&quot; specimen, most of the italics are Granjon&#x27;s. (Some books published by Garamond in 1545 use a very common italic of the period, not cut by him.)

====Greek====

Garamond cut type for the Greek alphabet from the beginning of his recorded career: on 2 November 1540 he contracted to cut a series of Greek faces for the French government, to be used in printing by Robert Estienne. The resulting typeface, known as the &quot;Grecs du roi&quot;, are very different from his Latin designs: again influenced by Greek typefaces used by Manutius (they were cut in three sizes, the same ones Manutius used), they were based on the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio, who used many ligatures and traditional contractions in his writing, and include an extraordinarily large number of alternate characters to faithfully replicate it. Arthur Tilley called the books printed from them &quot;among the most finished specimens of typography that exist&quot;.
The &quot;Grecs du roi&quot; punches and matrices remain the property of the French government. They were extremely influential and directly copied by many engravers for other printers, becoming the basis of Greek typeface design for the next two centuries.

Although the &quot;Grecs du roi&quot; style was popular in Greek printing for the next two centuries, it is problematic for modern setting of body text, due to changing tastes in Greek printing: they are slanted, but modern Greek printing often uses upright type, and because Garamond&#x27;s types were designed assuming that ligatures would be manually selected and inserted wherever needed; later metal types on the same model used fewer ligatures. Digital &#x27;Garamond&#x27; releases such as Adobe&#x27;s with Roman and Greek character sets often re-interpret the Greek, for instance with upright characters. A commercial digitisation from Anagrafi Fonts, &quot;KS GrequeX&quot;, uses the OpenType format to include over 1100 abbreviations and ligatures, more than Garamond cut.

According to Lane the most influential &quot;Grecs du roi&quot; copies were those of Granjon and Haultin, but others may have been cut by Jean Arnould and Nicolas de Villiers, amongst others. Another was made by Arthur Nicholls in London.

====After Garamond&#x27;s death====

Garamond died in 1561 and his punches and matrices were sold off by his widow. Purchasers included the Le Bé type foundry in Paris run by the family of Guillaume Le Bé and Christophe Plantin, who was in Paris at the time; the Frankfurt foundry often referred to by historians as Egenolff-Berner also came to acquire materials of Garamond&#x27;s. Le Bé&#x27;s son is known to have written to Plantin&#x27;s successor Moretus offering to trade matrices so they could both have complementary type in a range of sizes. Konrad Berner showcased various types of Garamond&#x27;s and other French engravers in a 1592 specimen, which named the types&#x27; engravers and would later be a source for historians.

Plantin&#x27;s collection of original Garamond punches and matrices survives at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, together with many other typefaces collected by Plantin from other typefounders of the period. The collection has been used extensively for research, for example by historians Harry Carter and Vervliet. Plantin also commissioned punchcutter Robert Granjon to create alternate characters for three Garamond fonts with shortened ascenders and descenders to allow tighter linespacing.

Garamond&#x27;s name was used outside France as a name for 10pt type, often in Dutch as &#x27;Garmond&#x27;.

===Robert Granjon===
Many modern revival fonts based on French renaissance printing are influenced by the work of Robert Granjon (c. 1513–90), particularly in italic. An engraver with a long and wide-ranging career, Granjon&#x27;s work seems to have ranged much more widely than Garamond&#x27;s focus on roman and Greek type, cutting type in italic, civilité (a cursive blackletter), and for the Vatican type in exotic alphabets including Arabic, Armenian and Hebrew. His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve years of his life Rome, where he ended his career in the service of the Vatican.

Vervliet comments that Granjon &quot;laid the foundation for our image of the way an Italic should look.&quot; Although he was not quite the first designer to use the idea of italics having capitals sloped to complement the roman, he &quot;solved successfully the problem of a balanced inclination of the capitals, a feature much ahead of the designs with a more irregular slope of his Viennese and Mainz predecessors...and even compared to...Garamont. A proper optical harmony of the angle of slope is characteristic for all Granjon’s Italics; it allowed the compositor to use whole lines of capitals without causing too much giddiness.&quot; Granjon also cut many swash capitals, which Vervliet describes as &quot;deliciously daring&quot; and have often been copied, for instance in Robert Slimbach&#x27;s revivals for Adobe (discussed below).

===Other French engravers of the sixteenth century===
Besides Garamond, Granjon and the &quot;Estienne master&quot;, other engravers were active in the French renaissance style.

Pierre Haultin particularly created many types which were very popular and distributed very widely around Europe: as a Protestant, he spent much of his career outside Paris working in Geneva, Lyons and La Rochelle and his nephew Jérôme established a career importing and casting his types in London, where his types were extremely common. In Carter&#x27;s view Haultin &quot;has been greatly underrated&quot;. Another engraver whose types were very popular in London was François Guyot, who moved from Paris to Antwerp and then London.

===Jean Jannon===
In 1621, sixty years after Garamond&#x27;s death, the French printer Jean Jannon released a specimen of typefaces in the Garamond/Granjon style. Jannon wrote in his specimen that:

Seeing that for some time many persons have had to do with the art [of printing] who have greatly lowered it ... the desire came upon me to try if I might imitate, after some fashion, some one among those who honourably busied themselves with the art, [men whose deaths] I hear regretted every day [Jannon mentions some eminent printers of the previous century] ... and inasmuch as I could not accomplish this design for lack of types which I needed ... [some typefounders] would not, and others could not furnish me with what I lacked [so] I resolved, about six years ago, to turn my hand in good earnest to the making of punches, matrices and moulds for all sorts of characters, for the accommodation both of the public and of myself.

Jannon was a Protestant in mostly Catholic France. After apparently working with the Estienne family in Paris he set up an independent career as printer in Sedan in what is now north-eastern France, becoming printer for the Protestant Academy. By his report he took up punchcutting seriously in his thirties, although according to Williamson he would have cut decorative material and engravings at least before this. Sedan at the time enjoyed an unstable independence as a principality at a time when the French government had conceded through the Edict of Nantes to allowing a complicated system of restricted liberties for Protestants.

The French Royal Printing Office (Imprimerie Royale) appears to have bought matrices from him in 1641 in three large sizes, roman and italic at roughly 18, 24 and 36 point sizes. (The contract is actually made for one &#x27;Nicholas Jannon&#x27;, which historians have concluded to be a mistake.) Despite the purchase, it is not clear that the office ever much used Jannon&#x27;s type: historian James Mosley has reported being unable to find books printed by the Imprimerie that use more than two sizes of italic. His type would later be misattributed to Garamond. Despite this, it is known that authorities in 1644 raided an office in Caen where he had been commissioned to do printing. Warde initially assumed that this was the source of the Jannon materials in the Imprimerie Nationale before the government&#x27;s purchase order came to light. Jannon&#x27;s types and their descendants are recognizable by the scooped-out triangular serifs on the top left of such characters as &#x27;m&#x27;, &#x27;n&#x27; and &#x27;r&#x27;, which curve to a steeper slant in Jannon&#x27;s design compared to Garamond&#x27;s. The italics are also very different from Garamond&#x27;s own or Granjon&#x27;s, being much more ornate and with considerable variation in angle of the capitals. Opinions of Jannon&#x27;s engraving quality have varied; Warde found them &quot;so technically brilliant as to be decadent&quot; and &quot;of slight value as a book face&quot; (the surviving Jannon sizes were intended as display faces, cut at 18pt or larger) and Vervliet described them as &quot;famous not so much for the quality of the design but as for the long-term confusion it created&quot;, although many reproductions of his work were successful in printing in the twentieth century. Jannon cut far more types than those surviving in the Imprimerie collection: before the misattribution to Garamond, he was particularly respected for his engraving of an extremely small size of type, known for his workplace as &quot;sédanoise&quot;, which was popular.

By the nineteenth century, Jannon&#x27;s matrices had come to be known as the &quot;Caractères de l&#x27;Université&quot; (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon&#x27;s work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon&#x27;s matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.

===The fate of Garamond&#x27;s work===

The old-style typefaces of Garamond and his contemporaries continued to be regularly used and kept in the stock of European typefounders until the end of the eighteenth century and appear in the major French type foundry specimen books of the eighteenth century, of Delacolonge, Lamesle, and Gando. In Delacolonge&#x27;s book, many fonts were shown &quot;mutilated&quot; or as &quot;bastard&quot; fonts: with replacement characters, specifically cut-down descenders to allow tighter linespacing. According to James Mosley French renaissance romans remained popular for slightly longer than italics, due to a taste for new italics, wider and with flat incoming serifs, introduced by the &quot;Romain du roi&quot; type and popularised by Simon-Pierre Fournier (see below): &quot;it is common enough, in the second half of the eighteenth century, to find books set in a Garamond roman or a near copy mated with one of Fournier&#x27;s italics&quot;.
A trademark associated with the Garalde style in modern times is the four-terminal &#x27;W&#x27;, although sixteenth-century French typefaces generally do not include the character as it is not normal in French. Many French renaissance typefaces used abroad had the character added later, along with the &#x27;J&#x27; and &#x27;U&#x27;: these were often very visibly added by lesser craftsmen, producing an obvious mismatch. Granjon added a &#x27;W&#x27; and &#x27;w&#x27;, both with three upper terminals, to Garamond&#x27;s Breviare roman in 1565 for Plantin.

The foundry of Guillaume Le Bé I which held many of Garamond&#x27;s punches and matrices passed to Guillaume Le Bé II, and came to be managed by Jean-Claude Fournier, whose son Jean-Pierre in 1730 purchased it. (His younger brother, Simon-Pierre Fournier, rapidly left the family business and became a major exponent of modern ideas in printing, including standardised point sizes and crisp types influenced by contemporary calligraphy.)

In 1756, Jean-Pierre Fournier wrote of his collection of vintage equipment that &quot;I am the owner of the foundry of Garamond, the Le Bé family and Granjon. I shall be happy to display my punches and matrices to all those who are lovers of true beauty ... these are the types that made the reputations of the Estiennes, Plantin and the Elzevirs,&quot; and referred to an inventory that he said was in his possession that had been drawn up after Garamond&#x27;s death in 1561. (The comment was made in a journal during a public dispute with a printer of more modern tastes who preferred to remain anonymous and may have been his younger brother.) The 1561 inventory does not survive, although some later inventories do; by this point Fournier&#x27;s foundry may have become rather inactive.

Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and his contemporaries finally fell out of use altogether with the arrival of what is now called the Didone, or modern-face, style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the Didot family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Lane suggests Fournier&#x27;s type foundry may have finally disposed of its materials around 1805; in contrast, the collections of the Plantin-Moretus Museum survive almost intact. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of Didot, and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been in the hands of the trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder ... the term caractères de l&#x27;Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.

Garamond&#x27;s reputation remained respected, even by members of the Didot family whose type designs came to dominate French printing.

===Revival era===
A revival of interest in &#x27;old-style&#x27; serif typefaces took place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond&#x27;s own work, had survived in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie&#x27;s director Arthur Christian, who commissioned the cutting of additional sizes in a matching style.

Early revivals were often based directly on the Imprimerie nationale types, one of the first by Peignot and then by American Type Founders (ATF).
These revivals could be made using pantograph machine engraving systems, which gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved, and allowed rapid development of a family in a large range of sizes. In addition, the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period created increasing availability and demand for new fonts. Among hot metal typesetting companies, Monotype&#x27;s branches in Britain and the United States brought out separate versions, and the American branch of Linotype licensed that of ATF.

A number of historians began in the early twentieth century to question if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the &quot;Grecs du Roi&quot; undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died during the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF&#x27;s historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the &#x27;Garamond&#x27; his company was reviving was really Garamond&#x27;s work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.

In a 1926 paper published on the British typography journal &quot;The Fleuron&quot;, Beatrice Warde revealed her discovery that the Imprimerie nationale type had been created by Jean Jannon, something she had discovered by examining printing credited to him in London and Paris and through reading the work of Paillard, and perhaps with advice from French bibliographer Marius Audin.

By the time Warde&#x27;s article was published some revivals had been released that were more authentic revivals of Garamond&#x27;s work, based on period books and printing specimens. The German company Stempel brought out a crisp revival of the original Garamond typefaces in the 1920s, inspired by a rediscovered specimen from the Egenolff-Berner foundry in Frankfurt, as did Linotype in Britain.

==Timeline==
===The Renaissance===
* 1470 – first book printed in France, by a Swiss/German team at the Sorbonne, Paris. Early books printed in France generally use type of a blackletter design or roman type with blackletter characteristics.
* 1496 – Aldus Manutius publishes &quot;De Aetna&quot;, a short text of poetry that serves as his first printing in the Latin alphabet. Its roman type sets a standard that would later be imitated by French printers.

===Late Renaissance===
* 1510 – Garamond may have been born around this time.
* 1530 – Robert Estienne begins to publish in a new and more elegant style of &#x27;roman&#x27; type, influenced by &quot;De Aetna&quot; with its asymmetrical &#x27;M&#x27;.
* 1540 – Garamond first clearly enters the historical record, being advanced money to cut the &quot;Grecs du Roi&quot; type.
* 1561 – Death of Garamond.
* 1563 – Christophe Plantin buys matrices and other equipment in Paris at auction, some from Garamond&#x27;s widow, for his partnership in Antwerp. Other equipment is bought by other Parisian and German printers; a specimen sheet identifying his types is issued by a Frankfurt foundry in 1592.
* 1560–70s – The work of Garamond and his contemporaries becomes very influential in the Low Countries and western Germany. A decline sets into the production of new typefaces, probably mostly due to simple saturation of the market with typefaces of acceptable quality, and possibly also due to economic and religious factors causing the emigration of printers and typefounders to other countries.

===Early modern period===
* 1580 – birth of Jannon
* 1621 – Jannon issues a specimen of his type.
* 1640 – Jannon leaves Sedan for Paris.
* 1641 – foundation of the Imprimerie Royale, which buys matrices from Jannon
* 1644 – Jannon&#x27;s printing office in Caen is raided by authorities concerned that he may have been publishing banned material. Jannon is not imprisoned, but returns to Sedan.
* 1658 – death of Jannon

===Eighteenth century===
* 1756 – Parisian printer Jean-Pierre Fournier quotes from the 1561 inventory of Garamond&#x27;s work and writes about his possession of Garamond&#x27;s equipment. However, his extensive collections are dispersed after his death in 1783 and ultimately &#x27;traditional&#x27; old-style type falls out of use in France around the end of the century.

===Early revival era===
* Late nineteenth century – revival in interest in &#x27;old-style&#x27; typefaces such as the Caslon type (1730s, England) and that of Jenson (1470s, Venice).
* 1912 – revival of the Imprimerie Royale (now Imprimerie nationale, following the revolution) type by the Peignot foundry. A revival by Ollière of &quot;Garamond&quot; type based on photographing sixteenth-century books follows
* 1914 – Jean Paillard writes and Ollière publishes an essay showcasing Ollière&#x27;s Garamond revival arguing that the Imprimerie nationale type was not created by Garamond but his work attracts little attention. He is killed serving in the First World War a few months later.
* 1920 – a copy of the 1592 Berner specimen of typefaces is published in facsimile.
* 1923 – ATF issues a specimen of their Garamond revival, in development for several years prior. ATF&#x27;s historian Henry Bullen privately tells Beatrice Warde, then a junior librarian, that he suspects that Garamond had nothing to do with the type, since he had never seen it in a contemporary book, but has no better candidate for its creator. Warde subsequently moves to Europe, becoming a freelance writer on printing and adviser to Monotype in London.
* 1925 – Based on the Egelhoff-Berner specimen, Stempel Garamond is released in Germany: later also released by Linotype, it is the first Garamond revival actually based on his work.
* 1923 – Monotype Garamond is published based on the Imprimerie nationale type.
* 1926 – Warde discovers and reveals that the Imprimerie nationale type was created by Jannon, and that all revivals based on it are not directly based on Garamond&#x27;s work.

==Contemporary versions==
===Based on Garamond&#x27;s design===

====Stempel Garamond====

A 1920s adaptation created by the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. Its lower case &#x27;a&#x27; has a sharp and somewhat angular look with a crisp hook at the top left, in contrast to a teardrop design that is common in many other serif typefaces. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of the number on the top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from an &#x27;o&#x27;. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel&#x27;s head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.

Garamond No. 1 and Garamond No. 2 are both based on Stempel Garamond, with various differences. Another typeface known as Original Garamond is a clone of Stempel Garamond.

===== URW++ Garamond No. 8 =====
Garamond No. 8 is a freeware version of Stempel Garamond contributed by URW++ to the Ghostscript project; it was included in GhostScript since Stempel Garamond is included as a system font in some implementations of the PostScript standard. It is distributed under the AFP license, which allows it to be copied freely but not sold. It is understood that its license does not place any restriction on whether the typeface is &quot;used&quot; in commercial settings (as long as the typeface is not distributed in situations where a fee is involved), nor whether printed contents created with it are sold. Garamond No. 8 hence does not have a fully open-source license, but its license does not restrict usage for personal purposes or commercial printing.

Featuring a bold weight, small capitals, optional text figures and automatic ligature insertion, it is particularly popular in the TeX community and is also included on some Linux distributions. Originally released as a PostScript Type 1, it has been converted into the TrueType format, usable by most current software.

Garamond No. 8 is often packaged as &quot;urw-garamond&quot; in the open source communities, but is actually different from another typeface that is simply known as URW Garamond.

====Granjon====

Granjon was a 1920s revival designed by George W. Jones for the British branch of Linotype, using a 1582 history textbook as a model and also influenced by Caslon. It was the favourite Garalde of many in the twentieth century, including Warde and Walter Tracy.

Jones also created for Linotype Estienne, a delicate revival based on Robert Estienne&#x27;s fonts of the 1530s discussed above, with very long ascenders and descenders. It was less popular and it has not been officially digitised by Linotype. Williamson suggested that in body text it failed to adapt the style of a large letter effectively down to body text size, giving a design with an extremely small x-height.

====Sabon====

Sabon is a Garamond revival designed by Jan Tschichold in 1964, jointly released by Linotype, Monotype and Stempel in 1967. It is named after Jacques Sabon, a Frankfurt-based printer, who introduced the typefaces of Garamond and his contemporaries to German printing. An unusual feature of many releases of Sabon is that the italic, based on Granjon&#x27;s work, is wider than most normal italics, at the same width as the roman style. This suited Linotype&#x27;s hot metal typesetting system. Later Sabon versions, such as Jean François Porchez&#x27;s Sabon Next, have not always maintained this principle.

Tschichold stated that Sabon was designed based on the Egenolff-Berner specimen, although there are different accounts on whether it was drawn using the Saint Augusin (around 13pt) or the Parangon (around 18.5pt) models. Porchez and Christopher Burke later researched into Sabon during the development of Sabon Next. They suggested that aspects of Sabon&#x27;s design may have been copied from a type by Guillaume Le Bé, a large-size specimen of which he had Tschichold reproduced in a textbook. Sabon Next was based on the version of Sabon that was developed for the Stempel metal handsetting system, along with designs of other Garamond types.

====Berthold Garamond====

A 1972 revival for phototypesetting issued by H. Berthold and designed by Günter Gerhard Lange.

URW Garamond (which is different from URW Garamond No. 8 mentioned above, despite the latter is often packaged as &quot;urw-garamond&quot; in open source software) is a clone of Berthold Garamond.

====Adobe Garamond====
Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is designed by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems following a research visit to the Plantin-Moretus Museum, based on a Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family has 3 weights (Regular, Semibold, and Bold), each with its respective italic, totalling 6 styles. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity, in contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. It is one of the most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing. Slimbach decided not to base the design directly on Garamond types in the 9–15pt sizes normally used for book text, but on a larger type called &quot;parangonne&quot; or &quot;vraye parangonne&quot;, which he felt was Garamond&#x27;s &quot;most attractive work&quot;. It was reviewed by Hugh Williamson for the Printing Historical Society as &quot;well-suited to photocomposition and to offset printing&quot;. It also received two detailed reviews in the same issue of &quot;Printing History&quot;, both a favourable one by Jery Kelly and a more critical one by book designer Mark Argetsinger. Argetsinger felt that while the &quot;parangonne&quot; type was &quot;a very beautiful design&quot;, the choice to base a text type on it produced a type of &quot;relative pallidness&quot; when printed by lithography. He recommended that Adobe add more optical sizes.

====Garamond Premier====
During the production of Adobe Garamond, its designer Robert Slimbach started planning for a second interpretation of Garamond after visiting the Plantin-Moretus Museum in 1988. He concluded that a digital revival of Garamond&#x27;s work would not be definitive unless it offered optical sizes, with different fonts designed for different sizes of text. Unable to create such a large range of styles practically with the technology and business requirements of the 1980s, he completed the project in 2005. Adobe states that Garamond Premier was developed based on multiple specimens at the Plantin-Moretus Museum.

Garamond Premier has 4 optical sizes (Regular, Caption, Subhead, and Display) and at least 4 weights (Regular, Medium, Semibold, and Bold, with an additional Light weight for Display), each with its respective italic, totalling 34 styles in the OpenType font format. Garamond Premier and its predecessor Adobe Garamond have the same x-heights, but they have many subtle differences in their designs. At the same weights and x-heights (hence font sizes), Garamond Premier is slightly darker and has tighter spacing than Adobe Garamond. Some other notable differences include (but are not limited to) the designs of the lowercase &quot;t&quot;, lowercase &quot;r&quot;, and uppercase &quot;Q&quot;.

It features glyph coverage for Central European, Cyrillic and Greek characters including polytonics. Professor Gerry Leonidas, an expert in Greek-language printing, described it in 2005 as &quot;bar none, the most accomplished typeface you can get for complex Greek texts&quot;. Adobe executive Thomas Phinney characterized Garamond Premier as a &quot;more directly authentic revival&quot; than their earlier Garamond, which he described as &quot;a more restrained and modernized interpretation&quot;.

====EB Garamond====
The &quot;EB Garamond&quot; («Egenolff-Berner-Garamond») is a free and open-source software implementation of Garamond, released by Georg Duffner in 2011 under the Open Font License. Duffner based the design on the 1592 Berner specimen, with italic and Greek characters based on Robert Granjon&#x27;s work, as well as the addition of Cyrillic characters and OpenType features such as swash italic capitals and schoolbook alternates. , it was intended to include multiple optical sizes, including fonts based on the 8 and 12 point sizes. It has been described as &quot;one of the best open source fonts&quot; by prominent typeface designer Erik Spiekermann. As Georg Duffner was unable to complete the bold weights for personal reasons, the project was continued by Octavio Pardo.

==== Berylium ====
&quot;Berylium&quot; is an implementation of Garamond designed by Ray Larabie for printed body text, with purposely jagged edges. Larabie released Berylium into the public domain in 2024.

===Based on Jannon&#x27;s design===

====ATF Garamond/Garamond No. 3====
American Type Founders created a revival of the Imprimerie Nationale fonts from around 1917, which was designed in-house by its design department led by Morris Fuller Benton under the influence of its historian and advisor Henry Lewis Bullen. It received a sumptuous showing, marketed especially towards advertisers, in ATF&#x27;s 1923 specimen book. Also involved in the design&#x27;s development was book and advertising designer T.M. Cleland, who created a set of matching borders and ornaments and according to Warde and Garnett also advised on the design and designed the swash characters.

While ATF&#x27;s handset foundry type release was initially popular, the design became particularly known to later users under the name of &quot;Garamond No. 3”, as a hot metal adaptation that was licensed to Linotype&#x27;s American branch and sold from around 1936. More practical to use than ATF&#x27;s handset foundry type, the number distinguished it from two versions of Stempel Garamond which Linotype also sold. It was the preferred Garalde font of prominent designer Massimo Vignelli.

Several digitisations have been made of both ATF&#x27;s Garamond and the Linotype adaptation, most notably a 2015 digitisation by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original swash characters. A loose adaptation with sans-serif companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.

====Monotype Garamond====

Monotype&#x27;s 1922–1923 design, based on Jannon&#x27;s work in the Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with Microsoft Office. Its italic, faithful to Jannon&#x27;s, is extremely calligraphic, with a variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, including additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype&#x27;s 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.

Monotype&#x27;s artistic advisor Stanley Morison wrote in his memoir that the italic was based on Granjon&#x27;s work, but as Carter&#x27;s commentary on it notes, this seems generally to be a mistake. The swash capitals, however, at least, probably are based on the work of Granjon. A 1959 publicity design promoting it was created by a young Rodney Peppé.

====Garamont====

A revival by Frederic Goudy for the American branch of Monotype, the name chosen to differ from other revivals. An elegant sample created by Bruce Rogers was shown in a spring 1923 issue of Monotype&#x27;s magazine. It, like Monotype Garamond, features a large range of swash characters, based on Imprimerie Nationale specimen sheets.

Mosley has described it as &quot;a lively type, underappreciated I think.&quot; LTC&#x27;s digitisation deliberately maintained its eccentricity and irregularity true to period printing, avoiding perfect verticals. In 1923, Morison at the British branch of Monotype thought it somewhat florid in comparison to the version of his branch which he considered a personal project, noting in a 1923 letter to American printer Daniel Berkeley Updike that &quot;I entertain very decided opinions about this latest of Mr. Goudy&#x27;s achievements ... a comparison leaves me with a preference for our version.&quot;

====Simoncini Garamond====
A 1950s version following Jannon by the Simoncini company of Italy, owned by Francesco Simoncini, which sold matrices for Linotype machines. It is particularly popular in Italian printing.

====Jannon====
František Štorm&#x27;s 2010 revival with optical sizes is one of the few modern revivals of Jannon&#x27;s work. Štorm also created a matching sans-serif companion design, Jannon Sans.

===Related fonts===

As one of the most popular typefaces in history, a number of designs have been created that are influenced by Garamond&#x27;s design but follow different design paths.

====ITC Garamond====
ITC Garamond was created by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC&#x27;s house style of unusually high x-height. It was initially intended to serve as a display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high x-height gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance. As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly proportioned for body text. It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in printed text. As seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple&#x27;s corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O&#x27;Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.

====Cormorant====
An open-source adaptation of Garamond intended for display sizes, designed by Christian Thalmann and co-released with Google Fonts. It features a delicate style suitable for printing at larger sizes, and considerable contrast in stroke weight in its larger sizes. Thalmann added several unusual alternate designs such as an upright italic and unicase styles, as well as exaggerated, highly slanting accents.

====Sans-serif designs====
Several sans-serif typefaces have been published that are based on the proportions of Garamond-style fonts, both as standalone designs or as part of a font superfamily with matching serif and sans-serif fonts. One example is Claude Sans, a humanist sans-serif based on the letterforms of Jannon&#x27;s type, created by Alan Meeks and published by Letraset and later ITC.

==In popular culture==

* In Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;, the protagonists work for a pair of related publishing companies, Garamond and Manuzio, both owned by a Mister Garamond.
* Garamond is the name of a character in the Wii game &quot;Super Paper Mario&quot;. He appears in the world of Flopside (the mirror-image of Flipside, where the game begins). He is a prolific and highly successful author, unlike his Flipside counterpart, Helvetica.
* For many years the masthead of British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; used &quot;The&quot; in italic &#x27;Garamond&#x27; and &quot;Guardian&quot; in bold Helvetica.
* A condensed variant of ITC Garamond was adopted by Apple in 1984 upon the release of the Macintosh, known as Apple Garamond. This was a proprietary font not publicly available, less condensed than the publicly released ITC Garamond Condensed.
* One of the initial goals of the literary journal &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; was to use only a single font: Garamond 3. The editor of the journal, Dave Eggers, has stated that it is his favourite font, &quot;because it looked good in so many permutations—italics, small caps, all caps, tracked out, justified or not.&quot;
* In Robin Sloan&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Mr. Penumbra&#x27;s 24-Hour Bookstore&quot; several character names derive from historical figures associated with the Garamond typeface.
* In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Stardust (Being A Romance Within The Realms of Faerie)&quot;, one of the realms of Faerie is called Garamond. It is ruled by the Squire of Garamond, whose &quot;only heir was transformed into a Gruntling Pig-wiggin.&quot; The realm occurs in the idiom &quot;something is so loud it can be heard from Garamond to Stormhold&quot; and includes an unnamed island in a lake that is the only known origin of a magical herb called Limbus Grass, which compels those who eat it to answer any question truthfully.

===Printer ink claim===
It has been claimed that Garamond uses much less ink than Times New Roman at a similar point size, so changing to Garamond could be a cost-saver for large organizations that print large numbers of documents, especially if using inkjet printers. Garamond, along with Times New Roman and Century Gothic, has been identified by the GSA as a &quot;toner-efficient&quot; font.

This claim has been criticised as a misinterpretation of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Microsoft Office, has a generally smaller design at the same nominal point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. In order to increase the legibility of Garamond, a common approach in typography is to increase text size such that the height of its lower-case characters (i.e., the absolute x-height of the font) matches that of Times New Roman, which counterbalances cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted that the effect of simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: &quot;any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text.&quot; Professional type designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented &quot;If we&#x27;re actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient.&quot;

<text>[[Ship prefix#Generic (merchant navy) prefixes|NS]] &quot;Savannah&quot; was the first nuclear-powered merchant ship. She was built in the late 1950s at a cost of $46.9 million (including a $28.3 million nuclear reactor and fuel core) and launched on July 21, 1959. She was funded by United States government agencies. &quot;Savannah&quot; was a demonstration project for the potential use of nuclear energy. The ship was named after , the first steamship to cross the Atlantic ocean. She was in service between 1962 and 1972 as one of only four nuclear-powered cargo ships ever built. (The Soviet ice-breaker &quot;Lenin&quot;, launched on December 5, 1957, was the first nuclear-powered civilian ship.)

&quot;Savannah&quot; was deactivated in 1971 and after several moves was moored at Pier 13 of the Canton Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland in 2008.

== Origin ==
In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed building a nuclear-powered merchant ship as a showcase for his &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot; initiative. The next year, the United States Congress authorized &quot;Savannah&quot; as a joint project of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Maritime Administration (MARAD), and the Department of Commerce.

She was designed by George G. Sharp, Incorporated, of New York City. Her keel was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey. Her nuclear reactor was manufactured by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. She was christened by U.S. First Lady Mamie Eisenhower at the ship&#x27;s launching on July 21, 1959.

In 1969, &quot;Savannah&quot; became the first nuclear-powered ship to dock in New York City. She was a centerpiece for a citywide information festival called &quot;Nuclear Week In New York&quot;. Thousands of people toured &quot;Savannah&quot; and attended related special events. These included demonstrations of advancements in peaceful uses of atomic energy, such as food products preserved by radiation, new applications for technology and many information and education programs. &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; featured &quot;Nuclear Week In New York&quot; on two programs. Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, was the featured speaker and President Eisenhower was honoured for his introduction of the global Atoms for Peace program. The appearance of &quot;Savannah&quot; and the Nuclear Week festival program was designed and implemented by Charles Yulish Associates and supported by contributions from leading energy companies.

=== Concept ===
Eisenhower desired a &quot;peace ship&quot; that would serve as an ambassador for the peaceful use of atomic power. According to an Eisenhower administration statement to Congress, &quot;The President seeks no return on this vessel except the goodwill of men everywhere ... Neither will the vessel be burdened by proving itself commercially feasible by carrying goods exclusively.&quot; Although initial proposals used a copy of ″s power plant, a conscious decision was made to design a propulsion system to commercial design standards with no connection to military programs.
George G. Sharp, Inc., a prominent naval architecture firm in New York City founded in 1920, was responsible for all of &quot;Savannah&quot;″s design but the Babcock &amp; Wilcox nuclear reactor. &quot;Savannah&quot; was the sixth large ship to have fin stabilizers, intended to enhance the safety of the reactor and improve passenger comfort. Since the reactor occupied the center of the ship and required clear overhead crane access during refueling, the superstructure was set far back on the hull. The raked, teardrop-shaped superstructure was specifically designed by George G. Sharp&#x27;s ship design consultant Jack Heaney and Associates of Wilton, Connecticut, for a futuristic appearance, decorated with stylized atom graphics on either side. Heaney was responsible for the interiors, which featured sleek modern &quot;Atomic Age&quot; styling.

== Description ==

&quot;Savannah&quot; measures in length and in beam, with a loaded draft of , and a loaded displacement of . &quot;Savannah&quot; was built with seven cargo holds, a reactor compartment and a machinery compartment, making nine water-tight compartments. There are three full decks. The reactor compartment is located near the center of the ship, with the superstructure just aft of the reactor top to allow the reactor to be refuelled. Holds 1 through 4 are forward of the superstructure, with cargo handling gear between 1 and 2 and between 3 and 4. Cargo hold 5 is served by side ports, as it is located beneath the swimming pool. Holds 6 and 7 are aft of the superstructure.

The topmost deck of the superstructure comprises the pilothouse, radio room, chart room, a battery room and an emergency diesel generator. The next lower deck comprises the officers&#x27; accommodations, with an officers&#x27; lounge at the tapering rear portion of the superstructure. Below this level is the promenade deck comprising, from forward aft, the elliptical main lounge, the main stair and elevator, and the Veranda Lounge. The bar was provided with enclosed walkways outboard, and a glass wall overlooking the swimming pool and promenade deck aft. A dance floor was provided in the center of the lounge, surrounded by tables with illuminated glass tops. The back bar features a glass and metal sculptural interpretation of the periodic table of the elements.

&quot;A&quot; Deck is the first full deck level, with cargo handling facilities fore and aft. Deck surfaces have been retrofitted with cargo container anchors. The interior of &quot;A&quot; Deck contains the main lobby and purser&#x27;s office, the infirmary, barber, beautician and steward&#x27;s facilities, as well as the health physics laboratory intended to monitor the effects of the nuclear reactor. All thirty passenger cabins are located on &quot;A&quot; Deck, each with a private bath and accommodations for one to three passengers.

&quot;B&quot; Deck contains the ship&#x27;s kitchen and the dining room. The 75-seat dining room features a curved wall sculpture entitled &quot;Fission&quot; by Pierre Bourdelle. At the opposite end of the dining room a metal model of the SS &quot;Savannah&quot; is set in a glass panel. The overhead light fixtures are screened with brass bands representing stylized atoms. The kitchen features an early water-cooled Raytheon Radarange microwave oven. &quot;B&quot; Deck also includes crew quarters and the crew mess and lounge.

&quot;C&quot; Deck comprises more crew quarters, the laundry and a butcher&#x27;s shop. A glassed-in central gallery provides a view of the main engine room. A pressure door provides access to the upper levels of the reactor compartment.

&quot;D&quot; Deck houses the machinery spaces, cargo holds and the nuclear reactor.

=== Reactor ===
&quot;Savannah&quot;″s reactor was designed to civilian standards using low-enriched uranium with less emphasis on shock resistance and compactness of design than that seen in comparable military propulsion reactors, but with considerable emphasis on safety and reliability.

The reactor was placed to allow for access from above for refuelling. The 74 MW reactor is a tall, narrow cylinder, housed in a cylindrical containment vessel with rounded ends and a vertical cylindrical projection housing the control rods and refuelling equipment. The containment vessel houses the pressurized-water reactor, the primary coolant loop and the steam generator. The steel vessel has a wall thickness varying from , designed to accommodate the gauge pressure generated by a ruptured primary coolant pipe. There are two manholes in the top of the containment vessel. Two manholes in the bottom of the containment vessel are designed to admit water to the containment vessel if the ship sinks in more than of water to prevent the pressure vessel&#x27;s collapse. The containment vessel was not occupied under operational conditions, but could be accessed within 30 minutes of reactor shut-down. The lower half of the containment vessel is shielded by a concrete barrier. The upper half is shielded by of lead and of polyethylene. A collision mat shields the sides of the vessel with alternating layers of steel and of redwood in a assembly.

The reactor was de-fuelled in 1975. It was removed and taken to Utah for disposal in November 2022. The reactor was high with a core in diameter and high, with 32 fuel elements. Each fuel element was in diameter and housed 164 uranium oxide pellets enriched to an average of 4.4% U-235. The 16 center elements were enriched to 4.2%, and the outer 16 elements to 4.6%. The pellets were in diameter, with pressurized helium gas in the annular space between the pellets and the element walls. Twenty-one control rods were provided, long, across and thick. The rods could be fully inserted in 1.6 seconds by electric drive.

===Machinery ===

The main machinery room measures long by wide and high. The main control room is immediately aft of the machinery room, from which engineers controlled both the reactor and the steam propulsion plant. A window separates the control room from the machinery room. The control room is visible from the viewing gallery on &quot;C&quot; Deck above. The steam plant is a relatively standard steam plant in its general characteristics, with a nine-stage high-pressure turbine and a 7-stage low-pressure turbine driving a single propeller shaft. The steam and water chemistry program was set up and managed by the Bull &amp; Roberts Company to match the systems it provided for US Navy nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines. The turbines were specially adapted to use the saturated steam typically provided by a nuclear power source. It was also unusual in having a electric motor geared to the high-pressure turbine for use in an emergency. The motor was driven by either the ship&#x27;s steam turbogenerators or the 750 kW emergency diesel generators located in the rear of the pilothouse. These generators could provide basic propulsion to the motor while running the reactor coolant pumps. The motor was upgraded to provide greater torque and reversibility to allow it to move the ship away from a pier in the event of a reactor accident.

The propulsion plant&#x27;s designed capacity was for a design speed of . Actual performance yielded about and a maximum speed of .

== Economics of nuclear propulsion ==
&quot;Savannah&quot; was a demonstration of the technical feasibility of nuclear propulsion for merchant ships and was not expected to be commercially competitive. She was designed to be visually impressive, looking more like a luxury yacht than a bulk cargo vessel, and was equipped with thirty air-conditioned staterooms, each with an individual bathroom, a dining facility for 100 passengers, a lounge that could double as a movie theatre, a veranda, a swimming pool and a library. Even her cargo-handling equipment was designed to look good. By many measures, the ship was a success. She performed well at sea, her safety record was impressive, and her gleaming white paint was never smudged by exhaust smoke, except when running the diesel generator. From 1965 to 1971, the Maritime Administration leased &quot;Savannah&quot; to American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines for revenue cargo service.

However, &quot;Savannah&quot;″s cargo space was limited to of freight in . Many of her competitors could accommodate several times as much. Her streamlined hull made loading the forward holds laborious, which became a significant disadvantage as ports became more and more automated. Her crew was a third larger than comparable oil-fired ships and received special training in addition to that required for conventional maritime licenses. Because of these special licensing requirements, the Maritime Administration established a Nuclear Engineer Program at the United States Merchant Marine Academy to provide officers specifically trained in nuclear marine engineering. 

Additionally, labour disputes erupted over a disparity in pay scales between deck officers and nuclear engineering officers. The pay issue continued to be a problem, so the Maritime Administration canceled its contract with States Marine Lines and selected American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines as the new ship operator. A new crew was trained, delaying further use for almost a year.

As a result of her design handicaps, training requirements, and additional crew members, &quot;Savannah&quot; cost approximately US$2 million a year more in operating subsidies than a similarly sized Mariner-class ship with a conventional oil-fired steam plant. The Maritime Administration placed her out of service in 1971 to save costs, a decision that made sense when fuel oil cost US$20 per ton. In 1974, however, when fuel oil cost $80 per ton, &quot;Savannah&quot;″s operating costs would have been no greater than a conventional cargo ship. This figure does not factor maintenance and eventual disposal of the ship&#x27;s nuclear power plant. The ship&#x27;s namesake, SS &quot;Savannah&quot;, which in 1819 became the first steam powered ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, was also a commercial failure despite the innovation in marine propulsion technology.

== Nuclear refueling, waste disposal and decommissioning ==
During her initial year of operation, &quot;Savannah&quot; released over of very low-level radioactive waste at sea, having substantially exceeded her storage capacity of . The Nuclear Servicing Vessel &quot;Atomic Servant&quot; was built to receive waste from &quot;Savannah.&quot; The unpowered barge featured a fuel storage pit for a replacement fuel and control rod assembly, lined by of lead. &quot;Atomic Servant&quot; was made available to service &quot;Savannah&quot; anywhere in the world.

The radioactive primary coolant loop water was removed at the time of shut-down, as were some of the more radioactive components within the reactor system. The secondary loop water was removed at the same time. Residual radioactivity in 1976 was variously estimated as between , mostly iron 55 (2.4-year half life) and cobalt 60 (5.2-year half life). By 2005, the residual radioactivity had declined to . Residual radiation in 2011 was stated to be very low. The reactor and the ship will be regulated until 2031.

== Service history ==
After christening on July 21, 1959, it took another years to complete the reactor installation and initial trials before the ship was moved to Yorktown, Virginia, under temporary oil-fired power, where the reactor was started and tested. Full reactor power was achieved in April 1962. &quot;Savannah&quot; was delivered on May 1, 1962, to the Maritime Administration and turned over to her operators, the States Marine Lines. On her maiden voyage beginning on August 20, 1962, &quot;Savannah&quot; undertook demonstrations, first sailing to Savannah, her home port. During this trip a faulty instrument initiated a reactor shutdown, which was misreported as a major accident in the press. From there she passed through the Panama Canal and visited Hawaii and ports on the west coast of the United States, becoming a popular exhibit for three weeks at the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle. By early 1963, she arrived in Galveston, Texas, for repair and system checks. There, a dispute over the compensation of nuclear-qualified engineering officers led to a reactor shutdown and strike by the nuclear engineering crew. The contract with States Marine Lines was canceled and a new operator, American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines, was selected, requiring a new crew to be trained. This involved a switch to non-union crew, which became a lingering issue in the staffing of proposed future nuclear ships.

By 1964, &quot;Savannah&quot; started a tour of the US Gulf and east coast ports under the command of captain Gaston R. De Groote. During the summer she crossed the Atlantic for the first time, visiting Bremerhaven, Hamburg, Rotterdam, Dublin and Southampton. 150,000 people toured the ship during this tour.
&quot;Savannah&quot; served as a passenger-cargo liner until 1965, when passenger service was discontinued. By this time a total of 848 passengers had been carried along with of cargo. The ship was converted to all-cargo use, with the removal of 1,800 tons of ballast. Passenger spaces were closed. &quot;Savannah&quot; operated for three years and traveled before returning to Galveston for refueling. Four of the 32 fuel assemblies were replaced and the remaining units rearranged to even out fuel usage. She resumed service until the end of 1971, when she was deactivated.

During her active career, &quot;Savannah&quot; traveled , visiting 45 foreign and 32 domestic ports and was visited by 1.4 million people in her function as an Atoms for Peace project. &quot;Savannah&quot;″s presence also eased access for nuclear-powered naval ships in foreign ports, though the ship was excluded from ports in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

Following her removal from active service, &quot;Savannah&quot; was first obtained by the City of Savannah and was docked at the end of River Street (near the Talmadge Memorial Bridge), with plans for eventually making her a floating hotel. However, investors could not be found. For a short period of time during the late 1970s she was stored in Galveston, Texas, and was a familiar sight to many travelers on State Highway 87 as they crossed Bolivar Roads on the free ferry service operated by the Texas Department of Highways.

== Museum ship ==

In 1981, &quot;Savannah&quot; was obtained via bareboat charter for display at the Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum near Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Although the museum had use of the vessel, ownership of &quot;Savannah&quot; remained with the Maritime Administration, and the Patriots Point Development Authority had to be designated a &quot;co-licensee&quot; for the ship&#x27;s reactor. Periodic radiological inspections were also necessary to ensure the continued safety of the ship. Once &quot;Savannah&quot; was open for display, visitors could tour the ship&#x27;s cargo holds, view the engine room from an observation area, look into staterooms and passenger areas, and walk the ship&#x27;s decks.
The museum had hoped to recondition and improve the ship&#x27;s public spaces for visitors, but these plans never materialized. &quot;Savannah&quot; never drew the visitors that the museum&#x27;s other ships, notably the aircraft carrier , did. When a periodic MARAD inspection in 1993 indicated a need to dry dock &quot;Savannah&quot;, Patriots Point and the Maritime Administration agreed to terminate the ship&#x27;s charter in 1994. The ship was moved from the museum and dry docked in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1994 for repairs, after which she was moved to the James River Merchant Marine Reserve Fleet near Newport News, Virginia.

The Maritime Administration has not funded decommissioning and removal of the ship&#x27;s nuclear systems. &quot;Savannah&quot; had undergone work at Colonna&#x27;s Shipyard of Norfolk, Virginia, beginning August 15, 2006. That $995,000 job included exterior structural and lighting repairs, removing shipboard cranes and wiring, refurbishing water-damaged interior spaces, and removing mold, mildew, and painting some of the interior. On January 30, 2007, she was towed to Pier 23, which is owned by the City of Newport News. On May 8, 2008, &quot;Savannah&quot; arrived in Baltimore under tow. &quot;Savannah&quot; remains in Baltimore through under a U.S. Maritime Administration contract with the Vane Brothers&#x27; Co. at the Canton Marine Terminal in the Canton section of Baltimore.
Since &quot;Savannah&quot; is historically significant and has been designated a National Historic Landmark, MARAD has expressed interest in offering the ship for preservation once &quot;Savannah&quot;″s decommissioning, decontamination and radiological work is completed. A MARAD spokesman told &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; in May 2008 that the maritime agency envisions the ship&#x27;s eventual conversion into a museum, but that no investors have yet offered to undertake the project.

While still under a long term contract with Canton Marine Terminal, NS &quot;Savannah&quot; was towed via C&amp;D canal to Philadelphia for drydock maintenance and pre-decommission work in early September 2019. She arrived to drydock at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia on September 10, 2019. Pre-decommission work is to include removal of nuclear support systems and other mechanical components leading up to the removal of the reactor. Decommissioning must be accomplished by 2031. By mid-February 2020, the ship had returned to Baltimore.

On December 4, 2023, the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation (MARAD) announced in the Federal Register that it is decommissioning the nuclear power plant of the Nuclear Ship Savannah (NSS), which will result in the termination of the ship&#x27;s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license, making the ship available for disposition, including potential conveyance or preservation. MARAD has announced a site visit to take place on December 16 and 17, 2023, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. The site visit will provide interested parties an opportunity to learn more about the NSS to assist in determining if they may wish to consider acquiring the ship for preservation purposes, as prescribed in the recently executed Programmatic Agreement (PA) covering the decommissioning and disposition of the ship.

== Historic designation ==
&quot;Savannah&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 14, 1982. She was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 17, 1991. &quot;Savannah&quot; is notable as one of the most visible and intact examples of the Atoms for Peace program, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in advance of the customary fifty-year age requirement because of her exceptional national significance.

<text>Centronics Data Computer Corporation was an American manufacturer of computer printers, now remembered primarily for the parallel interface that bears its name, the Centronics connector.

== History ==

=== Foundations ===
Centronics began as a division of Wang Laboratories. Founded and initially operated by Robert Howard (president) and Samuel Lang (vice president and owner of the well known K &amp; L Color Photo Service Lab in New York City), the group produced remote terminals and systems for the casino industry. Printers were developed to print receipts and transaction reports. Wang spun off the business in 1971 and Centronics was formed as a corporation in Hudson, New Hampshire with Howard as president and chairman.

The Centronics Model 101 was introduced at the 1970 National Computer Conference in May. The print head used an innovative seven-wire solenoid impact system. Based on this design, Centronics later developed the first dot matrix impact printer (while the first such printer was the OKI Wiredot in 1968).

Howard developed a personal relationship with his neighbor, Max Hugel, the founder and president of Brother International, the United States arm of Brother Industries, Ltd., a manufacturer of sewing machines and typewriters. A business relationship developed when Centronics needed reliable manufacturing of the printer mechanisms—a relationship that would help propel Brother into the printer industry. Hugel would later become executive vice president of Centronics. Print heads and electronics were built in Centronics plants in New Hampshire and Ireland, mechanisms were built in Japan by Brother and the printers were assembled in New Hampshire.

In the 1970s, Centronics formed a relationship with Canon to develop non-impact printers. No products were ever produced, but Canon continued to work on laser printers, eventually developing a highly successful series of engines.

In 1977, Centronics sued competitor Mannesmann AG in a patent dispute regarding the return spring used in the print actuator.

In 1975, Centronics formed an OEM agreement with Tandy and produced DMP and LP series printers for several years. The 6000 series band printers were introduced in 1978. By 1979 company revenues were over $100 million.

In 1980, the Mini-Printer Model 770 was introduced—a small, low-cost desktop serial matrix printer. This was the first printer built completely in-house, and there were problems. Flaws in the microprocessor led to a recall and a stoppage of manufacturing for a year. During this period, Epson, Brother and others began to gain market share and Centronics never recovered. 1980 also saw the introduction of the E Series 900 and 1200 LPM band printers.

=== Change of ownership ===

In 1982, Control Data Corporation merged their current printer business unit, CPI, into Centronics and at the same time invested $25 million in the company, effectively taking control from Howard. During 1980-1985 the company lost $80 million.

Control Data controlled the company until 1986 when CDC&#x27;s interest was acquired by a group of investors affiliated with Drexel Burnham Lambert. The Drexel interest was acquired by Centronics in 1987.

The LineWriter 400 band printer was introduced in 1983, closely followed by the faster LineWriter 800 band printer in 1984. The LineWriter series would continue through 1995. The GLP (Great Little Printer) was a series of low-end serial matrix printers introduced in 1984.

The relationship with Brother continued with several of the PrintStation models being produced from rebadged Brother products. Exclusive rights to market Trilog color matrix printers was acquired in 1984, and Trilog was purchased outright in 1985. Advanced Terminals (a manufacturer of sheet feeders) and BDS Computer Australia Pty Ltd were purchased in 1986.

The PrintStation 350 series serial matrix printer was highly successful in the OEM market, sold with the logos of Data General, ITT Courier, NCR, CDC, Decision Data and ISI. Most profitable was the agreement to build the IBM 4214 based on a modified PS350. In 1985, company revenues were $126 million with $65 million from IBM 4214 production. In 1986 the IBM 4214 production ended and revenue dropped.

On June 23, 1986, Centronics announced the new corporate logo. The new logo never gained recognition before the sale to GENICOM, and GENICOM used the old logo in continued sales of printers and supplies.

The only Centronics laser product was released in July 1986: the PagePrinter 8. The PP8 used a Sharp engine identical to an existing Sharp copier, using a 6800 based controller jointly developed by Sharp and Centronics. At $2,495, the PP8 was $500 less than the HP LaserJet. A faster version was announced, but never materialized.

=== Printer division sale ===
In 1987 the Centronics printer business was sold to GENICOM for $87 million. Centronics Data Computer Corporation continued as a New York Stock Exchange company and soon changed its name to Centronics Corporation in 1987. After using the proceeds of the sale to purchase Ekco Housewares in 1988 for $125 million, Centronics changed their name to Ekco Group, Inc.

==Centronics 101==
The Centronics 101 (introduced 1970) was highly innovative and affordable at its inception. Some selected specifications:
* Print speed: 165 characters per second
* Weight: 118 pounds (53.5 kg)
* Size: 27 ½ &quot; W x 11 ¼ &quot; H x 19 ¼ D (≈70 cm x 29 cm x 49 cm)
* Shipping: 200 pounds (ca 91 kg), wooden crate, unpacked by removal of 36 screws
* Characters: 62, 10 numeric, 26 upper case and 26 special characters (no lower case)
* Character size: 10 characters per inch
* Line spacing: 6 lines per inch
* Vertical control: punched tape reader for top of form and vertical tab
* Forms thickness: original plus four copies
* Interfaces: Centronics parallel, optional RS-232 serial

== Legacy ==

The connectors developed for its parallel interface live on as the &quot;Centronics connector&quot;, used in other computer hardware applications, notably as the printer end of the once ubiquitous parallel-printer cable.

<doc id="194578" wikidata="Q19120" url="?curid=194578" title="Ricinulei">
<text>Ricinulei is a small order of arachnids. Like most arachnids, they are predatory; eating small arthropods. They occur today in west-central Africa (&quot;Ricinoides&quot;) and the Americas (&quot;Cryptocellus&quot; and &quot;Pseudocellus&quot;) from Brazil to southern Texas, where they inhabit either leaf-litter or caves. As of 2022, 103 extant species of ricinuleids have been described worldwide, all in the single family Ricinoididae. Due to their obscurity they do not have a proper common-name, though in academic literature they are occasionally referred to as hooded tickspiders.

In addition to the three living genera, Ricinulei has a fossil-record spanning over 300 million years, including fossils from the Late Carboniferous of Euramerica and the Cretaceous Burmese amber.

The Ricinulei order is considered by paleontologists and zoologists to be a Lazarus taxon - that is, a taxon (plural taxa) which disappears for one or more periods from the fossil record, only to appear again either in subsequent fossil records, or as actual living organisms - often in isolated, obscure, or otherwise very specialized habitats.

== Anatomy and physiology ==
The most important general account of ricinuleid anatomy remains the 1904 monograph by Hans Jacob Hansen and William Sørensen. Useful further studies can be found in, e.g., the work of Pittard and Mitchell, Gerald Legg and L. van der Hammen.
=== Body ===
Ricinulei are typically about long. The largest Ricinulei known to ever exist was the Late Carboniferous &quot;Curculioides bohemondi&quot; with a body length of . The cuticle (or exoskeleton) of both the legs and body is remarkably thick. Their most notable feature is a &quot;hood&quot; (or &quot;cucullus&quot;) which can be raised and lowered over the head. When lowered, it covers the mouth and the chelicerae. Living ricinuleids have no eyes, although two pairs of lateral eyes can be seen in fossils and even living species retain light-sensitive areas of cuticle in this position.

The heavy-bodied abdomen (or opisthosoma) exhibits a narrow &quot;pedicel&quot;, or waist, where it attaches to the prosoma. Curiously, there is a complex coupling mechanism between the prosoma and opisthosoma. The front margin of the opisthosoma tucks into a corresponding fold at the back of the carapace. The advantages of this unusual system are not well understood, and since the genital opening is located on the pedicel (another rather unusual feature) the animals have to &#x27;unlock&#x27; themselves in order to mate. The abdomen is divided dorsally into a series of large plates or tergites, each of which is subdivided into a median and lateral plate.
=== Appendages ===

The mouthparts, or chelicerae, are composed of two segments forming a fixed and a moveable digit. Sensory organs are also found associated with the mouthparts; presumably for tasting the food. The chelicerae can be retracted and at rest they are normally hidden beneath the cucullus.

Ricinuleid pedipalps are complex appendages. They are typically used to manipulate food items, but also bear many sensory structures and are used as &#x27;short range&#x27; sensory organs. The pedipalps end in pincers that are small relative to their bodies, when compared to those of the related orders of scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Similar pincers on the pedipalps have now been found in the extinct order Trigonotarbida (see Relationships).

As in many harvestmen, the second pair of legs is longest in ricinuleids and these limbs are used to feel ahead of the animal, almost like antennae. If the pedipalps are &#x27;short range&#x27; sensory organs, the second pair of legs are the corresponding &#x27;long range&#x27; ones. Sensilla on the tarsi at the ends of legs I and II (which are used more frequently to sense the surroundings) differ from those of legs III and IV. In male ricinuleids, the third pair of legs are uniquely modified to form copulatory organs. The shape of these organs is very important for taxonomy and can be used to tell males of different species apart.

=== Internal anatomy ===
An older summary of ricinuleid internal anatomy was published by Jacques Millot. The midgut has been described, while the excretory system consists of Malpighian tubules and a pair of coxal glands. Female ricinuleids have spermathecae, presumably to store sperm. The male genitalia, sperm cells and sperm production have also been intensively studied. Gas exchange takes place through trachea, and opens through a single pair of spiracles on the prosoma. At least one Brazilian species appears to have a plastron, which may help it prevent getting wet and allow it to continue to breathe, even if inundated with water.

== Distribution ==
Of the three living genera, &quot;Ricinoides&quot; inhabits tropical West Africa from The Gambia and Senegal, eastwards to the Congo and Gabon, &quot;Pseudocellus&quot; inhabits North and Central America from Panama to Southern Texas, as well as the Caribbean (including Cuba), while &quot;Cryptocellus&quot; ranges from Rondônia in western Brazil northwards to Honduras in Central America.

==Behavior and life history==

Ricinuleids inhabit the leaf litter of rainforest floors, as well as caves, where they search for prey with their elongate sensory second leg pair. Ricinulei feed on other small invertebrates, although details of their natural prey are sparse. Relatively little is known about their courtship and mating habits, but males have been observed using their modified third pair of legs to transfer a spermatophore to the female. The eggs are carried under the mother&#x27;s hood, until the young hatch into six-legged larva, which later molt into their eight-legged adult forms. The six-legged larva is a feature they share with Acari (see Relationships). Despite the scarce number of studies about the biology of this group, recent studies have reported nocturnal habits, as well as novel behaviors for this group, which include interactions between individuals different than mating. Ricinuleids are often found in large congregations, the exact purpose of which is unknown.

==Fossil record==
Ricinulei are unique among arachnids in that the first one to be discovered was a fossil, described in 1837 by the noted English geologist William Buckland; albeit misinterpreted as a beetle. Further fossil species were added in subsequent years by, among others, Samuel Hubbard Scudder, Reginald Innes Pocock and Alexander Petrunkevitch.

Fifteen of the twenty species of fossil ricinuleids discovered so far originate from the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) coal measures of Europe and North America. They were revised in detail in 1992 by Paul Selden, who placed them in a separate suborder, Palaeoricinulei.

The fossils are divided into four families: Curculioididae, Poliocheridae, Primoricinuleidae, and Sigillaricinuleidae. The poliocherids are more like modern ricinuleids in having an opisthosoma with a series of three large, divided tergites. Curculioidids, by contrast, have an opisthosoma without obvious tergites, but with a single median sulcus; a dividing line running down the middle of the back. This superficially resembles the elytra of a beetle and explains why Buckland originally misidentified the first fossil species. Five species: &quot;?Poliochera cretacea&quot;, &quot;Primoricinuleus pugio&quot;, &quot;Hirsutisoma acutiformis&quot;, &quot;H. bruckschi&quot;, &quot;H. grimaldii&quot; and &quot;H. dentata&quot;, are known from the Cenomanian (~99 million years old) Burmese amber of Myanmar; &quot;Curculioides bohemondi&quot;, the largest of all Ricinulei, was a member of the Curculioididae. &quot;Monooculricinuleus incisus&quot; and &quot;M. semiglobosus&quot; from Burmese amber were originally described as members of Ricinulei, but they might belong to Opiliones instead.

Some Carboniferous genera of Palaeoricinulei exceed modern Ricinulei in size, with bodies in length, and many appear to have had eyes, unlike modern representatives which are completely blind. It is likely they had a surface dwelling ecology, unlike that of modern Ricinulei. The fossil genera from the Cretaceous Burmese amber are referred to the extinct order Primoricinulei, and are thought to have had a different ecology than modern species as tree-dwelling predators that crawled on bark.

===Early work===
In 1665, Robert Hooke described a large crab-like mite he observed with a microscope, he published a description of it in his book; &quot;Micrographia&quot;. The first living ricinuleid described using Linnaean taxonomy was from West Africa by Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville in 1838, &quot;i.e.&quot; one year after the first fossil. This was followed by a second living example collected by Henry Walter Bates in Brazil and described by John Obadiah Westwood in 1874, and a third from Sierra Leone by Tamerlan Thorell in 1892. In these early studies ricinuleids were thought to be unusual harvestmen (Opiliones), and in his 1892 paper Thorell introduced the name &quot;Ricinulei&quot; for these animals as a suborder of the harvestman. Ricinuleids were subsequently recognized as an arachnid order in their own right in the 1904 monograph by Hansen &amp; Soerensen. These authors recognised a group called &quot;&quot;, comprising spiders, whip spiders, whip scorpions and ricinuleids, which they defined as having a rather narrow join between the prosoma and opisthosoma and a small &#x27;tail end&#x27; to the opisthosoma.

===Ricinuleids and mites===
Morphological studies of arachnid relationships have largely concluded that ricinuleids are most closely related to Acari (mites and ticks) though more recent phylogenomic studies refute this. L. van der Hammen placed ricinuleids in a group called &quot;Cryptognomae&quot;, together with the anactinotrichid mites only. Peter Weygoldt and Hannes Paulus referred to ricinuleids and all mites as &quot;Acarinomorpha&quot;. Jeffrey Shultz used the name &quot;Acaromorpha&quot;. This hypothesis recognizes that both ricinuleids and mites hatch with a larval stage with only six legs, rather than the usual eight seen in arachnids. The additional pair of legs appears later during development. Some authors have also suggested that the gnathosoma, a separate part of the body bearing the mouthparts, is also a unique character for ricinuleids and mites, but this feature is rather complex and difficult to interpret and other authors would restrict the presence of a gnathosoma &quot;sensu stricto&quot; to mites only.

===Ricinuleids and trigonotarbids===
In 1892, Ferdinand Karsch suggested that ricinuleids were the last living descendants of the extinct arachnid order Trigonotarbida. This hypothesis was widely overlooked, but was reintroduced by Jason Dunlop in 1996. Characteristics shared by ricinuleids and trigonotarbids include the division of the tergites on the opisthososma into median and lateral plates and the presence of an unusual &#x27;locking mechanism&#x27; between the two halves of the body. A further study subsequently recognised that the tip of the pedipalp in both ricinuleids and trigonotarbids ends in a similar small claw. Ricinuleids as sister group of trigonotarbids was also recovered in the 2002 study by Gonzalo Giribet and colleagues.

=== Phylogenomic studies ===
Recent phylogenomic studies have recovered different relationships than those previously suggested. An analysis in early 2019 suggested the sister group of the ricinuleids may be Xiphosura, the arthropod order containing horseshoe crabs. In response to this work, a more recent study placed Ricinulei and Opiliones as sister taxa.

<text>The Ore Mountains (, ) lie along the Czech–German border, separating the historical regions of Bohemia in the Czech Republic and Saxony in Germany. The highest peaks are the Klínovec in the Czech Republic (German: &quot;Keilberg&quot;) at above sea level and the Fichtelberg in Germany at .

The Ore Mountains have been intensively reshaped by human intervention and a diverse cultural landscape has developed. Mining in particular, with its tips, dams, ditches and sinkholes, directly shaped the landscape and the habitats of plants and animals in many places. The region was also the setting of the earliest stages of the early modern transformation of mining and metallurgy from a craft to a large-scale industry, a process that preceded and enabled the later Industrial Revolution.

The higher altitudes from around 500 m above sea level on the German side belong to the Ore Mountains/Vogtland Nature Parkthe largest of its kind in Germany with a length of 120 km. The eastern Ore Mountains are protected landscape. Other smaller areas on the German and Czech sides are protected as nature reserves and natural monuments. On the ridges there are also several larger raised bogs that are only fed by rainwater. The mountains are popular for hiking and there are winter sports areas at higher elevations. In 2019, the region became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Name ==
In English, the Ore Mountains are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ore Mountain Range&quot;, but are also sometimes called the &quot;Erzgebirge&quot; or &quot;Erz Mountains&quot; after their German name or the &quot;Krušné Mountains&quot; after their Czech name. In Czech they are the &quot;Krušné hory&quot; , from old Czech , meaning &quot;piece of ore&quot;, and were historically known as &quot;Rudohoří&quot;, a literal translation of the German name, and &quot;Vyšehory&quot;, meaning &quot;high mountains&quot;. In Upper Sorbian the mountains are known as the &quot;Rudne horiny&quot;. The German and Upper Sorbian names, as well as the historical Czech &quot;Rudohoří&quot;, literally mean &quot;ore mountains&quot;.

== Geography ==
=== Geology ===
The Ore Mountains are geologically considered to be one of the most heavily researched mountain ranges in the world. The Ore Mountains are a Hercynian block tilted so as to present a steep scarp face towards Bohemia and a gentle slope on the German side.
They were formed during a lengthy process.

During the folding of the Variscan orogeny, metamorphism occurred deep underground, forming slate and gneiss. In addition, granite plutons intruded into the metamorphic rocks. By the end of the Palaeozoic era, the mountains had been eroded into gently undulating hills (the Permian massif), exposing the hard rocks.

In the Tertiary period these mountain remnants came under heavy pressure as a result of plate tectonic processes during which the Alps were formed and the North American and Eurasian plates were separated.
As the rock of the Ore Mountains was too brittle to be folded, it shattered into an independent fault block which was uplifted and tilted to the northwest. This can be very clearly seen at a height of on the mountain of &quot;Komáří vížka&quot; which lies on the Czech side, east of Zinnwald-Georgenfeld, right on the edge of the fault block.

Consequently, it is a fault-block mountain range, which has been incised by a whole range of river valleys whose rivers drain southwards into the Ohře and northwards into the Mulde or directly into the Elbe.
The main geologic feature in the Ore Mountains is the Late Paleozoic Eibenstock granite pluton, which is exposed for 25 miles along its northwest–southeast axis and up to 15 miles in width. This pluton is surrounded by progressive zones of contact metamorphism in which Paleozoic slates and phyllites have been changed to spotted hornfels, andalusite hornfels, and quartzites. Two key mineral centres intersect this pluton at Joachimsthal, one trending northwesterly from Schneeberg through Johanngeorgenstadt to Joachimsthal, and a second trending north–south from Freiberg through Marienberg, Annaberg, Niederschlag, Joachimsthal, and Schlaggenwald. Late Tertiary faulting and volcanism gave rise to basalt and phonolite dikes. Ore veins include iron, copper, tin, tungsten, lead, silver, cobalt, bismuth, uranium, plus iron and manganese oxides.

The most important rocks occurring in the Ore Mountains are schist, phyllite and granite with contact metamorphic zones in the west, basalt as remnants in the Plešivec (Pleßberg), Scheibenberg, Bärenstein, Pöhlberg, Velký Špičák (&quot;Großer Spitzberg or Schmiedeberger Spitzberg&quot;), Jelení hora (&quot;Haßberg&quot;) and Geisingberg as well as gneisses and rhyolite (Kahleberg) in the east. The soils consist of rapidly leaching grus. In the western and central areas of the mountains it is formed from weathered granite. Phyllite results in a loamy, rapidly weathered gneiss in the east of the mountains producing a light soil. As a result of the subsoils based on granite and rhyolite, the land is mostly covered in forest; on the gneiss soils it was possible to grow and cultivate flax in earlier centuries and, later, rye, oats and potatoes up to the highlands. Today the land is predominantly used for pasture. But it is not uncommon to see near-natural mountain meadows.

To the north of the Ore Mountains, west of Chemnitz and around Zwickau lies the Ore Mountain Basin which is only really known geologically. Here there are deposits of stone coal where mining has already been abandoned. A similar but smaller basin with abandoned coal deposits, the Döhlen Basin, is located southwest of Dresden on the northern edge of the Ore Mountains. It forms the transition to the Elbe Valley zone.

=== Terrain ===
The western part of the Ore Mountains is home to the two highest peaks of the range: Klínovec, located in the Czech part, with an altitude of and Fichtelberg, the highest mountain of Saxony, Germany, at . The Ore Mountains are part of a larger mountain system and adjoin the Fichtel Mountains to the west and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains to the east. Past the River Elbe, the mountain chain continues as the Lusatian Mountains. While the mountains slope gently away in the northern (German) part, the southern (Czech) slopes are rather steep.

=== Topography ===

The Ore Mountains are oriented in a southwest–northeast direction and are about 150 km long and, on average, about 40 km wide. From a geomorphological perspective the range is divided into the Western, Central and Eastern Ore Mountains, separated by the valleys of the Schwarzwasser and Zwickauer Mulde and the Flöha (&quot;Flöha Line&quot;), the division of the western section along the River Schwarzwasser is of a more recent date. The Eastern Ore Mountains mainly comprise large, gently climbing plateaux, in contrast with the steeper and higher-lying western and central areas, and are dissected by river valleys that frequently change direction. The crest of the mountains themselves forms, in all three regions, a succession of plateaux and individual peaks.

To the east it is adjoined by the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and, to the west, by the Elster Mountains and other Saxon parts of the Vogtland. South(east) of the Central and Eastern Ore Mountains lies the North Bohemian Basin and, immediately east of that, the Bohemian Central Uplands which are separated from the Eastern Ore Mountains by narrow fingers of the aforementioned basin. South(east) of the Western Ore Mountains lie the Sokolov Basin, the Eger Graben and the Doupov Mountains. To the north the boundary is less sharply defined because the Ore Mountains, a typical example of a fault-block, descend very gradually. 

The topographical transition from the Western and Central Ore Mountains to the loess hill country to the north between Zwickau and Chemnitz is referred to as the Ore Mountain Basin; that from the Eastern Ore Mountains as the Ore Mountain Foreland. Between Freital and Pirna, the area is called the Dresden Ore Mountain Foreland (&quot;Dresdner Erzgebirgsvorland&quot;) or Bannewitz-Possendorf-Burkhardswald Plateau (&quot;Bannewitz-Possendorf-Burkhardswalder Plateau&quot;). Geologically the Ore Mountains reach the city limits of Dresden at the Windberg hill near Freital and the Karsdorf Fault. The V-shaped valleys of the Ore Mountains break through this fault and the shoulder of the Dresden Basin.

The Ore Mountains belong to the Bohemian Massif within Europe&#x27;s Central Uplands, a massif that also includes the Upper Palatine Forest, the Bohemian Forest, the Bavarian Forest, the Lusatian Mountains, the Iser Mountains, the Giant Mountains and the Inner-Bohemian Mountains. At the same time it forms a y-shaped mountain chain, along with the Upper Palatine Forest, Bohemian Forest, Fichtel Mountains, Franconian Forest, Thuringian Slate Mountains and Thuringian Forest, that has no unique name but is characterised by a rather homogeneous climate.

According to cultural tradition, Zwickau is seen historically as part of the Ore Mountains, Chemnitz is seen historically as just lying outside them, but Freiberg is included. The supposed limit of the Ore Mountains continues southwest of Dresden towards the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. From this perspective, its main characteristics, i.e., gently sloping plateaus climbing up to the ridgeline incised by V-shaped valleys, continue to the southern edge of the Dresden Basin. North of the Ore Mountains the landscape gradually transitions into the Saxon Lowland and Saxon Elbeland. Its cultural-geographical transition to Saxon Switzerland in the area of the Müglitz and Gottleuba valleys is not sharply defined.

==== Notable peaks ====

The highest mountain in the Ore Mountains is the Klínovec (German: &quot;Keilberg&quot;), at 1,244 metres, in the Bohemian part of the range. The highest elevation on the Saxon side is the 1,215-metre-high Fichtelberg, which was the highest mountain in East Germany. The Ore Mountains contain about thirty summits with a height over , but not all are clearly defined mountains. Most of them occur around the Klínovec and the Fichtelberg. About a third of them are located on the Saxon side of the border.

==== Important rivers ====
From west to east:

* Svatava (&quot;Zwota&quot;)
* Rolava (&quot;Rohlau&quot;)

* Freiberger Mulde
** Zschopau

=== Natural regions in the Saxon Ore Mountains ===
In the division of Germany into natural regions that was carried out Germany-wide in the 1950s the Ore Mountains formed major unit group 42:

* 42 Ore Mountains (&quot;Erzgebirge&quot;)
** 420 &quot;Southern slopes of the Ore Mountains&quot; (&quot;Südabdachung des Erzgebirges&quot;)
** 421 &quot;Upper Western Ore Mountains&quot; (&quot;Oberes Westerzgebirge&quot;)
** 422 &quot;Upper Eastern Ore Mountains&quot; (&quot;Oberes Osterzgebirge&quot;)
** 423 &quot;Lower Western Ore Mountains&quot; (&quot;Unteres Westerzgebirge&quot;)
** 424 &quot;Lower Eastern Ore Mountains&quot; (&quot;Unteres Osterzgebirge&quot;)

Even after the reclassification of natural regions by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation in 1994 the Ore Mountains, region &quot;D16&quot;, remained a major unit group with almost unchanged boundaries. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the working group &quot;Naturhaushalt und Gebietscharakter&quot; of the Saxon Academy of Sciences (&quot;Sächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot;) in Leipzig merged the Ore Mountains with the major unit group of Vogtland to the west and the major landscape units of Saxon Switzerland, Lusatian Highlands and Zittau Mountains to the east into one overarching unit, the Saxon Highlands and Uplands. In addition, its internal divisions were changed. Former major unit 420 was grouped with the western part of major units 421 and 423 to form a new major unit, the Western Ore Mountains (&quot;Westerzgebirge&quot;), the eastern part of major units 421 and 423 became the Central Ore Mountains (&quot;Mittelerzgebirge&quot;) and major units 422 and 424 became the Eastern Ore Mountains (&quot;Osterzgebirge&quot;).

The current division therefore looks as follows:

* Saxon Highlands and Uplands (&quot;Sächsisches Bergland und Mittelgebirge&quot;)
** Ore Mountains (&quot;Erzgebirge&quot;)
*** Western Ore Mountains (&quot;Westerzgebirge&quot;)
*** Central Ore Mountains (&quot;Mittelerzgebirge&quot;)
*** Eastern Ore Mountains (&quot;Osterzgebirge&quot;)

The geographic unit of the Southern Slopes of the Ore Mountains remains unchanged under the title of Southern Ore Mountains (&quot;Süderzgebirge&quot;).

=== Climate ===
The climate of the higher regions of the Ore Mountains is characterised as distinctly harsh. Temperatures are considerably lower all year round than in the lowlands, and the summer is noticeably shorter and cool days are frequent. The average annual temperatures only reach values of 3 to 5 °C. In Oberwiesenthal, at a height of , on average only about 140 frost-free days per year are observed. Based on reports of earlier chroniclers, the climate of the upper Ore Mountains in past centuries must have been even harsher than it is today. Historic sources describe hard winters in which cattle froze to death in their stables, and occasionally houses and cellars were snowed in even after snowfalls in April. The population was regularly cut off from the outside world. The upper Ore Mountains was therefore nicknamed &quot;Saxon Siberia&quot; already in the 18th century.

The fault block mountain range that climbs from northwest to southeast, and which enables prolonged rain to fall as orographic rain when weather systems drive in from the west and northwest, gives rise to twice as much precipitation as in the lowlands which exceeds 1,100 mm on the upper reaches of the mountains. Since a large part of the precipitation falls as snow, in many years a thick and permanent layer of snow remains until April. The ridges of the Ore Mountains are one of the snowiest areas in the German Central Uplands. Foehn winds, and also the so-called Bohemian Wind may occur during certain specific southerly weather conditions.

As a result of the climate and the heavy amounts of snow a natural Dwarf Mountain Pine region is found near Satzung, near the border to Bohemia at just under . By comparison, in the Alps these pines do not occur until 1,600 to .

== History ==
=== Etymology of the name ===

The term &quot;Saltusbohemicus&quot; (&quot;Bohemian Forest&quot;) for the region emerged in the 12th century. In the German language the names &quot;Böhmischer Wald&quot;, &quot;Beheimer Wald&quot;, &quot;Behmerwald&quot; or &quot;Böhmerwald&quot; were used, in Czech the name &quot;Český les&quot;. The last-mentioned names are used today for the mountain range along the Czech Republic&#x27;s southwestern border (&quot;see:&quot; Bohemian Forest).

From earlier research, other names for the Ore Mountains have also appeared in a few older written records. However, the names &quot;Hircanus Saltus&quot; (Hercynian Forest) or &quot;Fergunna&quot;, which appeared in the 9th century, were only used in a general sense for the vast forests of the Central Uplands. Frequently the term &quot;Miriquidi&quot; is used to refer directly to the Ore Mountains, but it only surfaces twice in the 10th and early 11th centuries, and these sources do not permit a clear identification with the ancient forest that formerly covered the whole of the Ore Mountains and its foreland.

Following the discovery of large ore deposits the area was further renamed in the 16th century. Petrus Albinus used the name&quot; Erzgebirge&quot; (&quot;Ore Mountains&quot;) for the first time in 1589, in his chronicle. In the early 17th century, the name &quot;Meißener Berge&quot; (&quot;Meissen Mountains&quot;) was temporarily used. A quarter of a century later the names &quot;Erzgebirge&quot; in German and &quot;Rudohoří&quot; in Czech became established. The Czech toponym is , derived from an old Czech expression &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;ore&quot;.

The mountains are sometimes divided into the Saxon Ore Mountains and Bohemian Ore Mountains. A similarly named range in Slovakia is usually known as the Slovak Ore Mountains.
=== Economic history ===
Europe&#x27;s earliest mining district appears to be located in Erzgebirge, dated to 2500 BC. From there tin was traded north to the Baltic Sea and south to the Mediterranean following the Amber Road trading route, of great importance in the Bronze Age. Tin mining knowledge spread to other European tin mining districts from Erzgebirge and evidence of tin mining begins to appear in Brittany, Devon and Cornwall, and in the Iberian Peninsula around 2000 BC. These deposits saw greater exploitation when they fell under Roman control between the third century BC and the first century AD. Demand for tin created a large and thriving network amongst Mediterranean cultures of Classical times. By the Medieval period, Iberia&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s deposits lost importance and were largely forgotten while Devon and Cornwall began dominating the European tin market.

From the time of the first wave of settlement, the history of the Ore Mountains has been heavily influenced by its economic development, especially that of the mining industry.

Settlement in the Ore Mountains was slow to begin with, especially on the Bohemian side. The harsh climate and short growing seasons hindered the cultivation of agricultural products. Nevertheless, settlements were supported by the aristocratic Hrabischitz family and established mainly at the foot of the mountains and along mountain streams into the deep woods.

In 1168, as a result of settlement in the early 12th century at the northern edge of the Ore Mountains, the first silver ore was discovered in the vicinity of present-day Freiberg, resulting in the &quot;First Berggeschrey&quot; or mining rush. Almost simultaneously, the first tin ore was discovered on the southern edge of the mountains in Bohemia.

In the 13th century, colonization of the mountains took place only sporadically along the Bohemian Way (&quot;antiqua Bohemiae semita&quot;). It was here that Sayda was built, a station on the trade route from Freiberg via Einsiedl, Johnsdorf and Brüx to Prague. In Sayda it joined the so-called salt road that ran from Halle via Oederan and onto Prague. Glass-making was introduced into the region from the second half of the 13th century. The emergence of this branch of trade benefited from the abundance of excess timber, which was created by clearings and new settlements and which was able to meet the high demand of the glassworks. Monks from Waldsassen Abbey brought a knowledge of the glass manufacture to the Ore Mountains. Most glassworks were located in the vicinity of Moldau, Brandau and the Frauenbach valley. The oldest glassworks site is Ulmbach. This timber-hungry industry lost its importance, however, with the boom in mining, which also enjoyed royal patronage.

Mining on the Bohemian side of the mountains probably began in the 14th century. An indication of this is a contract between Boresch of Riesenburg and the Ossegg abbot, Gerwig, in which the division of revenue derived from ore was agreed. Grains of tin (&quot;Zinnkörner&quot; or &quot;Graupen&quot;) were obtained at that time in the Seiffen mining area and gave the Bohemian mining town of Graupen (Czech &quot;Krupka&quot;) its name.

With the further settlement of the Ore Mountains in the 15th century, new, rich, ore deposits were eventually discovered around Schneeberg Annaberg and St. Joachimsthal. The &quot;Second Berggeschrey&quot; started and triggered a massive wave of colonization. In quick succession, new, planned, mining towns were built across the Ore Mountains in the vicinity of newly discovered ore deposits. Typical examples are the towns of Marienberg, Oberwiesenthal, Gottesgab (&quot;Boží Dar&quot;), Sebastiansberg (&quot;Hora Sv. Šebestiána&quot;) and Platten (&quot;Horní Blatná&quot;). Economically, however, only silver and tin ores were used. From that time, the wealth of Saxony was built on the silver mines of the Ore Mountains. As a metal used for coinage, silver was minted on site in the mountain towns into money. The &quot;Joachimsthaler&quot; coins, minted in the valley of &quot;Joachimsthal&quot;, became famous and gave their name to the medieval coin known as the &quot;Thaler&quot; from which the word &quot;dollar&quot; is derived. After the end of the Hussite Wars, the economy in Bohemia, which had been disrupted by the conflict, recovered.

In the 16th century the Ore Mountains became the heartland of the Central European mining industry. New ore discoveries attracted more and more people, and the number of residents on the Saxon side of the mountains continued to rise rapidly. Bohemia, in addition to migration from within the country, also received migration from elsewhere, mainly of German miners, who settled in the mountain villages and in the towns at the edge of the mountains.

Under Emperor Ferdinand II an unprecedented Re-Catholicization began in Bohemia from 1624 to 1626, whereupon a large number of Bohemian Protestants then fled into the neighbouring Electorate of Saxony. As a result, many Bohemian villages became devastated and desolate, while on the Saxon side new places were founded by these migrants, such as the mining town of Johanngeorgenstadt.

Ore mining largely came to a standstill in the 17th century, especially after the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Due to the very sharp decline of the mining industry and because the search for new ore deposits proved fruitless, the population had to resort to other occupations. Agricultural yields were low, however, and also the demand for wood was reduced by the closure of smelteries. Many people were already active at that time in textile production. However, since that was not enough for subsistence, the manufacture of wooden goods and toys developed, especially in the Eastern Ore Mountains. Here, the artisans were required by Prince-Elector Augustus under the Timber Act of 1560, to buy their wood in Bohemia. Wood from the Saxon Ore Mountains was still needed for the mines and smelters in Freiberg. This export of timber led, among other things, to the construction of an artificial cross-border rafting channel, the Neugrabenflöße, along the river Flöha. Because of the decline in industrial production in that period, people without any ties migrated to the interior of Germany or Bohemia.

After the discovery of the cobalt blue pigments the mining industry experienced a revival. Cobalt was extracted especially in Schneeberg, and processed in the state paintworks to produce cobalt blue paints and dyes. They succeeded in keeping the method of production secret for a long time, so that for about 100 years the blue colour works had a worldwide monopoly. From about 1820 in Johanngeorgenstadt, uranium was also extracted and was then used to colour glass, amongst other things. Even richer deposits of uranium ore were found in St. Joachimsthal. St. Andrew&#x27;s White Earth Mine (&quot;Weißerdenzeche St. Andreas&quot;) at Aue supplied kaolin to the Meissen Porcelain Factory in Meissen for nearly 150 years. Its export from the state, however, was prohibited by the Prince-electors under threat of severe punishment or even death.

Towards the end of the 19th century, mining slowly declined again. Drainage costs increased, from the mid-19th century, led to a steady decrease in yield, despite sinking of deeper galleries (&quot;Erbstollen&quot;) and the expansion of ditch and tunnel (&quot;Rösche&quot;) systems for supplying the necessary water for overshot wheels from the crest of the mountains, such as the Freiberg Mines Water Management System or the &quot;Reitzenhainer Zeuggraben&quot;. Only a few mines remained profitable over a long period. Amongst them was the &quot;Himmelsfürst Fundgrube&quot; near Erbisdorf, whose 50 continuous years of profitable operation were commemorated in 1818 with the issue of a commemorative coin (&quot;Ausbeutetaler&quot;) and which went on to make a profit continuously until 1848. Thanks to discoveries of rich ore seams it became the most productive Freiberg mine of the 19th century.

But even the excavation of the Rothschönberger Stolln, the largest and most important Saxon drainage adit, which drained the entire Freiberg district, could not stop the decline of mining. Because even before the completion of this technical achievement the German Empire introduced the gold standard in 1871, the price of silver dropped rapidly and led to the unprofitability of the entire Ore Mountain silver mining industry. This situation was not altered even by short-term discoveries of rich deposits in various mines nor the state&#x27;s purchase of all the Freiberg mines and their incorporation into the state-owned enterprise, &quot;Oberdirektion der Königlichen Erzbergwerke&quot;, founded in 1886. In 1913, the last silver mines closed and the company was disbanded.
Mining in the Ore Mountains was given new life during the First and Second World Wars in order to supply raw materials. Nazi Germany also saw the resumption of silver mining. Afterwards the people returned to the manufacture of wooden products and toys, especially in the Eastern Ore Mountains. The clock industry is centred on Glashütte. In the Western Ore Mountains, economic alternatives were offered by the engineering and textile industries.

In 1789 the chemical element uranium was discovered in St. Joachimsthal; then in pitchblende from the same area, radium was discovered by Marie Curie in 1898. In the late 1930s, following the discovery of the nuclear fission, uranium ore became of particular interest for military purposes. After the incorporation of Sudetenland into Germany in 1938 all the uranium production facilities were commandeered for the development of nuclear weapons. After the American atomic bomb was dropped on Japan in 1945, Soviet experts searched for evidence of the German nuclear energy project to support Soviet atomic bomb development. Shortly thereafter, the processing of uranium ore for the Soviet Union began in the Ore Mountains under the code name SAG Wismut, a cover up for the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s highly secretive uranium mining.

For the third time in history, thousands of people poured into the Ore Mountains to build a new life. The principal mining areas were located around Johanngeorgenstadt, Schlema and Aue. Uranium ore deposits were also exploited for the Soviet Union in Bohemian Jáchymov (St. Joachimsthal). Its processing was associated with serious health consequences for the miners. In addition a dam burst in 1954 at Lengenfeld at a uranium mining waste lake; 50,000 cubic metres of waste water poured down 4 kilometres into the valley. Until 1991 uranium ore was also mined in Aue-Alberoda and Pöhla.

Mining operations in Freiberg that had begun in 1168 finally ceased in 1968 after 800 years. In Altenberg and Ehrenfriedersdorf tin mining continued to 1991. The smelting of these ores took place mainly in Muldenhütten until the early 1990s. In St. Egidien and Aue there were important nickel smelting sites. In Pöhla in the Western Ore Mountains, during exploratory work for SDAG Wismut new, rich lodes of tin ore were discovered in the 1980s. The test workings of that time are now considered the largest tin finds in Europe. Another well-known place of tin production was Seiffen. The village in the Eastern Ore Mountains has become a leading centre of wood and toy manufacturing. Here, wooden smoking figures, nutcrackers, hand-carved wooden trees (&quot;Spanbäume&quot;), candle arches, (&quot;Schwibbogen&quot;), Christmas pyramids and music boxes are made. Up to the last third of the 20th century, Coal was mined near Zwickau until 1978, around Lugau and Oelsnitz until 1971 and in the Döhlen Basin near Freital until 1989.

The mountains that until the late 11th (and early 12th century) were covered in dense forests were almost completely transformed into a cultural landscape by the mining industry and by settlement. The population density is high right up into the upper regions of the mountains. For example, Oberwiesenthal, the highest town in Germany, lies in the Ore Mountains, and neighbouring Boží Dar (German: &quot;Gottesgab&quot;) on the Czech side, is actually the highest town in Central Europe. Only on the relatively inaccessible, less climatically favourable ridges are there still large, contiguous forests, but since the 18th century these have been managed economically. Due to the high demand for timber by the mining and smelting industries, where it was needed for pit props and fuel, large-scale deforestation took place from the 12th century onwards, and even the forests owned by the nobility could not cover the growing demand for wood. In the 18th century, industries were encouraged to use coal as fuel instead of timber in order to preserve the forests, and this was enforced in the 19th century. In the early 1960s the first signs of forest dieback were seen in the Eastern Ore Mountains near Altenberg and Reitzenhain, after local damage to the forests had become apparent since the 19th century as a result of smelter smoke (&quot;Hüttenrauch&quot;). The German population of the Bohemian part of the Ore Mountains was expelled in 1945 in accordance with to the Beneš decrees.

== Nature ==
The upper western part of the Ore Mountains, known in German as &quot;Erzgebirge&quot;, belongs to the Ore Mountains/Vogtland Nature Park. The eastern part, called the Eastern Ore Mountains (&quot;Osterzgebirge&quot;), is a protected landscape. Further small areas are nature reserves and natural monuments, and are protected by the state.

Ever since the settlement in mediaeval times, the Ore Mountains were farmed intensively. This led to widespread clearings of the originally dense forest, also to keep up with the enormous need for wood in mining and metallurgy. Mining including the construction of dumps, impoundments, and ditches in many places also directly shaped the scenery and the habitats of plants and animals.

Evidence for local forest dieback due to the smoke from smelting furnaces was first noted the 19th century. In the 20th century, several mountain crests were deforested because of their climatically exposed location. Thus, in recent years, mixed forests are cultivated which are more resistant to weather effects and pests than the traditional monocultures of spruces.

=== The Ore Mountains/Vogtland Nature Park ===
Human interventions have created a unique cultural landscape with a large number of typical biotopes which are worthy of protection such as mountain meadows and wetlands. Today, even old mining spoil heaps offer a living environment for a variety of plants and animals. 61% of the area of Ore Mountains/Vogtland Nature Park is covered with woodland. In particular in the western Ore Mountains, huge contiguous woodlands spread all the way to the highest altitudes and are used for forestry. Moreover, in this area several rain water fed bogs are found. Many of these protected areas offer a retreat for rare species with special environmental adaptations such as different species of orchids and gentian, the Eurasian pygmy owl and kingfishers. Some alpine species of plants and animals that have been found at higher altitudes of the Ore mountains are otherwise only known from more distant places in the Sudeten mountains or the Alps. After conditions improved, once displaced species such as Eagle owls and Black storks have returned in the early 21st century.

== Economy ==
The German part of the Ore Mountains is one of the major business locations in Saxony. The region has a high density of industrial operations. Since 2000, the number of industrial workers has risen against the Germany-wide trend by about 20 percent. Typical of the Ore Mountains are mainly small, often owner-managed, businesses.

The economic strengths of the Ore Mountains are mainly in manufacturing. 63 percent of the industrial workforce is employed in the metalworking and electrical industry.

Only of minor importance is the formerly dominant textile and clothing industry (5 percent of industrial net product) and the food industry. The newly established chemical, leather and plastic industries and the industries traditionally based in the Ore Mountains-basedwood, paper, furniture, glass and ceramics workseach contribute about 14 percent of regional net product.

Mining, the essential historical basis of industrial development in the Ore Mountains, currently plays only a minor economic role on the Saxon side of the border. For example, in Hermsdorf/Erzgeb. in the Eastern Ore Mountains, calcite is mined, and near Lengefeld in the Central Ore Mountains, dolomitic marble is extracted. For the first time in two decades, an ore mine was opened in Niederschlag near Oberwiesenthal on 28 October 2010. It is expected that 50,000-130,000 tons of fluorspar per year will be extracted there.

In the Czech part of the Ore Mountains, tourism has gained a certain importance, even though the Giant Mountains are more important for domestic tourism. In addition, mining still plays a greater role, particularly coal mining in the southern forelands of the Ore Mountains. Europe&#x27;s largest deposits of lithium-bearing mica zinnwaldite in Cínovec, a Czech village between town of Dubí and the border with Germany which gave its old German name Zinnwald to the mineral, are expected to be mined starting 2019 (as of June 2017).

== Tourism ==
When several Ore Mountain passes were upgraded into &quot;chaussees&quot; in the 19th century, and the Upper Ore Mountains were accessed by the railway, tourism began to develop. One of the early promoters of tourism in the Ore Mountains was Otto Delitsch. In 1907, a memorial was erected to him in Wildenthal. In many places mountain inns and observation towers were erected on the highest peaks. At that time, skiers used the ridges with their guaranteed snow. Today, steam-worked narrow gauge railways dating to that era, such as the Pressnitz Valley Railway, are popular tourist attractions.

In 1924 the Fichtelberg Cable Car became the first cable car in Germany, and it still takes visitors to the highest mountain in Saxony. The Ridgeway (&quot;Kammweg&quot;) was one of the first long-distance paths to be established. This once ran from Hainsberg near Asch over the Ore Mountains, Bohemian Switzerland and the Lusatian Mountains to Sněžka in the Giant Mountains. Today there is not only a dense network of trails, but also an extensive cross country skiing network and downhill ski slopes for winter sports. The most important ski resort is Oberwiesenthal on the Fichtelberg mountain. And the Ore Mountain/Krušné hory Ski Trail is a German-Czech ski mountaineering trail along the entire Ore Mountain crest.

Based on the historical Silver Road a tourist road was created in 1990 running from Zwickau to Dresden traversing the entire Ore Mountains and linking its main attractions. These include visitor mines, mining trails, technical and local history museums and numerous other smaller attractions, especially the medieval town centres in the old mining towns and its major churches, such as Freiberg Cathedral, St. Anne&#x27;s Church in Annaberg-Buchholz or St Wolfgang&#x27;s Church at Schneeberg. On the Bohemian and Saxon sides of the border there are also many castles, built in different architectural styles, which may be visited. One of the best known examples is Augustusburg Castle.

In the Advent and Christmas season the Ore Mountains, with its distinct traditions, Christmas markets and miners&#x27; parades is also a popular destination for short breaks.

Unique and popular spa resorts are located in Jáchymov in the Czech Republic. In the historical town are some of the most unique spas in the world. Musculoskeletal system is treated here with radon water and direct irradiation. This treatment is suitable for vascular diseases. Furthermore, for the nerve, rheumatic diseases or inflammation of nerves. The most important use is the treatment of diseases of the musculoskeletal system (gout etc.). The spa was founded in 1906. One of the spa buildings is Radium Palacespa neoclassical hotel palace, already at the time of its establishment in 1912 was one of the best that Europe could offer in the field of spas.

With 960,963 guests staying for 2,937,204 nights in 2007 the Ore Mountains and West Saxony is the most important Saxon holiday destination after the cities, and tourism is an important economic factor in the region. Since 2004 the Ore Mountain Tourist Association (&quot;Tourismusverband Erzgebirge&quot;) has offered the Ore Mountain Card (&quot;ErzgebirgsCard&quot;) with which over 100 museums, castles, heritage railways and other sights may be visited free of charge.

=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===
In 2019, the following 22 mines or mining complexes were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as the Erzgebirge/Krušnohoří Mining Region.


== Culture ==

The culture of the Ore Mountains was shaped mainly by mining that goes back to the Middle Ages. The old saying, coined here, that &quot;everything comes from the mine&quot; (&quot;Alles kommt vom Bergwerk her!&quot;) refers to many areas of life in the region, from its landscape, to its handicrafts, industry, living traditions and folk art. The visitor may recognise this on his arrival from the normal everyday greeting &quot;Glück Auf!&quot; that is used in the region.

The Ore Mountains has its own dialect, Erzgebirgisch, which sits on the boundary between Upper German and Central German and is not therefore uniform.

The first important native dialect poet of the Ore Mountains was Christian Gottlob Wild in the early 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, Hans Soph, Stephan Dietrich and especially Anton Günther were active; their works have a lasting impact to this day in Ore Mountain songs and writings. Erzgebirgisch songs were later popularised by various local groups. The most famous include the &quot;Preßnitzer Musikanten&quot;, &quot;Geschwister Caldarelli&quot;, &quot;Zschorlauer Nachtigallen&quot;, the &quot;Erzgebirgsensemble Aue&quot; and &quot;Joachim Süß and his Ensemble&quot;. Today it is mainly &quot;De Randfichten&quot;, but also groups like &quot;Wind, Sand und Sterne&quot;, &quot;De Ranzn&quot;, &quot;De Krippelkiefern&quot;, &quot;De Erbschleicher&quot; and &quot;Schluckauf&quot; that sing in the Erzgebirgisch dialect.

The Ore Mountains are nationally known for their variety of customs at Advent and Christmas time. This is epitomized by traditional Ore Mountain folk art, in the form of smoking figures, Christmas pyramids, candle arches, nutcrackers, miners&#x27; and angels&#x27; figures, all of which are used as Christmas decorations. Above all, places in the Upper Ore Mountains decorate their windows during the Christmas season in such a way that they are transformed into a &quot;sea of light&quot;. In addition, traditional Christmas mining celebrations such as the &quot;Mettenschicht&quot; and &quot;Hutzenabende&quot; draw many visitors and have made the Ore Mountains known as &quot;Christmasland&quot; (&quot;Weihnachtsland&quot;).

In addition to the Christmas markets and other smaller traditional and modern folk festivals, the Annaberger Kät is the most famous and largest Ore Mountain folk festival. Started in 1520 by Duke George the Bearded, it has been held annually since.

Also interesting is Ore Mountain cuisine, which is simple, but rich in tradition.

In 2019 the region was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as the Erzgebirge/Krušnohoří Mining Region.

<text>A chain tool is a small mechanical device used to &quot;break&quot; a bicycle chain in such a way that it can be mended with the same tool. A bicycle chain has links and plates that are pinned together; these pins can be pushed out with the chain tool. Because the pins are pushed out gradually with a screw, they can be partially removed or fully removed, depending upon the intention of the user.

The chain tool has two positions where a chain can be inserted perpendicular to the tool, one close to the movable screw portion, and one lower down just above the fixed end. In each position, there are a pair of protruding tabs; one fits into the center of one link of the chain, the other fits into the center of the next link. With the chain properly in place, the pin is held in the center of the tool, so that the tip of the movable screw can press on the end of the pin. The end of the screw is slightly narrower than the pin, so that it can press the pin through the link. Often the end of the screw is a removable piece which can be replaced when worn.

==Variations and alternatives==
Most chain tools are designed for chains where the links have flat plates. For chains with complicated shaped plates designed to facilitate smooth shifting, specific chain tools are available which are identical in design and operation, but have the ears protruding into the chain shaped in cross section to fit the links of the particular chain in question precisely, so as to hold the pin in the all-important vertical alignment with the screw of the tool.

Some chain tools are better at removing pins than they are at inserting them. Once completely removed, chain pins are often very difficult to insert with a tool unless it has been specifically designed to do so. Users may overcome this limitation of some tools by never completely removing a pin that they intend to replace. They push the pin so that the chain can be broken, to shorten it for example, but so that it is firmly retained in the farthest plate. This way, even simple chain tools can press the pin back into place. 

While a chain tool is required to shorten simple chains on a bicycle, and as described above, can often be used to reconnect them, there are fast-release chain links that allow repeated making and breaking of a chain. They are connected by hand pressure but often need a pair of needle-nosed pliers for removal. These links invariably replace a pair of &quot;outside&quot; plates on a chain, so joining two sets of &quot;inside&quot; plates. Bicycles with a single front chainring and rear sprocket (for example bicycles with hub gears or coaster brake hubs) may have a master link on the chain which holds the pin in place with an easily removable c-clip. Some master links are bevelled on top, and can interfere with the smooth operation of a derailleur system. Some derailleur suppliers have produced a chain with a fast-release link, made with straight plates to suit their derailleur products.

A chain tool is usually needed to shorten a chain, even when a fast-release link is being used, unless the combined number of links plus the connection link just happens to be the length required. Consider the following example.

Assume that an old derailleur chain is to be replaced with a new chain containing a &quot;suitable&quot; fast release link, supplied with it. The old chain is broken with a chain tool to remove it, and counting the links it is noted that there were 112 in total. The new chain should have the same length, but counting its links concludes that including the fast-release link there are 116 of them. (The chain link count on a new chain will not necessarily agree with the number given on its packaging.) A chain of this type is provided with &quot;inner plates&quot; at both ends for this purpose. Bearing in mind that the chain must end up with two sets of &quot;inner plate ends&quot; after the shortening, then the chain tool can be used to completely remove four links. The fast-release link plates are installed by hand as if they were a set of &quot;outer plates&quot;, and can be fixed in place by hand pressure alone. There are variations of the method in use, but in each case a chain tool will usually be needed.

<text>A screwdriver is a tool, manual or powered, used for turning screws.

==Description==
A typical simple screwdriver has a handle and a shaft, ending in a tip the user puts into the screw head before turning the handle. This form of the screwdriver has been replaced in many workplaces and homes with a more modern and versatile tool, a power drill, as they are quicker, easier, and can also drill holes. The shaft is usually made of tough steel to resist bending or twisting. The tip may be hardened to resist wear, treated with a dark tip coating for improved visual contrast between tip and screw—or ridged or treated for additional &quot;grip&quot;. 

Handles are typically wood, metal, or plastic and usually hexagonal, square, or oval in cross-section to improve grip and prevent the tool from rolling when set down. Some manual screwdrivers have interchangeable tips that fit into a socket on the end of the shaft and are held in mechanically or magnetically. These often have a hollow handle that contains various types and sizes of tips, and a reversible ratchet action that allows multiple full turns without repositioning the tip or the user&#x27;s hand.

A screwdriver is classified by its tip, which is shaped to fit the driving surfaces (slots, grooves, recesses, etc.) on the corresponding screw head. Proper use requires that the screwdriver&#x27;s tip engage the head of a screw of the same size and type designation as the screwdriver tip. Screwdriver tips are available in a wide variety of types and sizes (List of screw drives). The two most common are the simple &#x27;blade&#x27;-type for slotted screws, and Phillips, generically called &quot;cross-recess&quot;, &quot;cross-head&quot;, or &quot;cross-point&quot;.

A wide variety of power screwdrivers ranges from a simple &quot;stick&quot;-type with batteries, a motor, and a tip holder all inline, to powerful &quot;pistol&quot; type VSR (variable-speed reversible) cordless drills that also function as screwdrivers. This is particularly useful as drilling a pilot hole before driving a screw is a common operation. Special combination drill-driver bits and adapters let an operator rapidly alternate between the two. Variations include impact drivers, which provide two types of &#x27;hammering&#x27; force for improved performance in certain situations, and &quot;right-angle&quot; drivers for use in tight spaces. Many options and enhancements, such as built-in bubble levels, high/low gear selection, magnetic screw holders, adjustable-torque clutches, keyless chucks, &quot;gyroscopic&quot; control, etc., are available.

== History ==
The earliest documented screwdrivers were used in the late Middle Ages. They were probably invented in the late 15th century, either in Germany or France. The tool&#x27;s original names in German and French were &quot;Schraubenzieher&quot; (screw-tightener) and &quot;tournevis&quot; (turnscrew), respectively. The first documentation of the tool is in the medieval Housebook of Wolfegg Castle, a manuscript written sometime between 1475 and 1490. These earliest screwdrivers had pear-shaped handles and were made for slotted screws (diversification of the many types of screwdrivers did not emerge until the Gilded Age). The screwdriver remained inconspicuous, however, as evidence of its existence throughout the next 300 years is based primarily on the presence of screws.

Screws were used in the 15th century to construct screw-cutting lathes, for securing breastplates, backplates, and helmets on medieval jousting armor—and eventually for multiple parts of the emerging firearms, particularly the matchlock. Screws, hence screwdrivers, were not used in full combat armor, most likely to give the wearer freedom of movement. 

The jaws that hold the pyrites inside wheellock guns were secured with screws, and the need to constantly replace the pyrites resulted in a considerable refinement of the screwdriver. The tool is more documented in France, and took on many shapes and sizes, though all for slotted screws. There were large, heavy-duty screwdrivers for building and repairing large machines, and smaller screwdrivers for refined cabinet work.

The screwdriver depended entirely on the screw, and it took several advances to make the screw easy enough to produce to become popular and widespread. The most popular door hinge at the time was the butt-hinge, but it was considered a luxury. The butt-hinge was handmade, and its constant motion required the security of a screw.

Screws were very hard to produce before the First Industrial Revolution, requiring the manufacture of a conical helix. The brothers Job and William Wyatt found a way to produce a screw on a novel machine that first cut the slotted head, and then cut the helix. Though their business ultimately failed, their contribution to low-cost manufacturing of the screw ultimately led to a vast increase in the screw and the screwdriver&#x27;s popularity. The increase in popularity gradually led to refinement and eventually diversification of the screwdriver. Refinement of the precision of screws also significantly contributed to the boom in production, mostly by increasing its efficiency and standardizing sizes, important precursors to industrial manufacture.
Canadian P.L. Robertson, though he was not the first person to patent the idea of socket-head screws, was the first to successfully commercialize them, starting in 1908. Socket screws rapidly grew in popularity, and are still used for their resistance to wear and tear, compatibility with hex keys, and ability to stop a power tool when set. Though immensely popular, Robertson had trouble marketing his invention to the newly booming auto industry, for he was unwilling to relinquish his patents.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, Henry F. Phillips patented his own invention, an improved version of a deep socket with a cruciform slot, today known as the Phillips Screw. Phillips offered his screw to the American Screw Company, and after a successful trial on the 1936 Cadillac, it quickly swept through the American auto industry. With the Industrial Revival at the end of the Great Depression and the upheaval of World War II, the Phillips screw quickly became, and remains, the most popular screw in the world. A main attraction for the screw was that conventional slotted screwdrivers could also be used on them, which was not possible with the Robertson Screw.

Gunsmiths still call a screwdriver a &quot;turnscrew&quot;, under which name it is an important part of a set of pistols. The name was common in earlier centuries, used by cabinetmakers, shipwrights, and perhaps other trades. The cabinetmaker&#x27;s screwdriver is one of the longest-established handle forms, somewhat oval or ellipsoid in cross-section. This is variously attributed to improving grip or preventing the tool rolling off the bench. The shape has been popular for a couple of hundred years. It is usually associated with a plain head for slotted screws, but has been used with many head forms. Modern plastic screwdrivers use a handle with a roughly hexagonal cross-section to achieve these same two goals, a far cry from the pear-shaped handle of the original 15th-century screwdriver.

== Handle ==

The handle and shaft of screwdrivers have changed considerably over time. The design is influenced by both purpose and manufacturing requirements. The &quot;Perfect Pattern Handle&quot; screwdriver was first manufactured by HD Smith &amp; Company, which operated from 1850 to 1900. Many manufacturers adopted this handle design. At the time, the &quot;flat bladed&quot; screw type was prevalent and was the fastener with which they were designed to be used. Another popular design was composed of drop-forged steel with riveted wood handles.

The shape and material of many modern screwdriver handles are designed to fit comfortably in the user&#x27;s hand, for user comfort and to facilitate maximum control and torque. Designs include indentations for the user&#x27;s fingers, and surfaces of a soft material such as thermoplastic elastomer to increase comfort and grip. Composite handles of rigid plastic and rubber are also common. Many screwdriver handles are not smooth and often not round, but have flats or other irregularities to improve grip and to prevent the tool from rolling when on a flat surface.

Some screwdrivers have a short hexagonal section at the top of the blade, adjacent to the handle, so that a ring spanner or open wrench can be used to increase the applied torque. Another option are &quot;cabinet&quot; screwdrivers which are made of flat bar stock and while the shaft may be rounded, will have a large flat section adjacent to the handle which a wrench (often an adjustable) may be used on for additional leverage. The offset screwdriver has a handle set at right angles to the small blade, providing access to narrow spaces and giving extra torque.

== Drive tip ==

Screwdrivers come in a large range of sizes to accommodate various screws—from tiny jeweller&#x27;s screwdrivers up. A screwdriver that is not the right size and type for the screw may damage the screw in the process of tightening it.

Some screwdriver tips are magnetic, so that the screw (unless non-magnetic) remains attached to the screwdriver. This is particularly useful for small screws, which are otherwise very difficult to attempt to handle. Many screwdriver designs have a handle with a detachable tip (the part of the screwdriver that engages the screw), called &quot;bits&quot; as with drill bits. This provides a set of one handle and several bits that can drive a variety of screw sizes and types.

The tool used to drive a slotted screw head is called a &quot;standard&quot;, &quot;common blade&quot;, &quot;flat-blade&quot;, &quot;slot-head&quot;, &quot;straight&quot;, &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;flat-tip&quot;, or &quot;flat-head&quot; screwdriver. This last usage can be confusing, because the term &quot;flat-head&quot; also describes a screw with a flat top, designed to install in a countersunk hole. Before the development of the newer bit types, the flat-blade was called the &quot;Common-Blade&quot;, because it was the most common one. Depending on the application, the name of this screwdriver may differ. Within the automotive/heavy electric industries, it is known as a &quot;flat head screwdriver&quot;; within the avionics and mining industries, it is known as a &quot;standard screwdriver&quot;. Though there are many names; the original device from 1908 was known as a &quot;flat-head screw turner&quot;.

Among slotted screwdrivers, variations at the blade or bit end involve the profile of the blade as viewed face-on (from the side of the tool). The more common type is sometimes called keystone, where the blade profile is slightly flared before tapering off at the end, which provides extra stiffness to the workface and makes it capable of withstanding more torque by gripping deeper in the screw slot. To maximize access in space-restricted applications, the &quot;cabinet&quot; variant screwdriver blade sides are straight and parallel, reaching the end of the blade at a right angle. This design is also frequently used in jeweler&#x27;s screwdrivers.

Many textbooks and vocational schools instruct mechanics to grind down the tip of the blade, which, due to the taper, increases its thickness and consequently allows more precise engagement with the slot in the screw. This approach creates a set of graduated slotted screwdrivers that will fit a particular screw for a tighter engagement and reduce screw head deformation. However, many better-quality screwdriver blades are already induction-hardened (surface heat-treated), coated with black-oxide, black-phosphate, or diamond-coated to increase friction between the screwdriver tip and the screw. Thus tip grinding after manufacture will likely compromise their durability so it is best to select the proper tip and avoid weakening the manufacture&#x27;s treatments.

===Phillips===
Phillips screwdrivers come in several standard sizes, ranging from tiny &quot;jeweler&#x27;s&quot; to those used for automobile frame assembly—or #000 to #4 respectively. This size number is usually stamped onto the shank (shaft) or handle for identification. Each bit size fits a range of screw sizes, more or less well. Each Phillips screwdriver size also has a related shank diameter. The driver has a 57° point and tapered, unsharp (rounded) flutes. The #1 and smaller bits come to a blunt point, but the #2 and above have no point, but rather a nearly squared-off tip, making each size incompatible with the other.

The design is often criticized for its tendency to cam out at lower torque levels than other &quot;cross head&quot; designs, an effect caused by the tapered profile of the flutes which makes them easier to insert into the screw than other similar styles. There has long been a popular belief that this was actually a &quot;deliberate&quot; feature of the design. Evidence is lacking for this specific narrative and the feature is not mentioned in the original patents. However, a subsequent refinement to the original design described in US Patent #2,474,994 describes this feature.

=== Robertson ===
Robertson, also known as a square, or Scrulox screw drive has a square-shaped socket in the screw head and a square protrusion on the tool. Both the tool and the socket have a taper, which makes inserting the tool easier, and also tends to help keep the screw on the tool tip. (The taper&#x27;s earliest reason for being was to make the manufacture of the screws practical using cold forming of the heads, but its other advantages helped popularize the drive.) Robertson screws are commonplace in Canada, though they have been used elsewhere, and have become much more common in other countries in recent decades. Robertson screwdrivers are easy to use one-handed, because the tapered socket tends to retain the screw, even if it is shaken. They also allow for the use of angled screw drivers and trim head screws. The socket-headed Robertson screws are self-centering, reduce cam out, stop a power tool when set, and can be removed if painted over or old and rusty. In industry, they speed up production and reduce product damage. One of their first major industrial uses was the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Model A &amp; Model T production. Henry Ford found them highly reliable and saved considerable production time, but he could not secure licensing for them in the United States, so he limited their use solely to his Canadian division. Robertson-head screwdrivers are available in a standard range of tip sizes, from 1.77mm to 4.85mm.

===Reed and Prince===

Reed and Prince, also called Frearson, is another historic cross-head screw configuration. The cross in the screw head is sharper and less rounded than a Phillips, and the bit has 45° flukes and a sharper, pointed end. Also, the Phillips screw slot is not as deep as the Reed and Prince slot. In theory, different size R&amp;P screws fit any R&amp;P bit size.

===Pozidriv===

Pozidriv and the related Supadriv are widely used in Europe and most of the Far East. While Pozidriv screws have cross heads like Phillips and are sometimes thought effectively the same, the Pozidriv design allows higher torque application than Phillips. It is often claimed that they can apply more torque than any of the other commonly used cross-head screwdriver systems, due to a complex fluting (mating) configuration.

===Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS)===
Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) cross-head screwdrivers are still another standard, often inaccurately called &quot;Japanese Phillips&quot;. Compatible screw heads are usually identifiable by a single depressed dot or an &quot;X&quot; to one side of the cross slot. This is a screw standard throughout the Asia market and Japanese imports. The driver has a 57° point with a flat tip.

===Other types===

Many modern electrical appliances, if they contain screws, use screws with heads other than the typical slotted or Phillips styles. Torx is one such pattern that has become widespread. It is a spline tip with a corresponding recess in the screw head. The main cause of this trend is manufacturing efficiency: Torx screwdriver tips do not slip out of the fastener as easily as would a Phillips or slotted driver.

Non-typical fasteners are commonplace in consumer devices for their ability to make disassembly more difficult. In microwave ovens, such screws deny casual access to the high-power kilovolt electrical components.

Torx and other drivers have become widely available to the consumer due to their increasing use in the industry. Some other styles fit a three-pointed star recess, and a five-lobed spline with rounded edges instead of the square edges of the Torx. This is called a Pentalobe.

Specialized patterns of security screws are also used, such as the Line Head (LH) style by OSG System Products, Japan, as used in many Nintendo consoles, though drivers for the more common security heads are, again, readily available. Another type of security head has smooth curved surfaces instead of the slot edges that would permit loosening the screw; it is found in public rest room privacy partitions, and cannot be removed by conventional screwdrivers.

== Variations ==
=== Torque screwdrivers ===

Screwdrivers are available—manual, electric, and pneumatic—with a clutch that slips at a preset torque. This helps the user tighten screws to a specified torque without damage or over-tightening. Cordless drills designed to use as screwdrivers often have such a clutch.

=== Powered screwdrivers ===

Interchangeable bits allow the use of powered screwdrivers, commonly using an electric or air motor to rotate the bit. Cordless drills with speed and torque control are commonly used as power screwdrivers.


=== Ratcheting screwdrivers ===

Some manual screwdrivers have a ratchet action whereby the screwdriver blade locks to the handle for clockwise rotation, but uncouples for counterclockwise rotation when set for tightening screws—and vice versa for loosening.

Spiral ratchet screw drivers, often colloquially called &quot;Yankee screwdrivers&quot; (a brand name), provide a special mechanism that transforms linear motion into rotational motion. Originally the &quot;Yankee&quot; name was used on all tools sold by the North Brothers Manufacturing Company but later, after Stanley purchased the company, it became synonymous with only this type of screwdriver. The user pushes the handle toward the workpiece, causing a pawl in a spiral groove to rotate the shank and the removable bit. The ratchet can be set to rotate left or right with each push, or can be locked so that the tool can be used like a conventional screwdriver. One disadvantage of this design is that if the bit slips out of the screw, the resultant sudden extension of the spring may cause the bit to scratch or otherwise damage the workpiece.

Once very popular, versions of these spiral ratchet drivers using proprietary bits have been largely discontinued by manufacturers such as Stanley. Some companies now offer a modernized version that uses standard -inch hex shank power tool bits. Since a wide variety of drill bits are available in this format, the tool can do double duty as a &quot;push drill&quot; or Persian drill.
