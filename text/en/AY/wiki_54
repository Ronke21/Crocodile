<doc id="192949" wikidata="Q326587" url="?curid=192949" title="Trygve Bratteli">
<text>Trygve Martin Bratteli (11 January 1910 – 20 November 1984) was a Norwegian newspaper editor, a politician with the Norwegian Labour Party, and Nazi concentration camp survivor. He served as the prime minister of Norway from 1971 to 1972 and again from 1973 to 1976. He was president of the Nordic Council in 1978.
==Background==
Bratteli was born on the island of Nøtterøy at Færder in Vestfold, Norway. His parents were Terje Hansen Bratteli (1878–1966) and Martha Barmen (1880–1938). He attended school locally, having many jobs including: work in fishing, as a coal miner and on a building site. Over a 9- to 10-month period, Bratteli travelled with whalers to Antarctica, where he worked in a guano factory at South Georgia Island. He was a student at the socialist school at Malmøya in 1933. Oscar Torp, chairman of the Norwegian Labour Party, asked him to become editor of &quot;Folkets Frihet&quot; in Kirkenes and later editor of &quot;Arbeiderungdommen&quot; which was published by the Socialist Youth League of Norway. For a period during 1940, he also served as Secretary of the Norwegian Labour Party.

Following the Nazi invasion of Norway, the daily newspaper &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; was closed down during 1940 by Nazi officials. Bratteli subsequently participated in the Norwegian resistance movement. He was arrested by agents of Nazi Germany in 1942, and was a Nacht und Nebel prisoner of various German concentration camps; including Natzweiler-Struthof, from 1943 to 1945. He was also imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, north of Berlin. He was liberated from Vaihingen an der Enz concentration camp on 5 April 1945, by the Swedish Red Cross White Buses along with fifteen other Norwegians who had survived.

==Political career==
After the liberation of Norway in 1945, Bratteli was appointed as Secretary of the Labour Party. He became chairman of the Workers&#x27; Youth League, vice chairman of the party, served on the newly formed &quot;defence commission&quot;, and in 1965; was made Chairman of the Labour Party. Bratteli was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Oslo in 1950, and was re-elected on seven occasions.

He was appointed as Minister of Finance in Oscar Torp&#x27;s cabinet, and from 1956 to 1960 in the third cabinet of Einar Gerhardsen. From 1960 to 1963, during Gerhardsen&#x27;s third period as Prime Minister, he was Minister of Transport and Communications. He was also acting Minister of Finance from January–February 1962. In September 1963, when Gerhardsen&#x27;s fourth cabinet was formed, Bratteli was again made Minister of Transport and Communications, a post he held until 1964.

The centre-right cabinet of Borten held office from 1965 to 1971, but when it collapsed, Bratteli became Prime Minister. In social policy, Bratteli&#x27;s premiership saw the passage of a law in June 1972 that lowered the pension age to 67. Central to his political career was the question of Norway&#x27;s membership of the European Community. Following the close rejection of membership in the 1972 referendum, his cabinet resigned. However, the successor cabinet Korvald only lasted one year, and the second cabinet Bratteli was formed following the 1973 Norwegian parliamentary election. Bratteli resigned as prime minister in January 1976 on the grounds of ill health. He was succeeded by fellow Labour member Odvar Nordli.

==Personal life==
Trygve Bratteli was married to Randi Helene Larssen (1924–2002). They had three children: two daughters, Tone and Marianne, and one son, professor Ola Bratteli (1946–2015).
Bratteli&#x27;s memoirs of his experiences in Nazi concentration camps was published in 1980. 
He died in 1984 and was buried at Vestre gravlund in Oslo.
Trygve Bratteli was a member of Friends of Israel within the Norwegian Labour Movement (&quot;Venner av Israel i Norsk Arbeiderbevegelse&quot;) which planted a forest to his memory in Israel.

*March 21 – In a landmark obscenity case, &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States rules that the hitherto banned novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (John Cleland&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot;, 1749) does not meet the Roth Standard for obscenity.

The guest of honor, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; publisher Katharine Graham, later says: &quot;Truman called me up that summer and said, &#x27;I think you need cheering up. And I&#x27;m going to give you a ball.&#x27;...I was...sort of baffled...I felt a little bit like Truman was going to give the ball anyway and that I was part of the props.&quot;

<text>John Henley (3 August 1692 – 13 October 1756), English clergyman, commonly known as &#x27;Orator Henley&#x27;, was a preacher known for showmanship and eccentricity.

== Life ==
The son of a vicar, John Henley was born in Melton Mowbray. After attending the grammar schools of Melton and Oakham, Rutland, he entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, &quot;Ye College where I had ye Stupidity to be educated,&quot; as he himself said. After having taken a B.A. degree, he became assistant and, afterwards, director in the grammar school of Melton Mowbray. He was also assistant curate there.

In November 1721, after being promoted to an M.A. degree, he moved to London, where he obtained the appointment of assistant preacher and wrote several books. Quarrelling with the Bishop of London, he gave up his benefice, and began his lectures or &#x27;Orations&#x27; on theological subjects and mundane matters. In 1723 he became Rector of Chelmondiston, Suffolk.

On 3 July 1726 Henley opened his so-called &#x27;Oratory&#x27;, a meeting room built over the shambles in Newport Market. In 1729, he transferred the scene of his operations to an old theater at Clare Market, near Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, where he continued to preach &quot;on the world as it is, serious or ridiculous.&quot; &quot;The Truth of the Gospel is in its Spirit and Moral, its practical Graces,&quot; he said, &quot; the rest is, in Comparison, as sounding Brass, or as a tinkling Cymbal.&quot; His discourses were popular and subject to rowdy disturbances. Into his services he introduced many peculiarities. He drew up a &#x27;Primitive Liturgy,&#x27; in which he substituted for the Nicene and Athanasian creeds, two creeds taken from the Apostolical Constitutions; for his &#x27;Primitive Eucharist&#x27; he made use of unleavened bread and mixed wine; and he distributed medals of admission to his &#x27;Oratory&#x27; at the price of one shilling. A visitor accused Henley that money was the god whom he worshipped: &quot;we must give One Shilling to the Door-Keeper, for the Seats were personal Property. A very fine Story indeed! And such a one, that is not to be paralleled, that we should pay a Shilling before we can worship GOD!&quot;

Henley knew that the most original element in the services was he himself. In his &quot;Dunciad&quot;, Alexander Pope called him a
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;great restorer of the good old Stage
Preacher at once and Zany of thy age.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
He possessed oratorical ability and adopted a theatrical style of elocution, tuning his voice and balancing his hands. His addresses were a medley of solemnity and buffoonery. &quot;The Connoisseur&quot;, a critical weekly paper, wrote that

&quot;the Clare-Market Orator, while he turns religion into farce, must be considered as exhibiting shews and interludes of an inferior nature, and himself regarded as a Jack-pudding in a gown and cassock.&quot;

Despite all criticism, the energetic and eccentric &#x27;Orator&#x27; was popular with most Londoners. His services were much frequented by the Freethinkers, and he himself expressed his determination &quot;to die a rational.&quot; He died in London on 13 October 1756.

Henley was the subject of contemporary caricatures, among them works by George Bickham the Younger and William Hogarth.

== Works ==
In 1714, he wrote a poem styled &quot;Esther, Queen of Persia&quot;, which was received with applause, and in 1719–1721, he published &quot;The Compleat Linguist; or, An Universal Grammar of all the Considerable Tongues in Being&quot;. For some years Henley edited the &quot;Hyp Doctor&quot;, a weekly paper established in opposition to the &quot;Craftsman&quot;. In 1726 he published &quot;The Primitive Liturgy: for the Use of the Oratory&quot;.

<text>Domnall Donn (died 696) was king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland). He was a son of Conall Crandomna.

His death is reported by the Annals of Ulster, but without mention of a title. He is among the kings named by the Duan Albanach, following his father and Dúnchad mac Conaing, which assigns him an improbable reign of 13 years. He may have been co-ruler with his brother Máel Dúin mac Conaill, or have reigned for 3 years rather than 13, making his rule 693–696 approximately.

If he was king of Dál Riata, rather than only of the Cenél nGabráin of Kintyre, he was followed by Ferchar Fota of the Cenél Loairn. The next king of the Cenél nGabráin known is Eochaid mac Domangairt.

<text>Máel Dúin mac Conaill (died 688) was a king in Dál Riata (modern western Scotland).

He was the son of Conall Crandomna. His death is reported by the Annals of Ulster, but without mention of a title. He is among the kings named by the Duan Albanach, following his brother Domnall Donn, which assigns him an improbable reign of 17 years.

The general confusion of the sources makes any conclusion difficult, but while it is likely that Máel Dúin was co-ruler, with his brother Domnall Donn, of the Cenél nGabráin lands in Kintyre, it is not likely that Máel Dúin and Domnall were high kings of Dál Riata. Whether the lands of the Cenél nGabráin were subject to Ecgfrith of Northumbria, or whether they were dominated by Ferchar Fota of the Cenél Loairn, cannot be said with certainty.

The next king of the Cenél nGabráin known is Eochaid mac Domangairt.

<text>Domangart mac Domnaill (died 673) was a king in Dál Riata (consisting of part of modern western Scotland) and the son of Domnall Brecc. It is not clear whether he was over-king of Dál Riata or king of the Cenél nGabráin.

Domangart is not listed by the Duan Albanach but is included in other sources, such as genealogies of William the Lion, and that of Causantín mac Cuilén found with the Senchus fer n-Alban. In these genealogies he is noted as the father of Eochaid mac Domangairt.

The Annals of Ulster for 673 report: &quot;The killing of Domangart, son of Domnall Brecc, the king of Dál Riata.&quot; Some king-lists state that in his time the Cenél Comgaill separated from the Cenél nGabráin.

It is not clear who succeeded Domangart as king of Dál Riata, if he was such, or as king of the Cenél nGabráin. Known kings after Domangart include Máel Dúin mac Conaill and Domnall Donn of the Cenél nGabráin and Ferchar Fota of the Cenél Loairn is assigned a long reign of 21 years by the Duan Albanach and other king-lists, and this would place the beginning of his rule close to the death of Domangart.

<text>Conall Crandomna was king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland) from about 650 until 660.

The Senchus fer n-Alban makes him a son of Eochaid Buide and thus a member of the Cenél nGabráin. The Duan Albanach has him succeed Ferchar mac Connaid of the Cenél Comgaill, which had not yet separated from the Cenél nGabráin. He was co-ruler with Dúnchad mac Conaing until 654, after which he was apparently sole ruler.

His sons Máel Dúin mac Conaill and Domnall Donn may have been kings of Dál Riata.

His death in 659 or 660 is reported by the Annals of Ulster. He was probably succeeded by his nephew Domangart mac Domnaill

<text>Dúnchad mac Conaing (or Dúnchad mac Dubáin) (died 654) was king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland). He was joint ruler with Conall Crandomna until he was defeated and killed by Talorgan son of Eanfrith, king of the Picts, in the Battle of Strathyre. Sources differ on Dúnchad&#x27;s patronym and thus his presumed ancestry.

The death of Dúnchad mac Conaing in battle is reported in the Annals of Tigernach in 654: &quot;... there fell Dúnchad, son of Conaing, and Congal, son of Ronan&quot;. John Bannerman proposed that this Dúnchad was the same person as the Dúnchad or Dúngal who is found as joint ruler with Conall Crandomna. Dúnchad mac Conaing appears in the Senchus fer n-Alban: &quot;These are the sons of Conaing, son of Áedán .i. Rigallán, Ferchar, Artán, Artúr, &quot;Dondchad&quot;, Domungart, Nechtan, Ném, Crumíne.

However, the &quot;Synchronisms of Flann Mainistrech&quot; list Dúnchad mac Dubáin as king, while the &quot;Duan Albanach&quot; associated one Dúngal with Conall. Dubán may be a hypocoristic form of Dub, and represent a byname (&quot;little Black&quot;). An alternative reconstruction made Dúnchad a descendant of Áedán mac Gabráin&#x27;s passed-over brother Eoganán.

He is presumed to have had at least one son, Conall Cáel (died 681), and it is possible that he was the grandfather, or great-grandfather by some readings, of Fiannamail ua Dúnchado and an ancestor of Dúnchad Bec.

<text>Ferchar mac Connaid was king of Dál Riata (in modern Scotland) from about 642 until 650.

He was a son of Connad Cerr and thus probably a member of the Cenél Comgaill, although some older reconstructions make him a member of the Cenél nGabráin. His death appears in the Annals of Ulster for 694 along with a number of other entries which appear to be misplaced by 45 years. The Duan Albanach grants him a reign of 16 years, which may mean that he ruled jointly with Domnall Brecc before becoming sole king, but the reign lengths of the Duan are problematic and this may be an error.

Ferchar is the only descendant of Connad Cerr known to have held the kingship of Dál Riata. The genealogies in the &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot; do not include Ferchar and his kin.

<text>Domnall Brecc (Welsh: &quot;Dyfnwal Frych&quot;; English: &quot;Donald the Freckled&quot;) (died 642 in Strathcarron) was king of Dál Riata, in modern Scotland, from about 629 until 642. He was the son of Eochaid Buide. He was counted as Donald II of Scotland by the scholar Fraxinius.

He first appears in 622, when the Annals of Tigernach report his presence at the battle of Cend Delgthen (probably in the east midlands of Ireland) as an ally of Conall Guthbinn of Clann Cholmáin. This is the only battle known where Domnall Brecc fought on the winning side.

Domnall suffered four defeats after he broke Dál Riata&#x27;s alliance with the Cenél Conaill clan of the Uí Néill. In Ireland, Domnall and his ally Congal Cáech of the Dál nAraidi were defeated by Domnall mac Áedo of the Cenél Conaill, the High King of Ireland, at the Battle of Mag Rath (Moira, County Down) in 637. He also lost to the Picts in 635 and 638 and lastly to Eugein I of Alt Clut at Strathcarron in 642, where he was killed.

A stanza interpolated into the ancient Welsh poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; refers to these events:

I saw an array that came from Pentir,
And bore themselves splendidly around the conflagration.
I saw a second one, rapidly descending from their township,
Who had risen at the word of the grandson of Nwython.
I saw great sturdy men who came with the dawn,
And the head of Dyfnwal Frych, ravens gnawed it.

Domnall&#x27;s son Domangart mac Domnaill was later to be king of Dál Riata and from him the later kings of the Cenél nGabráin were descended. A second son, Cathasach, died c. 650, and a grandson of Domnall, also called Cathasach, died c. 688.

<text>Connad Cerr (Connad the Left-handed) was a king of Dál Riata in the early 7th century. He was either a son of Conall mac Comgaill or of Eochaid Buide. Connad appears to have been joint king with Eochaid Buide in the 620s.

He is named as king of Dál Riata in 627 when he won a victory over Fiachnae mac Demmáin, king of the Ulaid at the Battle of Ard Corann. Connad was killed at Fid Eóin, fighting against the Dál nAraidi led by Máel Caích, brother of Congal Cáech. While the Annals of Ulster have the battle in 629 and the Annals of Tigernach in 630, both place the death of Connad before the death of Eochaid Buide.

Connad&#x27;s son Ferchar was later king. An entry in the Book of Ballymote associates Connad&#x27;s descendants with &quot;the men of Fife&quot;.

<text>Eochaid Buide was king of Dál Riata from around 608 until 629. &quot;Buide&quot; refers to the colour yellow, as in the colour of his hair.

He was a younger son of Áedán mac Gabráin and became his father&#x27;s chosen heir upon the death of his elder brothers. Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Columba&quot; has Columba foresee that Eochaid, then a child, will succeed his father in preference to his adult brothers Artúr, Eochaid Find and Domangart.

In 616, Eochaid Buide gave shelter to Acha of Deira and her children after her husband Æthelfrith was killed at the Battle of the River Idle, fighting her brother, Edwin of Northumbria. While at his court, they adopted Christianity. When Acha&#x27;s sons returned to reclaim the kingdom at the Battle of Heavenfield, they brought Christianity with them. Her daughter Æbbe established a double monastery at Coldingham.

In the last two years of his reign, 627–629, Eochaid was apparently co-ruler with Connad Cerr, who predeceased him. Eochaid was followed by his son Domnall Brecc.

Eochaid&#x27;s other sons named by the Senchus fer n-Alban are Conall Crandomna, Failbe (who died at the Battle of Fid Eoin), Cú-cen-máthair (whose death is reported in the Annals of Ulster for 604), Conall Bec, Connad or Conall Cerr (who may be the same person as Connad Cerr who died at Fid Eoin), Failbe, Domangart and Domnall Donn (not the same person as Domnall Donn unless his obituary is misplaced by 45 years like that of Ferchar mac Connaid)

According to the &quot;Fled Dúin na nGéd&quot;, Eochaid Buide was the grandfather of Congal Cáech. The story has anachronistic features as it has Eochaid alive at the time of the battle of Mag Rath (securely dated to within a year of 637), but it is chronologically feasible that Congal Cáech could have been the son of Eochaid&#x27;s daughter if the identification of Cú-cen-máthair and the dating of his death is correct.

<doc id="192974" wikidata="Q378755" url="?curid=192974" title="Áedán mac Gabráin">
<text>Áedán mac Gabráin (; ), also written as Aedan, was a king of Dál Riata from 574 until c. 609 AD. The kingdom of Dál Riata was situated in modern Argyll and Bute, Scotland, and parts of County Antrim, Ireland. Genealogies record that Áedán was a son of Gabrán mac Domangairt.

He was a contemporary of Saint Columba, and much that is recorded of his life and career comes from hagiography such as Adomnán of Iona&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Columba&quot;. Áedán appears as a character in Old Irish and Middle Irish language works of prose and verse, some now lost.

The Irish annals record Áedán&#x27;s campaigns against his neighbours, in Ireland, and in northern Britain, including expeditions to the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, and the east coast of Scotland. As recorded by Bede, Áedán was decisively defeated by Æthelfrith of Bernicia at the Battle of Degsastan. Áedán may have been deposed, or have abdicated, following this defeat. His date of death is recorded by one source as 17 April 609, in Kilkerran.

==Sources==
The sources for Áedán&#x27;s life include Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;; Irish annals, principally the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; and the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;; and Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Columba&quot;. The &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot;, a census and genealogy of Dál Riata, purports to record his ancestry and that of his immediate descendants. None of these sources are contemporary. Adomnán&#x27;s work was written in the very late 7th century, probably to mark the centenary of Columba&#x27;s death. It incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of Columba, &quot;De virtutibus sancti Columbae&quot;, by Cumméne Find. This may have been written as early as 640; neither the elements incorporated from Cumméne&#x27;s work nor Adomnán&#x27;s own writings can be treated as simple history. Bede&#x27;s history was written 30 years after Adomnán&#x27;s. The surviving Irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at Iona from the middle of the 7th century onwards so that these too are retrospective when dealing with Áedán&#x27;s time.

The Rawlinson B 502 manuscript, dated to c. 1130, contains the tale &quot;Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus Aedáin maic Gabráin&quot; (&quot;The Birth of Brandub son of Eochu and of Aedán son of Gabrán&quot;). In this story, Áedán is the twin brother of Brandub mac Echach, a King of Leinster who belonged to the Uí Cheinnselaig kindred. Áedán is exchanged at birth for one of the twin daughters of Gabrán, born the same night so that each family might have a son. &quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot; also associates Áedán with Leinster. John Bannerman concluded that &quot;[t]here seems to be no basis of fact behind these traditions.&quot; Francis John Byrne suggested that the &quot;Echtra&quot; was written by a poet at the court of Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, an 11th-century descendant of Brandub, and was written to cement an alliance between Diarmait and the Scots king Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (&quot;Malcolm III&quot;), who claimed to be a descendant of Áedán. A lost Irish tale, &quot;Echtra Áedáin mac Gabráin&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Áedán son of Gabrán&quot;), appears in a list of works, but its contents are unknown. Áedán is a character in the epic &quot;Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin&quot;, but the events which inspired the tale appear to have taken place in the middle of the 7th century. He also appears in the tale &quot;Compert Mongáin&quot;.

Áedán additionally appears in a variety of Welsh sources, making him one of the few non-Britons to figure in Welsh tradition. Welsh sources call him &quot;Aedan Bradawc&quot;, meaning &quot;The Treacherous&quot; or &quot;The Wily&quot;. He may have earned this epithet after the collapse of an alliance with Rhydderch Hael, king of the nearby Brittonic kingdom of Alt Clut; the enmity between them is remembered in the Welsh Triads and elsewhere. Another Triad records Áedán&#x27;s host as one of the &quot;Three Faithful War-Bands of the Island of Britain&quot;, as they &quot;went to the sea for their lord&quot;. This may point to an otherwise lost tradition concerning one of Áedán&#x27;s sea expeditions, such as to Orkney or the Isle of Man. Additionally, several Welsh works claim a Brittonic pedigree for Áedán. The &quot;Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd&quot; records him as a descendant of Dyfnwal Hen of Alt Clut, though the genealogy is much confused (&quot;Gauran&quot; is given as his son, rather than father). The Cambro-Latin &quot;De Situ Brecheniauc&quot; and &quot;Cognacio Brychan&quot; claim his mother was Luan, daughter of Brychan of Brycheiniog in Wales. Though these pedigrees are inconsistent and likely dubious, they are notable in highlighting Áedán&#x27;s close association with the Britons.

==Neighbours==
Áedán was the chief king in Dál Riata, ruling over lesser tribal kings. The &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot; records the sub-divisions of Dál Riata in the 7th and 8th centuries, but no record from Áedán&#x27;s time survives. According to the &quot;Senchus&quot;, Dál Riata was divided into three sub-kingdoms in the 7th century, each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder. These were the Cenél nGabráin, named for Áedán&#x27;s father, who ruled over Kintyre, Cowal and Bute; the Cenél Loairn of northern Argyll; and the Cenél nÓengusa of Islay. Within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by the &quot;Senchus&quot;. Details of the Irish part of the kingdom are less clear.

Looking outward, Dál Riata&#x27;s neighbours in north Britain were the Picts and the Britons of the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot;, the Brittonic-speaking parts of what is now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland. The most powerful Brittonic kingdom in the area was Alt Clut, later known as Strathclyde and Cumbria. Late in Áedán&#x27;s life, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia became the greatest power in northern Britain.

In Ireland, Dál Riata formed part of Ulster, ruled by Báetán mac Cairill of the Dál Fiatach. The other major grouping in Ulster consisted of the disunited tribes of the Cruithne, later known as the Dál nAraidi. The most important Cruithne king in Áedán&#x27;s time was Fiachnae mac Báetáin. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the Uí Néill and their subjects and allies. Of the Uí Néill kings, Áed mac Ainmuirech of the Cenél Conaill, Columba&#x27;s first cousin once removed, was the most important during Áedán&#x27;s reign.

==Reign==

Adomnán, the &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot; and the Irish annals record Áedán as a son of Gabrán mac Domangairt (died c. 555–560). Áedán&#x27;s brother Eoganán is known from Adomnán and his death is recorded c. 597. The &quot;Senchus&quot; names three other sons of Gabrán, namely Cuildach, Domnall, and Domangart. Although nothing is known of Cuildach and Domangart or their descendants, Adomnán mentions a certain Ioan, son of Conall, son of Domnall, &quot;who belonged to the royal lineage of the Cenél nGabráin&quot;, but this is generally read as meaning that Ioan was a kinsman of the Cenél nGabráin, and his grandfather named Domnall is not thought to be the same person as Áedán&#x27;s brother Domnall.

Áedán was about forty years old when he became king, following the death of his uncle Conall mac Comgaill in 574. His succession as king may have been contested; Adomnán states that Columba had favoured the candidacy of Áedán&#x27;s brother Eoganán. Adomnán claims that Áedán was ordained as king by Columba, the first example of an ordination known in Britain and Ireland.

In 574, following the account of Conall&#x27;s death, the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; and the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; record a battle in Kintyre, called the Battle of Teloch, or Delgu. The precise location of the battle is unidentified. The annals agree that &quot;Dúnchad, son of Conall, son of Comgall, and many others of the allies of the sons of Gabrán, fell.&quot; In 575, the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; report &quot;the great convention of Druim Cett&quot;, at Mullagh or Daisy Hill near Limavady, with Áed mac Ainmuirech and Columba in attendance. Adomnán reports that Áedán was present at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting is not entirely certain, but one agreement made there concerned the status of Áedán&#x27;s kingdom. Áedán and Áed agreed that while the fleet of Dál Riata would serve the Uí Néill, no tribute would be paid to them, and warriors would only be provided from the Dál Riata lands in Ireland.

The reason for this agreement is thought to have been the threat posed to Áedán, and also to Áed, by Báetán mac Cairill. Báetán is said to have forced the king of Dál Riata to pay homage to him at Rosnaree on Islandmagee. Áedán is thought to be the king in question, and Ulster sources say that Báetán collected tribute from Scotland. Following Báetán&#x27;s death in 581, the Ulstermen abandoned the Isle of Man, which they had captured in Báetán&#x27;s time, perhaps driven out by Áedán who is recorded as fighting there c. 583. Earlier, c. 580, Áedán is said to have raided Orkney, which had been subject to Bridei son of Maelchon, King of the Picts, at an earlier date.

Áedán&#x27;s campaigns on the Isle of Man have sometimes been confused with the battle against the Miathi mentioned by Adomnán. The Miathi appear to have been the Maeatae, a tribe in the area of the upper river Forth. This campaign was successful, but Áedán&#x27;s sons Artúr and Eochaid Find were killed in battle according to Adomnán. This battle may have taken place c. 590 and been recorded as the Battle of Leithreid or Leithrig.

The &quot;Prophecy of Berchán&quot; says of Áedán: &quot;Thirteen years (one after another) [he will fight against] the Pictish host (fair the diadem).&quot; The only recorded battle between Áedán and the Picts appears to have been fought in Circinn, in 599 or after, where Áedán was defeated. The annals mention the deaths of his sons here. It has been suggested that this battle was confused with the &quot;Battle of Asreth&quot; in Circinn, fought c. 584, in which Bridei son of Maelchon was killed. This battle is described as being &quot;fought between the Picts themselves&quot;.

A number of Welsh traditions point to warfare between Áedán and King Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut, the northern Brittonic kingdom later known as Strathclyde. Hector Munro Chadwick and subsequent historians suggest Áedán was initially in a long-term alliance with Rhydderch and his predecessors, but that it eventually collapsed into conflict. Adomnán reports that Rhydderch sent a monk named Luigbe to Iona to speak with Columba &quot;for he wanted to learn whether he would be slaughtered by his enemies or not&quot;. A Welsh Triad names Áedán&#x27;s plundering of Alt Clut as one of the &quot;three unrestrained plunderings of Britain&quot;, and the poem &quot;Peiryan Vaban&quot; tells of a battle between Áedán and Rhydderch. The lost Irish epic &quot;Orgain Sratha Cluada&quot; is usually thought to refer to the attack on Alt Clut in 870 by Vikings, but MacQuarrie suggests that it may refer to an attack by Áedán on Rhydderch.

==Degsastan and after==
Degsastan appears not to have been the first battle between Áedán and the Bernicians. The death of his son Domangart in the land of the Saxons is mentioned by Adomnán, and it is presumed that Bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle.

Of the roots of this conflict, Bede mentions only that Áedán was alarmed by Æthelfrith&#x27;s advance. Wherever the Battle of Degsastan was fought, Bede saw it as lying within Northumbria. The battle was a decisive victory for Æthelfrith, and Bede says, carefully, that &quot;[f]rom that day until the present, no king of the Irish in Britain has dared to do battle with the English.&quot; Although victorious, Æthelfrith suffered losses; Bede tells us his brother Theodbald was killed with all his following. Theodbald appears to be called Eanfrith in Irish sources, which name his killer as Máel Umai mac Báetáin of the Cenél nEógain, son of High-King Báetán mac Ninnedo. The Irish poem &quot;Compert Mongáin&quot; says that the king of Ulster, Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi, aided Áedán against the Saxons, perhaps at Degsastan. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; mentions that Hering, son of King Hussa of Bernicia, was present, apparently fighting with Áedán.

After the defeat of Degsastan, the annals report nothing of Áedán until his death around six years later, perhaps on 17 April 609, the date supplied by the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot;, composed c. 800. The &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; give his age as 74. The &quot;Prophecy of Berchán&quot; places his death in Kintyre and says &quot;[h]e will not be king at the time of his death&quot;, while the 12th century &quot;Acta Sancti Lasriani&quot; claims that he was expelled from the kingship. John of Fordun, writing in the 14th century, believed that Áedán had been buried at Kilkerran in Kintyre.

==Áedán&#x27;s descendants==
Áedán was succeeded by his son, Eochaid Buide. Adomnán gives an account of Columba&#x27;s prophecy that Eochaid&#x27;s older brothers (listed as Artúr, Eochaid Find and Domangart) would predecease their father. Áedán&#x27;s other sons are named by the &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot; as Eochaid Find, Tuathal, Bran, Baithéne, Conaing, and Gartnait. Adomnán also names Artúr, called a son of Conaing in the &quot;Senchus&quot;, and Domangart, who is not included in the &quot;Senchus&quot;. Domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of Áedán, most likely another son of Conaing. The main line of Cenél nGabráin kings were the descendants of Eochaid Buide through his son Domnall Brecc, but the descendants of Conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th.

It has been suggested that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, it has been argued that Gartnait&#x27;s successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán&#x27;s great-grandson.

Less is known of Áedán&#x27;s daughters. Maithgemm, also recorded as Gemma, married a prince named Cairell of the Dál Fiatach. The names of Áedán&#x27;s wives are not recorded, but one was said to be Brittonic, and another may have been a Pictish woman named Domelch, if indeed the Gartnait son of Domelch and Gartnait son of Áedán are one and the same.

<text>Conall mac Comgaill was king of Dál Riata from about 558 until 574.

He was a son of Comgall mac Domangairt. It is said that he gave Iona to Saint Columba. The Duan Albanach says that he reigned &quot;without dissension&quot;, but there is a report of an expedition by Conall and Colmán Bec mac Diarmato of the Southern Uí Néill to &quot;Iardoaman&quot; in the Annals of Ulster for 568. The much longer entry in the later and less reliable Annals of the Four Masters reports: &quot;A sea fleet was brought by Colman Beg, son of Diarmaid, son of Fearghus Cerrbheoil, and by Conall, son of Comhgall, chief of Dal Riada, to Sol (Seil) and Ile (Islay), and they carried off many spoils from them.&quot;

The Senchus fer n-Alban says that Conall had seven sons: Loingsech, Nechtan, Artan, Tuathan, Tutio and Coirpe. However, Connad Cerr is taken to be a son of Conall, and the death of Conall&#x27;s son Dúnchad is noted in the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach, leading the army of the &quot;sons of Gabrán&quot; in Kintyre.

<text>Gnus (), or Gnus Network User Services, is a message reader which is part of GNU Emacs. It supports reading and composing both e-mail and news and can also act as an RSS reader, web processor, and directory browser for both local and remote filesystems.

Gnus blurs the distinction between news and e-mail, treating them both as &quot;articles&quot; that come from different sources. News articles are kept separate by group, and e-mail can be split into arbitrary groups, similar to folders in other mail readers. In addition, Gnus is able to use a number of web-based sources as inputs for its groups.

== Features ==
Some Gnus features:
* a range of backends that support any or all of:
** reading email from the local filesystem, or over a network via IMAP or POP3
** reading web pages via an RSS feed
** treating a directory of files, either local or remote (via FTP or other method) as articles to browse 
** reading Usenet News, including the Gmane and Gwene mail-to-news archives of mailing lists
** searching local or remote indices of emails or news items, e.g. via Notmuch
* simple or advanced mail splitting (automatic sorting of incoming mail to user-defined groups)
* incoming mail can be set to expire instead of just plain deletion
* custom posting styles (e.g. a different From address, .signature etc.) for each group
* virtual groups (e.g., directory on the computer can be read as a group)
* an advanced message scoring system
* user-defined hooks for almost any method (in emacs lisp)
* many of the parameters (e.g., expiration, posting style) can be specified individually for all of the groups
* integration with the Insidious Big Brother Database (BBDB) to handle contacts in a highly automated fashion.
* integration with other Emacs packages, such as the W3 web browser, LDAP lookup code, etc.

As part of Emacs, Gnus&#x27; features can be extended indefinitely through Emacs lisp.

To quote the Gnus Manual:

:&quot;You know that Gnus gives you all the opportunity you&#x27;d ever want for shooting yourself in the foot. Some people call it flexibility. Gnus is also customizable to a great extent, which means that the user has a say on how Gnus behaves. Other newsreaders might unconditionally shoot you in your foot, but with Gnus, you have a choice!&quot; 

Note that the composition of HTML email messages (as users of more WYSIWYG editors may be used to) is not included by default; the lack of this &quot;ability&quot; is counted as a feature by Gnus&#x27; traditional user base.

== History ==
Gnus is a rewrite of GNUS by Masanobu Umeda, which ceased to be developed in 1992. In autumn 1994, Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen started the rewrite under the name &quot;(ding)&quot; which is a recursive acronym for &quot;ding is not Gnus&quot;, intending to produce a version for which the interface and configuration would work almost exactly the same, but the internals would be completely revamped and improved. The new version proved to be popular and has undergone constant expansion and enhancement. Ingebrigtsen is also programmer of eww.

=== Versions ===
In general, users receive Gnus bundled with their copy of GNU Emacs and only need to worry about version numbers if they want to upgrade to newer versions themselves instead of receiving updates through Emacs or their operating system&#x27;s packaging system.

The following versions have been released:
* Gnus 5 ((ding) Gnus) – November 1995
** Gnus 5.1 rebranded 5.0.13 bundled with GNU Emacs 19.30/19.31
* Gnus 5.2 (September Gnus) – May 1996
** Gnus 5.3, a rebranded 5.2.38 bundled with GNU Emacs 19.32 and all later versions of GNU Emacs 19.x
* Gnus 5.4 (Red Gnus) – January 25, 1997
** Gnus 5.5, a rebranded 5.4 bundled with GNU Emacs 20.1 (September 17, 1997) and also included in XEmacs 20.4
* Gnus 5.6 (Quassia Gnus) – March 8, 1998
* Gnus 5.8 (Pterodactyl Gnus) – December 3, 1999
* Gnus 5.10 (Oort Gnus) – May 1, 2003
** Gnus 5.11, a rebranded 5.10 bundled with GNU Emacs 22.1 (June 2, 2007). 5.10/5.11 development from the &quot;Oort&quot; development branch wrapped up around 2008. Some 5.11 versions, such as that packaged by Ubuntu Linux as &quot;5.11+v0.10&quot;, are actually based on the later &quot;No Gnus&quot; development branch. 
* Gnus 5.13 (No Gnus) - bundled with GNU Emacs 23.1 (July 29, 2009)
** The &quot;No Gnus&quot; development branch began January 4, 2004, and wrapped up in early 2012, with version 0.19. 
* Gnus 5.14, Ma Gnus (or 真 Gnus), is the current development version, v0.7 first released in May 2013.
The odd minor version numbers, like 5.3 and 5.5 are for the Gnus versions bundled with GNU Emacs. The even version numbers are the unbundled releases. So for example, Gnus 5.5 is similar to Gnus 5.4, but bundled with Emacs 20.1.

Development is done using &quot;named versions&quot;, whose first letters run backwards in the alphabet; &quot;No Gnus&quot; v0.19 was released in early 2012, and development transitioned to &quot;Ma Gnus&quot;. No named version ever reaches 1.0, instead when it is considered stable enough for general release, it sheds its name and gets packaged with as simply &quot;Gnus &lt;version number&gt;&quot;. Entering the &quot;V&quot; command in the Groups buffer of a running copy of Gnus will usually cause it to divulge a version number, but there is no easy way for an end user to know if, for example, &quot;No Gnus 0.9&quot; is older or newer than &quot;Gnus 5.10.8&quot;.

After being developed separately for 22 years, the developer of Gnus announced that further development would take place inside Gnu Emacs&#x27; git tree. A side effect of this change is that support for XEmacs and older versions of Gnu Emacs will be dropped.

<doc id="192979" wikidata="Q948569" url="?curid=192979" title="James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond">
<text>Lieutenant-General James FitzThomas Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond, (19 October 1610 – 21 July 1688), was an Anglo-Irish statesman and soldier, known as Earl of Ormond from 1634 to 1642 and Marquess of Ormond from 1642 to 1661. Following the failure of the senior line of the Butler family, he was the second representative of the Kilcash branch to inherit the earldom.

His friend, the Earl of Strafford, secured his appointment as commander of the government army in Ireland. Following the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he led government forces against the Irish Catholic Confederation; when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, he supported the Royalists and in 1643 negotiated a ceasefire with the Confederation which allowed his troops to be transferred to England. Shortly before the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, he agreed the Second Ormonde Peace, an alliance between the Confederation and Royalist forces which fought against the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

During the 1650s he lived in exile on the continent with Charles II of England. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, Ormond became a major figure in English and Irish politics, holding many high government offices such as Chancellor of the University of Oxford.

== Birth and origins ==
James was born on 19 October 1610 at Clerkenwell, London, the eldest son of Thomas Butler and his wife Elizabeth Pointz. His father, who was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Thurles, was the eldest son and heir apparent of Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond, called &quot;Walter of the rosary beads&quot;. His father&#x27;s family, the Butler dynasty, was Old English and descended from Theobald Walter, who had been appointed Chief Butler of Ireland by King Henry II in 1177.

James&#x27;s mother, Lady Thurles, was English and Catholic, a daughter of Sir John Pointz of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, and his second wife Elizabeth Sydenham. James&#x27;s birth house in Clerkenwell belonged to him, his maternal grandfather.

James was one of seven siblings, three brothers and four sisters, who are listed in his father&#x27;s article. James was not only the eldest son but also the first-born as his eldest sister was born after him in 1612.

== Early life ==
Shortly after his birth, his parents returned to Ireland where they were welcome to Black Tom, the 10th Earl of Ormond but not to Walter his heir apparent, who had opposed James&#x27;s father&#x27;s marriage into the English Poyntz family, who were Catholic but only gentry.

Black Tom died on 22 November 1614. James&#x27;s grandfather Walter succeeded as the 11th Earl and James&#x27;s father became heir apparent with the courtesy title of Viscount Thurles. While the title was secure, the Ormond lands were claimed by Richard Preston, 1st Earl of Desmond, who had married Elizabeth, Black Tom&#x27;s only surviving child.

In 1619 his father perished on his way from Ireland to England in a shipwreck near the Skerries off the coast of Anglesey. James inherited his father&#x27;s courtesy title Viscount Thurles. The year following that disaster, his mother brought young Thurles, as he now was, back to England, and placed him, then nine years old, at school with a Catholic gentleman at Finchley — this doubtless through the influence of his grandfather, the 11th Earl. His mother remarried to George Mathew of Thurles.

On 26 May 1623, King James I, made Thurles a ward of Richard Preston, Earl of Desmond, and placed him at Lambeth, London, under the care of George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury to be brought up as a Protestant. The Ormond estates being under sequestration, the young Lord had but £40 a year for his own and his servants&#x27; clothing and expenses. He seems to have been neglected by the Archbishop — &quot;he was not instructed even in humanity, nor so much as taught to understand Latin&quot;.

When fifteen Thurles went to live with his paternal grandfather (then released from prison) at Drury Lane. His grandfather, the 11th Earl of Ormond, was now an old man and did not interfere much with his Protestant religious education. This was very important for Thurles&#x27;s future life, as it meant that, unlike almost all his relatives in the Butler dynasty, he was a Protestant. This strained his relationship with the rest of his family and dependants, as they suffered from land confiscations and legal discrimination on account of their religion, while he did not.

Now having more means at his command, Thurles entered into all the gaieties of the court and town. At eighteen he went to Portsmouth with his friend George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham intending to join the expedition for the relief of La Rochelle; a project abandoned upon the Duke&#x27;s assassination.

It was during his London residence that he set himself to learn Irish, a partial knowledge of which proved most useful to him in after years.

== Marriage and children ==
About six months after his visit to Portsmouth, Thurles first saw at Court, and fell in love with, his cousin Lady Elizabeth Preston, only child and heiress of Richard Preston, Earl of Desmond and his wife Elizabeth. Charles I gave his consent by letters patent, on 8 September 1629. At Christmas 1629, they married putting an end to the long-standing quarrel between the families and united their estates, one of which was Kilkenny Castle









James and Elizabeth had eight sons, five of whom died in childhood, and two daughters. Five children survived into adulthood:
#Thomas (1634–1680), predeceased his father, but had a son who would become the 2nd Duke
#Richard (1639–1686), became first and last Earl of Arran of the 1662 creation and predeceased his father
#Elizabeth (1640–1665), married Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield and had affairs with James Hamilton and the Duke of York
#John (1643–1677), became the Earl of Gowran
#Mary (1646–1710), married William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire

== With Strafford ==
Thurles&#x27;s career began in 1633 with the appointment as head of government in Ireland of Thomas Wentworth, the future Earl of Strafford, by whom Ormond was treated with great favour. Writing to Charles I, Wentworth described Ormond as &quot;young, but take it from me, a very staid head&quot;.

On 24 February 1633, Thurles, on the death of his grandfather, succeeded to the earldom as the 12th Earl of Ormond. Lord Ormond, as he now was, became Wentworth&#x27;s chief friend and supporter. In January 1635 he became a member of the Irish Privy Council. Wentworth planned large-scale confiscations of Catholic-owned land, both to raise money for the crown and to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry, a policy which Ormond supported. Yet, it infuriated his relatives, and drove many of them into opposition to Wentworth and ultimately into armed rebellion. In 1640, with Wentworth having been recalled to attend to the Second Bishops&#x27; War in England, Ormond was made commander-in-chief of the forces in Ireland. The opposition to Wentworth ultimately aided impeachment of the Earl by the English Parliament, and his eventual execution in May 1641.

== Rebellion and Civil War ==
=== Fighting the rebellion and the Confederates ===
On the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Ormond found himself in command of the Irish Royal Army based in Dublin. Most of the country was taken by the Catholic rebels, who included Ormond&#x27;s Butler relatives. However, Ormond&#x27;s bonds of kinship were not entirely severed. His wife and children were escorted from Kilkenny to Dublin under the order of the rebel leader Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret, another member of the Butler dynasty.

Early in 1642 the Irish Catholics formed their own government, the Catholic Confederation, with its capital at Kilkenny, and began to raise their own regular troops, more organised and capable than the feudal militias of the 1641 rebellion. Also in early 1642, the king sent in troop reinforcements from England and Scotland. The Irish Confederate War was underway. Ormond mounted several expeditions from Dublin in 1642 that cleared the area around Dublin of Confederate forces. He secured control of the Pale, and re-supplied some outlying garrisons, without serious contest. The Lords Justices, Sir William Parsons, 1st Baronet of Bellamont and Sir John Borlase, who suspected him because he was related to many of the Confederate leaders, recalled him from command, but he succeeded securing much of County Kildare in February 1642. Next, he managed to lift the siege of Drogheda in March 1642. In April he relieved the royalist garrisons at Naas, Athy and Maryborough, and on his return to Dublin he won the Battle of Kilrush against a larger force. On 30 August 1642 he was created Marquess of Ormond. He received the public thanks of the English Parliament and a monetary reward, and in September 1642 was put in command with a commission direct from the king.

In March 1643, Ormond ventured with his troops to New Ross, County Wexford, deep in the territory of the Catholic Confederation, and won a small but indecisive victory there (Battle of New Ross) before returning to Dublin. Nevertheless, Ormond was in a difficult situation. The Confederates held two-thirds of the island. The English Civil War, which started in September 1642, had removed the prospect of more reinforcements and supplies from England, and indeed the king desired to recall troops. In addition, the Scots Covenanters, who had landed an army in the northeast of Ireland at Carrickfergus to counter the Catholic rebellion in that part of the country in early 1642, had subsequently put northeast Ireland on the side of the English Parliamentarians against the king; and the relatively strong Protestant presence in and around Derry and Cork City was inclined to side with the Parliamentarians as well, and soon did so.

=== Ormond Cessation ===
Isolated in Dublin in what was now a three-sided contest, with the king desiring to reduce the Irish Royal Army, Ormond negotiated a &quot;cessation&quot; or ceasefire for a year with the Confederates. The truce began on 15 September 1643, By this treaty the greater part of Ireland was given up into the hands of the Catholic Confederation (leaving only districts in the north, the Dublin Pale, round Cork City, and certain smallish garrisons in the possession of Protestant commanders). This truce was vehemently opposed by the Lords Justices and the Protestant community in general in Ireland.

Soon afterwards, in November 1643, by the King&#x27;s orders, Ormond dispatched a body of his troops into England to fight on the Royalist side in the Civil War, estimated at 4,000 troops, half of whom were sent from Cork. In November 1643 the king appointed Ormond as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was sworn in on 21 January 1644. The previous occupant of this post, Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, had never set foot in Ireland. Ormond&#x27;s assigned mission was to prevent the king&#x27;s Parliamentarian enemies from being reinforced from Ireland, and to aim to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalists in England. To these ends, he was instructed to do all in his power to keep the Scottish Covenanter army in the north of Ireland occupied. He was also given the king&#x27;s authority to negotiate a treaty with the Catholic Confederation that could allow their troops to be redirected against the Parliamentarians. In August 1644, the cessation with the Confederates was extended for another year.

=== Negotiations with the Irish Confederates ===

Ormond was faced with the difficult task of reconciling the various factions in Ireland. The Old (native) Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent (&quot;Old English&quot;) were represented in Confederate Ireland—essentially an independent Catholic government based in Kilkenny—who wanted to come to terms with King Charles I of England in return for religious toleration and self-government. On the other side, any concession that Ormond made to the Confederates weakened his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland. Ormond&#x27;s negotiations with the Confederates were therefore tortuous, even though many of the Confederate leaders were his relatives or friends.

In 1644, he assisted Randall Macdonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim in mounting an Irish Confederate expedition into Scotland. The force, led by Alasdair MacColla was sent to help the Scottish Royalists and sparked off a civil war in Scotland (1644–45). This turned out to be the only intervention of Irish Catholic troops in Britain during the Civil Wars.

On 25 August 1645, Edward Somerset, Earl of Glamorgan, acting on behalf of King Charles, signed a treaty in Kilkenny with the Irish Catholic Confederates without first airing the terms of the treaty with the Irish Protestant community. Irish Protestant opposition turned out to be so intense, that Charles was forced to repudiate the treaty almost immediately out of fear of ceding almost all Irish Protestant support to the other side in the English civil war.

On 21 October 1645 Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, the papal nuncio landed in Ireland. On 28 March 1646, Ormond, on behalf of the king, concluded the First Ormond Peace, another treaty with the Confederates that granted religious concessions and removed various grievances. However, the Confederates&#x27; General Assembly in Kilkenny rejected the deal, partly due to the influence of the pope&#x27;s ambassador (nuncio) Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, who worked to dissuade the Catholics from entering into a compromise. The Confederates called off their truce with Ormond, and arrested those among their number who had signed the treaty with Ormond.

Ormond then judged that he could not hold Dublin against the Confederates. He, therefore, applied to the English Long Parliament and signed a treaty with them on 19 June 1647 delivering Dublin into the hands of the Parliamentarians on terms that protected the interests of both royalist Protestants and Roman Catholics who had not actually entered into rebellion. At the beginning of August 1647, Ormond handed over Dublin, together with 3000 royalist troops under his command, to the Parliamentarian commander Michael Jones, who had recently arrived from England with 5000 Parliamentarian troops. Ormond in turn sailed for England on 28 July 1647, remarking of his surrender that he &quot;preferred English rebels to Irish ones&quot;. On 8 August 1647 the combined royalist and parliamentarian troops won the major Battle of Dungan&#x27;s Hill against the Confederates.

=== First exile ===
Ormond attended King Charles during August and October 1647 at Hampton Court Palace, but in March 1648, in order to avoid arrest by the parliament, he joined the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Paris.

=== Commander of Royalist Alliance ===
In September of the same year, the pope&#x27;s nuncio having been expelled, and affairs otherwise looking favourable, he returned to Ireland arriving at Cork on 29 September 1648. His aim was to unite all parties for the king.

The Irish Confederates were now much more amenable to compromise, as 1647 had seen a series of military disasters for them at the hands of English Parliamentarian forces. On 17 January 1649 Ormond concluded a peace with the rebels on the basis of the free exercise of their religion.

On the execution of Charles I, he proclaimed his loyalty to Charles II, who made him a Knight of the Garter in September 1649. Ormond was placed in command of the Irish Confederates&#x27; armies and also English Royalist troops who were landed in Ireland from France.

However, despite controlling almost all of Ireland before August 1649, Ormond was unable to prevent the conquest of Ireland by Cromwell in 1649–50. Ormond tried to retake Dublin by laying siege to the city in the summer of 1649, but was routed at the Battle of Rathmines in August. Subsequently, he tried to halt Cromwell by holding a line of fortified towns across the country. However, the New Model Army took them one after the other, beginning with the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649.

Ormond lost most of the English and Protestant Royalist troops under his command when they mutinied and went over to Cromwell in May 1650. This left him with only the Irish Catholic forces, who distrusted him greatly. Ormond was ousted from his command in late 1650.

=== Second exile ===
He left Ireland for France sailing from Galway on 7 December 1650, but stopped over at Gleninagh Castle, on the southern shore of the Bay of Galway, from where he then started his passage to France on 11 December. He sailed on a small frigate, the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, which the Duke of York had sent him from Jersey. Caught in winter storms, they reached Perros in Brittany after three weeks. Ormond was accompanied among others by Inchiquin, Bellings and Daniel O&#x27;Neill.

A synod held at the Augustinian abbey in Jamestown, County Leitrim, repudiated Ormond and excommunicated his followers. In Cromwell&#x27;s Act of Settlement of 1652, all of Ormond&#x27;s lands in Ireland were confiscated and he was excepted from the pardon given to those Royalists who had surrendered by that date. His name heads the list of over 100 men who were excluded from pardon.

Ormond, though desperately short of money, was in constant attendance on Charles II and the Queen Mother in Paris, and accompanied the King to Aix and Cologne when he was expelled from France by the terms of Mazarin&#x27;s treaty with Cromwell in 1655. In April 1656 Ormond was one of two signatories who agreed the Treaty of Brussels, securing an alliance for the Royalists with the Spanish court. In 1658, he went disguised, and at great risk, on a secret mission into England to gain trustworthy intelligence as to the chances of an uprising. He attended the king at Fuenterrabia in 1659, had an interview with Mazarin, and was actively engaged in the secret transactions immediately preceding the Restoration. Relations between Ormond and the Queen Mother became increasingly strained; when she remarked that &quot;if she had been trusted, the King had now been in England&quot;, Ormond retorted that &quot;if she had never been trusted, the King had never been out of England&quot;.

== Restoration career ==
On the return of Charles to England as King in 1660, Ormond was appointed a commissioner for the treasury and the navy, made Lord Steward of the Household, a Privy Councillor, Lord Lieutenant of Somerset (an office which he resigned in 1672), High Steward of Westminster, Kingston and Bristol, chancellor of Trinity College Dublin, Baron Butler of Llanthony and Earl of Brecknock in the peerage of England; and on 30 March 1661 he was created Duke of Ormond in the Irish peerage and made Lord High Steward of England, for Charles&#x27;s coronation that year. At the same time, he recovered his enormous estates in Ireland, and large grants in recompense of the fortune he had spent in the royal service were made to him by the king, while in the following year the Irish Parliament presented him with £30,000. His losses, however, according to Carte, exceeded his gains by nearly a million pounds. See also Act of Settlement 1662.

On 4 November 1661, he once more received the lord lieutenancy of Ireland, and busily engaged in the work of settling that country. The main problem was the land question, and the Act of Explanation was passed through the Irish parliament by Ormond, on 23 December 1665.

His heart was in his government, and he vehemently opposed the Importation Act 1667 prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle, which struck so fatal a blow at Irish trade; and retaliated by prohibiting the import into Ireland of Scottish commodities, and obtained leave to trade with foreign countries. He encouraged Irish manufacture and learning, and it was due to his efforts that the Irish College of Physicians owes its incorporation.

He had great influence over the appointment of judges: while he naturally wished to appoint to the Bench men of legal ability, a record of loyalty to the Crown was also generally required. It is interesting that he was prepared to appoint judges of Gaelic descent, like James Donnellan, and even some who were known to have Roman Catholic leanings. He was criticised for favouring old friends like John Bysse who were considered too infirm to be effective, but this also shows one of his main virtues, loyalty: as Elrington Ball remarks, those whom Ormond had ever loved, he loved to the end. Himself a merciful man, he encouraged the Irish judges to show a similar spirit of clemency; as he remarked, a man who has been reprieved can later be hanged, but a man who has been hanged can never be reprieved. In general, the judges followed his example and, by the standards of the age, were merciful enough.

Ormond&#x27;s personality had always been a striking one, and he was highly regarded. He was dignified and proud of his loyalty, even when he lost royal favour, declaring, &quot;However ill I may stand at court I am resolved to lye well in the chronicle&quot;. Ormond soon became the mark for attack from all that was worst in the court. Buckingham especially did his utmost to undermine his influence. Ormond&#x27;s almost irresponsible government of Ireland during troubled times was open to criticism.

He had billeted soldiers on civilians, and had executed martial law. He was threatened by Buckingham with impeachment. In March 1669, Ormond was removed from the government of Ireland and from the committee for Irish affairs. He made no complaint, insisted that his sons and others over whom he had influence should retain their posts, and continued to fulfil the duties of his other offices, while his character and services were recognised in his election as Chancellor of the University of Oxford on 4 August 1669.

In 1670, an extraordinary attempt was made to assassinate the duke by a ruffian and adventurer named Thomas Blood, already notorious for an unsuccessful plot to surprise Dublin Castle in 1663, and later for stealing the royal crown from the Tower. Ormond was attacked by Blood and his accomplices while driving up St James&#x27;s Street on the night of 6 December 1670, dragged out of his coach, and taken on horseback along Piccadilly with the intention of hanging him at Tyburn. Ormond, however, succeeded in overcoming the horseman to whom he was bound, and escaped.

The outrage, it was suspected, had been instigated by Buckingham, who was openly accused of the crime by Lord Ossory, Ormond&#x27;s son, in the king&#x27;s presence, and threatened by him with instant death if any violence should happen to his father. These suspicions were encouraged by the improper action of the king in pardoning Blood, and in admitting him to his presence and treating him with favour after his apprehension while endeavouring to steal the crown jewels.

In his estates in Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary, Ormond was responsible for establishing the woollen industry in the town in 1670.

In 1671 Ormond successfully opposed Richard Talbot&#x27;s attempt to upset the Act of Settlement 1662. In 1673, he again visited Ireland, returned to London in 1675 to give advice to Charles on affairs in parliament, and in 1677 was again restored to favour and reappointed to the lord lieutenancy. On his arrival in Ireland, he occupied himself in placing the revenue and the army upon a proper footing. Upon the outbreak of the disturbances caused by the Popish Plot (1678) in England, Ormond at once took steps towards rendering the Roman Catholics, who were in the proportion of 15 to 1, powerless; and the mildness and moderation of his measures served as the ground of an attack upon him in England led by Shaftesbury, from which he was defended with great spirit by his own son Lord Ossory. While wary of defending Oliver Plunkett publicly, in private he denounced the obvious falsity of the charges against him – of the informers who claimed that Plunkett had hired them to kill the King he wrote that &quot;no schoolboy would have trusted them with the design of robbing an orchard&quot;.

In 1682 Charles summoned Ormond to court. The same year he wrote &quot;A Letter, from a Person of Honour in the Country, in answer to the earl of Anglesey, his Observations upon the earl of Castlehaven&#x27;s Memoires concerning the Rebellion of Ireland&quot;, and gave Charles general support. On 29 November 1682, an English dukedom was conferred upon him, and in June 1684 he returned to Ireland, but he was recalled in October in consequence of fresh intrigues. Before he could give up his government to Rochester, Charles II died; and Ormond&#x27;s last act as lord lieutenant was to proclaim James II in Dublin.

Ormond also served as the sixth Chancellor of the University of Dublin between 1645 and 1688, although he was in exile for the first fifteen years of his tenure.

Subsequently, Ormond lived in retirement at Cornbury in Oxfordshire, a house lent to him by Lord Clarendon, but emerged in 1687 to offer opposition at the board of the Charterhouse to James&#x27;s attempt to assume the dispensing power and force upon the institution a Roman Catholic candidate without taking the oaths. Ormond also refused the king his support in the question of the Indulgence; James, to his credit, refused to take away his offices, and continued to hold him in respect and favour to the last. Despite his long service to Ireland he admitted that he had no wish to spend his last years there.

== Death, succession, and timeline ==
Ormond died on 21 July 1688 at Kingston Lacy estate, Dorset, &quot;not having, as he rejoyced to know, outlived his intellectuals&quot;, i.e. not having become senile. Ormond was buried in Westminster Abbey on 4 August 1688. His eldest son, Thomas, 6th Earl of Ossory, predeceased him, but Ossory&#x27;s eldest son James succeeded as 2nd Duke of Ormond (1665–1745).

The anonymous author of Ormond&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (11th ed.) wrote that with him disappeared the greatest and grandest figure of the times, and that Ormond&#x27;s splendid qualities were expressed with some felicity in verses written on welcoming his return to Ireland and printed in 1682:

<doc id="192981" wikidata="Q3176886" url="?curid=192981" title="University of the Philippines Diliman">
<text>The University of the Philippines Diliman (also called UPD; ), also referred to as UP Diliman or simply University of the Philippines (UP), is a public, coeducational, research university located in Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines. It was established on February 12, 1949, as the flagship campus and seat of administration of the University of the Philippines System, the national university of the Philippines.

As a member of the University of the Philippines System, it is the fourth oldest and is the largest constituent campus in terms of the number of degree-granting academic units, student population, faculty, and library resources. There are 27 degree-granting units on campus, accounting for 26,349 students of which, 17,117 are undergraduates. UP Diliman had a complement of 1,620 regular faculty in 2023, of whom 499 have doctoral degrees.

In addition to the units in the main campus, UP Diliman has extension programs in Angeles City, Pampanga (the Clark Freeport Zone area) and Olongapo, Zambales, as well as a marine laboratory in Bolinao, Pangasinan under the Marine Science Institute, and an satellite campus at Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. UP Diliman offers academic programs in 247 major fields. There are 70 programs at the undergraduate level, 109 programs at the master&#x27;s level and 68 at the doctoral level.

The UP Diliman campus is also the site of the country&#x27;s National Science Complex. Notable research units of UP Diliman centered at the National Science Complex include the Marine Science Institute (MSI), the National Institute of Geological Sciences (NIGS), the National Institute of Physics (NIP), the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NIMBB), the National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development (NISMED), and the Computational Science Research Center (CSRC) which are all pioneers of scientific research and development in the Philippines. The Sentro ng Wikang Filipino, devoted to research on the intellectualization of the Filipino language, is also located in the campus.

A nationally important university, UP Diliman alumni include a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Philippine presidents, chief justices of the Philippine Supreme Court, Philippine National Scientists, and Philippine National Artists, the most of any higher education institution. Taken as a single university distinct from other UP System campuses, UP Diliman is considered as the top institution of higher learning in the country, based on the reports published by the CWUR University Rankings and the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

The Management Review Committee (MRC) was created by UP President Edgardo Angara in the 1980s to evaluate and recommend measures for the university&#x27;s improvement. The report made by the MRC led to the decision of the Board of Regents to further decentralize the UP administration, declaring UP Diliman an autonomous unit and the system&#x27;s flagship university on March 23, 1983. This also furthered the reorganization of some major units of the university, with the College of Arts and Sciences being split into three colleges: the College of Science, the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy. UP Diliman was formally established as a constituent university on April 23, 1985, at the 976th Meeting of the U.P. Board of Regents.

==Campus==
In a bid to boost initiatives in the sciences and technology, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo established the NSC through Executive Order 583 on December 8, 2006, to be administered and operated by the College of Science. Some ₱2 billion was allocated to the program to increase research and technological capacity in the country. Of that amount, ₱1.7 billion was earmarked for the construction of the NSC; in particular, the completion of the buildings for the National Institute of Physics and the Institute of Mathematics. It also funded the construction of buildings for the Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Biology, the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, the Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology, and the College of Science Administration buildings.

The ERDT, on the other hand, is a 10-year program that seeks, among others, to attain “a critical mass of MS and Ph.D. graduates in engineering; upgrade the qualifications of practicing engineers; provide accessible graduate education; upgrade engineering colleges, and develop a culture of research &amp; development.”

The ERDT is implemented by a consortium of seven universities in the country offering Masters and Doctoral degrees in the various engineering fields. As part of the program, funds have enabled the construction of the following buildings in the National Engineering Complex for the units under the College of Engineering, namely: Computer Science, Geodetic Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical, and Electronics Engineering Institute, Institute of Civil Engineering; Mining, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Energy and Environmental Engineering.

=== The Oblation and Academic Oval ===


The U.P. Diliman campus is connected to Commonwealth Avenue via University Avenue. It stretches where traffic enters the campus or proceeds towards C.P. Garcia St., which connects Commonwealth Avenue to Katipunan Avenue. At the end of University Avenue, the Oblation Plaza of the Diliman campus faces the road. Behind it, the facade of Quezon Hall can be seen.

The Oblation statue () is the most iconic figure of the U.P. System. The statue was originally created by National Artist Guillermo E. Tolentino in 1935 in a collective effort by the students of the U.P. System. During the 40th anniversary of the University of the Philippines in 1949, the Oblation was transferred to Diliman in Quezon City from their original site along Padre Faura St. in Manila as a symbol of transfer of administrative seat. The Oblation was originally naked and made of concrete and stands in height. For morality and censorship purposes, U.P. President Jorge Bocobo suggested to put a fig leaf to cover the genitals. In 1950, the Board of Regents ordered the statue to be cast in true bronze. Tolentino made a trip to Italy to personally supervise the casting of his old masterpiece into bronze. The bronze statue, unveiled on November 29, 1958, is now housed at Gonzalez Hall where the University Library is also located.

Several replicas of Tolentino&#x27;s Oblation statue were created during the creation of new U.P. campuses, some were made by the National Artist Napoleon Abueva. U.P. Diliman&#x27;s Oblation statue located in the Oblation Plaza is also a concrete-made replica of Tolentino&#x27;s. 

The main and largest road in the university is the Academic Oval, informally known as &quot;Acad Oval&quot;. This road is composed of two joining avenues, the Roxas and Osmeña Avenues. Having a total circumference of about , the oval connects the rest of the colleges of the university from the main University Avenue. The avenue derives its name from several colleges located around it, namely the College of Mass Communication, College of Music, College of Engineering, College of Law, School of Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Education, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy and School of Library and Information Studies. The oval also covers Quezon Hall, the U.P. Theater, National Engineering Center, Student Activity Center/Vinzons Hall, Center for International Studies and Jorge B. Vargas Museum. Additionally, the Academic Oval is planted with over 500 acacia and fire trees.

The Alumni Walk was launched in U.P.’s centennial year in 2008. A project of the UPD administration under then-Chancellor Sergio S. Cao, the project sought to transform the inner sidewalk of the Academic Oval into a tile-paved footpath with commemorative slabs bearing UPD alumni-donors’ names, and whose donations went to the UPD Faculty Development Fund. In March 2008, however, the Academic Oval was turned into one-way in order to lessen traffic volume entering the university. According to then vice chancellor for community affairs Cynthia Grace Gregorio, the policy also promotes lessening air pollution by creating biking lanes on the inner side of the circle.
===Carillon and bell tower===
The only carillon in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia that is manually played by a clavier or a wooden keyboard, the U.P. Carillon tower is about 130 feet tall. The U.P. Carillon was originally constructed in 1940 by National Artist Juan Nakpil, Conservatory of Music director Ramon Tapales and UP President Bienvenido Gonzales with an initial idea of building a concrete structure that may tower the grounds of the university. Several years later, on August 1, 1952, the tower was finished and dedicated as the U.P. Carillon. Forty-eight bells with four octaves were installed by the Dutch carillonneur Adrian Antonisse, with the efforts laid by the U.P. Alumni Association. These bells were forged by Van Bergen Co. in Netherlands and the largest of them weighs five tons, where the total cost of construction summed up to ₱200,000.

Apart from playing the U.P.&#x27;s anthem &quot;UP Naming Mahal&quot; (U.P. Beloved), the carillon tuned many music such as the &quot;Magtanim ay Di Biro&quot; (Planting Rice, a Filipino folk song) and The Beatles sounds. One of the most important tunings of the carillon was when it played the socialist anthem &quot;The Internationale&quot; at the 1971 Diliman Commune. During this time, U.P. students declared the university as a republic and as a separate entity from the Philippines.

Due to age and rust, the carillon ceased to play in 1981. In 1988, the last symphonies of &quot;U.P. Naming Mahal&quot; and &quot;Push On U.P.!&quot; (U.P. Diliman&#x27;s athletic cheer) from the tower was played during the December&#x27;s Lantern Parade. Since then, the carillon was never tuned. But as late as 2001, students said that they could hear the rhymes of &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot; and &quot;Sing a Song of Six Pence&quot;, despite the carillion being closed to prevent further mishap.

In 2005, through the collective efforts of the U.P. Alumni Association and various private donors, the U.P. Carillon Restoration Project of the U.P. Centennial Commission launched a fund-raising program to collect ₱20 million to restore the carillon, as a projection of using the tower again in the coming 100th year of the University of the Philippines. After two years, the Project was able to collect ₱14 million which will be used to clean up and repair the tower itself and to replace the bells.

In 2007, the carillon was formally reintroduced to the public after two years of restoration. The original 48 bells were put into archives and were replaced by 36 bells bought from Dutch company Petit &amp; Fritsen for ₱12 million, for which the construction engineers were provided by the Royal Bell Philippines. According to project engineer Matthew Bergers, each bell was made from 80% bronze and 20% an admixture of zinc, magnesium and phosphorus. The largest of these bells weighs and the smallest . The original wood claviers were replaced by heavy-duty oakwood; all bells are designed to hold refurbished steel pipes. Another project engineer, Eduardo Otacan, said that the new bells will have a three-octave range, and can be programmed using computers attached to the clavier.

At the same time, a small amphitheater named Carillon Plaza was constructed at the base of the tower. After about two decades of silence, the U.P. Carillon was heard again during the Lantern Parade of 2007.

===Sunken Garden===

The Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds, or commonly known as the Sunken Garden, is a natural depression found on the eastern side of the campus and at the end of the Academic Oval circle. Sunken Garden is enclosed by the UP Main Library, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy&#x27;s Department of Psychology, College of Education, Student Activity Center/Vinzons Hall, College of Business Administration, School of Economics and College of Law. The Grounds was originally a property of the UP Reserved Officers&#x27; Training Corps when the campus was founded in 1949.

Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds acquired its name &quot;Sunken Garden&quot; due to its basin-shaped low-level formation that has the deepest point of 65 meters above sea level (contrary to the university&#x27;s height that is over hundreds of meters above sea level). The Sunken Garden is the venue of the annual U.P. Fair as well as for sports tournaments, including football, frisbee and volleyball. Sometimes, the Department of Military Science and Tactics hold training in the area.

According to local lore, the Sunken Garden sinks by about two inches every year. Though this has not been verified in any study, some have posited reasons for the sinking: one is that it is because of underground trenches over the campus&#x27; sewer system that connects to the Marikina Fault Line, an active geologic structure that runs across the east of Metro Manila. Another theory is that the depression was due to the emptying of former streams in the Sunken Garden that were prominent in the 1950s. These streams formerly run from Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for Commonwealth Avenue.

=== UP Promenade ===
Inaugurated in 2018, the UP Promenade is a 120-meter walkway equipped with internet and Wi-Fi capable facilities available for the use of every student and faculty member of the Diliman campus. Fronting Gonzales Hall (Main Library), it is a 7.5-meter-wide (extending to 16 meters, more or less, at certain portions)-by-120-meter-broad walkway with alcoves, plazas and benches. It is a legacy project donated by Upsilon Sigma Phi as part of an external learning center within the campus. In the middle of UP Promenade is called the “Freedom Plaza&quot;.

==Administration==

U.P. Diliman is the fourth oldest and is the largest, in terms of student population, of all the seven major campuses of the University of the Philippines. The University of the Philippines is governed by the Board of Regents&#x27; 11 members, of whom five are &quot;ex officio&quot;, three are student, faculty, and staff representatives, and three are appointed by the President of the Philippines. Each campus of the University of the Philippines is headed by a chancellor. The first chancellor of U.P. Diliman was Senator Edgardo J. Angara, whose office was created on April 26, 1982. The chancellor is assisted by five vice chancellors — for academic affairs, administration, community affairs, research &amp; development, and student affairs. The current chancellor is Edgardo Carlo Vistan II, who was appointed by the Board of Regents into position during its meeting in April 2023.

Apart from heading the university, the chancellor also holds administrative duties that represent the Board of Regents at the campus level. The chancellor also serves as chairperson of the university council, an internal coordinating body composed of the chancellor himself, the university registrar who serves as secretary, and the professorial faculty. The vice chancellor for academic affairs, on the other hand, assists the chancellor in coordinating curricular, instructional, library, and other programs of the university. The vice chancellor for administration assists the chancellor in the administrative management of the campus. The vice-chancellor for community affairs assists the chancellor in promoting relationships within the university and in dealing with local government and safety issues, while the vice chancellor for research &amp; development assists the chancellor in formulating guidelines and criteria for the university&#x27;s research and development endeavors. Finally, the vice chancellor for student affairs assists the chancellor in promoting wellness and discipline among students in areas such as health, food services, and scholarship management.

==Academics==

===Colleges and Institutes===
The university&#x27;s departments are headed by department chairs, who assume the duties assigned by the dean and the chancellor. Each chair is appointed by the chancellor, as recommended by the dean or institute director, and has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon reappointment.

Some units of the university are known as National Institutes, such as the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The status of being an institute is determined by the Board of Regents, but recognition as a national institute is governed by Philippine legislation. The head of a national institute, also the director, is not appointed by the chancellor but by the president of the university.

In addition to the units in the main campus, UP Diliman has degree-granting satellite campuses (officially named extension programs) in Angeles City, Pampanga (specifically in the Clark Freeport Zone area) and in Olongapo, Zambales. These degree-granting extension programs are headed by a director, who assumes the duties assigned by the chancellor.

U.P. Diliman is composed of 26 colleges, schools, and institutes. Officially, these are called &quot;degree-granting units&quot;. The oldest of these colleges is the College of Fine Arts, established in 1908 and originally located in Manila. On the other hand, the first college to operate on the Diliman campus is the College of Music (then Conservatory of Music) in 1949.
===Grading System and Academic Calendar===
Academic performance is rated from 1.00 being excellent to 5.00 as failed. Grades from 1.00 to 3.00 are separated by increments of 0.25, while 3.00 is followed immediately by 4.00 and then 5.00. Some professors use 0.50 as increments instead, and some colleges, particularly the College of Engineering do not give 4.00 grades. A grade of four (4.00) is a conditional grade and a student needs to remove the grade of 4.00 during a prescribed period (usually determined by the college where he/she is enrolled) or else it will become 5.00 once the period has lapsed. A conditional grade can only be removed by a removal exam; if the student passes the exam, he/she will obtain a grade of 3.00; otherwise, it is 5.00. An alternative for 4.00 is the rating of &quot;INC&quot;, which means &quot;incomplete&quot;, and is given to students who have unfinished requirements for a particular subject. If a student drops the subject before the &quot;subject dropping period&quot; his/her record for that subject will be replaced by &quot;DRP&quot;.

Students who attain a grade point average of 1.20 or better, 1.45 to 1.20, and 1.75 to 1.45 are awarded upon graduation as summa cum laude, magna cum laude and cum laude respectively. Up until 2014, graduation occurred every April and October, with commencement exercises being held only in April. The shift in the academic calendar moved graduation dates to June and December, with commencement exercises being done only during the month of June. U.P. Diliman had an average of 3,190 undergraduates, 627 MS graduates, and 73 Ph.D. students graduating every year. The most number of honor graduates came from the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy, followed by the College of Business Administration, College of Engineering, College of Mass Communication and College of Architecture.

=== Rankings and Accreditation ===
As part of the University of the Philippines System, U.P. Diliman is also considered as an SUC and the only national university of the Philippines. The nature of the University of the Philippines puts it in a position where it does not need any accreditation by any other local body.

UP Diliman&#x27;s website led the 2024 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities in the Philippines published by the Cybermetrics Lab. It ranked first among the nation&#x27;s 363 universities, with the UP System placing third and University of the Philippines Manila in seventh place.

300 students enrolled in elective course, as UP Diliman opened on March 1, 2024 Celebrity Studies: Taylor Swift in Focus - its impact on the relationships between the public, media, class, politics, gender, race, and success.

== Culture, sports and traditions ==
The Diliman community is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Diliman Republic&quot; and a &quot;microcosm of the Philippine Society.&quot; It is the only university in Metro Manila that has its own jeepney transportation system due to its sheer size. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) as well as a television station. Currently, the university operates DZUP 1602, a community AM radio station, and University of the Philippines Internet Television, also known as TVUP - the first university in the country to have a TV network franchise and allotment frequency to broadcast in free TV should they want. The campus encompasses a number of residential areas and many students claim a sense of solidarity with the residents of these immediate communities. On the other hand, &quot;The Philippine Collegian&quot; is the official student publication of the university, and one of only three tertiary-level campus publications in the Philippines released weekly.

=== Campus events ===
Two of the most-awaited events inside the campus are the Lantern Parade, held in the last week before the Christmas break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February (for 2025, it will be held on April). During the Lantern Parade, the individual colleges as well as groups within U.P.D. create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval, culminating in a lengthy program held in front of the Amphitheater capped off by a massive fireworks display. In recent years the event has become so popular even outside of UP that media outlets and major Manila television networks regularly send crews to broadcast the event live.

The U.P. Fair, organized by the UP Diliman University Student Council, is a week-long event held at the Sunken Garden that features evening music concerts, booths, and amusement park rides. Typically falling during the third week of February, students and youth even from outside the U.P. System flock to the nightly concerts.

=== UP Fighting Maroons ===
The UP Fighting Maroons is the name of the collegiate varsity teams of the University of the Philippines Diliman, which play in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), the premiere sports league in the country. The collegiate women&#x27;s varsity teams are also sometimes called the Lady Maroons. The University of the Philippines Integrated School is the affiliate juniors division high school. They play as the Junior Maroons, formerly the Preps.

U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) and participates in all events. The Fighting Maroons have perennially placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP. One of the most popular athletic teams in the program is the U.P. Pep Squad, a heavyweight in the annual UAAP Cheerdance Competition.

==Centennial Celebration==
On January 8, 2008, the University of the Philippines System, with 7 constituent universities and 12 campuses offering 258 undergraduate and 438 graduate programs, began its centennial celebration at the Diliman campus. 

The university has produced 7 of 17 presidents (8, including Bong Bong Marcos who did not finish his degree in UP Law), 14 chief justices of the Supreme Court, 34 of 35 national scientists and 36 of 57 national artists, 1 Nobel Laureate, and an estimated 300,000 alumni (20,000 doctors, 12,000 lawyers and 30,000 teachers). Of the senators serving in the 2010–2013 term, 14 were from UP.

Fernando Javier, 100, of Baguio, eldest living U.P. alumnus (Civil Engineering from the University of the Philippines Manila, 1933), began the 100-torch relay at the U.P. academic oval in Diliman, Quezon City. The 99th torchbearer was Michael Reuben Dumlao, youngest, a 6th-grader from the University of the Philippines Integrated School in U.P. Diliman. Then-U.P. president Emerlinda R. Roman, also its first woman president, ignited the centennial cauldron in front of the U.P. Oblation plaza.

The cauldron featured three pillars — representing the university&#x27;s core values of Excellence, Leadership and Service — and seven flowers representing the constituent universities: U.P. Manila, U.P. Diliman (together with U.P. Pampanga, its extension campus), U.P. Los Baños, U.P. Baguio, U.P. Visayas, U.P. Mindanao, and U.P. Open University.

The centennial celebration came with a massive fund-raising campaign for the U.P. System, and generous donations from alumni came pouring in. One of the largest was the GT-Toyota Asian Cultural (ACC) Center, a gleaming 100-million-peso, one-hectare complex envisioned to be a major hub of campus activity as well as the main site of the Asian Center&#x27;s different collaborations.

===UPAA 2008 Centennial Yearbook===
The University of the Philippines Alumni Association announced its launching of a special three-volume U.P.A.A. 2008 Centennial Yearbook on June 21, 2008, at the U.P.A.A. Grand Alumni-Faculty Homecoming and Reunion at the Araneta Coliseum, Cubao, Quezon City. The theme was “U.P. Alumni: Excellence, Leadership, and Service in the Next 100 Years,” with the three cover designs showing the works of national artists Napoleon Abueva, Abdul Imao, and Benedicto Cabrera. Chief Justice Reynato Puno was the yearbook&#x27;s most distinguished alumnus awardee (among 47 other awardees).

== Notable alumni ==

<text>The Philippine General Hospital (also known as University of the Philippines–Philippine General Hospital or UP–Philippine General Hospital), simply referred to as UP–PGH or PGH, is a tertiary state-owned hospital administered and operated by the University of the Philippines Manila. It is designated as the National University Hospital, and the national government referral center. It stands within a site located at the UP Manila Campus in Ermita, Manila. PGH has 1,100 beds and 400 private beds, and has an estimated of 4,000 employees to serve more than 600,000 patients every year.

The PGH, being the largest training hospital in the country, is the laboratory hospital of health science students enrolled in the University of the Philippines. This includes students of medicine, nursing, physical therapy, pharmacy, occupational therapy, dentistry, and speech pathology.

There are 16 clinical departments under the Philippine General Hospital — Family and Community Medicine, Anesthesiology, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Neurosciences, Pediatrics, Otorhinolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery, Ophthalmology, Orthopedics, Rehabilitation Medicine, Psychiatry, Radiology, Pathology, Emergency Medicine, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, and Dermatology—all of which offer residency and fellowship training. It also offers various training for paramedical specialties such as nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, radiation technology, nutrition, hospital dentistry, medical technology and EMT training.

== History ==
In 1907, The Philippine Commission passed &quot;Act No. 1688&quot; which appropriated the sum of about ₱780,000.00 for the construction of the Philippine General Hospital in Manila. The cornerstone of the hospital was laid on February 28, 1908. The bids for the construction of the buildings were opened on July 27 and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, H. Thurber of the Manila Construction Company. The structural works for the central administration building, a surgical pavilion with two operating rooms, a building for dispensary and out-clinic, five ward pavilions of sixty beds each, a nurses’ home, a kitchen, an ambulance stable and morgue were completed on November 30, 1909. 

In 1910, the Philippine General Hospital opened its door to the public on September 1 with three hundred thirty beds and was eventually linked to the Philippine Medical School. 

PGH remained open during World War II, where its wards overflowed with victims of the conflict. It treated Filipino, Japanese soldiers and American internees alike, even if the hospital supplies are almost depleted.

In 1981, Architect J. Ramos undertook the master planning of the PGH renovation project. PGH celebrated its centennial in 2007, one hundred years since the US government passed a law establishing it.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, PGH was selected as one of the COVID-19 referral centers in the country. The hospital provided 130 beds for COVID-19 patients, while continuing to serve other people with other ailments. PGH officially accepted COVID-19 referrals from other hospitals starting March 30, 2020.

On March 13, 2024, a blaze hit the ground floor of the audio-visual room of the Department of Medicine from 3:08 p.m.-4:30 p.m. having affected Wards 1, 2, 3, and 4. “Code Triage” in its emergency room was raised with damage of P1.4 million.

== Architecture ==

The Philippine General Hospital Administration Building is situated along Taft Avenue in Manila. It was built by architect Tomas Mapua in Neoclassical style that follows the Daniel Burnham plan for Manila. This plan included Manila Hotel, Army and Navy Club and the Philippine General Hospital. These were executed by his successor, Parsons included who was a city planner in the Philippines during the early period American colonization in the country. His works were a clear translation of Neoclassicism into a new hybrid of colonial tropical architecture.

In 2014, the Pediatric Oncology Isolation Ward was constructed by Sta. Elena Construction and Development through the generosity of its president and CEO, Alice Eduardo. The ward was dedicated to children with cancer, particularly from poor households that could not afford the costs of an isolation ward. A dormitory was also built to house the children&#x27;s caregivers or relatives while they were admitted to PGH.

In 2020, Alice Eduardo contributed to the restoration and modernization of Bahay Silungan. This is a heritage building that served as the Nurses&#x27; Home, which was first occupied in 1911. The home has 18 bedrooms, terraces, and verandas. The restoration was decided amid the COVID-19 pandemic so that the doctors, nurses, and transient patients would have a temporary home. Today, Bahay Silungan accommodates up to 66 nurses and 14 transient patients.

<text>Charles Denis Sauter Bourbaki (22 April 1816, Pau – 22 September 1897, Bayonne) was a French general.

==Career==
Bourbaki was born at Pau in extreme southwestern France, the son of Greek colonel Constantin Denis Bourbaki, who died in the Greek War of Independence in 1827. He was educated at the Prytanée National Militaire, entered École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, and in 1836 joined the &quot;Zouaves&quot; (light infantry), becoming lieutenant of the Foreign Legion in 1838 and &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King Louis Philippe. 

=== Early commands ===
It was in the African expedition that Bourbaki first came to the fore. In 1842 he was captain in the &quot;Zouaves&quot;; 1847, colonel of the &quot;Turcos&quot;; in 1850, lieutenant-colonel of the 1st &quot;Zouaves&quot;; 1851, colonel; 1854, brigadier-general. In the Crimean War he commanded a portion of the Algerian troops; and at the Alma, Inkerman and Sevastopol Bourbaki&#x27;s name became famous. 

In 1857 he was appointed general of division, placed in command in 1859 at Lyon. His success in the war in Italy was second only to that of MacMahon, and in 1862 he was proposed as a candidate for the vacant Greek throne, but declined the proffered honour. 

=== Imperial Guard ===
In 1870 the Emperor Napoleon III entrusted Bourbaki with the command of the Imperial Guard, and he played an important part in the fighting around Metz. His conduct at the Battle of Gravelotte in August 1870 was questioned because, while the Prussians were exhausted from the fighting, and the French were poised to mount a counter-attack, Bourbaki refused to commit the reserves of the French Imperial Guard to the battle because he considered it a defeat.

A curious incident of the siege of Metz, during the Franco-Prussian War, is connected with Bourbaki&#x27;s name. A certain Edmond Régnier, a French businessman with no political background or connections, appeared at Hastings on the 21 September to seek an interview with the refugee empress Eugénie, and failing to obtain this he managed to get from the young Prince Imperial a signed photograph with a message to the emperor Napoleon. This he used, by means of a safe-conduct from Bismarck, as credentials to Marshal Bazaine, to whom he presented himself at Metz, telling him on the empress&#x27;s alleged authority that peace was about to be signed and that either Marshal Canrobert or General Bourbaki was to go to Hastings for the purpose. 

Bourbaki at once went to England, with Prussian connivance, as though he had an official mission, only to discover from the empress at Hastings that a trick had been played on him. As soon as he could manage he returned to France but was refused re-entrance into Metz on a technicality, because his Prussian-provided passport was outdated by a few days.

=== Armée de l&#x27;Est ===

Bourbaki offered his services to Léon Gambetta, a lawyer and republican politician who had proclaimed the Third French Republic in September 1870. Bourbaki was given the command of the Northern Army, but was recalled on 10 November and transferred to the Army of the Loire. In command of the hastily trained and ill-equipped Army of the East, Bourbaki made an attempt to raise the siege of Belfort, which, after an initial victory in the Battle of Villersexel ended in the defeat of the French in the three-day battle of the Lisaine. 

Other German forces under Prussian Field Marshal Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel now closed upon Bourbaki, and he was eventually driven over the Swiss frontier with a remnant of his forces. His troops were in desperate condition, owing to lack of food; and out of 150,000 men under him when he started, only 87,000 men with 12,000 horses escaped into Switzerland. They crossed the western border of Switzerland at Les Verrières, Sainte-Croix, Vallorbe and in the Vallée de Joux at the beginning of February 1871. They were disarmed and detained for six weeks before being repatriated in March. This episode is memorialized in the Bourbaki Panorama, a large panoramic painting now in Lucerne, Switzerland.

Rather than submit to the humiliation of a probable surrender, Bourbaki had delegated his functions to General Justin Clinchant on 26 January 1871, and tried to commit suicide that night. He fired a pistol at his forehead, but the bullet somehow &quot;flattened as if against a cast-iron plate&quot; and his life was saved. General Clinchant carried Bourbaki into Switzerland, where he recovered sufficiently to return to France.

In July 1871, he again took the command at Lyon where he subsequently became military governor.

=== Later service ===
In 1881, owing to his political opinions, he was placed on the retired list. In 1885 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the French Senate.

<text>Justin Clinchant (; 24 December 1820, Thiaucourt-Regniéville – 20 March 1881) was a French Army general of the 19th century.

==Biography==
Clinchant entered the army from St Cyr in 1841.

From 1847 to 1852 Clinchant was employed in the Algerian campaigns, and in 1854 and 1855 in the Crimea. At the assault on the Malakoff (8 September 1855) he greatly distinguished himself at the head of a battalion. During the 1859 campaign he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and as a colonel he served in the French intervention in Mexico. He was made general of brigade in 1866.

At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Clinchant led a brigade of the Army of the Rhine. His troops were amongst those shut up in Metz, and he passed into captivity, but soon escaped. The Government of National Defense made him general of division and put him at the head of the 20th corps of the Army of the East. He was under Bourbaki during the campaign of the Jura, and after Bourbaki attempted to commit suicide he succeeded to the command (23 January 1871). He was intercepted by the German Army under Von Manteuffel in an attempt at retreat, and thus driven with 84,000 men over the Swiss frontier at Pontarlier.

In 1871 Clinchant commanded the Fifth Army Corps of the Army of Versailles operating against the Commune. In 1879, he was appointed military governor of Paris. He held that position when he died in 1881.

<doc id="192989" wikidata="Q261585" url="?curid=192989" title="Big Rip">
<text>In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a hypothetical cosmological model concerning the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the matter of the universe, from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, and even spacetime itself, is progressively torn apart by the expansion of the universe at a certain time in the future, until distances between particles will infinitely increase.

According to the standard model of cosmology, the scale factor of the universe is accelerating, and, in the future era of cosmological constant dominance, will increase exponentially. But this expansion is similar for every moment of time (hence the exponential law—the expansion of a local volume is the same number of times over the same time interval), and is characterized by an unchanging, small Hubble constant, effectively ignored by any bound material structures. By contrast, in the Big Rip scenario the Hubble constant increases to infinity in a finite time. According to recent studies, the universe is set for a constant expansion and heat death, because the equation of state parameter &quot;w&quot; = −1.

The possibility of sudden rip singularity occurs only for hypothetical matter (phantom energy) with implausible physical properties.

==Overview==
The truth of the hypothesis relies on the type of dark energy present in our universe. The type that could prove this hypothesis is a constantly increasing form of dark energy known as phantom energy. If the dark energy in the universe increases without limit, it could overcome all forces that hold the universe together. The key value is the equation of state parameter &quot;w&quot;, the ratio between the dark energy pressure and its energy density. If −1 &lt; &quot;w&quot; &lt; 0, the expansion of the universe tends to accelerate, but the dark energy tends to dissipate over time, and the Big Rip does not happen. Phantom energy has &quot;w&quot; &lt; −1, which means that its density increases as the universe expands.

A universe dominated by phantom energy is an accelerating universe, expanding at an ever-increasing rate. But this implies that the size of the observable universe and the cosmological event horizon is continually shrinking—the distance at which objects can influence an observer becomes ever closer, and the distance over which interactions can propagate becomes ever shorter. When the size of the horizon becomes smaller than any particular structure, no interaction by any of the fundamental forces can occur between the most remote parts of the structure, and the structure is &quot;ripped apart&quot;. The progression of time itself will stop. The model implies that after a finite time there will be a final singularity, called the &quot;Big Rip&quot;, in which the observable universe eventually reaches zero size and all distances diverge to infinite values.

The authors of this hypothesis, led by Robert R. Caldwell of Dartmouth College, calculate the time from the present to the Big Rip to be

}&lt;/math&gt;}}

where &quot;w&quot; is defined above, &quot;H&quot;0 is Hubble&#x27;s constant and &quot;Ω&quot;m is the present value of the density of all the matter in the universe.

Observations of galaxy cluster speeds by the Chandra X-ray Observatory seem to suggest the value of &quot;w&quot; is between approximately −0.907 and −1.075, meaning the Big Rip cannot be ruled out. Based on the above equation, if the observation determines that &quot;w&quot; is less than −1 but greater than or equal to −1.075, the Big Rip would occur in approximately 152 billion years at the earliest. More recent data from Planck mission indicates the value of &quot;w&quot; to be −1.028 (&amp;pm;0.031), pushing the earliest possible time of Big Rip to approximately 200 billion years into the future.

==Authors&#x27; example==
In their paper, the authors consider a hypothetical example with &quot;w&quot; = −1.5, &quot;H&quot;0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, and &quot;Ω&quot;m = 0.3, in which case the Big Rip would happen approximately 22 billion years from the present. In this scenario, galaxies would first be separated from each other about 200 million years before the Big Rip. About 60 million years before the Big Rip, galaxies would begin to disintegrate as gravity becomes too weak to hold them together. Planetary systems like the Solar System would become gravitationally unbound about three months before the Big Rip, and planets would fly off into the rapidly expanding universe. In the last minutes, stars and planets would be torn apart, and the now-dispersed atoms would be destroyed about 10−19 seconds before the end (the atoms will first be ionized as electrons fly off, followed by the dissociation of the atomic nuclei). At the time the Big Rip occurs, even spacetime itself would be ripped apart and the scale factor would be infinity.

==Observed universe==

Evidence indicates &quot;w&quot; to be very close to −1 in our universe, which makes &quot;w&quot; the dominating term in the equation. The closer &quot;w&quot; is to −1, the closer the denominator is to zero and the further the Big Rip is in the future. If &quot;w&quot; were exactly −1, the Big Rip could not happen, regardless of the values of &quot;H&quot;0 or &quot;Ω&quot;m.

According to the latest cosmological data available, the uncertainties are still too large to discriminate among the three cases &quot;w&quot; &lt; −1, &quot;w&quot; = −1, and &quot;w&quot; &gt; −1.

Moreover, it is nearly impossible to measure &quot;w&quot; to be exactly at −1 due to statistical fluctuations. This means that the measured value of &quot;w&quot; can be arbitrarily close to −1 but not exactly at −1, hence the earliest possible date of the Big Rip can be pushed back further with more accurate measurements but the Big Rip is very difficult to completely rule out.

<doc id="192990" wikidata="Q103955" url="?curid=192990" title="Gustav Stresemann">
<text>Gustav Ernst Stresemann (; 10 May 1878 – 3 October 1929) was a German statesman during the Weimar Republic who served as chancellor of Germany from August to November 1923 and as foreign minister from 1923 to 1929. His most notable achievement was the reconciliation between Germany and France, for which he and French Prime Minister Aristide Briand received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926. During a period of political instability and fragile, short-lived governments, Stresemann was seen at his death as &quot;the person who maintained the precarious balance of the political system.&quot;

Stresemann attended the University of Berlin and Leipzig University, where he studied political economy, history and international law and developed his vision of liberalism and nationalism, a combination of views that would define his political career. After obtaining his doctorate, Stresemann worked in trade associations before entering politics. In 1907, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as a deputy for the National Liberal Party. He lost his seat in 1912 but was re-elected two years later. During the First World War, he was a vocal advocate for German militarism and expansionism. Exempted from war service due to poor health, he gradually became the National Liberals&#x27; &quot;de facto&quot; leader before formally taking over the party in 1917. Germany&#x27;s defeat and the fall of the Hohenzollern monarchy came as a significant shock to Stresemann, forcing him to gradually reassess his previous positions. He founded the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP) and, despite his own monarchist beliefs, came to grudgingly accept Weimar democracy and became open to working with the centre and the left.

In August 1923, Stresemann was named chancellor and foreign minister of a grand coalition government. During his brief chancellorship, he abandoned the policy of passive resistance against the French-Belgian occupation of the Ruhr and introduced the Rentenmark in a (relatively successful) attempt to tame hyperinflation in the country. In November, Stresemann&#x27;s reshuffled government collapsed after the Social Democrats withdrew from the coalition. He resigned as chancellor following a vote of no confidence but remained as foreign minister in the new government led by Wilhelm Marx. His first major diplomatic success was the 1924 Dawes Plan, which reduced Germany&#x27;s overall reparations commitment. It was followed by the Locarno Treaties in 1925, which confirmed Germany&#x27;s postwar western borders, guaranteed peace with France, and led to Germany&#x27;s admission to the League of Nations a year later. Stresemann also moved to improve relations with the Soviet Union through the 1926 Treaty of Berlin. In 1928, he oversaw Germany&#x27;s participation in the Kellogg–Briand Pact, in which the signatory states promised not to use war to resolve international conflicts.

Amid failing health, Stresemann successfully negotiated the Young Plan which sought to further reduce German reparations payments. He died in October 1929 after a series of strokes at the age of 51.

==Early years==
Stresemann was born on 10 May 1878 at 66 Köpenicker Straße in southeast Berlin, the youngest of seven children. His father worked as a beer bottler and distributor, and also ran a small bar out of the family home, as well as renting rooms for extra money. The family was lower middle class, but relatively well-off for the neighbourhood, and had sufficient funds to provide Gustav with a high-quality education. Stresemann was an excellent student, particularly excelling in German literature and poetry. At the age of 16, he joined the Andreas Gymnasium to study. His parents brought him up to have an interest in books – he was especially passionate about history, with his teacher, Mr. Wolff, commenting that he had an &quot;almost sickly taste in history&quot;. He took an interest in Napoleon and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whom he later wrote about in his work (&quot;Goethe and Napoleon: a Discourse&quot;). His mother, Mathilde, died in 1895. From December 1895, he wrote &quot;Berlin letters&quot; for the newspaper , often talking about politics and targeting Prussian conservatives. In an essay written when he left school, he noted that he would have enjoyed becoming a teacher, but he would only have been qualified to teach languages or the natural sciences, which were not his primary areas of interest. Due to this, he enrolled in university.

In April 1897, Stresemann enrolled at the University of Berlin, where he was convinced by a businessman to study political economy instead of literature. During his university years, Stresemann became active in the Burschenschaften movement of student fraternities and became editor, in April 1898, of the &quot;Allgemeine Deutsche Universitäts-Zeitung&quot;, a newspaper run by Konrad Kuster, a leader in the liberal portion of the Burschenschaften. His editorials for the paper were often political and dismissed most of the contemporary political parties as broken in one way or another. In his early writings, he set out views that combined liberalism with strident nationalism, a combination that would dominate his views for the rest of his life. In 1898, Stresemann left the University of Berlin, transferring to the University of Leipzig so that he could pursue a doctorate. He studied history and international law and took literature courses. Influenced by Martin Kriele, he also took courses in economics. In March 1899, he stopped being an editor for the . He completed his studies in January 1901, submitting a thesis on the bottled beer industry in Berlin, which received a relatively high grade but was a subject of mockery from colleagues. Stresemann&#x27;s doctoral supervisor was the economist Karl Bücher. 

In 1902, Stresemann founded the Saxon Manufacturers&#x27; Association. In 1903 he married Käte Kleefeld (1883–1970), daughter of a wealthy Jewish Berlin businessman, and the sister of Kurt von Kleefeld, the last person in Germany to be ennobled (in 1918). At that time he was also a member of Friedrich Naumann&#x27;s National-Social Association. In 1906 he was elected to the Dresden town council. Though he had initially worked in trade associations, Stresemann soon became a leader of the National Liberal Party in Saxony. In 1907, he was elected to the Reichstag, where he soon became a close associate of party chairman . However, his support of expanded social welfare programs did not sit well with some of the party&#x27;s more conservative members, and he lost his post in the party&#x27;s executive committee in 1912. Later that year he lost both his Reichstag and town council seats. He returned to business and founded the German-American Economic Association. In 1914 he returned to the Reichstag. He was exempted from war service due to poor health. With Bassermann kept away from the Reichstag by either illness or military service, Stresemann soon became the National Liberals&#x27; &quot;de facto&quot; leader. After Bassermann&#x27;s death in 1917, Stresemann succeeded him as the party leader.

==World War I==
Prior to the war, Stresemann was associated with the left wing of the National Liberals. He believed in the maintenance of a balance of power between the British Empire, the United States, and Germany, the countries which he believed would be the world&#x27;s economic superpowers. Yet he also supported the Anglo-German naval arms race, believing that the expansion of the Imperial German Navy was necessary to protect German international trade.

During World War I, he gradually moved to the right, expressing his support of the Hohenzollern monarchy and Germany&#x27;s expansionist goals. He believed that Germany would need to annex Belgium, parts of north-east France, &quot;extensive&quot; lands in Eastern Europe and the French protectorate in Morocco in order to economically compete with the United States in the future. He was a vocal proponent of unrestricted submarine warfare. However, he still favoured an expansion of the social welfare programme and also supported an end to the restrictive Prussian three-class franchise. In 1916, he visited Constantinople and learned about the extent of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Armenian genocide. Stresemann nevertheless agreed to the Turks&#x27; demand to recall of the German ambassador, Paul Wolff Metternich, and accused him of being too sympathetic to Armenians.

The collapse of the German Empire after its defeat in World War I and the German revolution of 1918–1919 drove Stresemann into a mental and physical breakdown, which shocked him into totally abandoning his earlier militarism and annexationism. When the Allied powers&#x27; peace terms became known, which included a crushing burden of reparations for the war, Constantin Fehrenbach, president of the Weimar National Assembly, denounced them and claimed &quot;the will to break the chains of slavery would be implanted&quot; into a generation of Germans. Stresemann said of this speech: &quot;He was inspired in that hour by God to say what was felt by the German people. His words, spoken under Fichte&#x27;s portrait, the final words of which merged into &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über alles&quot;, made it an unforgettably solemn hour. There was in that sense a kind of uplifting grandeur. The impression left on all was tremendous.&quot;

After the war, Stresemann was interested in joining the German Democratic Party, which was formed from a merger of the Progressive People&#x27;s Party with the left wing of the National Liberals. He wanted to be a part of a united post-war liberal party, but the leaders of the merger talks made it clear that they did not want anyone who had been an aggressive annexationist during the war. He then brought together the right wing of the old National Liberal Party and some of the Progressives into the German People&#x27;s Party (, DVP), with himself as chairman. Most of its support came from the educated and property-owning classes, with considerable financial aid from heavy industry. Initially Stresemann and the DVP opposed the Weimar Republic and supported a restoration of the monarchy. The DVP platform promoted Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies, and hostility to communism and the Social Democrats.

The DVP was initially seen, along with the German National People&#x27;s Party, as part of the &quot;national opposition&quot; to the Weimar Republic, particularly for its hesitant acceptance of democracy and sympathetic attitude towards the Freikorps and the Kapp Putsch in 1920. Beginning in 1919, Stresemann emphasized that Germany should try to regain its great-power status by leveraging the continued global economic influence and creditworthiness of its industry, pursuing peaceful economic expansion, and establishing friendly relations with the United States. By late 1920, Stresemann gradually moved to cooperation with the parties of the left and centre — possibly in reaction to political murders like that of Walther Rathenau. However, he remained a monarchist at heart.

==Weimar Republic==
===Chancellor 1923===

On 13 August 1923, Stresemann was appointed chancellor and foreign minister of a grand coalition government in the so-called &quot;year of crises&quot; (1923). In social policy, a new system of binding arbitration was introduced in October 1923 in which an outside arbitrator had the final say in industrial disputes. 

On 26 September 1923, Stresemann announced the end to the passive resistance against the occupation of the Ruhr by the French and Belgians, in tandem with an Article 48 (of the Weimar Constitution) state of emergency proclamation by President Friedrich Ebert that lasted until February 1924. In October 1923, when the Communist Party of Germany entered the Social Democratic-led governments of Saxony and Thuringia with hidden revolutionary intentions, Stresemann used a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot; to send troops into the two states to remove the Communists from the governments. By this time, Stresemann was convinced that accepting the Republic and reaching an understanding with the Allies on the reparations issue was the only way for Germany to gain the breathing room it needed to rebuild its battered economy. He also wished to see the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Allied-occupied Rhineland, as he wrote to Wilhelm, the former German Crown Prince on 23 July 1923: &quot;The most important objective of German politics is the liberation of German territory from French and Belgian occupation. First, we must remove the strangler from our throat&quot;.

Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic reached its peak in November 1923. Since Germany was unable to pay the idled workers in the occupied Ruhr any other way, more and more money was printed, which finally led to hyperinflation. The Stresemann government introduced a new currency, the Rentenmark, to end hyperinflation. Although Stresemann, like nearly every other German politician, cursed the Treaty of Versailles as a dictated peace, he had come to believe that Germany would never win relief from its terms unless it made a good-faith effort to fulfil them. To his mind, this would convince the Allies that the reparations bill was truly beyond Germany&#x27;s capacity. The effort paid off; the Allies began to take a look at reforming the reparations scheme.

In early November 1923, partly because of the reaction to the overthrowing of the SPD/KPD governments in Saxony and Thuringia, the Social Democrats withdrew from his reshuffled government and, after he lost a confidence vote on 23 November 1923, Stresemann and his cabinet resigned.

===Foreign minister 1923–1929===

Stresemann remained as foreign minister in the government of his successor, Wilhelm Marx from the Centre Party, and for the rest of his life in seven additional successive governments ranging from the centre-right to the centre-left. His first notable achievement was the Dawes Plan of 1924, which reduced Germany&#x27;s overall reparations commitment, reorganized the Reichsbank and ended the occupation of the Ruhr. With President Friedrich Ebert, he secured the appointment of Hjalmar Schacht as the new president of the Reichsbank. Schacht implemented the Dawes Plan and managed the successful effort to end hyperinflation, despite his reservations about Germany&#x27;s growing foreign debt under Stresemann&#x27;s economic policies. The successful negotiation of the Dawes Plan provided hope for Stresemann&#x27;s foreign policy strategy emphasizing Germany&#x27;s remaining economic soft power, since the co-author of the plan, Owen D. Young, was the chairman of General Electric and a major trading partner with the German firm AEG. 

After Sir Austen Chamberlain became British Foreign Secretary, he sought a British guarantee of Germany&#x27;s post-war border with France and Belgium, since a prospective Anglo-American guarantee had become moot due to the United States&#x27; failure to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Stresemann later wrote: &quot;Chamberlain had never been our friend. His first act was to attempt to restore the old Entente through a three-power alliance of England, France and Belgium, directed against Germany. German diplomacy faced a catastrophic situation.&quot;

Stresemann conceived the idea that Germany would guarantee her western borders and pledge never to invade Belgium and France again. Germany was in no position at the time to attack, as Stresemann wrote to the ex-Crown Prince: &quot;The renunciation of a military conflict with France has only a theoretical significance, in so far as there is no possibility of a war with France.&quot; Stresemann negotiated the Locarno Treaties with Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium. On the third day of negotiations, Stresemann told French Foreign Secretary Aristide Briand of the concessions Germany wanted in order to be able to have something concrete to show the sceptical German public in exchange for the Locarno Pact. The concessions included a reduction in the number of occupation troops in the Rhineland, shortening the length of the occupation and no permanent inspection of German disarmament. As Stresemann recorded, Briand &quot;almost fell off his sofa. ... He was astonished at my boldness, which indeed he thought had gone too far. If my views were to be accepted, the Treaty of Versailles might as well cease to exist.&quot; Nevertheless, Briand expressed his understanding. After signing the Locarno Treaties, he indicated that they &quot;should consider everything for the realization for which we hoped. ... In a general way, Dr. Stresemann’s list did not &quot;a priori&quot; seem impossible of realization.&quot; 

The Treaties were signed in October 1925 at Locarno. Germany officially recognized its post-World War I western border for the first time, guaranteed peace with France and Belgium and pledged to observe the demilitarization of the Rhineland. If the terms of the treaty were broken, the signatories (including Britain) promised to come to the aid of the country against which the violation had taken place. Stresemann was not willing to conclude a similar treaty with the Second Polish Republic: &quot;There will be no Locarno of the east&quot; he said in 1925. However, as part of the Locarno Treaties, he signed arbitration agreements with both Poland and the First Czechoslovak Republic to ensure that any future conflict would be settled by impartial arbitration rather than by the use of force. By 1929 his policy was “detente with Poland” and strengthening good economic relationships.

After this reconciliation with the Versailles powers, Stresemann moved to improve relations with the Soviet Union. He said to Nikolay Krestinsky in June 1925, as recorded in his diary: &quot;I had said I would not come to conclude a treaty with Russia so long as our political situation in the other direction was not cleared up, as I wanted to answer the question whether we had a treaty with Russia in the negative.&quot; The Treaty of Berlin signed in April 1926 reaffirmed and strengthened the Treaty of Rapallo signed in 1922. Germany and the Soviet Union pledged neutrality in the event of an attack on the other by a third party for five years. 
In September 1926, as planned during the negotiations for the Locarno Treaties, Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as permanent member of the Executive Council. Stresemann was co-winner with Aristide Briand of the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize for their work on Locarno. Stresemann&#x27;s success owed much to his friendly personal character and his willingness to be pragmatic. He was close personal friends with many influential foreigners, most notably Aristide Briand.

Stresemann wrote to the ex-Crown Prince about how Germany could use its position in the League of Nations: &quot;All the questions which to-day preoccupy the German people can be transformed into as many vexations for the Entente by a skilful orator before the League of Nations.&quot; Since League resolutions had to be unanimous, Germany could gain concessions from other countries on modifications of the Polish border or political union with Austria, as other countries needed its vote. Germany could act as &quot;the spokesman of the whole German cultural community&quot;.

Germany signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact in August 1928. It renounced the use of violence to resolve international conflicts. Although Stresemann did not propose the pact, Germany&#x27;s adherence convinced many people that Weimar Germany was a Germany that could be reasoned with. This new insight was instrumental in the Young Plan of February 1929, which led to more reductions in German reparations payment.

Stresemann was not, however, in any sense pro-French. His main preoccupation was to free Germany from the burden of reparations payments to France, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. His strategy for this was to forge close economic ties with the United States. The U.S. was Germany&#x27;s main source of capital and raw materials, and one of Germany&#x27;s largest export markets for manufactured goods. Germany&#x27;s economic recovery was thus in the interests of the U.S., and gave the U.S. an incentive to help Germany resolve the reparations burden. The Dawes and Young Plans were the result of this strategy. New York bankers loaned large sums to Germany, which used the dollars to pay reparations to France and Britain, which in turn paid the war loans they owed to Washington. Stresemann also hoped to use the United States&#x27; new financial involvement in the German economy to incentivize the nation&#x27;s financial and political institutions to support reform of reparations. This paid off in 1928 when Federal Reserve Chairman Benjamin Strong supported the development of the Young Plan. Stresemann had a close relationship with Herbert Hoover, who was secretary of commerce in 1921–28 and president from 1929. This strategy worked remarkably well until it was derailed by the Great Depression after Stresemann&#x27;s death.
During his period in the foreign ministry, Stresemann came more and more to accept the Republic, which he had at first rejected. By the mid-1920s, having contributed much to a (temporary) consolidation of the feeble democratic order, Stresemann was regarded as a , (republican by reason), someone who accepted the Republic as the least of all evils but was in his heart still loyal to the monarchy. The conservative opposition criticized him for his supporting the Republic and fulfilling too willingly the demands of the Western powers. Along with Matthias Erzberger and others, he was attacked as a (&quot;fulfilment politician&quot;). Indeed, some of the more conservative members of his own People&#x27;s Party never really trusted him.

In 1925, when he first proposed an agreement with France, he made it clear that in doing so he intended to &quot;gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and [...] concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East&quot;. In the same year, while Poland was in a state of political and economic crisis, Stresemann began a trade war against the country. Stresemann hoped for an escalation of the Polish crisis, which would enable Germany to regain territories ceded to Poland after World War I, and he wanted Germany to gain a larger market for its products there. Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have &quot;prematurely&quot; restabilized the Polish economy. In response to a British proposal, Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London: &quot;[A] final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong.&quot; According to Stresemann&#x27;s letter, there should be no settlement &quot;until [Poland&#x27;s] economic and financial distress has reached an extreme stage and reduced the entire Polish body politic to a state of powerlessness&quot;. Stresemann hoped to recover formerly German territories in Greater Poland, Silesia and the Polish Corridor. Besides waging economic war on Poland, Stresemann also funded extensive propaganda efforts both in Germany and abroad.

According to historian Gordon Craig: No German statesman since Bismarck&#x27;s time had demonstrated, as brilliantly as he was to do, the ability to sense danger and to avoid it by seizing and retaining the initiative, the gift of maintaining perspective and a sense of relative values in the midst of a changing diplomatic situation, and the talent for being more stubborn than his partners in negotiation and for refusing to allow their importunities to force him to accept second-best solutions.

==Health decline and death==

In 1928, Stresemann&#x27;s poor health worsened after the mainstream national conservative parties lost seats to the SPD in the 1928 German federal election. He successfully negotiated a grand coalition government led by Chancellor Hermann Müller in which he remained foreign secretary, but he was weakened in doing so.

Stresemann&#x27;s Atlanticist foreign policy also began to show fractures after the Young Plan failed to reduce reparations annuities as far as hoped, or to establish a linkage between Allied war debts to the United States and German reparations payments. He seemed to win a victory when his friend Herbert Hoover won the 1928 United States presidential election, but Hoover&#x27;s administration enacted a protectionist trade policy to assist U.S. agriculture and signed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act. The new trade barriers lessened U.S. credit to Germany. 

Discontent with the Young Plan led to the growth of far-right movements rejecting liberal democracy such as the Nazi Party, with Stresemann weakening himself further by keeping the right wing of the DVP under control. Stresemann responded to worsening trans-Atlantic relations by pursuing negotiations for closer relations with the United Kingdom and France, and in 1929 he spoke positively of the idea of European integration to form a united political and economic counterweight against the United States. He died of a series of strokes on 3 October 1929 at the age of 51, before he could make any further diplomatic progress towards this idea. His death came just hours after convincing the Reichstag to accept the Young Plan. His gravesite is situated in the Luisenstadt Cemetery at Südstern in Berlin Kreuzberg, and includes work by the German sculptor Hugo Lederer.

Stresemann and his wife Käte had two sons, Wolfgang, who later became intendant of the Berlin Philharmonic, and Joachim Stresemann.

Stresemann was a Freemason initiated in the Masonic lodge Frederick the Great in Berlin in 1923. His Masonic membership was generally known to his contemporaries, and he was criticized by German nationalists as a &quot;lodge politician&quot;.

==Fashion==
Stresemann popularized the style of substituting a short dark lounge-suit jacket for a morning coat but otherwise wearing morning dress for men&#x27;s day wear. The look became so identified with Stresemann that such outfits are often called &quot;Stresemanns&quot;.

<text>The League of the Balkans was a quadruple alliance formed by a series of bilateral treaties concluded in 1912 between the Eastern Orthodox kingdoms of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro, and directed against the Ottoman Empire, which still controlled much of Southeastern Europe.

The Balkans had been in a state of turmoil since the early 1900s, with years of guerrilla warfare in Macedonia followed by the Young Turk Revolution, the protracted Bosnian Crisis, and several Albanian Uprisings. The outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 had further weakened the Ottomans and emboldened the Balkan states. Under Russian influence, Serbia and Bulgaria settled their differences and signed an alliance, which was originally directed against Austria-Hungary, on 13 March 1912, but by adding a secret chapter to it essentially redirected the alliance against the Ottoman Empire. Serbia then signed a mutual alliance with Montenegro, and Bulgaria did the same with Greece.

The League was victorious in the First Balkan War which broke out in October 1912, where it successfully seized control of almost all European Ottoman territories. After the victory, however, unresolved prior differences between the allies re-emerged over the division of the spoils, particularly Macedonia, leading to the effective break-up of the League, and soon after, on 16 June 1913, Bulgaria attacked her erstwhile allies, beginning the Second Balkan War.

== Background ==
After the Crimean War (1853–1856), Russia realised that the other Great Powers would spare no effort to prevent it from gaining access to the Mediterranean. In consequence, it started engineering an ambitious plan for indirect expansion through the creation of friendly and closely allied states under Russian patronage in the Balkan Peninsula. Instrumental to the policy was the emerging Panslavic movement, which henceforth formed the basis of Russian foreign policy up until the end of the tsarist regime in 1917. Working in this direction, following the victorious Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Russia managed to establish an autonomous Bulgarian state. Similarly, after saving Serbia from annihilation at the Ottoman&#x27; hands in 1876, Russia forced the Ottomans to accept a full independence and expanded Serbia two years later.

However, although both states acknowledged Russian patronage and protection, their conflicted national aspirations soon led to a series of hostile actions before and after the short war between them. With the antagonism of the European powers mounting, and smarting from her humiliation by the Austrians at the Bosnian Crisis, Russia sought to gain the upper hand by creating a Russophile &quot;Slavic block&quot; in the Balkans directed against Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans. Consequently, Russian diplomacy began pressuring the two countries, Serbia and Bulgaria, to reach a compromise and to form an alliance.

Apart from the Russian pressure upon Bulgaria and Serbia, another issue that triggered the formation of the League was the Albanian Uprising of 1911. The timetable of the negotiations between Serbia and Bulgaria indicates that progress paralleled the success of the Albanian revolt. In May 1912 the Albanians succeeded in taking Skopje and continued towards Monastir, forcing the Ottomans to recognise the autonomy of Albania in June 1912. That was considered catastrophic for Serbia; after its hopes of expansion to the north were thwarted by the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908, Serbia now found the last direction of possible expansion, the south, also closing by the creation of an Albanian Vilayet. The Serbs now wanted to stop the establishment of the Albanian state. On the other hand, Bulgaria used the Serbian anxiety to force Serbia to agree to significant concessions in regard to Vardar Macedonia.

Thus, the final agreement between the two countries stipulated that in the event of a victorious war against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the Kriva Palanka–Ohrid line. Serbia&#x27;s expansion was to be to the north of this line, including Kosovo, and west to the Adriatic coast, a territory including the northern half of modern Albania, giving Serbia access to the sea. In essence, Serbia was forced to exchange Macedonia for Albania, an issue that would play a key role in the eventual dissolution of the League in the spring of 1913, when the Great Powers insisted upon the creation of the Albanian state and denied Serbia its territorial gains in that direction.
Bulgaria, on its part, had held a long-term policy regarding the Ottomans since regaining independence during the Russo-Turkish War. After the successful coup d&#x27;état for the incorporation of Eastern Rumelia, Bulgaria had orchestrated a methodical scenario of indirect expansion through the creation, in the multi-ethnic Ottoman-held Macedonia (for many centuries an administrative rather than a nationalistic name), of a united, liberating and revolutionary organization, the IMRO, allegedly without national color. IMRO&#x27;s rhetoric claimed to be speaking generally for liberation on behalf of the &quot;Macedonian People&quot; and declared its anti-chauvinism. In fact, it was a Bulgarian-backed organization created with the secret agenda of facilitating the incorporation of Thrace (Eastern and Western) and Macedonia (Aegean and the Vardar) into a new autonomous state, as an intermediate step before unification with Bulgaria could take place in the same way as with Eastern Rumelia.

After initial success, Serbia and especially Greece realized the true purpose of IMRO and consequently, a vicious guerrilla war, the so-called Macedonian Struggle broke out between Bulgarian and Greek-backed armed groups within Ottoman Macedonia. The conflict ended only when the Young Turks movement came to power, promising reforms and equality of all Ottoman subjects regardless of religion or nationality. Bulgaria then turned to the more direct method of expansion through winning a war, building a large army for that purpose, and started to see itself as the &quot;Prussia of the Balkans&quot;. However, even so, it was clear that Bulgaria could not win a war against the Ottomans alone, and an alliance was necessary. By signing the military appendix to the original agreement Bulgaria aimed to use the Serbian army to seize most of Macedonia while concentrating her own army for the operations against Thrace with its major cities of Adrianople and Constantinople.

In Greece, army officers had revolted in August 1909 and secured the appointment of a progressive government under Eleftherios Venizelos, which they hoped would resolve the Cretan issue in Greece&#x27;s favour and reverse their defeat of 1897 at the hands of the Ottomans. In the discussions that led Greece to join the League, Bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on the distribution of territorial gains unlike the deal with Serbia over Vardar Macedonia. The reason was Bulgaria&#x27;s diplomatic policy of pushing Serbia into an agreement limiting its access to Macedonia and at the same time refusing any such agreement with Greece. Having low regard for the Greek Army&#x27;s military effectiveness, the Bulgarian leadership estimated that according to the military plans, their limited forces that had been deployed to the Macedonian theatre would be able to occupy the larger part of the region and the important port city of Thessaloniki before the Greeks.

The entry of Greece to the League, however, was essential for the allies since Greece, alone among the Balkan states in possessing a major fleet, could preclude the mass transfer of Ottoman reinforcements from Asia directly into Europe by sea. As the Greek ambassador to Sofia had put it during the negotiations that led to Greece&#x27;s entry in the League, &quot;Greece can provide 600,000 men for the war effort. 200,000 men in the field, and the fleet will be able to stop 400,000 men being landed by Turkey between Salonika and Gallipoli.&quot;

Montenegro, a relatively small country but a close ally of Serbia, was considered a second-class participant. It took the invitation to the insistence of Serbia more as a favour since it had limited local aspirations over the Sanjak and city of Shkodër, both in northern Albania.

Another fact that helped the formation of the League was the evident inefficiency of the Ottoman Army. The Ottomans were at war with Italy for a year (29 September 1911 to 18 October 1912) over Libya after Italy had launched an invasion of Tripolitania. Although the Italians made little progress and Ottoman resistance, aided by the Libyans, proved stiffer than expected, the war exhausted the Ottoman state. In addition, the Italian occupation of the Greek-inhabited Dodecanese Islands served as a warning for Greece of the consequences of staying out of a future war against the Ottomans.

== Reaction of Great Powers ==
These developments did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire, which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, each of them unofficially took a different diplomatic approach because of their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventative effect of the common official warning was canceled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities:

* Russia was a prime mover in the establishment of the League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against Russia&#x27;s rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories in which Russia had long-held ambitions and over which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward in participating in the upcoming First World War against the Central Powers.
* France, not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the League and firmly informed its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the upcoming Balkan conflict.
* The British Empire, although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging the Greek entry into the League to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged the Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace and preferred it to be Bulgarian than Russian, despite the assurances that Britain had given to the Russians in regard of their expansion there.
* Austria-Hungary, struggling for an exit from the Adriatic and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation&#x27;s expansion in the area. At the same time, Austria-Hungary had its own internal problems with the significant Slavic populations that campaigned against the German–Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria&#x27;s Slavic subjects.
* Germany, already heavily involved in the internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Ottomans, but in its effort to win Bulgaria for the Central Powers and seeing the inevitability of Ottoman disintegration, it was playing with the idea to replace the Balkan positions of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in its San Stefano borders, an idea that was based on the German origin of the Bulgarian king and his anti-Russian sentiments.

For the Balkan League, the opportunity was too good to be missed, as the Ottoman Empire was weak and riddled with internal strife. The allied governments intensified their military and diplomatic preparations. During the last days of September, the Balkan states and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. The first state to declare war was Montenegro, on October 8, 1912, starting the First Balkan War. The other three states, after issuing an ultimatum to the Porte on October 13, declared war on Turkey on October 17.

== Aftermath ==

In the resulting war, the combined Balkan armies effectively destroyed Ottoman power in Europe in a series of victories. However, the League&#x27;s triumph was short-lived. The antagonisms between the Balkan states still persisted, and after the successful conclusion of the First Balkan War, they resurfaced, especially over the partition of Macedonia. Mounting tensions effectively tore the League apart, and the Second Balkan War broke out when Bulgaria, confident of a quick victory, attacked its former allies Serbia and Greece. The Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counterattacked, penetrating into Bulgaria.

The Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Romania took advantage of the situation and invaded Bulgaria too. The subsequent peace left Bulgaria with gains in territory but led to the loss of Eastern Thrace to the Ottomans and most of Macedonia to the Greeks. Defeat turned Bulgaria into its participation in the First World War on the side of the Central Powers since its Balkan enemies (Serbia, Greece, and Romania) were involved in the war on the side of the Entente.

During the war, King George I of Greece was assassinated in Thessaloniki by Alexandros Schinas. That generated a shift in the Greek foreign policy from clearly pro-Entente to neutrality, since the new king, Constantine I, unlike his father and his popular prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, was pro-German and tried to keep the country neutral in the upcoming world war. With the outbreak of war and the Entente&#x27;s intervention in Macedonia, the conflict between king and the prime minister steadily deteriorated. That eventually led to the National Schism, which greatly contributed to the loss of the next war against Kemalist Turkey in Asia Minor, and dominated Greek politics for over a half of a century.

The outcome of the Balkan Wars caused a permanent break-up of the Russo-Bulgarian alliance and left Serbia and Montenegro as the only allies of Russia in the critical region.

<text>Guillaume Victor Émile Augier (; 17 September 182025 October 1889) was a French dramatist. He was the thirteenth member to occupy seat 1 of the on 31 March 1857.

==Biography==
Augier was born at Valence, Drôme, the grandson of Pigault Lebrun, and belonged to the well-to-do bourgeoisie in spirit as well as by birth. After a good education and legal training, he wrote a play in two acts and in verse, &quot;La Ciguë&quot; (1844), which was refused at the Théâtre Français, but produced with as considerable success at the Odéon. This settled his career. 
From then on, at fairly regular intervals, either alone or in collaboration with other writers—Jules Sandeau, Eugène Marin Labiche, Édouard Foussier—he produced plays such as &quot;Le Fils de Giboyer&quot; (1862)—which was regarded as an attack on the clerical party in France, and was surely brought out by the direct intervention of the emperor. 
His last comedy, &quot;Les Fourchambault&quot;, belongs to the year 1879. After that date he wrote no more, restrained by the fear of producing inferior work.

He died at his home at Croissy-sur-Seine.

===Career===
Augier described his own life as &quot;without incident&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;Aventurière&quot; (1848), the first of his important works, already shows a deviation from romantic ideals; and in the &quot;Mariage d&#x27;Olympe&quot; (1855), the courtesan is shown as she is, not glorified as in Dumas&#x27;s &quot;Dame aux Camélias&quot;. 
In &quot;Gabrielle&quot; (1849), the husband, not the lover, is the sympathetic character. 
Augier provided the libretto for the first opera composed by Charles Gounod, &quot;Sapho&quot; (1851). In this version of the story a courtesan Glycère is the perfidious villainess, and the self-sacrificing title character is wholly heterosexual, not a &quot;sapphist&quot;. In the &quot;Lionnes pauvres&quot; (1858) the wife who sells her favours comes under the lash. 
Greed of gold, social moralization, ultramontanism, lust of power, these are satirized &quot;Les Effrontés&quot; (1861), &quot;Le Fils de Giboyer&quot; (1862), &quot;La Contagion&quot; announced under the title of &quot;Le Baron d&#x27;Estrigaud&quot; (1866), &quot;Lions et renards&quot; (1869)—which, with &quot;Le Gendre de Monsieur Poirier&quot; (1854), written in collaboration with &quot;Jules Sandeau&quot;, reach the high-water mark of Augier&#x27;s art; in &quot;Philiberte&quot; (1853), he produced a graceful and delicate drawing-room comedy; and in &quot;Jean de Thommeray&quot;, acted in 1873 after the great reverses of 1870, the regenerating note of patriotism rings high and clear.

His last two dramas, &quot;Madame Caverlet&quot; (1876) and &quot;Les Fourchambault&quot; (1879), are problem plays. But it would be unfair to suggest that Augier was a mere preacher. He was a moralist in the same sense in which the term can be applied to Molière and the great dramatists. Nor does the interest of dramas depend on elaborate plot. It springs from character. His men and women are real, several of them typical. Augier&#x27;s first drama, &quot;La Ciguë&quot;, belongs to a time (1844) when romantic drama was on the wane; and his almost elusively domestic range of subject scarcely lends itself to lyric bursts of pure poetry. His verse, if not that of a great poet, has excellent dramatic qualities, while the prose of his prose dramas is admirable for directness, alertness, sinew and a large and effective wit.

<text>Alexander James Harvey (5 February 1935 – 4 February 1982) was a Scottish rock and blues musician. Although his career spanned almost three decades, he is best remembered as the frontman of the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, with whom he built a reputation as an exciting live performer during the era of glam rock in the 1970s.

==Biography==

Harvey was born and raised in the working-class Kinning Park district of Glasgow (also reported as the Gorbals in the 2009 STV show &quot;The Greatest Scot&quot;). By his own account, he worked in a number of jobs, from carpentry to being a waiter at a restaurant to carving gravestones, before finding success in music. He first began performing in skiffle groups in 1954. On Friday, 20 May 1960, at the Town Hall in Alloa, Alex Harvey and his Big Beat Band opened for Johnny Gentle and His Group, &quot;His Group&quot; being the Beatles (John, Paul, George, Stuart Sutcliffe and Tommy Moore), on this the opening night – and biggest audience – of the Beatles&#x27; seven-date tour of Scotland with Gentle.

His musical roots were in Dixieland jazz and skiffle music, which enjoyed considerable popularity in Britain during the late 1950s. From 1958 until 1965, he was the leader of Alex Harvey&#x27;s Big Soul Band, playing blues and rock and roll songs and spending considerable time touring in the United Kingdom and Germany. He also won a competition that sought &quot;Scotland&#x27;s answer to Tommy Steele&quot;. Harvey became strongly identified with British rhythm and blues music, although he was equally able to play rock songs.

After leaving the Big Soul Band, he briefly tried for a solo career but with little success. By 1967, he found a positive direction for his career when he became a member of the pit band in the London stage production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. This band recorded the live album &quot;Hair Rave Up&quot;, which contained Harvey originals and other songs not from the stage show. In 1970, Harvey formed Rock Workshop with Ray Russell; their first, self-titled album contained an early version of &quot;Hole in Her Stocking&quot;, later to appear on &quot;Framed&quot;. Harvey remained with &quot;Hair&quot; for five years.

Harvey was instrumental in the formation of the band Stone the Crows by introducing his younger brother Leslie &quot;Les&quot; Harvey to singer Maggie Bell. Also in Stone the Crows was bassist James Dewar, who later worked with Robin Trower. Les Harvey was fatally electrocuted in a freak accident while performing with the band in 1972.

==The Sensational Alex Harvey Band==
In 1972, Harvey formed the Sensational Alex Harvey Band (often shortened to SAHB) with guitarist Zal Cleminson, bassist Chris Glen, and cousins Hugh (keyboards) and Ted McKenna (drums), all previous members of progressive rock act Tear Gas. 

SAHB produced a succession of highly regarded albums and tours throughout the 1970s. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band had top 40 hits in Britain with the single &quot;Delilah&quot;, a cover version of the Tom Jones hit, which reached number seven in 1975, and also with &quot;The Boston Tea Party&quot; in June 1976. The band never achieved acclaim in the United States the way it did in Great Britain, but it had a cult following in certain US cities, especially Cleveland, where the group first played at the Agora Ballroom in December 1974. Thanks to airplay from WMMS, songs like &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;The Faith Healer&quot; became very popular. Cleveland remained a city where the Sensational Alex Harvey Band had a devoted following. However, they were unable to replicate that popularity in most other US cities.

After Harvey left the group in 1976, the other members continued as SAHB (Without Alex) producing the album &quot;Fourplay&quot;. Harvey re-joined the group for 1978&#x27;s &quot;Rock Drill&quot;. SAHB with Alex toured the UK in Autumn 1981 with the last gig at Workington&#x27;s Carnegie Theatre on 1 November.

==Single, solo albums and death==
After he left the band for good, he released two more solo albums and went on tour with his solo band from 1979. On 4 February 1982, returning from performances in Belgium, Harvey died from a heart attack, a day before his 47th birthday.

==Personal life==
Married twice, first to Mary Martin, with whom he had a son; second to Trudy, with whom he had a son.

Harvey was a Master Mason in Lodge Union, No. 332, in the City of Glasgow, in Scotland. He was initiated on 22 June 1955 and was passed to the Second Degree in Freemasonry on 24 August 1955. He received his Third Degree on 16 November 1955.

==Legacy==
In 2002, a biography of Harvey by John Neil Munro was published: &quot;The Sensational Alex Harvey&quot;. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band were voted the fifth greatest Scottish band of all time in a 2005 survey. On 4 February 2012, a rowan tree was planted in memory of Harvey on the grounds of the People&#x27;s Palace museum in Glasgow. The tree was planted by Alex Harvey Junior and the remaining members of the band. A limited edition book entitled &quot;Alex Harvey: Last of the Teenage Idols&quot;, photographed by Janet Macoska and edited by Martin Kielty was released for the 30th anniversary of his death.

Two novels by Christopher Brookmyre, &quot;The Sacred Art of Stealing&quot; and &quot;A Snowball in Hell&quot;, reference SAHB&#x27;s work.

On 18 March 2016, Universal Music released a 14-disc box set of Harvey&#x27;s work, entitled &quot;The Last of the Teenage Idols&quot;. This multi-disc set was the most comprehensive compilation of Harvey&#x27;s music to date, including many rare and out-of-print titles.

<text>The Big Brother Awards (BBAs) are humorous awards that recognize &quot;the government and private sector organizations ... which have done the most to threaten personal privacy&quot;. They are named after the George Orwell character Big Brother from the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. They are awarded yearly to authorities, companies, organizations, and persons that it is asserted have been acting particularly and consistently to threaten or violate people&#x27;s privacy, or disclosed people&#x27;s personal data to third parties.

The awards are intended to draw public attention to privacy issues and related alarming trends in society, especially in data privacy. The contest is organized by a loose coalition of nongovernmental organizations, including Iuridicum Remedium, Privacy International, and others.

The United States&#x27; most recently hosted its Big Brother Awards – also known as the Orwell Awards or simply the Orwells – on 14 April 2005 in Seattle, Washington. They had previously been hosted in Berkeley, California, on 12 April 2004; New York City on 3 April 2003; San Francisco, California, on 18 April 2002; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 7 March 2001. The first annual US Big Brother Awards were made at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in Washington, D.C., on 7 April 1999, the 50th anniversary of the publication of Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The awards were made by Simon Davies, managing director of the London-based Privacy International to recognize &quot;the government and private sector organizations which have done the most to invade personal privacy in the United States.&quot; The awards were given in five categories: Greatest Corporate Invader, Lifetime Menace, Most Invasive Program, People&#x27;s Choice, and Worst Public Official.

<text>The Battle of Olustee or Battle of Ocean Pond was fought in Baker County, Florida on February 20, 1864, during the American Civil War. It was the largest battle fought in Florida during the war.

Union General Truman Seymour had landed troops at Jacksonville, aiming chiefly to disrupt Confederate food supply. Meeting little resistance, he proceeded towards the state capital of Tallahassee, against orders, assuming that he would face only the small Florida militia. Confederates in Charleston sent reinforcements under General Alfred H. Colquitt and the two armies collided near Ocean Pond in Olustee.

The Union forces were repulsed and retreated to Jacksonville. Some were garrisoned there to occupy territory. Other troops were transferred to other, more active, areas where they were needed.

== Background ==

From the start of the war, Florida primarily served as a supplier of essential provisions, particularly beef and salt, for the Confederacy. The importance of these supplies escalated significantly after the fall of Vicksburg, as it severed the eastern part of the Confederacy from beef and supplies originating west of the Mississippi. Additionally, Florida became a refuge for an increasing number of Confederate deserters and pro-Union Floridians, which seemingly made it a more vulnerable target for raids and assaults by Union forces.

On January 13, 1864, President Lincoln wrote to Major General Quincy A. Gillmore, commander of the Union&#x27;s Department of the South at Hilton Head, South Carolina, asking that he take steps to &quot;reconstruct a loyal State government in Florida.&quot; By the following month, Gillmore ordered an expedition into Florida to secure Union enclaves, sever Confederate supply routes, and recruit black soldiers. Brigadier General Truman Seymour, in command of the expedition, landed troops at Jacksonville, in an area already seized by the Union in March 1862. Seymour&#x27;s forces made several raids into the northeast and north-central Florida. During these raids, he met little resistance, seized several Confederate camps, captured small bands of troops and artillery pieces, and liberated slaves. But, Seymour was under orders from Gillmore not to advance deep into the state.

Seymour&#x27;s preparations at Hilton Head had concerned the Confederate command in the key port city of Charleston, South Carolina. General P. G. T. Beauregard, correctly guessed Seymour&#x27;s objective was Florida and believed these Union actions posed enough of a threat for him to detach reinforcements under Georgian Alfred H. Colquitt to bolster Florida&#x27;s defenses and stop Seymour. Colquitt arrived in time to reinforce Florida troops under the command of Brigadier General Joseph Finegan. As Colquitt&#x27;s troops began arriving, Seymour, without Gillmore&#x27;s knowledge, began a new drive across north Florida with the capture of Tallahassee as a possible objective.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===

===Confederate===


== Battle ==

Following the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, Seymour led his 5,500 men in the direction of Lake City. At approximately 2:30 in the afternoon of February 20, the Union force approached General Finegan&#x27;s 5,000 Confederates entrenched near Olustee Station. Finegan sent out an infantry brigade to meet Seymour&#x27;s advance units and lure them into the Confederate entrenchments, but this plan went awry. The opposing forces met at Ocean Pond and the battle began. Seymour made the mistake of assuming he was once again facing Florida militia units he had previously routed with ease and committed his troops piecemeal into the battle. Finegan and Seymour both reinforced their engaged units during the afternoon and the battle took place in open pine woods. The Union forces attacked but were savagely repulsed by withering barrages of rifle and cannon fire. At about 2:00 p.m, Confederate officer Benjamin B. Sample led a spoiling assault on the Union lines, causing a great number of casualties on both sides. Sample&#x27;s assault was unsuccessful in breaking the Union line, but managed to demoralize the already weary Union soldiers. 

The battle raged throughout the afternoon until, as Finegan committed the last of his reserves, the Union line broke and began to retreat. Finegan did not exploit the retreat, allowing most of the fleeing Union forces to reach Jacksonville. It is claimed in letters and memoirs from Confederate officers the reason that the confederate troops were not able to exploit the retreat was because they were killing the surviving black wounded and captured troops. The Confederates did make a final attempt to engage the rear element of Seymour&#x27;s forces just before nightfall, but they were repulsed by elements of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 35th United States Colored Troops, both composed of Black soldiers.

== Aftermath ==

Union casualties were 203 killed, 1,152 wounded, and 506 missing, a total of 1,861 men—about 34 percent. Confederate losses were lower: 93 killed, 848 wounded, and 8 missing, a total of 949 casualties in all—but still about 19 percent. Union forces also lost six artillery pieces and 39 horses that were captured. The ratio of Union casualties to the number of troops involved made this the second bloodiest battle of the War for the Union, with 265 casualties per 1,000 troops. Soldiers on both sides were veterans of the great battles in the eastern and western theaters of war, but many of them remarked in letters and diaries that they had never undergone such terrible fighting. The Confederate dead were buried at Oaklawn Cemetery in nearby Lake City.

The Union losses caused Northern authorities to question the necessity of further Union involvement in the militarily insignificant state of Florida.
On the morning of February 22, as the Union forces were still retreating to Jacksonville, the 54th Massachusetts was ordered to countermarch back to Ten-Mile Station. The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th Massachusetts arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately three miles to Camp Finegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of 10 miles (16 km). It took 42 hours to pull the train that distance.

In the South, the battle was seen as a spirit-raising rout. One Georgia newspaper referred to Union forces as walking &quot;forty miles over the most barren land of the South, frightening the salamanders and the gophers, and getting a terrible thrashing&quot;. The Confederate Congress even passed a resolution to officially thank the rebel soldiers.

Today, the battlefield is commemorated by the Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park, a part of the Florida State Park system. This park is located within the Osceola National Forest, on U.S. 90. The battlefield is partially protected as state park, and part of the national forest. Part of it is privately held land on the south side of U.S. 90. However as of 2022 there is still no monument to the Union dead of this battle.
On Presidents&#x27; Day weekend each February (see Citations), an annual historical reenactment is conducted on the site of the battle. Thousands of reenactors from across the U.S., and even from overseas, have participated over the years.

The reenactment of the Battle of Olustee is co-sponsored by four organizations: the Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park Citizens Support Organization; the Florida Department of Environmental Protection – Recreation and Parks; the USDA Forest Service – Osceola National Forest; and The Blue-Grey Army, Inc.

== Battle lithograph ==
The lithograph at the top of the page was printed by the firm of Kurz and Allison in 1894. It depicts soldiers of the 8th U.S. Colored Troops advancing against Confederate entrenchments. While frequently used in media about the Battle of Olustee, the image is inaccurate and reveals the artist&#x27;s ignorance about the events. During the battle, Confederates operated well in advance of their prepared positions. Neither side fought from behind fortifications, as the fighting took place in a pine forest (see map – top of the map is approximately due West), and there were few large cleared area. The dotted red line on the map indicates the location of the Confederate trenches.

<doc id="193000" wikidata="Q317777" url="?curid=193000" title="Abdullah el-Faisal">
<text>Abdullah el-Faisal (born Trevor William Forrest, also known as Abdullah al-Faisal, Sheikh Faisal, Sheik Faisal, and Imam Al-Jamaikee, born 10 September 1963) is a Jamaican Muslim cleric who preached in the United Kingdom until he was convicted of stirring up racial hatred and urging his followers to murder Jews, Hindus, Christians, Americans and other &quot;unbelievers&quot;.

El-Faisal was sentenced to nine years in prison, of which he served four years before being deported to Jamaica in 2007. He subsequently traveled to Africa, but was deported from Botswana in 2009 and from Kenya back to Jamaica in January 2010.

In 2020, El-Faisal was extradited to New York City after being arrested in Jamaica in 2017. He was subsequently convicted in January 2023 in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on counts including soliciting or providing support for an act of terrorism. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

==Early life==
El-Faisal was born in Saint James Parish to an evangelical Christian family which belonged to the Salvation Army church, a Christian denomination. He grew up in the small farming village of Point, about from the city of Montego Bay, in upper St. James, Jamaica. He attended Springfield All-Age, then Maldon Primary and Junior High. At age 16, he converted to Islam, after being introduced to the religion by a teacher at Maldon High School.

He began using the name Abdullah el-Faisal shortly after graduating Maldon in 1980, and changed it legally in 1983. In 1981, in Trinidad, he took a six-week course in Islamic and Arabic studies sponsored by the Saudi Arabian government. He left Jamaica in 1983 for Guyana where he studied Arabic and Islam for a year. Starting in 1984, El-Faisal studied Islam for seven years on a Saudi government scholarship at the Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He then moved to the UK later in the 1980s.

==England: 1991–2003==
El-Faisal was sent to the United Kingdom to preach by Sheikh Raji. He returned to the UK in 1991, became the imam at the Brixton Mosque in South London, began preaching to crowds of up to 500 people at the mosque and at Brixton Town Hall. He married his second wife, Pakistani-British biology graduate Zubeida Khan whom he met months after his arrival, in 1992, thereby acquiring rights of residence. This meant he had two wives, as his first marriage was still extant. In 1993, el-Faisal was ejected by Brixton Mosque&#x27;s administration who objected to his radical preaching.

Afterward, he gave a lecture he called &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Deception of the Saudi Salafis&quot;, where he attacked the Brixton Mosque management on the basis of their alleged subservience to the corrupt rulers of Saudi Arabia. He opened a study center in Tower Hamlets, East London.

Referred to as &quot;Sheikh&quot; by his followers, el-Faisal travelled and lectured to audiences in mosques in Birmingham, London, and Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, and in Manchester, Worthing, Bournemouth, Cardiff, Swansea, Coventry, Maidenhead, Tipton, Beeston, and venues in Scotland and Wales. Some of his lectures were taped and sold at Islamic bookshops. He also called on Muslim mothers to raise their children to be &quot;jihad&quot; soldiers by the age of 15. The content of those taped lectures served as the basis for his later trial and conviction.

In February 2002, El-Faisal&#x27;s tapes were purchased by an undercover police officer at an Islamic bookshop at 62 Brick Lane in London and seized under a search warrant at Zam Zam Bookshop at 388 Green Street in East Ham and at his home at 104 Albert Square in Stratford. He was arrested on 18 February 2002.

El-Faisal is an associate of Abu Hamza al-Masri, the Egyptian ousted from the Finsbury Park mosque who is known for preaching against non-Muslims, and who is currently incarcerated in the United States for various offenses. El-Faisal is reportedly a former supporter of Osama bin Laden, and has been linked to al-Qaeda members.

==Conviction and imprisonment: 2003–07==
; Conviction
After a four-week trial at the Old Bailey, el-Faisal was found guilty by a jury of six men and six women on 24 February 2003 of: (a) three charges of soliciting the murder of Jews, Americans, Hindus, and Christians; and (b) two charges of using threatening words to stir up racial hatred, in tapes of speeches to his followers. He was the first Muslim cleric to be tried in the UK.
; Taped lectures
In tapes of lectures he had given, he exhorted Muslim women to buy toy guns for their children, to train them for &quot;jihad&quot;. El-Faisal tried to recruit British schoolboys for Jihad training camps, promising them &quot;seventy-two virgins in paradise&quot; if they died fighting a holy war. El-Faisal said &quot;Those who want to go to &quot;Jannah&quot; [paradise], it&#x27;s easy, just kill a &quot;Kaffar&quot; [unbeliever] ... by killing that Kaffar you have purchased your ticket to paradise.&quot; He suggested killing non-Muslims like &quot;cockroaches.&quot;

On one tape, titled &quot;Jihad&quot;, he said: &quot;Our methodology is the bullet, not the ballot.&quot; In a tape called &quot;Rules of Jihad&quot;, thought to have been made before the 9/11 attacks, he said: &quot;You have to learn how to shoot. You have to learn how to fly planes, drive tanks, and you have to learn how to load your guns and to use missiles. You are only allowed to use nuclear weapons in that country which is 100% unbelievers.&quot; He encouraged the use of &quot;anything, even chemical weapons,&quot; to &quot;exterminate non-believers.&quot; A picture of the burning World Trade Center was on the cover of one recording.

He lectured: &quot;You can go to India, and if you see a Hindu walking down the road you are allowed to kill him and take his money, is that clear, because there is no peace treaty between us.&quot; He also suggested that power plants could use the dead bodies of Hindus as fuel. &quot;Jews,&quot; el-Faisal said, &quot;should be killed ... as by Hitler.&quot; He said: &quot;People with British passports, if you fly into Israel, it is easy. Fly into Israel and do whatever you can. If you die, you are up in paradise. How do you fight a Jew? You kill a Jew. In the case of Hindus, by bombing their businesses.&quot;

During the trial, he denied he had intended to incite people to violence. He also testified that he had held Osama bin Laden in &quot;great respect,&quot; but that bin Laden had &quot;lost the path&quot; since 11 September.
; Sentencing and appeal
El-Faisal was sentenced on 7 March 2003 to nine years in prison. He received seven years for soliciting murder, 12 months to run concurrently for using threatening words with intent to stir up racial hatred, and a further two years (to run consecutively) for distributing threatening recordings with intent to stir up racial hatred. Old Bailey judge Peter Beaumont delivered the sentence. He said el-Faisal had &quot;fanned the flames of hostility&quot;, and told him: &quot;As the jury found, you not only preached hate, but the words you uttered in those meetings were recorded to reach a wider audience. You urged those who listened and watched to kill those who did not share your faith.&quot; The judge suggested that el-Faisal serve at least half his sentence, and then be deported.

On 17 February 2004, el-Faisal lost an appeal of his conviction. While in prison, he attempted to improve conditions, saying: &quot;if you&#x27;re a cleric, you have to set an example for other Muslim prisoners to follow, and you&#x27;re not supposed to crack under pressure.&quot; He ended up serving four years.

===Followers: 9/11 plotter, Richard Reid, 7/7 and Flight 253 bombers===

Prosecutors said he preached to 2001 shoe bomber Richard Reid and 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui.

In addition, two of the four accused 2005 7/7 suicide bombers, Muhammad Sidique Khan, responsible for the Edgware Road blast that killed 6 people, and Jamaican-born Briton Germaine Lindsay, responsible for the blast that killed 26 people at King&#x27;s Cross tube station, were followers of El-Faisal. In an interview with the &quot;BBC&quot; in June 2008, he admitted knowing Germaine Lindsay but insisted he had not radicalized him.

In a May 2005 online posting under the name &quot;farouk1986,&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the suspected Christmas Day 2009 Flight 253 bomber, referred to El-Faisal, writing: &quot;i thought once they are arrested, no one hears about them for life and the keys to their prison wards are thrown away. That&#x27;s what I heard sheikh faisal of UK say (he has also been arrested i heard).&quot;

==Deportations from the UK, Botswana, and Kenya: May 2007–present==
Upon being eligible for parole, el-Faisal was released from prison, deported to Jamaica, and permanently banned from the UK on 25 May 2007. He remained on an international watch list. Andrew Dismore, a Labour Member of Parliament, noted that deportation might not adequately address the risks posed by el-Faisal, saying: &quot;Once he&#x27;s deported to Jamaica, what restrictions will there be to prevent him spreading his message of hate over the Internet?&quot; He is said to preach extremists views online at paltalk chat rooms and associated with the authentic tawheed website.

On his arrival in Jamaica, the Islamic Council of Jamaica refused him permission to preach in its mosques. He began to again give lectures, conduct Q&amp;A sessions via online chats, and established himself at the pulpit of a mosque in Spanish Town, just west of Kingston, Jamaica. The content of his sermons remained the same as that which was submitted at his trial.

In June 2008, he was preaching in South Africa. He reportedly traveled by road through various countries in Africa including Nigeria, Angola, Malawi, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana, and Tanzania before entering Kenya.

Along the way, Botswana had deported him as a prohibited immigrant.

=== Kenya ===
El-Faisal was allowed entry to Kenya on 24 December 2009, due to a computer error. He was arrested by anti-terror police in Mombasa on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009. Attempts by Kenya to deport him were initially unsuccessful because of his involvement in terrorist activities. He was unable to reach Jamaica, which had said it would accept him, because South Africa, the U.K., the U.S., and Tanzania all declined to issue him transit visas that would allow him to connect to flights to Jamaica.

He was deported from Kenya on 7 January 2010 to the West African nation of Gambia, which agreed to accept el-Faisal at his request. But as he was being transported through Nigeria, Nigerian authorities refused to grant him a transit visa and instead sent him back to Kenya on 10 January 2010. The Gambian government also indicated it would not grant him entry.

Several hundred people demonstrated on 8 January 2010, protesting the &quot;unfair&quot; treatment of el-Faisal. On 15 January, police in Nairobi were summoned to block a protest march by several hundred people, some of whom were waving the flag of al Shabaab. Some angry residents threw stones at the marchers. The following day at least five people died in demonstrations after Friday prayers at Jami&#x27;a Mosque.

=== Jamaica ===
He was deported from Kenya on a private plane (at a cost in excess of $523,000), and on 22 January 2010 arrived back in Jamaica. There, he was questioned by Special Branch investigators who said that he had not broken any laws in Jamaica, but that the police wanted to make sure they knew where and how to find him &quot;because of the international attention he has received.&quot; The Islamic Council of Jamaica banned him from preaching at any of its 12 mosques, but he was permitted to worship there. In 2017, he continued releasing public statements in support of the Islamic State.

In his book &quot;Ticking Time Bomb: Counter-Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government&#x27;s Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack&quot; (2011), former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman described Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, American-Yemeni imam Anwar al-Awlaki, el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as &quot;virtual spiritual sanctioners&quot; who use the internet to offer religious justification for terrorism.

== Conviction and imprisonment: 2017–23 ==
On 25 August 2017, he was arrested in Jamaica after US officers caught him trying to recruit jihadis in an undercover sting operation. According to the Manhattan district attorney, he offered to help an undercover officer travel to the Middle East and join ISIL, and was taken into custody in Jamaica to await extradition to the USA.

In July 2020, Jamaica&#x27;s Court of Appeal ruled the extradition to the USA could proceed. Faisal was extradited on 13 August 2020. The New York City district attorney assumed prosecution of the case, with five charges of terrorism. According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; report, Faisal was held in &quot;lockdown&quot;, confined for 2 hours a day.

On March 23, 2023, Faisal was convicted, after a two-month long jury trial, of recruiting, soliciting, and inspiring students and followers to pledge allegiance to, travel to, join and commit acts of terrorism on behalf of the Islamic State, a/k/a “ISIS” or “ISIL.” He was sentenced to 18 years in a New York state prison.

<text>Oswald Boelcke PlM (; 19 May 1891 – 28 October 1916) was a World War I German professional soldier and pioneering flying ace credited with 40 aerial victories. Boelcke is honored as the father of the German fighter air force, and of air combat as a whole. He was a highly influential mentor, patrol leader, and tactician in the first years of air combat, 1915 and 1916.

Boelcke fulfilled his childhood dream of a military career by joining the Imperial German Army on 15 March 1911. He pursued an early interest in aviation, learning to fly as World War I began. After duty as an aerial observer during 1914, he became one of the original fighter pilots during mid-1915. Flying the first true fighters, Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and several other early aces began shooting down enemy airplanes. Boelcke and Immelmann were the first German fighter pilots awarded Prussia&#x27;s highest honor, the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. The German high command reassigned Boelcke after his 19th victory. During his forced grounding on staff duty, he helped transform Die (Flying Troop) air arm into the Luftstreitkräfte (Air Force). His innovative turn of mind codified his combat experiences into the first manual of fighter tactics distributed to an air force, the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;. The &quot;Dicta&quot; promulgated axioms for individual pilot success, as well as a requirement for teamwork directed by a formation&#x27;s leader. Modern aerial combat tactics manuals stem from the &quot;Dicta&quot;.

After an enforced holiday leave spent on a military inspection tour of Ottoman facilities, Boelcke was picked to lead one of Germany&#x27;s first fighter squadrons, Jagdstaffel 2 (Fighter Squadron 2). Its pilots were hand-picked by Boelcke and indoctrinated in his &quot;Dicta&quot; through extensive training. During September and October 1916, Boelcke scored 21 more victories while commanding , maintaining his position as the world&#x27;s highest-scoring ace. He was killed in a mid-air collision with his best friend, Erwin Böhme, on 28 October 1916. By the end of the war, (renamed Jasta Boelcke) had 25 aces in its ranks; many of them were selected to lead other squadrons and four of its members became generals during World War II. Boelcke&#x27;s influence extends to the present, with extensive tributes to him at the German Air Force&#x27;s Nörvenich Air Base and throughout Germany.

==Early years==

The son of a schoolmaster, Oswald Boelcke was born on 19 May 1891, in Giebichenstein (since 1900 a district of Halle), Prussian Province of Saxony. The Boelcke family had returned to the German Empire from Argentina six months before Oswald&#x27;s birth. His family name was originally spelt Bölcke, but Oswald and his elder brother Wilhelm (1886–1954) dispensed with the umlaut and adopted the Latin spelling in place of the German. The pronunciation is the same for both spellings.

Boelcke caught whooping cough aged three, resulting in lifelong asthma. When he was four, his father moved the family to Dessau near the Junkers factory in pursuit of professional advancement. The planes flying overhead were Boelcke&#x27;s first exposure to aircraft.

As Boelcke grew, he turned to athletics despite his asthma. In later life, he was described as being about tall, broad-shouldered and well proportioned, with great agility and strength. He played soccer and tennis, skated and danced, and was considered the best gymnast in his school. He was an oarsman, and a prizewinning swimmer and diver. When he was 17, he became an alpinist capable of out-climbing his father and elder brother. His athletic prowess made him a popular leader on the school playing fields.

He got along well in school with both his fellow students and the teachers. His frank and friendly demeanor, blond hair, and intense blue eyes made him memorable. One source says Oswald Boelcke was studious as well as athletic, excelling at mathematics and physics.

Boelcke&#x27;s family was a conservative one. They realized that a military career could move their son up the social ladder. Under this influence, while in the third or fourth form, ten-year-old Boelcke wrote a personal letter to Kaiser Wilhelm requesting an appointment to military school. His wish was granted when he was 13, but once his parents were apprised of the opportunity by the belated letter of reply, they objected and he did not attend Cadet School. He attended (Duke Frederick&#x27;s High School) instead of interrupting his education.

Boelcke&#x27;s interest in a military career seemed undiminished. While in school, his favorite author was the nationalist writer Heinrich von Treitschke. Boelcke also read publications from the German General Staff. At age 17, for an elocution class, he chose three subjects—General Gerhard von Scharnhorst&#x27;s military reforms, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin&#x27;s life before his aeronautical experiments, and the first airship flights. Despite his principal&#x27;s reservations about his scholarship, Boelcke was awarded his honors degree on 11 February 1911.

==Entry into military service==

After leaving school Boelcke joined a telegraph battalion in Koblenz as a (cadet officer) on 15 March 1911. As he learned his general military duties, he saw more airplanes. In January 1912 he began attending the (Military Academy) in Metz. As the advent of spring lengthened the days, he took advantage of his early class dismissal to spend the rest of his daylight hours watching airplanes at a nearby airfield. In June, he stood his final exams. His written tests were graded as only &quot;fair&quot;; his oral exams were &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot;; his leadership skills were considered &quot;excellent&quot;. 

In July 1912, he graduated and was commissioned as an ensign. Since Boelcke had gained his , his commission was back-dated to 23 August 1910, making him senior to the other new ensigns in his battalion. Promotion to lieutenant soon followed. He settled into a daily routine of training recruit telegraphers, and enjoyed an active social life.

During 1913, Boelcke took advantage of a temporary posting to Metz to be taken on some flights with the 3rd Air Battalion. That October he was transferred to Darmstadt. On a visit to Frankfurt, he witnessed an aerobatic performance by pioneer French aviator Adolphe Pégoud. In February 1914, he competed in the officer&#x27;s pentathlon, taking third place and qualifying for the 1916 Olympics scheduled for Berlin.

==World War I==

===1914===

Without informing his family, Boelcke applied for a transfer to aviation duty. On 29 May 1914, he was accepted for pilot&#x27;s training. On 2 June, he began a six-week course of instruction at the (Halberstadt Flying School). He passed his final pilot&#x27;s exam on 15 August. His first assignment was training 50 neophyte pilots on an Aviatik B.I. 

World War I having begun, Boelcke was anxious to see action. On 31 August, he connived his way into joining his older brother Wilhelm at (Field Flyer Detachment 13). On 1 September, the aircrew of Boelcke and Boelcke flew the first of many missions together. On 8 September, during reconnaissance of a French aerodrome, Wilhelm avoided a challenge by French aircraft because he feared they had machine guns aboard. 

The brothers soon compiled a record of flying longer missions at more frequent intervals than the other aircrews, causing some resentment within the unit. The two Boelckes continued to fly as the weather worsened and the opposing armies&#x27; activities began to stagnate into trench warfare. By year&#x27;s end, Oswald, who had been last to join the section, had flown 42 sorties beyond the front line and Wilhelm had flown 61. The next most active airman had 27 sorties.

===1915===
====Catalyst for action====

There was little ground combat and little need for air support during early 1915. Oswald had a spell in hospital with asthma, and both brothers went on home leave. The Boelckes&#x27; new commanding officer wished to separate them. In late March, matters came to a head when the brothers refused to fly separately and jumped the chain of command to complain but, in April, they were parted. As Wilhelm returned to Germany, Oswald was posted to (Field Flyer Detachment 62) in La Brayelle, Douai, France on 25 April.

He was quickly passed on to (Combat Single-Seater Command Douai), arriving 19 May. He was the most experienced pilot in the unit. His new assignment brought him friendship with Max Immelmann, a fellow citizen of the Prussian Province of Saxony serving in the unit.
Boelcke&#x27;s and Immelmann&#x27;s posting to FFA 62 proved momentous, as they would fly the unit&#x27;s Fokker Eindeckers during the Fokker Scourge.

====Advent of synchronized guns====

When Roland Garros, Eugène Gilbert and Adolphe Pégoud managed to score the first aerial victories, they caught the public imagination. French newspapers hailed Pégoud as &quot;l&#x27;as&quot;, or ace. To an audience overwhelmed by a war of enormous armies and geographic complexity, simple stories of lone heroes had great appeal. German propagandists took advantage of this by supplying press releases to newspapers and magazines, encouraging printing of postcards, and filming of popular aviators.

After two unsuccessful combats in two-seated reconnaissance craft, Boelcke scored his first accredited victory on 4 July 1915, after 30 minutes of angling about to afford his observer with fields of fire. Then Boelcke shifted from two-seaters to the world&#x27;s original dedicated fighter plane.
The Fokker E.I (monoplane) was a hasty German response to the first air-to-air victories achieved by French fliers. The airplane itself was unremarkable, with cranky controls and underpowered inefficient engine, but its weapon system was not.

The noses of were fitted with a forward-firing air-cooled Parabellum machine-gun connected to a gun synchronizer that prevented bullets from being fired when the propeller blades were in the line of fire. Aiming the airplane aimed the gun, murderously simplifying the task of attacking other aircraft. The machine-guns carried hundreds of bullets in ammunition belts. The few British Lewis guns in use had to be aimed indirectly around the propeller, and awkwardly reloaded after the 47 rounds in its ammunition drum had been fired. Fokkers were issued singly or in pairs to operational detachments. 

The were to be flown when pilots were not on their assigned reconnaissance missions in their two-seaters. The German General Staff had settled on an aerial strategy of defensive &quot;barrier&quot; patrols over their own lines. The new aircraft were considered so revolutionary that they could not be risked over enemy lines for fear of capture. This restriction to defensive patrols was soon eroded by the insubordinate aggression of Boelcke and other Fokker fliers.

====Early fighter warfare====
On 17 June, on the French side of the lines, Gilbert shot down his fifth German aeroplane. On 21 June, operating from the Allied side of the lines, British pilot Lanoe Hawker scored his first victory. In July 1915, Boelcke, Immelmann, Parschau, and Wintgens began to fly the aircraft in combat. As the German single-seat pilots began waging war in the third dimension, they had no tactical knowledge for reference. Until Boelcke recorded his experiences in July 1916, there was no tactical guide.

On 1 July, Wintgens achieved the initial victory with the Fokker, but the French aircraft fell behind their own lines and went unverified—until after the war. On 4 July, Wintgens filed another victory claim—again only confirmed postwar. That day, Boelcke and his observer brought down an enemy two-seater in a prolonged engagement between reconnaissance machines. It was Boelcke&#x27;s first victory, and the only one he scored in a two-seater, as he then switched to the . By the end of July, Wintgens had two more victories, both verified. On 1 August, Immelmann shot down his first aircraft. By this time, the pilots were being mentioned in official dispatches and lionized in magazine and newspaper. In letters home, Boelcke was already counseling his father about modesty in dealing with journalists.

Boelcke and Immelmann often flew together. Boelcke won his first individual aerial combat on 19 August 1915, forcing down a British plane. On 31 August, Pégoud was shot down and killed after six victories. By then, Hawker had won six of his eventual seven victories, generally unnoticed. In the glare of German publicity, Wintgens had claimed five victims, Boelcke two and Immelmann one.

====The ace race begins====
September 1915 saw improved models of the delivered to the front. Engine power was increased and the Fokker E.IV carried a pair of guns over the engine. That month Boelcke and Immelmann scored two victories apiece. On 22 September, Boelcke was moved to Metz, joining the secretive (Carrier Pigeons Detachment Metz) to counter a French offensive. On 1 November, the day after his sixth victory, Boelcke was awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. Immelmann duplicated the feat six days later, reaching six victories and being awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. By now, the deadly effect of the new aircraft on aerial warfare was beginning to be referred to by the British and French public as the Fokker Scourge.

Boelcke moved back to on 12 December. When he arrived, he was awarded a Prussian Lifesaving Medal for an act of heroism in late August. While watching French locals fishing from a high pier jutting into a canal, Boelcke saw a teen boy topple in and sink. Boelcke plunged in and saved the child from drowning. When French bystanders applauded his heroism, Boelcke was embarrassed by his soggy public appearance in his dress uniform. By the end of 1915, Immelmann had seven victories, Boelcke had six, Wintgens had five (including two unconfirmed) and Hans-Joachim Buddecke had four (one unconfirmed). There were 86 Fokker and 21 Pfalz &quot;Eindeckers&quot; in service. Officially, the nine successful pilots of the Fokker Scourge had shot down 28 enemy aircraft.

===1916===

====Ace race continues====
On 5 January 1916, the winter weather improved enough for flying, and Boelcke shot down a British BE.2. Landing near the downed aircraft, he found that the German-speaking pilot knew of him. Boelcke later visited the observer in hospital, bringing him reading material. By now, Boelcke was so well known that this incident was front-page news. On 12 January, Buddecke submitted his ninth combat claim, but four had not been verified. Boelcke and Immelmann shot down their eighth victims that day. These two were immediately presented the German Empire&#x27;s most prestigious decoration, the &quot;Pour le Merite&quot;. This award sparked articles in the American and British press, as well as the German news. Boelcke was internationally famous, and could not walk German streets or attend the opera without being lionized. The young lieutenant also found that generals and nobility sought his company.

On 21 January, Boelcke was again covertly posted to , in anticipation of the Battle of Verdun. Bad weather limited his flying, and he complained he had little to do except reluctantly reply to fan mail. In late February, he was hospitalized with an intestinal ailment. After about a week, he absconded from care to return to duty. He complained he was stationed too far from the front at Jametz and was given permission to use the forward airfield at Sivry only behind the lines.

On 11 March, he was given command of the new (Flying Detachment Sivry). This unit of six fighter pilots was the precursor of German fighter squadrons. Boelcke connected a front-line observation post to the Sivry airfield and established the first tactical air direction center. The new fighter unit was stationed near Stenay, which was the headquarters of Prussian Crown Prince Wilhelm. A friendship developed between the Crown Prince and the flier.

On 3 March 1916, Boelcke was ordered to evaluate a new prototype: his report pointed out shortcomings like inaccurately mounted guns and the limitations of its rotary engine. He also submitted a memorandum that criticized German use of airpower as &quot;wretched&quot;. Boelcke became the first aviator to score 10 victories on 12 March. The following day, as Boelcke scored another, Immelmann scored one of the first double victories of the war to tie it up at 11 all. The dead heat lasted for a week. On 19 March, Boelcke used his usual tactics of point-blank fire for his 12th victory. 

By this time, the obsolescent Fokker E.III was being replaced by newer Halberstadt D.II single-gun and twin-gun Albatros D.I biplane fighters, both types fitted with synchronized guns. The French counter to the Fokker Scourge was the new Nieuport 11. The British counter was the Airco DH.2 pusher biplane that could shoot without use of synchronizing gear. Boelcke concentrated on developing fighter tactics, massing fighters in formation and using accurate gunnery in combat.

The ace race continued, although Buddecke lost ground and was no longer a contender due to problems verifying some of his victories in Turkey. Now it became more of an &quot;ace chase&quot;, with Immelmann playing catchup to Boelcke as their scores rose into the teens. When Boelcke shot down two enemy airplanes on 21 May 1916, the emperor disregarded army regulations prohibiting promotion to until age 30. Boelcke was promoted to the rank ten days past his 25th birthday, making him the youngest captain in the German military.
====The ace race ends====
Immelmann was killed on 18 June 1916 after his 17th victory. Boelcke, who then had 18 victories, was left the preeminent ace of the war. Upon Boelcke&#x27;s return from Immelmann&#x27;s funeral, Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered Boelcke grounded for a month to avoid losing him in combat soon after Immelmann. He had become such an important hero to the German public, as well as such an authority on aerial warfare, that he could not be risked. Boelcke downed his 19th victim before reporting to headquarters on 27 June.

There the disgruntled flier was detailed to share his expertise with the head of German military aviation, Hermann von der Lieth-Thomsen, who was planning the reorganization of the German air service from the (Flying Troops) into the (Air Force). The Prussian military believed that a combat officer knew best which tactics would succeed. In concordance with this belief, Boelcke codified his successful mission tactics into the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;. Its eight maxims seem self-evident, but Boelcke was the first to recognize them. His first six rules pointed out ways to gain an advantage in combat. The seventh counseled keeping a line of retreat, and the eighth mandated squadron teamwork. These rules were published in a pamphlet that was widely distributed throughout the as the original training manual on fighter tactics.

The British launched their Somme offensive on 1 July. Their air assets amounted to 185 aircraft. The French supplied 201 more. The opposing German force amounted to 129 aircraft, including 19 fighters. The British alone had 76 fighters in their force. Allied bombers began a campaign to destroy the German planes on their aerodromes.

====Journey to the east====

On 10 July 1916, Boelcke left on a tour of the Balkans. He travelled through Austria-Hungary to visit the Ottoman Empire. From his diary notes, the journey seemed a combination of military facility inspections, a celebrity tour, and a holiday. He kept attendance at formal social obligations to a minimum, but had to oblige such important hosts as Enver Pasha and Otto Liman von Sanders. Making his rounds of the Turkish flying units supported by the German Military Mission, Boelcke again met his friend Hans Joachim Buddecke. After a three-day beach vacation at Smyrna, Boelcke reached the quiescent Gallipoli battlefield on 30 July. When he returned to Constantinople, he learned that in his absence, the French and British airmen had taken air superiority from the Germans on the Western Front.

On his hastened return trip, Boelcke visited Bulgaria and the Russian Front. He was visiting his brother Wilhelm at his unit in Kovel, a telegram arrived from Lieth-Thomsen: &quot;Return to west front as quickly as possible to organize and lead &quot;Jagdstaffel 2&quot; (Fighter Squadron 2) on the Somme front.&quot;

====Creation of ====

When the message from headquarters reached the Boelcke brothers, it was followed by an extraordinary authorization. Six (Combat Single-Seater Commands) were expanded into (fighter squadrons), by orders issued on 10 August. The seventh planned squadron would be raised from scratch. This squadron, (Fighter Squadron 2), was designated as Boelcke&#x27;s to man and command. This authorization gave him a free hand to recruit fighter pilots for his new unit.


Upon Wilhelm&#x27;s recommendation, Oswald recruited a pair of pilots from Wilhelm&#x27;s unit, both of whom he had previously met. One was a young cavalry officer, Manfred von Richthofen. The other was 37-year-old Erwin Böhme, a civil engineer returned from six years in Africa to reenlist in the military. After choosing three other pilots, Boelcke returned to France to organize his squadron.

Boelcke started with only four empty buildings vacated by (Field Flyer Detachment 32) in the Vélu Woods. His new squadron was authorized 14 aircraft, the pilots to fly them, and ground crew to support them. As of 27 August, the fledgling squadron had three officers and 64 other ranks on strength, but no aircraft. By 8 September, there were eight pilots on board, including Richthofen and Böhme. Three days later, Böhme was pushing for permission to use his castoff Halberstadt; there were four aircraft in the squadron by then.

While his squadron struggled into existence, Boelcke flew solo combat sorties, to be eagerly greeted upon his return by his pilots. On 2 September, he shot down Captain R. E. Wilson for his 20th victory. The next day, Boelcke hosted Wilson in the squadron mess before returning the British flier to captivity.

As new personnel continued to check in, facilities were built, and the squadron&#x27;s pilots trained. They began with firing and troubleshooting machine guns on the ground. They also received extensive lectures from Boelcke on aircraft recognition and the strengths and flaws of opposing aircraft. They familiarized themselves with their Halberstadts before taking to the air. Boelcke believed, &quot;You can win the men&#x27;s confidence if you associate with them naturally and do not try to play the high and mighty superior.&quot;

Boelcke drilled his pilots in his tactics as they flew. They learned to pair as leader and wingman, spaced 60 meters abreast to allow room for a U-turn without collision. They flew formation, massing their power for attacks. While attacking they split into pairs, although the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot; advised single assaults on the foe by flight leaders. Meanwhile, Boelcke withheld the squadron from combat, and continued flying his solo sorties. Single victims fell to him on 8 and 9 September, and he scored double victories on the 14th and 15th. When Boelcke returned to base with gunpowder soot on his chin, they knew he had shot down another enemy plane. Boelcke told them, &quot;I only open fire when I can see the goggle strap on my opponent&#x27;s crash helmet.&quot;

====Into battle====

New fighters arrived on 16 September. There was a prototype Albatros D.II for Boelcke, and five Albatros D.Is to be shared by his pilots. The new aircraft outclassed previous German types, as well as those of their enemies. With more powerful engines, the new arrivals were faster, climbed more quickly to a higher ceiling, and carried two synchronized nose machine guns instead of one. With these new airplanes, flew its first squadron missions on 17 September. Boelcke shot down his 27th victim, and his men shot down four more. Squadron training continued amid the initial successes. Boelcke now discussed flights beforehand and listened to his pilots&#x27; input, then issued orders for the mission. Post-flight, he debriefed his men.

On 22 September, rainy weather had aggravated Boelcke&#x27;s asthma to the point he could not fly. He refused to go to hospital, but devolved command on &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Gunther Viehweger. That night, transferred from Bertincourt to Lagnicourt because British artillery was beginning to shell its airfield. The next day, in a letter home, Boelcke noted he was still trying to impress his pilots that they should fight as a team instead of individually. Nevertheless, when the squadron flew six sorties that day without him, it shot down three enemy aircraft. Boelcke returned to flight status and command on the 27th. The squadron&#x27;s September monthly activity report, written by Boelcke, reported 186 sorties flown, 69 of which resulted in combat. Ten victories were credited to him, and 15 more were shared among his men. suffered four casualties.

By 1 October, the squadron had ten pilots; besides Boelcke, five of them had shot down enemy aircraft. Boelcke scored his 30th victory, but the squadron lost a pilot to antiaircraft fire. The next day began a stretch of rainy weather that prevented flying until the 7th. On 8 October, General Erich Ludendorff reorganized the makeshift into the and appointed Generalleutnant Ernst von Hoeppner to the new post of Chief of Field Aviation. Hoeppner immediately had the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot; distributed within the new air force.

On 10 October, a clear day saw the resumption of flying. flew 31 sorties, fought during 18 of them, and claimed five victories, including Boelcke&#x27;s 33rd. More air battles came on the 16th; among the four victories for the squadron were two more by Boelcke. He achieved 11 victories in October, with his 40th coming on 26 October. This total easily made him the leading ace of the war; his score would hold until Richthofen surpassed it on 13 April 1917. At the time of his death he had 36 more victories than von Richthofen&#x27;s 4. This demonstrated just how far ahead he was of the future 80 victory ace. By this time, it was becoming obvious that the Royal Flying Corps had lost its mastery of the air. had 50 victories to its credit—26 in October alone—with only six casualties. The German air service had suffered only 39 casualties between mid-September and mid-October, and had shot down 211 enemy aircraft.

====Last mission====

On the evening of 27 October, a depressed and tired Boelcke left the squadron mess early to return to his room. He complained of the racket in the mess to his batman, then sat staring into the fire. Böhme joined him, also stating the mess was too noisy. They shared a long talk, ending only when the orderly suggested bedtime. The following day was misty with a cloud layer, but the squadron still flew four missions during the morning, as well as another later in the day.

On the sixth mission, Boelcke and five of his pilots attacked a pair of British airplanes from 24 Squadron RFC. Boelcke and Böhme chased the Airco DH.2 of Captain Arthur Knight, while Richthofen pursued the other DH.2, flown by Captain Alfred McKay. McKay evaded Richthofen by crossing behind Knight, cutting off Boelcke and Böhme. Both of them jerked their planes upward to avoid colliding with McKay, each hidden from the other by their aircraft&#x27;s wings. Neither was aware of the other&#x27;s position.

Just as Böhme spotted the other plane bobbing up below him, Boelcke&#x27;s upper left wing brushed the undercarriage of Böhme&#x27;s airplane. The slight impact split the fabric on the wing of Boelcke&#x27;s Albatros. As the fabric tore away, the wing lost lift, and the aircraft spiralled down to glide into an impact, near a German artillery battery near Bapaume. Although the crash seemed survivable, Boelcke was not wearing his crash helmet, nor was his safety belt fastened. He died of a fractured skull. Böhme returned to base and overturned while landing, blanking the accident from his mind in his distress. He lamented, &quot;Destiny is generally cruelly stupid in her choices...&quot; but he was exonerated by an enquiry.

====In memoriam====
Pilots from rushed forward to the artillery position where Boelcke had crashed, hoping he was still alive. The gunners handed over his body to them. Despite Boelcke being Protestant, his memorial service was held in the Catholic Cambrai Cathedral on 31 October. Among the many wreaths, there was one from Captain Wilson and three of his fellow prisoners; its ribbon was addressed to &quot;The opponent we admired and esteemed so highly&quot;. Another wreath of British origin had been air dropped by the Royal Flying Corps; it read &quot;To the memory of Captain Boelcke, our brave and chivalrous opponent&quot;.

Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria attended the ceremony and two generals spoke at the service. Richthofen preceded the coffin from the cathedral, displaying Boelcke&#x27;s decorations. The sun broke through the gloom as the coffin was placed on a gun caisson. Idling aircraft criss-crossed overhead in tribute. The journey to a waiting train passed through an honor guard to the sound of rifle salutes, followed by a hymn. The train crept away through Magdeburg and Halberstadt to Dessau. 

When the train arrived in Dessau the next day, Boelcke was taken to his home church, Saint John&#x27;s and laid out before the altar, attended by an honor guard of decorated sergeant pilots. Condolences, decorations and honors arrived from the crowned heads of Europe. When the funeral service was held on the afternoon of 2 November, the crowd was packed with royalty, generals and nobility. General Moriz von Lyncker gave Boelcke&#x27;s funeral oration, followed by a speech by Lieth-Thomsen. Boelcke was buried in the (Cemetery of Honor).

==Legacy==
According to his pre-eminent student, Manfred von Richthofen, &quot;Boelcke had not a personal enemy. He was equally polite to everybody, making no differences.&quot;

Boelcke was the progenitor of air-to-air combat tactics, fighter squadron organization, early-warning systems, and the German air force; he has been dubbed &quot;the father of air combat&quot;. From his first victories, the news of his success instructed and motivated both his fellow fliers and the German public. It was at his instigation that the Imperial German Air Service founded its (Fighter School) to teach his aerial tactics. The promulgation of his &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot; set tactics for the German fighter force. The concentration of fighter airplanes into squadrons gained Germany air supremacy on the Western Front, and was the basis for their wartime successes. &quot;Jagdstaffel 2&quot; was re-named and remained one of Germany&#x27;s premier fighter squadrons after Boelcke&#x27;s death, outscoring all but one other . The 336 victories the scored during the war came at the price of 44 casualties.

Of the first 15 pilots chosen by Boelcke, eight became aces—seven of them within the squadron. Three of the 15, at various times, commanded the . By war&#x27;s end, 25 aces had served in the squadron and accounted for 90 per cent of its victories. Four of its aces became generals during World War IIGerhard Bassenge, Ernst Bormann, Hermann Frommherz, and Otto Höhne. The most notable of Boelcke&#x27;s original roster of pilots was Richthofen. The Red Baron acknowledged Boelcke&#x27;s influence in the &quot;Richthofen Dicta&quot;; the opening sentence of his tactical manual for wing operations refers to Boelcke. The &quot;Richthofen Dicta&quot; section entitled &quot;The One to One Battle&quot; quotes Boelcke. As was done with &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;, &quot;the Richthofen Dicta&quot; was distributed service-wide by the German High Command.

Boelcke was one of the few German heroes of World War I not tainted by association with the Nazi cause. Nevertheless, Nazi Germany named (Bomber Wing 27) for Boelcke, and Boelcke&#x27;s barracks, a Luftwaffe barracks named after him, later became a subcamp of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. There is a (Boelcke Street) in Berlin; a () in Koblenz, located on another ; and still another extends northwest from Kerpen, leading to two in separate locations. There is also an officers clubhouse named for Boelcke on a military installation, near the northern located on the base.

Boelcke&#x27;s name appears on the coat of arms of the present-day German Air Force fighter-bomber wing (Tactical Air Force Wing 31). The wing conducts a pilgrimage to Boelcke&#x27;s grave on the anniversary of his death. He is also extensively commemorated on the wing&#x27;s home airfield at Norvenich Air Base. He is memorialized by murals on base buildings, portraits in their halls, and a bust in the headquarters entry. The base magazine is named for him. An aircraft tail section on static display is emblazoned with his name and a painting of his Fokker.

<text>Jean-Étienne Vachier Championnet (; 13 April 1762 – 9 January 1800) was a French Army officer who led a Republican French division in several important battles of the French Revolutionary Wars. He became commander-in-chief of the Army of Rome in 1798 and of the Army of Italy in 1799. He died in early 1800 of typhus. His name is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 3.

==Career==
Championnet joined the French Army at an early age and served in the Great Siege of Gibraltar. During the French Revolution, he took a prominent part in the movement and was elected by the men of a battalion to command them. In May 1793 he was charged with the suppression of the civil disturbances in the Jura, which he quelled without bloodshed. Under Charles Pichegru he took part in the Rhine campaign of 1793 as a brigade commander, and at Weissenburg and in the Palatinate won the commendation of Lazare Hoche.

At Fleurus his stubborn fighting in the centre of the field contributed greatly to Jourdan&#x27;s victory. In the subsequent campaigns he commanded the left wing ‘of the French armies on the Rhine between Neuwied and Düsseldorf, and took a part in expeditions to the Lahn and the Main rivers. At the conclusion of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, he briefly commanded the Army of Sambre and Meuse from 24 January–31 January 1797.

In 1798 Championnet was named commander-in-chief of the Army of Rome which was tasked with protecting the Roman Republic against attacks by the Kingdom of Naples and the Royal Navy. Nominally 32,000 strong, the army scarcely numbered 8000 effectives, with a bare fifteen cartridges per man. Leading the Neapolitan army, the Austrian general Karl Mack von Leiberich had a tenfold superiority in numbers, but Championnet held his own and captured Naples itself, and there established the Parthenopaean Republic. His intense earnestness and intolerance of opposition, plus his penchant for looting and an unwillingness to curb atrocities by his troops, soon embroiled him with the civil population. He became involved in a quarrel with Guillaume-Charles Faipoult, one of the &quot;Representatives on mission&quot; (political commissar), was relieved with the accusation of graft, and subsequently imprisoned for a short time.

The following year, however, saw him again in the field as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Alps. This, too, was at first a mere paper force, but after three months&#x27; hard work it was able to take the field. After Barthélemy Catherine Joubert was killed at the Battle of Novi, Championnet assumed control over the Army of Italy. The campaign which followed was uniformly unsuccessful and, worn out by the unequal struggle, Championnet died at Antibes in the French Maritime Alps. In 1848 a statue was erected in his honour at Valence.

According to Napoleon, Championette &quot;was brave, full of zeal, active, devoted to his country; he was a good General of Division, an indifferent Commander-in-Chief.&quot;

The figure of General Championnet is linked to the traditional carnival of Frosinone, which had been part of the short-lived Parthenopaean Republic, during which a puppet representing the general is carried around the streets of the city and then given to the flames.

<text>Worldwide Pants Incorporated is an American television and film production company founded and owned by comedian and talk show host David Letterman.

The company was formerly headquartered at the Ed Sullivan Theater building in New York City, but has since moved to Los Angeles following the ending of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The president and CEO is former &quot;Late Show&quot; executive producer Rob Burnett. Peter Lassally, a former &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Show&quot; executive producer, was the senior vice-president until his retirement.

==History==

===1990s===
A predecessor company, &quot;Space Age Meats&quot;, produced Letterman&#x27;s first television talk show, &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; in 1980. This company was also credited with producing &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, produced in partnership with NBC and Johnny Carson&#x27;s Carson Productions from 1982 to 1990 (Carson would continue to be credited with production of that show until his retirement in 1992).

Worldwide Pants&#x27; first production credit was for &quot;Late Night&quot; in 1991, shortly after its formation. The company, then known as Worldwide Pants Productions, shared a 1991 Peabody Award, for their ability to &quot;take one of TV&#x27;s most conventional and least inventive forms—the talk show—and infuse it with freshness and imagination.&quot;

In 1993, the company produced two shows: one was the sitcom &quot;The Building&quot;, starring Bonnie Hunt, and the other was the new late night program &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, both on CBS. Although the former flopped, the latter went on to succeed, for a whopping 22-year run until 2015. In 1995, Worldwide Pants launched &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; franchise, starting with one hosted by Tom Snyder, then with Craig Kilborn, and then with Craig Ferguson. Worldwide Pants produced these &quot;Late Late Show&quot; iterations until 2015. Also that year, it teamed up with Bonnie Hunt again to start out &quot;Bonnie&quot;, which went on to last one season on the air on CBS.

In 1996, Worldwide Pants went on to greater success in primetime with the launch of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, which went on to be successful and critically acclaimed, went on for nine seasons. In 1997, David Kissinger, who was senior vice president of comedy and drama series department of Walt Disney Television, joined Worldwide Pants as vice president of the studio.

===2002–2006===
A 2002 &quot;Forbes&quot; article comments on the approach Letterman takes for Worldwide Pants television productions:
:Letterman&#x27;s approach is to nurture an idea with seed money from his production company, then get someone else to pay for the rest of it. He isn&#x27;t particularly hands-on once the programs get past the initial stages, but his imprimatur carries weight with network buyers. &quot;They&#x27;ve got a point of view about everything they do,&quot; says Chris Albrecht, president of original programming at HBO. &quot;These guys are making television every night and have been for a long time. You feel more comfortable with them.&quot;

The company produced its first film, &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;, a prequel to the TV show of the same name. The film premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, within the &quot;Park City at Midnight&quot; category. Warner Independent Pictures subsequently signed up as North American distributor of the film, before ThinkFilm acquired the rights from Warner, giving it a limited release in summer 2006. The film grossed slightly more than $2 million, on a $2 million production budget and $1.5 million prints and advertising budget.

In April 2005 the Sci-Fi Channel announced that Worldwide Pants would produce a half-hour animated ensemble comedy for the channel from Brendon Small, called &quot;Barbarian Chronicles&quot;. A subsequent interview with Small confirmed there were no plans to go through with the deal.

===2007 WGA strike===

Production of new episodes of the company&#x27;s two late-night CBS talk shows ceased on November 5, 2007, when the Worldwide Pants writers joined the strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the trade association of which Worldwide Pants is a member.

During the first part of the strike reruns of Worldwide Pants shows were aired. This changed when Worldwide Pants broke ranks with the AMPTP by negotiating an independent, interim collective bargaining agreement with the Writers Guild of America in which Worldwide Pants essentially agreed to operate in accordance with the contract demands of the WGA for the duration of the labor dispute. The agreements automatically reverted to the final contract terms that the guild reached with the AMPTP at the end of the strike. The agreement allowed both the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; to return to the airwaves with their full writing staffs on January 2, 2008.

The agreement gave Worldwide Pants and CBS a perceived advantage over their rivals at NBC. The latter network was unable to make similar arrangements for its late night programming because NBC had retained control of production operations for both &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien.&quot; Unlike CBS, NBC would have had to negotiate an agreement covering the entire network in order to have writers work on the two late night shows. NBC aired new episodes of its late night shows on the same night as CBS, but without writers. This meant, among other things, that Leno and O&#x27;Brien were unable to perform their traditional monologues without violating strike rules and were unable to secure the appearance of most celebrities, who refused to cross a picket line.

===2007–2015===
In October 2007, the media announced that Worldwide Pants would co-produce its first non-comedy project, a documentary about young adults running for public office. The documentary, titled &quot;The Youngest Candidate&quot;, was written and directed by Jason Pollock and premiered July 2008 at the Traverse City Film Festival.

In March 2008, Eco Media announced a &quot;content partnership&quot; with Worldwide Pants to &quot;create original, unscripted, environment-related content, in the style of &quot;The Late Show&quot; remote segments, for television and Internet distribution.&quot;

In 2008 Worldwide Pants signed a product placement deal with Ford to promote the Ford Flex during &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, using a series of weekly custom-written skits in which Ferguson played the leader of a band riding in a Flex as they traveled from Los Angeles International Airport to the CBS Studio.

In April 2010, Worldwide Pants started Clear Entertainment, a.k.a. C.E. Music, a record label and announced the signing of their first band Runner Runner, a pop-punk group from Huntington Beach, California.

In April 2012, CBS announced that it would begin co-producing &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Worldwide Pants, part of a deal that included extending Ferguson&#x27;s contract until 2014.

In October 2012, Worldwide Pants and B&amp;B Productions—a subsidiary of Worldwide Pants created by Rob Burnett and Jon Beckerman—announced they had secured the rights to adapt Jonathan Evison&#x27;s novel &quot;The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving&quot; as a feature film.

The company&#x27;s principal property, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, wrapped up production in 2015. Its production of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; also ended once James Corden&#x27;s version of the franchise launched in March 2015, though Worldwide Pants did continue to produce the show while it was fronted by a series of guest hosts between the departure of Craig Ferguson at the end of 2014 and Corden&#x27;s premiere. The company is not producing either &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; or &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, both of which are owned outright by CBS.

===Post-&quot;Late Show&quot; (2015–present)===
The company didn&#x27;t shut down with Letterman&#x27;s retirement from late night television; however, its future direction was unclear at the time of Letterman&#x27;s finale. CEO Rob Burnett said at the time of &quot;Late Show&quot;&#x27;s finale: &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t know what the future of Worldwide Pants will be... We&#x27;ve built a brand here. There is value. Ultimately it will be to Dave to decide what he wants to do with that.&quot; Burnett indicated that he will likely step down as CEO in order to focus on his own projects once matters dealing with &quot;Late Show&quot;&#x27;s winding down are concluded. The company moved out of the 13 story office building above the Ed Sullivan Theater, its home for 22 years, and relocated to Los Angeles.

In early 2017, Worldwide Pants won a lawsuit over royalties.

In an interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine published in March 2017, Letterman said of the company: &quot;Worldwide Pants is now on pause. Years ago, I wanted Worldwide Pants to be an ongoing organism whereby we could continue to employ people and develop material. In the meantime, things changed out from under us. It was explained to me that that production model doesn’t hold up anymore. So Worldwide Pants ran out of steam for lack of opportunity. But we are trying to put it back together. It would be fun not to be involved in traditional ABC, NBC, CBS television. There’s a billion different places to put something now.&quot;

Due to its ownership of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and various iterations of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, Worldwide Pants is also the owner of a considerable library of archival footage from both programs which, according to Burnett, &quot;is extremely valuable if handled correctly&quot;. Worldwide Pants made excerpts from &quot;Late Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot; (licensed from NBC) available on YouTube in 2022, coinciding with &quot;Late Night&quot;&#x27;s launch 40 years ago.

Worldwide Pants is currently the co-producer with RadicalMedia of Letterman&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman&quot;.

<text>The [[Iraq War]] began in 2003 and involved a two-phase conflict comprising an initial invasion of Iraq led by U.S. and UK forces and a longer, eight-year phase of occupation and fighting with insurgents.

The Iraqi conflict (2003–present) that started with the 2003 to 2011 Iraq War has seen several phases of insurgency and open conflict:
* Iraqi Civil War (2006–2008), civil war mainly between sectarian militant groups and Iraqi forces and their respective allies
* Iraqi insurgency (2011–2013), the surge in violence involving the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) that occurred immediately following the end of the 2003 to 2011 Iraq War
* War in Iraq (2013–2017), conflict with ISIL that began when the initial two-year-long insurgency escalated in December 2013
* ISIL insurgency in Iraq (2017–present), low-level ISIL insurgency following territorial defeat in Iraq in 2017

Iraq War may also refer to:
* Mesopotamian campaign (1914–1918)
* Iraqi revolt of 1920 against the British
* Anglo-Iraqi War (1941)
* Gulf War (1990–1991) (referred to by some as the First Iraq War)
* Iraqi no-fly zones conflict (1991–2003)

<text>Literature in the Esperanto language began before the first official publication in Esperanto in 1887: the language&#x27;s creator, L. L. Zamenhof, translated poetry and prose into the language as he was developing it as a test of its completeness and expressiveness, and published several translations and a short original poem as an appendix to the first book on the language, &quot;Unua Libro&quot;. Other early speakers wrote poetry, stories, and essays in the language; Henri Vallienne was the first to write novels in Esperanto. The first female Esperanto novelist was Edith Alleyne Sinnotte with her book &quot;Lilio&quot; published in 1918&quot;.&quot; Except for a handful of poems, most of the literature from Esperanto&#x27;s first two decades is now regarded as of historical interest only.

Between the two World Wars, several new poets and novelists published their first works, including several recognized as the first to produce work of outstanding quality in the still-young language: Julio Baghy, Eŭgeno Miĥalski, Kálmán Kalocsay, Heinrich Luyken, and Jean Forge.

Modern authors include Claude Piron and William Auld, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, , Trevor Steele, , Julia Sigmund, Sen Rodin, Eugène de Zilah, , Manuel de Seabra, Baldur Ragnarsson, Jorge Camacho, Victor Sadler, , , Benoît Philippe and others. 

Esperanto has seen a solid production of material in braille since the work of the blind Russian Esperantist Vasili Eroshenko, who wrote and taught in Japan and China in the 1910s and 1920s, and Harold Brown wrote several modern plays in Esperanto.

The largest Esperanto book service at the Universal Esperanto Association offers around 4,000 books in its catalog. About 130 novels have been published originally in Esperanto. Two major literary magazines: &quot;Literatura Foiro&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, are published regularly; some other magazines, such as &quot;Monato&quot;, also publish fiction.

The most comprehensive guide to the literature of the language is Geoffrey Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto&quot;, published under the auspices of the Esperanto-speaking Writers&#x27; Association by Mondial.

<text>William Auld (6 November 1924 – 11 September 2006) was a British poet, author, translator and magazine editor who wrote chiefly in Esperanto.

==Life==

Auld was born at Erith in Kent, and then moved to Glasgow with his parents, attending Allan Glen&#x27;s School. After wartime service as a spitfire pilot in the Royal Air Force, he studied English literature at Glasgow University, and then qualified as a teacher.

In 1952 he married his childhood sweetheart Margaret (Meta) Barr Stewart, also an Esperantist, and had two children. In 1960, he was appointed to a secondary school in Alloa and he remained there for the rest of his life. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1999, 2004, and 2006, making him the first person nominated for works in Esperanto.

His masterpiece, &quot;La infana raso&quot; (&quot;The Infant Race&quot;), is a long poem that, in Auld&#x27;s words, explores &quot;the role of the human race in time and in the cosmos,&quot; and is partly based on &quot;The Cantos&quot; by Ezra Pound.

Auld began to learn Esperanto in 1937 but only became active in the propagation of the language in 1947, and from then on wrote many works in Esperanto. He edited various magazines and reviews, including &quot;Esperanto en Skotlando&quot; (1949–1955), &quot;Esperanto&quot; (1955–1958, 1961–1962), &quot;Monda Kulturo&quot; (1962–1963), &quot;Norda Prismo&quot; (1968–1972), &quot;La Brita Esperantisto&quot; (1973–1999) and &quot;Fonto&quot; (1980–1987).

He was Vice President of the Universal Esperanto Association (1977–1980), President of the Academy of Esperanto (1979–1983), and President of the Esperanto PEN Centre (1999–2005). He donated his personal collection of nearly 5000 books in and about Esperanto to the National Library of Scotland, where it is now housed, in 2001.

He died in Dolair/Dollar, Clackmannanshire, and is buried in Dollar churchyard. The grave lies on the approach path to the church from the main road.

<text>The stamen (: stamina or stamens) is a part consisting of the male reproductive organs of a flower. Collectively, the stamens form the androecium.

==Morphology and terminology==

A stamen typically consists of a stalk called the filament and an anther which contains microsporangia. Most commonly anthers are two-lobed (each lobe is termed a locule) and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther. The sterile tissue between the lobes is called the connective, an extension of the filament containing conducting strands. It can be seen as an extension on the dorsal side of the anther. A pollen grain develops from a microspore in the microsporangium and contains the male gametophyte. The size of anthers differs greatly, from a tiny fraction of a millimeter in &quot;Wolfia&quot; spp up to five inches (13 centimeters) in &quot;Canna iridiflora&quot; and &quot;Strelitzia nicolai&quot;.

The stamens in a flower are collectively called the androecium. The androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen (i.e. a single locule) as in &quot;Canna&quot; species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in the saguaro (&quot;Carnegiea gigantea&quot;). The androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns, some of them highly complex. It generally surrounds the gynoecium and is surrounded by the perianth. A few members of the family Triuridaceae, particularly &quot;Lacandonia schismatica&quot; and &quot;Lacandonia brasiliana&quot;, along with a few species of &quot;Trithuria&quot; (family Hydatellaceae) are exceptional in that their gynoecia surround their androecia.

==Etymology==
* Stamen is the Latin word meaning &quot;thread&quot; (originally thread of the warp, in weaving).
* Filament derives from classical Latin , meaning &quot;thread&quot;
* Anther derives from French , from classical Latin , meaning &quot;medicine extracted from the flower&quot; in turn from Ancient Greek (), feminine of () meaning &quot;flowery&quot;, from () meaning &quot;flower&quot;
* Androecium (: androecia) derives from Ancient Greek () meaning &quot;man&quot;, and () meaning &quot;house&quot; or &quot;chamber/room&quot;.

==Variation in morphology==

Depending on the species of plant, some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the floral axis. They also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways, including fusion of some but not all stamens. The filaments may be fused and the anthers free, or the filaments free and the anthers fused. Rather than there being two locules, one locule of a stamen may fail to develop, or alternatively the two locules may merge late in development to give a single locule. Extreme cases of stamen fusion occur in some species of &quot;Cyclanthera&quot; in the family Cucurbitaceae and in section &quot;Cyclanthera&quot; of genus &quot;Phyllanthus&quot; (family Euphorbiaceae) where the stamens form a ring around the gynoecium, with a single locule. Plants having a single stamen are referred to as &quot;monandrous.&quot;

==Pollen production==
A typical anther contains four microsporangia. The &quot;microsporangia&quot; form sacs or pockets (&quot;locules&quot;) in the anther (anther sacs or pollen sacs). The two separate locules on each side of an anther may fuse into a single locule. Each microsporangium is lined with a nutritive tissue layer called the &quot;tapetum&quot; and initially contains diploid pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. The spores may remain attached to each other in a tetrad or separate after meiosis. Each microspore then divides mitotically to form an immature microgametophyte called a pollen grain.

The pollen is eventually released when the anther forms openings (dehisces). These may consist of longitudinal slits, pores, as in the heath family (Ericaceae), or by valves, as in the barberry family (Berberidaceae). In some plants, notably members of Orchidaceae and Asclepiadoideae, the pollen remains in masses called pollinia, which are adapted to attach to particular pollinating agents such as birds or insects. More commonly, mature pollen grains separate and are dispensed by wind or water, pollinating insects, birds or other pollination vectors.

Pollen of angiosperms must be transported to the stigma, the receptive surface of the carpel, of a compatible flower, for successful pollination to occur. After arriving, the pollen grain (an immature microgametophyte) typically completes its development. It may grow a pollen tube and undergo mitosis to produce two sperm nuclei.

== Sexual reproduction in plants ==
In the typical flower (that is, in the majority of flowering plant species) each flower has both carpels and stamens. In some species, however, the flowers are unisexual with only carpels or stamens. (monoecious = both types of flowers found on the same plant; dioecious = the two types of flower found only on different plants). A flower with only stamens is called androecious. A flower with only carpels is called gynoecious.

A pistil consists of one or more carpels. A flower with functional stamens but no functional pistil is called a staminate flower, or (inaccurately) a male flower. A flower with a functional pistil but no functional stamens is called a pistillate flower, or (inaccurately) a female flower.

An abortive or rudimentary stamen is called a staminodium or staminode, such as in &quot;Scrophularia nodosa&quot;.

The carpels and stamens of orchids are fused into a column. The top part of the column is formed by the anther, which is covered by an anther cap.

== Terminology ==
;Stamen 
Stamens can also be adnate (fused or joined from more than one whorl):
* epipetalous: adnate to the corolla
* epiphyllous: adnate to undifferentiated tepals (as in many Liliaceae)
They can have different lengths from each other:
* didymous: two equal pairs
* didynamous: occurring in two pairs, a long pair and a shorter pair
* tetradynamous: occurring as a set of six stamens with four long and two shorter ones
or respective to the rest of the flower (perianth):
* exserted: extending beyond the corolla
* included: not extending beyond the corolla
They may be arranged in one of two different patterns:
* spiral; or
* whorled: one or more discrete whorls (series) 
They may be arranged, with respect to the petals:
* diplostemonous: in two whorls, the outer alternating with the petals, while the inner is opposite the petals.
* haplostemenous: having a single series of stamens, equal in number to the proper number of petals and alternating with them
* obdiplostemonous: in two whorls, with twice the number of stamens as petals, the outer opposite the petals, inner opposite the sepals, e.g. Simaroubaceae (&quot;see diagram&quot;)

;Connective
Where the connective is very small, or imperceptible, the anther lobes are close together, and the connective is referred to as discrete, e.g. &quot;Euphorbia&quot; pp., &quot;Adhatoda zeylanica&quot;. Where the connective separates the anther lobes, it is called divaricate, e.g. &quot;Tilia&quot;, &quot;Justicia gendarussa&quot;. The connective may also be a long and stalk-like, crosswise on the filament, this is a distractile connective, e.g. &quot;Salvia&quot;. The connective may also bear appendages, and is called appendiculate, e.g. &quot;Nerium odorum&quot; and some other species of Apocynaceae. In &quot;Nerium&quot;, the appendages are united as a staminal corona.

;Filament
A column formed from the fusion of multiple filaments is known as an androphore. Stamens can be connate (fused or joined in the same whorl) as follows:
* extrorse: anther dehiscence directed away from the centre of the flower. Cf. introrse, directed inwards, and latrorse towards the side.
* monadelphous: fused into a single, compound structure
* declinate: curving downwards, then up at the tip (also – declinate-descending)
* diadelphous: joined partially into two androecial structures
* pentadelphous: joined partially into five androecial structures
* synandrous: only the anthers are connate (such as in the Asteraceae). The fused stamens are referred to as a synandrium.

;Anther
Anther shapes are variously described by terms such as linear, rounded, sagittate, sinuous, or reniform.

The anther can be attached to the filament&#x27;s connective in two ways:
* basifixed: attached at its base to the filament
** pseudobasifixed: a somewhat misnomer configuration where connective tissue extends in a tube around the filament tip
* dorsifixed: attached at its center to the filament, usually versatile (able to move)

<text>A credit rating agency (CRA, also called a ratings service) is a company that assigns credit ratings, which rate a debtor&#x27;s ability to pay back debt by making timely principal and interest payments and the likelihood of default. An agency may rate the creditworthiness of issuers of debt obligations, of debt instruments, and in some cases, of the servicers of the underlying debt, but not of individual consumers.

Other forms of a rating agency include environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) rating agencies and the Chinese Social Credit System.

The debt instruments rated by CRAs include government bonds, corporate bonds, CDs, municipal bonds, preferred stock, and collateralized securities, such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.

The issuers of the obligations or securities may be companies, special purpose entities, state or local governments, non-profit organizations, or sovereign nations. A credit rating facilitates the trading of securities on international markets. It affects the interest rate that a security pays out, with higher ratings leading to lower interest rates. Individual consumers are rated for creditworthiness not by credit rating agencies but by credit bureaus (also called consumer reporting agencies or credit reference agencies), which issue credit scores.

The value of credit ratings for securities has been widely questioned. Hundreds of billions of securities that were given the agencies&#x27; highest ratings were downgraded to junk during the financial crisis of 2007–08. Rating downgrades during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010–12 were blamed by EU officials for accelerating the crisis.

Credit rating is a highly concentrated industry, with the &quot;Big Three&quot; credit rating agencies controlling approximately 95% of the ratings business. Moody&#x27;s Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) together control 80% of the global market, and Fitch Ratings controls a further 15%. They are externalized sell-side functions for the marketing of securities.

==History==

===Early history===
When the United States began to expand to the west and other parts of the country, so did the distance of businesses to their customers. When businesses were close to those who purchased goods or services from them, it was easy for the merchants to extend credit to them, due to their proximity and the fact that merchants knew their customers personally and knew whether or not they would be able to pay them back. As trading distances increased, merchants no longer personally knew their customers and became wary of extending credit to people who they did not know in fear of them not being able to pay them back. Business owners&#x27; hesitation to extend credit to new customers led to the birth of the credit reporting industry.

Mercantile credit agencies—the precursors of today&#x27;s rating agencies—were established in the wake of the financial crisis of 1837. These agencies rated the ability of merchants to pay their debts and consolidated these ratings in published guides. The first such agency was established in 1841 by Lewis Tappan in New York City. It was subsequently acquired by Robert Dun, who published its first ratings guide in 1859. Another early agency, John Bradstreet, formed in 1849 and published a ratings guide in 1857.

Credit rating agencies originated in the United States in the early 1900s, when ratings began to be applied to securities, specifically those related to the railroad bond market. In the United States, the construction of extensive railroad systems had led to the development of corporate bond issues to finance them, and therefore a bond market several times larger than in other countries. The bond markets in the Netherlands and Britain had been established longer but tended to be small, and revolved around sovereign governments that were trusted to honor their debts. Companies were founded to provide investors with financial information on the growing railroad industry, including Henry Varnum Poor&#x27;s publishing company, which produced a publication compiling financial data about the railroad and canal industries. Following the 1907 financial crisis, demand rose for such independent market information, in particular for independent analyses of bond creditworthiness. In 1909, financial analyst John Moody issued a publication focused solely on railroad bonds. His ratings became the first to be published widely in an accessible format, and his company was the first to charge subscription fees to investors.

In 1913, the ratings publication by Moody&#x27;s underwent two significant changes: it expanded its focus to include industrial firms and utilities, and it began to use a letter-rating system. For the first time, public securities were rated using a system borrowed from the mercantile credit rating agencies, using letters to indicate their creditworthiness. In the next few years, antecedents of the &quot;Big Three&quot; credit rating agencies were established. Poor&#x27;s Publishing Company began issuing ratings in 1916, Standard Statistics Company in 1922, and the Fitch Publishing Company in 1924.

===Post-Depression era===
In the United States, the rating industry grew and consolidated rapidly following the passage of the Glass-Steagall act of 1933 and the separation of the securities business from banking. As the market grew beyond that of traditional investment banking institutions, new investors again called for increased transparency, leading to the passage of new, mandatory disclosure laws for issuers, and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 1936, regulation was introduced to prohibit banks from investing in bonds determined by &quot;recognized rating manuals&quot; (the forerunners of credit rating agencies) to be &quot;speculative investment securities&quot; (&quot;junk bonds&quot;, in modern terminology). US banks were permitted to hold only &quot;investment grade&quot; bonds, and it was the ratings of Fitch, Moody&#x27;s, Poor&#x27;s, and Standard that legally determined which bonds were which. State insurance regulators approved similar requirements in the following decades.

From 1930 to 1980, the bonds and ratings of them were primarily relegated to American municipalities and American blue chip industrial firms. International &quot;sovereign bond&quot; rating shrivelled during the Great Depression to a handful of the most creditworthy countries, after a number of defaults of bonds issued by governments such as Germany&#x27;s.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, ratings were extended to commercial paper and bank deposits. Also during that time, major agencies changed their business model by beginning to charge bond issuers as well as investors. The reasons for this change included a growing free rider problem related to the increasing availability of inexpensive photocopy machines and the increased complexity of the financial markets.

The rating agencies added levels of gradation to their rating systems. In 1973, Fitch added plus and minus symbols to its existing letter-rating system. The following year, Standard and Poor&#x27;s did the same, and Moody&#x27;s began using numbers for the same purpose in 1982.

===Growth of bond market===

The end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 led to the liberalization of financial regulations and the global expansion of capital markets in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1975, SEC rules began explicitly referencing credit ratings. For example, the commission changed its minimum capital requirements for broker-dealers, allowing smaller reserves for higher-rated bonds; the rating would be done by &quot;nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations&quot; (NRSROs). This referred to the &quot;Big Three&quot;, but in time ten agencies (later six, due to consolidation) were identified by the SEC as NRSROs.

Rating agencies also grew in size and profitability as the number of issuers accessing the debt markets grew exponentially, both in the United States and abroad. By 2009 the worldwide bond market (total debt outstanding) reached an estimated $82.2 trillion, in 2009 dollars.

===1980s–present===
Two economic trends of the 1980s and 90s that brought significant expansion for the global capital market were
*the move away from &quot;intermediated&quot; financing (bank loans) toward cheaper and longer-term &quot;disintermediated&quot; financing (tradable bonds and other fixed income securities), and 
*the global move away from state intervention and state-led industrial adjustment toward economic liberalism based on (among other things) global capital markets and arms-length relations between government and industry.

More debt securities meant more business for the Big Three agencies, which many investors depended on to judge the securities of the capital market. US government regulators also depended on the rating agencies; they allowed pension funds and money market funds to purchase only securities rated above certain levels.

A market for low-rated, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds blossomed in the late 1970s, expanding securities financing to firms other than a few large, established blue chip corporations. Rating agencies also began to apply their ratings beyond bonds to counterparty risks, the performance risk of mortgage servicers, and the price volatility of mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities. Ratings were increasingly used in most developed countries&#x27; financial markets and in the &quot;emerging markets&quot; of the developing world. Moody&#x27;s and S&amp;P opened offices Europe, Japan, and particularly emerging markets. Non-American agencies also developed outside of the United States. Along with the largest US raters, one British, two Canadian and three Japanese firms were listed among the world&#x27;s &quot;most influential&quot; rating agencies in the early 1990s by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; publication &quot;Credit Ratings International&quot;.

Structured finance was another growth area of growth. The &quot;financial engineering&quot; of the new &quot;private-label&quot; asset-backed securities—such as subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDO), &quot;CDO-Squared&quot;, and &quot;synthetic CDOs&quot;—made them &quot;harder to understand and to price&quot; and became a profit center for rating agencies. By 2006, Moody&#x27;s earned $881 million in revenue from structured finance. By December 2008, there were over $11 trillion structured finance debt securities outstanding in the US bond market.

The Big Three issued 97%–98% of all credit ratings in the United States and roughly 95% worldwide, giving them considerable pricing power. This and credit market expansion brought them profit margins of around 50% from 2004 through 2009.

As the influence and profitability of CRAs expanded, so did scrutiny and concern about their performance and alleged illegal practices. In 1996 the US Department of Justice launched an investigation into possible improper pressuring of issuers by Moody&#x27;s in order to win business. Agencies were subjected to dozens of lawsuits by investors complaining of inaccurate ratings following the collapse of Enron, and especially after the US subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent financial crisis of 2007–2008. During that debacle, 73%—over $800 billion worth—of all mortgage-backed securities that one credit rating agency (Moody&#x27;s) had rated triple-A in 2006 were downgraded to junk status two years later. In July 2008, SIFMA formed a global task force with members drawn from a cross-section of the financial services industry, including asset managers, underwriters, and issuers, and provided industry input to lawmakers and regulators in Europe and Asia, and was designated by the U.S. President&#x27;s Working Group on Financial Markets as the private-sector group to provide the PWG with industry recommendations on credit rating matters. It published the &quot;Recommendations of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Credit Rating Agency Task Force&quot;, which included a dozen recommendations to change the credit rating agency process.

Downgrades of European and US sovereign debt were also criticized. In August 2011, S&amp;P downgraded the long-held triple-A rating of US securities. Since the spring of 2010, one or more of the Big Three relegated Greece, Portugal, and Ireland to &quot;junk&quot; status—a move that many EU officials say has accelerated a burgeoning European sovereign-debt crisis. In January 2012, amid continued eurozone instability, S&amp;P downgraded nine eurozone countries, stripping France and Austria of their triple-A ratings.

==Role in capital markets==
Credit rating agencies assess the relative credit risk of specific debt securities or structured finance instruments and borrowing entities (issuers of debt), and in some cases the creditworthiness of governments and their securities. By serving as information intermediaries, CRAs theoretically reduce information costs, increase the pool of potential borrowers, and promote liquid markets. These functions may increase the supply of available risk capital in the market and promote economic growth.

===Ratings use in bond market===

Credit rating agencies provide assessments about the creditworthiness of bonds issued by corporations, governments, and packagers of asset-backed securities. In market practice, a significant bond issuance generally has a rating from one or two of the Big Three agencies.

CRAs theoretically provide investors with an independent evaluation and assessment of debt securities&#x27; creditworthiness. However, in recent decades the paying customers of CRAs have primarily not been buyers of securities but their issuers, raising the issue of conflict of interest (see below).

In addition, rating agencies have been liable—at least in US courts—for any losses incurred by the inaccuracy of their ratings only if it is proven that they knew the ratings were false or exhibited &quot;reckless disregard for the truth&quot;. Otherwise, ratings are simply an expression of the agencies&#x27; informed opinions, protected as &quot;free speech&quot; under the First Amendment. As one rating agency disclaimer read: 
The ratings ... are and must be construed solely as, statements of opinion and not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase, sell, or hold any securities. Under an amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, this protection has been removed, but how the law will be implemented remains to be determined by rules made by the SEC and decisions by courts.

To determine a bond&#x27;s rating, a credit rating agency analyzes the accounts of the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond&#x27;s chance of default, expected loss, or a similar metric. The metrics vary somewhat between the agencies. S&amp;P&#x27;s ratings reflect default probability, while ratings by Moody&#x27;s reflect expected investor losses in the case of default. For corporate obligations, Fitch&#x27;s ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the event of default, but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure default risk. The process and criteria for rating a convertible bond are similar, although different enough that bonds and convertible bonds issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings. Some bank loans may receive ratings to assist in wider syndication and attract institutional investors.

The relative risks—the rating grades—are usually expressed through some variation of an alphabetical combination of lower- and uppercase letters, with either plus or minus signs or numbers added to further fine-tune the rating.
 
Fitch and S&amp;P use (from the most creditworthy to the least) AAA, AA, A, and BBB for investment-grade long-term credit risk and BB, CCC, CC, C, and D for &quot;speculative&quot; long-term credit risk. Moody&#x27;s long-term designators are Aaa, Aa, A, and Baa for investment grade and Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C for speculative grade. Fitch and S&amp;P use pluses and minuses (e.g., AA+ and AA−), and Moody&#x27;s uses numbers (e.g., Aa1 and Aa3) to add further gradations.

Agencies do not attach a hard number of probability of default to each grade, preferring descriptive definitions, such as &quot;the obligor&#x27;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong&quot;, (from a Standard and Poor&#x27;s definition of a AAA-rated bond) or &quot;less vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues&quot; (for a BB-rated bond). However, some studies have estimated the average risk and reward of bonds by rating. One study by Moody&#x27;s claimed that over a &quot;5-year time horizon&quot;, bonds that were given its highest rating (Aaa) had a &quot;cumulative default rate&quot; of just 0.18%, the next highest (Aa2) 0.28%, the next (Baa2) 2.11%, 8.82% for the next (Ba2), and 31.24% for the lowest it studied (B2). (See &quot;Default rate&quot; in &quot;Estimated spreads and default rates by rating grade&quot; table to right.) Over a longer time horizon, it stated, &quot;the order is by and large, but not exactly, preserved&quot;.

Another study in the &quot;Journal of Finance&quot; calculated the additional interest rate or &quot;spread&quot; that corporate bonds pay over that of &quot;riskless&quot; US Treasury bonds, according to the bonds rating. (See &quot;Basis point spread&quot; in the table to right.) Looking at rated bonds from 1973 through 1989, the authors found a AAA-rated bond paid only 43 &quot;basis points&quot; (or 43/100ths of a percentage point) more than a Treasury bond (so that it would yield 3.43% if the Treasury bond yielded 3.00%). A CCC-rated &quot;junk&quot; (or speculative) bond, on the other hand, paid over 4% more than a Treasury bond on average (7.04% if the Treasury bond yielded 3.00%) over that period.

The market also follows the benefits from ratings that result from government regulations (see below), which often prohibit financial institutions from purchasing securities rated below a certain level. For example, in the United States, in accordance with two 1989 regulations, pension funds are prohibited from investing in asset-backed securities rated below A, and savings and loan associations from investing in securities rated below BBB.

CRAs provide &quot;surveillance&quot; (ongoing review of securities after their initial rating) and may change a security&#x27;s rating if they feel its creditworthiness has changed. CRAs typically signal in advance their intention to consider rating changes. Fitch, Moody&#x27;s, and S&amp;P all use negative &quot;outlook&quot; notifications to indicate the potential for a downgrade within the next two years (one year in the case of speculative-grade credits). Negative &quot;watch&quot; notifications are used to indicate that a downgrade is likely within the next 90 days.

===Accuracy and responsiveness===

Critics maintain that this rating, outlooking, and watching of securities has not worked nearly as smoothly as agencies suggest. They point to near-defaults, defaults, and financial disasters not detected by the rating agencies&#x27; post-issuance surveillance, or ratings of troubled debt securities not downgraded until just before (or even after) bankruptcy. These include the 1970 Penn Central bankruptcy, the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the 1994 Orange County default, the Asian and Russian financial crises, the 1998 collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, the 2001 Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies, and especially the 2007–8 subprime mortgage crisis.

In the 2001 Enron accounting scandal, the company&#x27;s ratings remained at investment grade until four days before bankruptcy—though Enron&#x27;s stock had been in sharp decline for several months—when &quot;the outlines of its fraudulent practices&quot; were first revealed. Critics complained that &quot;not a single analyst at either Moody&#x27;s or S&amp;P lost his job as a result of missing the Enron fraud&quot; and &quot;management stayed the same&quot;. During the subprime crisis, when hundreds of billion of dollars&#x27; worth of triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities were abruptly downgraded from triple-A to &quot;junk&quot; status within two years of issue, the CRAs&#x27; ratings were characterized by critics as &quot;catastrophically misleading&quot; and &quot;provided little or no value&quot;. Ratings of preferred stocks also fared poorly. Despite over a year of rising mortgage delinquencies, Moody&#x27;s continued to rate Freddie Mac&#x27;s preferred stock triple-A until mid-2008, when it was downgraded to one tick above the junk bond level. Some empirical studies have also found that rather than a downgrade lowering the market price and raising the interest rates of corporate bonds, the cause and effect are reversed. Expanding yield spreads (i.e., declining value and quality) of corporate bonds precedes downgrades by agencies, suggesting it is the market that alerts the CRAs of trouble and not vice versa.

In February 2018, an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission found a serious lack of detail and rigour in many of the ratings issued by agencies. ASIC examined six agencies, including the Australian arms of Fitch, Moody&#x27;s and S&amp;P Global Ratings (the other agencies were Best Asia-Pacific, Australia Ratings and Equifax Australia). It said agencies had often paid lip service to compliance. In one case, an agency had issued an annual compliance report only a single page in length, with scant discussion of methodology. In another case, a chief executive officer of a company had signed off on a report as though a board member. Also, overseas staff of ratings agencies had assigned credit ratings despite lacking the necessary accreditation.

====Explanations of flaws====
Defenders of credit rating agencies complain of the market&#x27;s lack of appreciation. Argues Robert Clow, &quot;When a company or sovereign nation pays its debt on time, the market barely takes momentary notice ... but let a country or corporation unexpectedly miss a payment or threaten default, and bondholders, lawyers and even regulators are quick to rush the field to protest the credit analyst&#x27;s lapse.&quot; Others say that bonds assigned a low credit rating by rating agencies have been shown to default more frequently than bonds that receive a high credit rating, suggesting that ratings still serve as a useful indicator of credit risk.

A number of explanations of the rating agencies&#x27; inaccurate ratings and forecasts have been offered, especially in the wake of the subprime crisis: 
*The methodologies employed by agencies to rate and monitor securities may be inherently flawed. For instance, a 2008 report by the Financial Stability Forum singled out methodological shortcomings—especially inadequate historical data—as a contributing cause in the underestimating of the risk in structured finance products by the CRAs before the subprime mortgage crisis.
*The ratings process relies on subjective judgments. This means that governments, for example, that are being rated can often inform and influence credit rating analysts during the review process 
*The rating agencies&#x27; interest in pleasing the issuers of securities, who are their paying customers and benefit from high ratings, creates a conflict with their interest in providing accurate ratings of securities for investors buying the securities. Issuers of securities benefit from higher ratings in that many of their customers—retail banks, pension funds, money market funds, insurance companies—are prohibited by law or otherwise restrained from buying securities below a certain rating.
*The rating agencies may have been significantly understaffed during the subprime boom and thus unable to properly assess every debt instrument. 
*Agency analysts may be underpaid relative to similar positions at investment banks and Wall Street firms, resulting in a migration of credit rating analysts and the analysts&#x27; inside knowledge of rating procedures to higher-paying jobs at the banks and firms that issue the securities being rated, and thereby facilitating the manipulation of ratings by issuers. 
*The functional use of ratings as regulatory mechanisms may inflate their reputation for accuracy.

====Excessive power====
Conversely, the complaint has been made that agencies have too much power over issuers and that downgrades can even force troubled companies into bankruptcy. The lowering of a credit score by a CRA can create a vicious cycle and a self-fulfilling prophecy: not only do interest rates on securities rise, but other contracts with financial institutions may also be affected adversely, causing an increase in financing costs and an ensuing decrease in creditworthiness. Large loans to companies often contain a clause that makes the loan due in full if the company&#x27;s credit rating is lowered beyond a certain point (usually from investment grade to &quot;speculative&quot;). The purpose of these &quot;ratings triggers&quot; is to ensure that the loan-making bank is able to lay claim to a weak company&#x27;s assets before the company declares bankruptcy and a receiver is appointed to divide up the claims against the company. The effect of such ratings triggers, however, can be devastating: under a worst-case scenario, once the company&#x27;s debt is downgraded by a CRA, the company&#x27;s loans become due in full; if the company is incapable of paying all of these loans in full at once, it is forced into bankruptcy (a so-called death spiral). These ratings triggers were instrumental in the collapse of Enron. Since that time, major agencies have put extra effort into detecting them and discouraging their use, and the US SEC requires that public companies in the United States disclose their existence.

====Reform laws====
The 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated improvements to the regulation of credit rating agencies and addressed several issues relating to the accuracy of credit ratings specifically. Under Dodd-Frank rules, agencies must publicly disclose how their ratings have performed over time and must provide additional information in their analyses so investors can make better decisions. An amendment to the act also specifies that ratings are not protected by the First Amendment as free speech but are &quot;fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject to the same standards of liability and oversight as apply to auditors, securities analysts and investment bankers.&quot; Implementation of this amendment has proven difficult due to conflict between the SEC and the rating agencies. The &quot;Economist&quot; magazine credits the free speech defence at least in part for the fact that &quot;41 legal actions targeting S&amp;P have been dropped or dismissed&quot; since the crisis.

In the European Union, there is no specific legislation governing contracts between issuers and credit rating agencies. General rules of contract law apply in full, although it is difficult to hold agencies liable for breach of contract. In 2012, an Australian federal court held Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s liable for inaccurate ratings.

===Ratings use in structured finance===

Credit rating agencies play a key role in structured financial transactions such as asset-backed securities (ABS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), &quot;synthetic CDOs&quot;, or derivatives.

Credit ratings for structured finance instruments may be distinguished from ratings for other debt securities in several important ways.

*These securities are more complex and an accurate prognoses of repayment more difficult than with other debt ratings. This is because they are formed by pooling debt — usually consumer credit assets, such as mortgages, credit card or auto loans — and structured by &quot;slicing&quot; the pool into multiple &quot;tranches&quot;, each with a different priority of payment. Tranches are often likened to buckets capturing cascading water, where the water of monthly or quarterly repayment flows down to the next bucket (tranche) only if the one above has been filled with its full share and is overflowing. The higher-up the bucket in the income stream, the lower its risk, the higher its credit rating, and lower its interest payment. This means the higher-level tranches have more credit worthiness than would a conventional unstructured, untranched bond with the same repayment income stream, and allows rating agencies to rate the tranches triple A or other high grades. Such securities are then eligible for purchase by pension funds and money market funds restricted to higher-rated debt, and for use by banks wanting to reduce costly capital requirements.
*CRAs are not only paid for giving ratings to structured securities, but may be paid for advice on how to structure tranches and sometimes the underlying assets that secure the debt to achieve ratings the issuer desires. This involves back and forth interaction and analysis between the sponsor of the trust that issues the security and the rating agency. During this process, the sponsor may submit proposed structures to the agency for analysis and feedback until the sponsor is satisfied with the ratings of the different tranches.
*Credit rating agencies employ varying methodologies to rate structured finance products, but generally focus on the type of pool of financial assets underlying the security and the proposed capital structure of the trust. This approach often involves a quantitative assessment in accordance with mathematical models, and may thus introduce a degree of model risk. However, bank models of risk assessment have proven less reliable than credit rating agency models, even in the base of large banks with sophisticated risk management procedures.

Aside from investors mentioned above—who are subject to ratings-based constraints in buying securities—some investors simply prefer that a structured finance product be rated by a credit rating agency. And not all structured finance products receive a credit rating agency rating. Ratings for complicated or risky CDOs are unusual and some issuers create structured products relying solely on internal analytics to assess credit risk.

====Subprime mortgage boom and crisis====

The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has described the Big Three rating agencies as &quot;key players in the process&quot; of mortgage securitization, providing reassurance of the soundness of the securities to money manager investors with &quot;no history in the mortgage business&quot;.

Credit rating agencies began issuing ratings for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the mid-1970s. In subsequent years, the ratings were applied to securities backed by other types of assets. During the first years of the twenty-first century, demand for highly rated fixed income securities was high. Growth was particularly strong and profitable in the structured finance industry during the 2001-2006 subprime mortgage boom, and business with finance industry accounted for almost all of the revenue growth at at least one of the CRAs (Moody&#x27;s).

From 2000 to 2007, Moody&#x27;s rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities as triple-A. In contrast only six (private sector) companies in the United States were given that top rating.

Rating agencies were even more important in rating collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These securities mortgage/asset backed security tranches lower in the &quot;waterfall&quot; of repayment that could not be rated triple-A, but for whom buyers had to be found or the rest of the pool of mortgages and other assets could not be securitized. Rating agencies solved the problem by rating 70% to 80% 
of the CDO tranches triple-A. Still another innovative structured product most of whose tranches were also given high ratings was the &quot;synthetic CDO&quot;. Cheaper and easier to create than ordinary &quot;cash&quot; CDOs, they paid insurance premium-like payments from credit default swap &quot;insurance&quot;, instead of interest and principal payments from house mortgages. If the insured or &quot;referenced&quot; CDOs defaulted, investors lost their investment, which was paid out much like an insurance claim.

====Conflict of interest====
However, when it was discovered that the mortgages had been sold to buyers who could not pay them, massive numbers of securities were downgraded, the securitization &quot;seized up&quot; and the Great Recession ensued.

Critics blamed this underestimation of the risk of the securities on the conflict between two interests the CRAs have—rating securities accurately, and serving their customers, the security issuers who need high ratings to sell to investors subject to ratings-based constraints, such as pension funds and life insurance companies.
While this conflict had existed for years, the combination of CRA focus on market share and earnings growth, the importance of structured finance to CRA profits, and pressure from issuers who began to &#x27;shop around&#x27; for the best ratings brought the conflict to a head between 2000 and 2007.

A small number of arrangers of structured finance products—primarily investment banks—drive a large amount of business to the ratings agencies, and thus have a much greater potential to exert undue influence on a rating agency than a single corporate debt issuer.

A 2013 Swiss Finance Institute study of structured debt ratings from S&amp;P, Moody&#x27;s, and Fitch found that agencies provide better ratings for the structured products of issuers that provide them with more overall bilateral rating business. This effect was found to be particularly pronounced in the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis. Alternative accounts of the agencies&#x27; inaccurate ratings before the crisis downplay the conflict of interest factor and focus instead on the agencies&#x27; overconfidence in rating securities, which stemmed from faith in their methodologies and past successes with subprime securitizations.

As a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, various legal requirements were introduced to increase the transparency of structured finance ratings. The European Union now requires credit rating agencies to use an additional symbol with ratings for structured finance instruments in order to distinguish them from other rating categories.

===Ratings use in sovereign debt===
Credit rating agencies also issue credit ratings for sovereign borrowers, including national governments, states, municipalities, and sovereign-supported international entities. Sovereign borrowers are the largest debt borrowers in many financial markets. Governments from both advanced economies and emerging markets borrow money by issuing government bonds and selling them to private investors, either overseas or domestically. Governments from emerging and developing markets may also choose to borrow from other government and international organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Sovereign credit ratings represent an assessment by a rating agency of a sovereign&#x27;s ability and willingness to repay its debt. The rating methodologies used to assess sovereign credit ratings are broadly similar to those used for corporate credit ratings, although the borrower&#x27;s &quot;willingness&quot; to repay receives extra emphasis since national governments may be eligible for debt immunity under international law, thus complicating repayment obligations. In addition, credit assessments reflect not only the long-term perceived default risk, but also short- or immediate-term political and economic developments. Differences in sovereign ratings between agencies may reflect varying qualitative evaluations of the investment environment.

National governments may solicit credit ratings to generate investor interest and improve access to the international capital markets. Developing countries often depend on strong sovereign credit ratings to access funding in international bond markets. Once ratings for a sovereign have been initiated, the rating agency will continue to monitor for relevant developments and adjust its credit opinion accordingly.

A 2010 International Monetary Fund study concluded that ratings were a reasonably good indicator of sovereign default risk. However, credit rating agencies were criticized for failing to predict the 1997 Asian financial crisis and for downgrading countries in the midst of that turmoil. Similar criticisms emerged after recent credit downgrades to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, although credit ratings agencies had begun to downgrade peripheral Eurozone countries well before the Eurozone crisis began.

====Conflict of interest in assigning sovereign ratings====
As part of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, Congress ordered the U.S. SEC to develop a report, titled &quot;Report on the Role and Function of Credit Rating Agencies in the Operation of the Securities Markets&quot; detailing how credit ratings are used in U.S. regulation and the policy issues this use raises. Partly as a result of this report, in June 2003, the SEC published a &quot;concept release&quot; called &quot;Rating Agencies and the Use of Credit Ratings under the Federal Securities Laws&quot; that sought public comment on many of the issues raised in its report. Public comments on this concept release have also been published on the SEC&#x27;s website.

In December 2004, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published a Code of Conduct for CRAs that, among other things, is designed to address the types of conflicts of interest that CRAs face. All of the major CRAs have agreed to sign on to this Code of Conduct and it has been praised by regulators ranging from the European Commission to the US SEC.

===Use by government regulators===
Regulatory authorities and legislative bodies in the United States and other jurisdictions rely on credit rating agencies&#x27; assessments of a broad range of debt issuers, and thereby attach a regulatory function to their ratings. This regulatory role is a derivative function in that the agencies do not publish ratings for that purpose. Governing bodies at both the national and international level have woven credit ratings into 
minimum capital requirements for banks, allowable investment alternatives for many institutional investors, and similar restrictive regulations for insurance companies and other financial market participants.

The use of credit ratings by regulatory agencies is not a new phenomenon. In the 1930s, regulators in the United States used credit rating agency ratings to prohibit banks from investing in bonds that were deemed to be below investment grade. In the following decades, state regulators outlined a similar role for agency ratings in restricting insurance company investments. From 1975 to 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recognized the largest and most credible agencies as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, and relied on such agencies exclusively for distinguishing between grades of creditworthiness in various regulations under federal securities laws. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 created a voluntary registration system for CRAs that met a certain minimum criteria, and provided the SEC with broader oversight authority.

The practice of using credit rating agency ratings for regulatory purposes has since expanded globally. Today, financial market regulations in many countries contain extensive references to ratings. The Basel III accord, a global bank capital standardization effort, relies on credit ratings to calculate minimum capital standards and minimum liquidity ratios.

The extensive use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes can have a number of unintended effects. Because regulated market participants must follow minimum investment grade provisions, ratings changes across the investment/non-investment grade boundary may lead to strong market price fluctuations and potentially cause systemic reactions. The regulatory function granted to credit rating agencies may also adversely affect their original market information function of providing credit opinions.

Against this background and in the wake of criticism of credit rating agencies following the subprime mortgage crisis, legislators in the United States and other jurisdictions have commenced to reduce rating reliance in laws and regulations. The 2010 Dodd–Frank Act removes statutory references to credit rating agencies, and calls for federal regulators to review and modify existing regulations to avoid relying on credit ratings as the sole assessment of creditworthiness.

==Industry structure==

=== The Big Three agencies ===
Credit rating is a highly concentrated industry, with the &quot;Big Three&quot; credit rating agencies controlling approximately 95% of the ratings business. Moody&#x27;s Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) together control 80% of the global market, and Fitch Ratings controls a further 15%.

 S&amp;P is the largest of the three, with 1.2 million outstanding ratings and 1,416 analysts and supervisors; Moody&#x27;s has 1 million outstanding ratings and 1,252 analysts and supervisors; and Fitch is the smallest, with approximately 350,000 outstanding ratings, and is sometimes used as an alternative to S&amp;P and Moody&#x27;s.

The three largest agencies are not the only sources of credit information. Many smaller rating agencies also exist, mostly serving non-US markets. All of the large securities firms have internal fixed income analysts who offer information about the risk and volatility of securities to their clients. And specialized risk consultants working in a variety of fields offer credit models and default estimates.

Market share concentration is not a new development in the credit rating industry. Since the establishment of the first agency in 1909, there have never been more than four credit rating agencies with significant market share. Even the Financial crisis of 2007–08—where the performance of the three rating agencies was dubbed &quot;horrendous&quot; by &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine—led to a drop in the share of the three by just one percent—from 98 to 97%.

The reason for the concentrated market structure is disputed. One widely cited opinion is that the Big Three&#x27;s historical reputation within the financial industry creates a high barrier of entry for new entrants. Following the enactment of the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 in the US, seven additional rating agencies attained recognition from the SEC as nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSROs). While these other agencies remain niche players, some have gained market share following the Financial crisis of 2007–08, and in October 2012 several announced plans to join together and create a new organization called the Universal Credit Rating Group. The European Union has considered setting up a state-supported EU-based agency. In November 2013, credit ratings organizations from five countries (CPR of Portugal, CARE Rating of India, GCR of South Africa, MARC of Malaysia, and SR Rating of Brazil) joint ventured to launch ARC Ratings, a new global agency touted as an alternative to the &quot;Big Three&quot;.

===Business models===
Credit rating agencies generate revenue from a variety of activities related to the production and distribution of credit ratings. The sources of the revenue are generally the issuer of the securities or the investor. Most agencies operate under one or a combination of business models: the subscription model and the issuer-pays model. However, agencies may offer additional services using a combination of business models.

Under the subscription model, the credit rating agency does not make its ratings freely available to the market, so investors pay a subscription fee for access to ratings. This revenue provides the main source of agency income, although agencies may also provide other types of services. Under the issuer-pays model, agencies charge issuers a fee for providing credit rating assessments. This revenue stream allows issuer-pays credit rating agencies to make their ratings freely available to the broader market, especially via the Internet.

The subscription approach was the prevailing business model until the early 1970s, when Moody&#x27;s, Fitch, and finally Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s adopted the issuer-pays model. Several factors contributed to this transition, including increased investor demand for credit ratings, and widespread use of information sharing technology—such as fax machines and photocopiers—which allowed investors to freely share agencies&#x27; reports and undermined demand for subscriptions. Today, eight of the nine nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) use the issuer-pays model, only Egan-Jones maintains an investor subscription service. Smaller, regional credit rating agencies may use either model. For example, China&#x27;s oldest rating agency, Chengxin Credit Management Co., uses the issuer-pays model. The Universal Credit Ratings Group, formed by Beijing-based Dagong Global Credit Rating, Egan-Jones of the U.S. and Russia&#x27;s RusRatings, uses the investor-pays model, while Dagong Europe Credit Rating, the other joint-venture of Dagong Global Credit Rating, uses the issuer-pays model.

Critics argue that the issuer-pays model creates a potential conflict of interest because the agencies are paid by the organizations whose debt they rate. However, the subscription model is also seen to have disadvantages, as it restricts the ratings&#x27; availability to paying investors. Issuer-pays CRAs have argued that subscription-models can also be subject to conflicts of interest due to pressures from investors with strong preferences on product ratings. In 2010 Lace Financials, a subscriber-pays agency later acquired by Kroll Ratings, was fined by the SEC for violating securities rules to the benefit of its largest subscriber.

A 2009 World Bank report proposed a &quot;hybrid&quot; approach in which issuers who pay for ratings are required to seek additional scores from subscriber-based third parties. Other proposed alternatives include a &quot;public-sector&quot; model in which national governments fund the rating costs, and an &quot;exchange-pays&quot; model, in which stock and bond exchanges pay for the ratings. Crowd-sourced, collaborative models such as Wikirating have been suggested as an alternative to both the subscription and issuer-pays models, although it is a recent development as of the 2010, and not yet widely used.

====Oligopoly produced by regulation====

Agencies are sometimes accused of being oligopolists, because barriers to market entry are high and rating agency business is itself reputation-based (and the finance industry pays little attention to a rating that is not widely recognized). In 2003, the US SEC submitted a report to Congress detailing plans to launch an investigation into the anti-competitive practices of credit rating agencies and issues including conflicts of interest.

Think tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that the Basel II/III &quot;capital adequacy&quot; norms favored at first essentially by the central banks of France, Germany and Switzerland (while the US and the UK were rather lukewarm) have unduly encouraged the use of ready-made opinions produced by oligopolistic rating agencies

Of the large agencies, only Moody&#x27;s is a separate, publicly held corporation that discloses its financial results without dilution by non-ratings businesses, and its high profit margins (which at times have been greater than 50 percent of gross margin) can be construed as consistent with the type of returns one might expect in an industry which has high barriers to entry. Celebrated investor Warren Buffett described the company as &quot;a natural duopoly&quot;, with &quot;incredible&quot; pricing power, when asked by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission about his ownership of 15% of the company.

According to professor Frank Partnoy, the regulation of CRAs by the SEC and Federal Reserve Bank has eliminated competition between CRAs and practically forced market participants to use the services of the three big agencies, Standard and Poor&#x27;s, Moody&#x27;s and Fitch.

SEC Commissioner Kathleen Casey has said that these CRAs have acted much like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other companies that dominate the market because of government actions. When the CRAs gave ratings that were &quot;catastrophically misleading, the large rating agencies enjoyed their most profitable years ever during the past decade.&quot;

To solve this problem, Ms. Casey (and others such as NYU professor Lawrence White) have proposed removing the NRSRO rules completely. Professor Frank Partnoy suggests that the regulators use the results of the credit risk swap markets rather than the ratings of NRSROs.

The CRAs have made competing suggestions that would, instead, add further regulations that would make market entrance even more expensive than it is now.

<doc id="193035" wikidata="Q88240" url="?curid=193035" title="720°">
<text>720° is a skateboarding video game released in arcades by Atari Games in 1986. The player controls a skateboarder skating around a middle-class neighborhood. By doing jumps and tricks, the player can eventually gain enough points to compete at a skate park. The game&#x27;s name comes from the &quot;ultimate&quot; trick, turning a full 720° (two complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.

==Plot==
From official materials:
:&quot;It&#x27;s just you, your trusty skateboard, and a hundred bucks as you skate, jump, slide, spin and move through four levels of difficulty, picking up loose cash, earning money through events, and finally, earning a ticket to one of the big skate parks! If you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll get to buy some rad equipment to make you the coolest skateboarder alive&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game begins with the player controlling a skateboarder skating around a middle-class neighborhood using common objects as ramps for jumps.

The player begins with a number of &quot;tickets&quot;, each of which grants admission to one of four skate parks, or &quot;events&quot; in Skate City, the &quot;hub&quot; between the parks. When a park is entered, one ticket is expended. The player gains additional tickets by earning points. Whenever the player isn&#x27;t in an event, a bar counts down the time remaining until the arrival of a swarm of killer bees accompanied by the caption of &quot;SKATE OR DIE!&quot;. Once the bees arrive, the player still has a small amount of time to make it to a park. The longer the player delays this, the faster the bees become until they are unavoidable. Getting caught by the bees ends the game, but on default settings, the player may elect to continue by inserting more money. Reaching a park with a ticket gives the player the chance to earn points, medals and money. The money is used to upgrade equipment and the timer will reset upon completion of an event.

The player constantly races to perform stunts, both in the events and in the park itself, to earn the points needed to acquire tickets. Thus, the player&#x27;s score is directly tied to the amount of time available to play the game. In order to win, the player must complete a total of sixteen events through four hubs.

===Structure===

The game is four levels each consisting of four events:
* Ramp: the player skates around a half-pipe structure, trying to gain more and more height and performing tricks in the air to earn the most possible points. This ends when the timer runs out.
* Downhill: a long course consisting of slopes and banks must be navigated to reach the finish line. The quicker the player reaches the finish, the more points are earned.
* Slalom: an obstacle course in which the player is required to pass between pairs of yellow flags scattered across the course. Each gate passed grants a little extra time, and scoring depends on time remaining upon crossing the finish line.
* Jump: the player jumps from a series of ramps, attempting to hit a bull&#x27;s-eye target off the screen. There are cryptic marks on the ramp before the jump that provide clues as to the location of the target. This ends when the timer runs out or the player crosses the finish line, whichever comes first.

Scattered in the levels are several &quot;map&quot; icons placed on the ground which when activated show a map with the roads, parks, shops, and the player&#x27;s location marked on it. Also scattered about the level are hazards and obstacles; jumping over hazards earns points.

The player earns points and money for high scores in each event, and doing well at the events earns the cash needed to buy equipment that improves player performance, and a chance at a bronze, silver, or gold medal. Completing all four events in all four classes finishes the game.

===Equipment===
There are four types of skating equipment to be purchased at different shops. The prices for each are the same, beginning at $25. Upon each return to Skate City after visiting a park, the price increases by $25, to a maximum of $250.

#Shoes: Allow higher jumps and faster acceleration.
#Board: Allows higher top speed.
#Pads: Give quicker recovery from wiping out.
#Helmet: Makes the player more aggressive, according to the console description, which translates to making the player spin faster.

==Arcade cabinet==
The speakers for the game are mounted atop the cabinet in a structure resembling a boombox, in line with the game&#x27;s skate-rat theme. The display is larger, and higher resolution (512x384 - same as &quot;Paperboy&quot;), than that of a contemporary arcade game. The joystick is rigidly mounted to a disc at a steep angle and moves in a circular fashion, instead of in compass directions like standard joysticks. The game also has two buttons, one for &quot;kicking&quot; (which refers not to actual &quot;kicking&quot;, but to pushing the skate board with a foot for speed) and the other for jumping.

==Development==
The game program for the arcade version was written in BLISS, and utilized the Atari System 2 hardware.

==Other versions==
The game was released to the Commodore 64 (twice) in 1987, the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1989, and the Game Boy Color in 1999. There is also an unreleased port for the Atari Lynx.

The Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, and the first Commodore 64 versions were developed by Tiertex Design Studios and published by U.S. Gold. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; described it as &quot;US Gold&#x27;s finest hour&quot;.

The Game Boy Color version was developed by Game Brains and published by Midway Games. It was originally released in March 1999 in North America and Europe.

==Reception==
The game received an overall positive reception among both users and critics. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the game 79th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;, writing that it was &quot;addicting&quot; and completely unique for its time.

==Legacy==
Emulated versions of the game are included in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, released in 2003 and 2004, &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot;, released in 2012.

<text>The Parlay Group was a technical industry consortium (founded 1998, ended around 2007) that specified APIs for the telephone network. These APIs enable the creation of services by organizations both inside and outside of the traditional carrier environment. In fact, it is hoped that services can be created by IT developers, rather than telephony experts.

== Parlay/OSA ==
Parlay/OSA was an open API for the telephone network. It was developed by The Parlay Group, which worked closely with ETSI and 3GPP, which all co-publish it. Within 3GPP, Parlay is part of Open Services Access.

Parlay APIs include: call control, conferencing, user interaction (audio and text messaging, SMS/MMS), and billing. The APIs are specified in the CORBA Interface definition language and WSDL. The use of CORBA enables remote access between the Parlay gateway and the application code. A set of Java mappings allow the APIs to be invoked locally as well. A major goal of the APIs is to be independent of the underlying telephony network technology (e.g. CDMA, GSM, landline SS7).

=== Parlay X ===

In 2003 the Parlay Group released a new set of web services called Parlay X. These are a much simpler set of APIs intended to be used by a larger community of developers. The Parlay X web services include Third Party Call Control (3PCC), location and simple payment. The Parlay X specifications complement the more powerful but more complex Parlay APIs. Parlay X implementations are now (September 2004) in commercial service from BT and Sprint.

Parlay work historically stems from the TINA effort. Parlay is somewhat related to JAIN, and is currently (early 2003) completely unrelated to the Service Creation Community.

==Parlay Technology==
The objective of Parlay/OSA is to provide an API that is independent of the underlying networking technology and of the programming technology used to create new services. As a result, the Parlay/OSA APIs are specified in UML. There are then a set of realizations, for specific programming environments:
CORBA/IDL,
Java, and
Web services specified by WSDL.

===Parlay Framework===
The role of the Parlay/OSA Framework was to provide a way for the network to authenticate applications using the Parlay/OSA API. The Framework also allows applications to discover the capabilities of the network, and provides management functions for handling fault and overload situations.

This is to ensure to a telecom network operator that any applications using the Parlay API cannot affect the security or integrity of the network.

===Implementing Parlay===
The Parlay/OSA specifications define an API, they do not say how the API is to be implemented.

The typical Parlay/OSA implementation adds a new network element - the Parlay/OSA Gateway, which implements the Framework. It may implement the individual service APIs, or may interact with other network elements such as switches to provide individual service capabilities such as call control or location.
Some vendors treat the Parlay/OSA Gateway as a stand-alone network element (e.g., the Ericsson NRG, jNetX OSA/Parlay GW, AePONA Network Gateway (formerly known as Causeway), HERIT Parlay/Parlay X Gateway), others include this function in an IN Service Control Point (e.g., the Telcordia OSP).

===Parlay and Web Services===
The Parlay X APIs define a set of simple telecom-related Web services. Parlay X Version 1, published in May 2003, defines web services for:
Third Party Call, Network Initiated Third Party Call, Send SMS, Receive SMS, Send Message, Receive Message, Amount Charging, Volume Charging, User Status and Terminal Location

Parlay X Version 2.1, published in June 2006, defines web services for:
Third Party Call, Call Notification, Short Messaging, Multimedia Messaging, Payment, Account Management, Terminal Status, Terminal Location, Call Handling, Audio Call, Multimedia Conference, Address List Management, and Presence.

The current draft specifications for Parlay X 3.0 as of September 2007 defines web services for:
Third Party Call, Call Notification, Short messaging, Multimedia Messaging, Payment, Account Management, Terminal Status, Terminal Location, Call Handling, Audio Call, Multimedia Conference, Address List Management, Presence, Message Broadcast, Geocoding, Application Driven QoS, Device Capabilities and Configuration, Multimedia Streaming control, Multimedia Multicast Session Management.

<doc id="193038" wikidata="Q14335" url="?curid=193038" title="Linth">
<text>The Linth (pronounced &quot;lint&quot;) is a Swiss river that rises near the village of Linthal in the mountains of the canton of Glarus, and eventually flows into the Obersee section of Lake Zurich. It is about in length.

The water power of the Linth was a main factor in the creation of the textile industry of the canton Glarus, and is today used to drive the Linth–Limmern power stations in its upper reaches.

The river and its upper valley forms the boundary between the mountain ranges of the Glarus Alps, to its east and south, and the Schwyzer Alps, to its west. In its lower part, in the Linth plain (), the Linth Canal forms the boundary between the cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen and part of the boundary between the cantons of St. Gallen and Schwyz.

The river lends its name to the former canton of Linth (1798–1803).

==Course of the river==

The river rises to the south-west of the village of Linthal, at the foot the Tödi mountain (elevation ). It collects the water from several glaciers, including the Clariden Glacier and the Biferten Glacier, as well as various tributary streams, including the &quot;Oberstafelbach&quot;, the &quot;Bifertenbach&quot;, the &quot;Sandbach&quot;, the &quot;Walenbach&quot; and the &quot;Limmerenbach&quot;. The last of these is dammed to create the Limmerensee, a part of the Linth–Limmern hydro-electric scheme.

The river then flows north to the village of Linthal, the highest significant settlement on the river, and onwards through the canton of Glarus villages of Rüti, Betschwanden, Diesbach, Hätzingen, Luchsingen, Leuggelbach, Haslen, Nidfurn and Schwanden. In Schwanden, the Linth is joined by one of its principal tributaries, the Sernf, which drains the south-eastern part of the canton of Glarus.

From Schwanden, the river continues to flow north through the villages of Mitlödi and Ennenda and the town of Glarus before reaching the village of Netstal. In Netstal, the Linth is joined by the Löntsch, which drains the Klöntalersee. The Linth then flows between the villages Näfels and Mollis, from where it formerly flowed in a northerly direction to a confluence with its tributary outfall from Lake Walen (Walensee) on the Linth Plain, and then across that plain in a westerly direction to its mouth at the head of the Obersee section of Lake Zurich.

As a result of the river regulation works (see below), the river is today diverted down an artificial channel in an easterly direction into Lake Walen. Another artificial channel (the Linth Channel) then takes the outfall of Lake Walen at Weesen and flows west through the Linth Plain and into the Obersee. 
== River regulation of the Linth ==
The taming of the Linth () from 1807 to 1823 was one of the great engineering feats of the early 19th century, the earliest project of such a size undertaken by the new Swiss state, and a great example of solidarity in early Switzerland.

In the second half of the 18th century, the situation of the population in the lower Glarus valley, the Linth Plain and around Lake Walen, was pretty disastrous: cutting down the woods of the Glarus valley during early industrialization led to more and more gravel coming down with the yearly spring high water which was deposited at the joining of Linth and Maag, the outflow of the Lake Walen, in the plain between Lake Walen and Lake Zurich. This caused frequent floodings and backing up of water which made the level of Lake Walen rise several meters and turned the whole countryside into swamps. Agriculture became more and more difficult, the poverty increased, and diseases like tuberculosis and malaria were rampant.

The , scientist, painter and manager Conrad Escher (later named &quot;von der Linth&quot;) from Zurich developed and executed the plan of channeling the Linth into Lake Walen, where the gravel could be deposited without damage. A second channel, the Linth Channel, connected the lakes of Walen and Zurich, replacing the former Maag.

The river regulation put an end to the floodings, lowered the level of Lake Walen by some 5.4 meters which greatly improved living conditions for the population, and dried up the swamps, resulting in 20 km2 arable land in the Linth plain.

<doc id="193040" wikidata="Q648680" url="?curid=193040" title="Joseph Bell">
<text>Joseph Bell FRCSE (2 December 1837 – 4 October 1911) was a Scottish surgeon and lecturer at the medical school of the University of Edinburgh in the 19th century. He is best known as an inspiration for the literary character, Sherlock Holmes.

==Early life==
Bell was the son of Cecilia Barbara Craigie (1813–1882) and Benjamin Bell (1810–1883), and a great-grandson of Benjamin Bell, considered to be the first Scottish scientific surgeon. Bell studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and received an MD in 1859 presenting the thesis &quot;Epithelial cancer: its pathology and treatment&quot;. During his time as a student, he was a member of the Royal Medical Society and delivered a dissertation which is still in possession of the society today.

==Career==
In his instruction, Joseph Bell emphasized the importance of close observation in making a diagnosis. To illustrate this, he would often pick a stranger, and by observing him, deduce his occupation and recent activities. These skills caused him to be considered a pioneer in forensic science, (forensic pathology in particular) at a time when science was not yet widely used in criminal investigation.

He served as personal surgeon to Queen Victoria whenever she visited Scotland. He also published several medical textbooks. Bell was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd), a justice of the peace, and a deputy lieutenant. In 1867 Bell was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as president in 1897. In 1876 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club. He was elected president of the RCSEd in 1887.

Bell wrote the book &quot;Manual of the Operations of Surgery&quot;, published in 1866.

==Personal life==
In 1883, Bell bought 2 Melville Crescent, a large townhouse, previously the home of the engineer John Miller of Leithen.

Joseph Bell died on 4 October 1911. He was buried at the Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh alongside his wife Edith Katherine (or Catherine) Erskine Murray (1840–1874) and their son Benjamin, and next to his parents&#x27; and brother&#x27;s plots. The grave is mid-way along the north wall of the northern section to the original cemetery.

===Marriage and children===
The couple had five children, of whom only three survived infancy:
* Jane (or Jean) Isabella Erskine Murray McCance (née Bell) (18 January 1866–1923)
* Cecilia Craigie Stisted (née Bell) (7 December 1867-8 July 1955)
* Benjamin Bell (14 July 1869-17 June 1893)
* Katherine (or Catherine) Bell (27 June 1872-Deceased)
* Stillborn son (1874)

==Inspiration of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;==
Arthur Conan Doyle met Bell in 1877, and served as his clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Doyle later went on to write a series of popular stories featuring the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, who Doyle stated was loosely based on Bell and his observant ways. Bell was aware of this inspiration. According to Irving Wallace (in an essay originally in his book &quot;The Fabulous Originals&quot; but later republished and updated in his collection &quot;The Sunday Gentleman&quot;), Bell was involved in several police investigations, mostly in Scotland, such as the Ardlamont mystery of 1893, usually with forensic expert Professor Henry Littlejohn. Bell also gave his analysis of the Ripper murders to Scotland Yard.

==Dramatization==
The BBC television series &quot;Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was a fictionalized account of Doyle&#x27;s time as Bell&#x27;s clerk. The series may have exaggerated Bell&#x27;s criminal investigations as well as the degree to which Holmes was based on Bell (played by Ian Richardson), and it positioned Doyle in the role of a Dr. Watson to Bell&#x27;s Holmes. The original one-off production, which led to the later series, was released on DVD and VHS in the US in 2003, titled &quot;Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle – The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

In 2006, Stone Publishing House published a book, written by historian Dr. Robert Hume, aimed at schoolchildren titled &quot;Dr. Joseph Bell – the Original Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot; in 2006, the time travelling adventurer known as the Doctor identifies himself as an ex-student of Bell to Queen Victoria.

The comic book &quot;Les dossiers du Professeur Bell&quot; by Joann Sfar is about the (fictional) supernatural adventures of Dr. Bell.

In episode 11, Season 5, of the Fox TV show &quot;House M.D.&quot;, Wilson presents House with Joseph Bell&#x27;s &quot;Manual Of the Operations of Surgery&quot; as a Christmas gift. The character of House is based on Holmes, who, as noted, was based in turn on Bell. In episode 14 of the show&#x27;s eighth and final season, House briefly comes to believe that his biological father is a man named Thomas Bell, played by prominent Scottish actor Billy Connolly.

The novel &quot;Mr. Doyle &amp; Dr. Bell&quot; (1997) by Howard Engel is a fictionalized account of Joseph Bell and his influence on Conan Doyle.

In &quot;Elementary&quot;, an American procedural drama television series that was introduced as a contemporary update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories of Sherlock Holmes, Holmes and Watson often work with a Detective called Marcus Bell, which is likely a nod to the real-life Joseph Bell.

==Memorial==
A bronze plaque memorial was erected to Joseph Bell at 2 Melville Crescent in Edinburgh, his home for his final decades, on 8 October 2011, the centenary of his death. The plaque explains Bell&#x27;s connection to Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, and was organized and funded by the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club. The building is now the Japanese Consulate in Edinburgh.

The unveiling ceremony was attended by the several people involved in the erection of the plaque (principally Takeshi Shimizu) and representatives of various Sherlock Holmes clubs and societies. All present gave a short speech on their connections to either Holmes or the project, and a speech from Professor Owen Dudley Edwards. The plaque was created and cast by Powderhall Bronze of Edinburgh.

<text>Pebble in the Sky is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1950. This work is his first novel — parts of the &quot;Foundation&quot; series had appeared from 1942 onwards in magazines, but &quot;Foundation&quot; was not published in book form until 1951. The original &quot;Foundation&quot; books are also a string of linked episodes, whereas this is a complete story involving a single group of characters.

==Publication history==
&quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; was originally written in the summer of 1947 under the title &quot;Grow Old with Me&quot; for &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, whose editor Sam Merwin, Jr. had approached Asimov to write a forty thousand word short novel for the magazine. The title was an adaption of Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Rabbi ben Ezra&quot;, the first few lines of which (starting &quot;Grow old along with me! / The best is yet to be...&quot;) were included in the final novel. It was rejected by &quot;Startling Stories&quot; on the basis that the magazine&#x27;s emphasis was more on adventure than science-heavy fiction (despite the editor inviting Asimov to write the latter as an experiment for the magazine), and again by John W. Campbell, Asimov&#x27;s usual editor. In 1949, Doubleday editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted the story on the suggestion of Frederik Pohl, on the condition it was expanded to seventy thousand words and the title changed to something more science fiction oriented, and it was published in January 1950 as &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;. &quot;Grow Old With Me&quot; was later published in its original form along with other draft stories in &quot;The Alternate Asimovs&quot; in 1986.

In &quot;Before the Golden Age&quot;, Asimov wrote that &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; was influenced by the short story &quot;Proxima Centauri&quot; by Murray Leinster.

The book has been reprinted many times: in 1953 by Galaxy, in 1957 and 1964 by Bantam, in 1958 and 1982 by Corgi as the first British edition, in 1968 by Sidgwick &amp; Jackson in hardcover, in 1969, 1972, 1974 (both paper and hard cover editions) and 1981 by Sphere Science Fiction, in 1971 and 1975 by Fawcett Books, in 1983 by Del Rey Books, in 1986 in hardcover by Grafton and in 1990 again by Doubleday in hardcover; in addition, it was reprinted as part of the &quot;Empire&quot; series, in 1986 by Ballantine Books, in 1992 by Spectra and in 2010 by Orb Books, in both print and Kindle editions.

&quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; was also included in a number of omnibuses: first in 1952 in &quot;Triangle&quot; along with the others in the &quot;Empire&quot; series (&quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; and &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; which had only been published earlier that year), in 1978 in &quot;The Far Ends of Time and Earth&quot; along with &quot;The End of Eternity&quot; and the short story collection &quot;Earth Is Room Enough&quot;, and again with the &quot;Empire&quot; series novels in 2002 as &quot;The Empire Novels&quot;.

The book was adapted for radio by Ernest Kinoy for &quot;Dimension X&quot; as &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;; first broadcast in 1951 it was released as an audio download in 2007 by Radio Spirits, and again in 2011.

==Story background==
The book begins with a retired tailor from the mid-20th century, who is accidentally pitched forward into the future. By then, Earth has become radioactive and is a low-status part of a vast Galactic Empire. There is both a mystery and a power-struggle, and a lot of debate and human choices. The protagonist is a very ordinary man, rather than the more typical space opera hero.

This book takes place in the same universe as the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Earth is part of the Empire of Trantor, later the setting for Hari Seldon&#x27;s invention of psychohistory. Asimov returned to the radioactive-Earth theme in &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot;; &quot;The Currents of Space&quot;; and &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. He would explore it most fully in &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;.

&quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; has been grouped along with &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; and &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; as the so-called &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; series. However, these are only loosely connected, occurring between the era of the Spacers and the &quot;Foundation&quot; series, but not otherwise overlapping in time, location, or theme.

In this work, unlike &quot;The End of Eternity&quot;, the time travel is one-way and uncontrolled. It is unlikely that the technologies are related, since, according to Andrew Harlan, the energy requirements for transporting a human with the Eternity&#x27;s technology far exceed the capabilities of twentieth century Earth.

One element of the novel Asimov was particularly fond of was the inclusion of a scene of exposition conducted over the course of a game of chess between two of the characters. By recounting all the moves, Asimov reacted against the common tendency of novelistic portrayals of chess games to neglect the action on the board. The game that he chose to present was a victory by Grigory Levenfish (black) over Boris Verlinsky (white) in Moscow in 1924, one which gained the victor a brilliancy-prize.

==Plot summary==
While walking down the street in Chicago, Joseph Schwartz, a retired tailor, is the unwitting victim of a nearby nuclear laboratory accident, by means of which he is instantaneously transported tens of thousands of years into the future (50,000 years, by one character&#x27;s estimate, a figure later retconned by future Asimov works as a &quot;mistake&quot;). He finds himself in a place he does not recognize, and due to apparent changes in the spoken language that far into the future, he is unable to communicate with anyone. He wanders into a farm, and is taken in by the couple that lives there. They mistake him for a mentally deficient person, and they secretly offer him as a subject for an experimental procedure to increase his mental abilities. The procedure, which has killed several subjects, works in his case, and he finds that he can quickly learn to speak the current &quot;lingua franca&quot;. He also slowly realizes that the procedure has given him strong telepathic abilities, including the ability to project his thoughts to the point of killing or injuring a person.

The Earth, at this time, is seen by the rest of the Galactic Empire as a rebellious planet — it has rebelled three times in the past — and the inhabitants are widely frowned upon and discriminated against. Earth also has several large radioactive areas, although the cause is never really described. With large uninhabitable areas, it is a very poor planet, and anyone who is unable to work is legally required to be euthanized. The people of the Earth must also be executed when they reach the age of sixty, a procedure known as &quot;The Sixty&quot;, with very few exceptions; mainly for people who have made significant contributions to society. That is a problem for Schwartz, who is now sixty-two years old.

The Earth is part of the Trantorian Galactic Empire, with a resident Procurator (who lives in a domed town in the high Himalayas) and a Galactic military garrison, but in practice it is ruled by a group of Earth-centered &quot;religious fanatics&quot; who believe in the ultimate superiority of Earthlings. They have created a new, deadly supervirus that they plan to use to kill or subjugate the rest of the Empire, and to avenge themselves for the way their planet has been treated by the galaxy at large. Citizens of the Empire are unaware of Earth&#x27;s lethal viruses, and mistakenly believe it is Earth&#x27;s radioactive environment that causes the characteristic syndrome of &quot;Radiation Fever,&quot; and that Earthlings pose the Empire no threat.

Joseph Schwartz, along with Affret Shekt, the scientist who developed the new device that boosted Schwartz&#x27;s mental powers, his daughter Pola Shekt, and visiting archaeologist Bel Arvardan, are captured by the rebels, but they escape with the help of Schwartz&#x27;s new mental abilities, and they are narrowly able to stop the plan to release the virus. Schwartz uses his mental abilities to provoke a pilot from the Imperial garrison into bombing the site where the arsenal of the super-virus exists.

The book ends on a hopeful note — perhaps the Empire can be persuaded to restore the Earth and reintroduce uncontaminated soil.

==Reception==
Boucher and McComas were disappointed by the novel, saying that despite Asimov&#x27;s good ideas, &quot;his heavy treatment and routine plot are disappointing. L. Sprague de Camp, however, recommended the novel highly, praising it as &quot;excellent; one of the few really mature and professional jobs available in book form [&quot;in 1950&quot;]. . . . Asimov&#x27;s characterization is good, his suspense is almost unbearable, and his handling of the theme of group prejudice is masterful.&quot; &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;″s Floyd C. Gale told readers &quot;Don&#x27;t miss&quot; it and the other Empire novels. Lester del Rey found the novel &quot;a first-rate story.&quot;

Although Hugo Awards were established only in 1953, too late for the novel to be eligible, it was later retroactively nominated for the Retro-Hugo Award and finished 2nd among the novels nominated for a retrospective 1951 Hugo Award for the Best Novel (of 1950) in 2001, losing to a similarly named &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein.

==Place in the wider Foundation saga==
===Chronology===
The 50,000-year estimate is at odds with the chronology given in Asimov&#x27;s later novels, in particular &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; and &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;. The latter novel indicates that the robot R. Daneel Olivaw was constructed some three thousand years after the founding of New York City. &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;, in its concluding scene, establishes that Daneel survives into the Interregnum period, after the First Galactic Empire collapses. He gives his age as (roughly) twenty thousand years. The Galactic Era dating system, to which most of Asimov&#x27;s Foundation Series adheres, places &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; approximately twelve thousand years after the events of &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;. Adding up all the differences, Joseph Schwartz&#x27;s time displacement ultimately transported him only some eleven millennia into the future.

In &quot;Foundation&quot;, the Galactic Empire has existed for 12,000 years. Nuclear power is believed to have existed for 50,000 years, even though this is long after the era of &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;.

===Historical analogy===

The obvious historical analogy is between Earth in the book and the historical situation of Judea under the Roman Empire, with the fanatics plotting rebellion against Trantor being modeled upon the Zealots who in 66 AD launched the First Jewish–Roman War which ended with destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, an event of Jewish history. This fits well in the general scheme of Trantor being the equivalent of Rome, and Trantor&#x27;s later decline in the Foundation Series being the equivalent of Rome&#x27;s decline centuries after the destruction of Jerusalem. Asimov&#x27;s position in this ancient historical controversy is clear, with the fanatic rebels being the undoubted villains of the book. It is noteworthy that Joseph Schwartz – the man from the past who ultimately foils the fanatics&#x27; plot – is clearly Jewish, and his action in effect saves the people of the future Earth from re-enacting the great tragedy of Schwartz&#x27;s own people.

===The fate of Earth===
In &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;, it is described that the Empire began a restoration of Earth, but that this was subsequently abandoned. There are also descendants of the old population at &quot;Alpha&quot;, a planet circling one of the suns of Alpha Centauri. They were settled there by the Empire, which intended to make a whole terraformed world, but which ultimately produced just one large island. Janov Pelorat stated that, if he understood the legends of Alpha correctly, the start of the restoration attempt was right before a period of much larger problems for the Empire. Daneel explains that he had a role in attempting the restoration of Earth&#x27;s soil and also settling humans at &quot;Alpha&quot;, but achieved less than he had wanted. Whether he was personally involved in the actual events of &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; is not discussed, but strongly implied. It is left open that other refugees from Earth might have settled elsewhere in the universe.

==Other media==
On June 17, 1951, the NBC radio network broadcast a much abbreviated radio dramatization of &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot; in the science fiction anthology series &quot;Dimension X&quot;. In this much abbreviated version (only 25 minutes), the whole story of time travel was cut out with Bel and Pola being the main characters. The ending was quite different, since the virus was released, leaving Earth alone as &quot;a pebble in the sky&quot;.

<doc id="193042" wikidata="Q1867374" url="?curid=193042" title="Punched card sorter">
<text>A punched card sorter is a machine for sorting decks of punched cards.

Sorting was a major activity in most facilities that processed data on punched cards using unit record equipment. The work flow of many processes required decks of cards to be put into some specific order as determined by the data punched in the cards. The same deck might be sorted differently for different processing steps. A popular family of sorters, the IBM 80 series sorters, sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter&#x27;s settings.

==Basic operation==

The basic operation of a card sorter is to take a punched card, examine a single column, and place the card into a selected pocket. There are twelve rows on a punched card, and thirteen pockets in the sorter; one pocket is for blanks, rejects, and errors. 

Cards are normally passed through the sorter face down with the bottom edge (&quot;9-edge&quot;) first. A small metal brush or optical sensor is positioned so that, as each card goes through the sorter, one column passes under the brush or optical sensor. The holes sensed in that column together with the settings of the sorter controls determine which pocket the card is to be directed to. This directing is done by slipping the card into a stack of metal strips (or &quot;chute blades&quot;) that run the length of the sorter feed mechanism. Each blade ends above one of the output pockets, and the card is thus routed to the designated pocket.

==Sorting operations==

Multiple column sorting was commonly done by first sorting the least significant column, then proceeding, column by column, to the most significant column. This is called a least significant digit radix sort.

Numeric columns have one punch in rows 0-9, possibly a sign overpunch in rows 11-12, and can be sorted in a single pass through the sorter. Alphabetic columns have a zone punch in rows 12, 11, or 0 and a digit punch in one of the rows 1-9, and can be sorted by passing some or all of the cards through the sorter twice on that column. For more details of punched card codes see punched card#IBM 80-column format and character codes.

Several methods were used for alphabetical sorting, depending on the features provided by the particular sorter and the characteristics of the data to be sorted. A commonly used method on the 082 and earlier sorters was to sort the cards twice on the same column, first on digit rows 1-9, and then (after re-stacking) on the zone rows 12, 11, and 0. Operator switches allow zone-sorting by &quot;switching off&quot; rows 1-9 for the second pass of the card for each column. 

Other special characters and punctuation marks were added to the card code, involving as many as three punches per column (and in 1964 with the introduction of EBCDIC as many as six punches per column). The 083 and 084 sorters recognized these multiple-digit or multiple-zone punches, sorting them to the error pocket.

==Earlier sorters==

Original census sorting box, 1890, manual.

Sorting cards became an issue during the 1900 agricultural census, so Herman Hollerith&#x27;s company developed the 1901 Hollerith Automatic Horizontal Sorter, a sorter with horizontal pockets.

In 1908, he designed the more compact Hollerith 070 Vertical Sorting Machine that sorted 250 cards per minute.

The Type 71 Vertical Sorter came out in 1928. It had 12 pockets that could hold 80 cards. It could sort 150 cards per minute.

The Type 75, Model 1, 19??, 400 cards per minute

The Type 75, Model 2, 19??, 250 cards per minute

==IBM 80 series Sorters==
Card Sorters in the IBM 80 series included:
*IBM 80 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine, model 1, Introduced by IBM in 1925, 450 cards per minute. This sorter was almost twice the speed of the older Hollerith 70 vertical sorter and used an entirely new magnetically operated horizontal design. At the close of 1943, IBM had 10,200 of these units on rental.
*IBM 80, model 2, 192?, 250 cards per minute
*IBM 81 Sorter, ????
*IBM 82 Sorter, 1949. Sorted cards at 650/minute
*IBM 83 Sorter, 1955. Sorted cards at 1000/minute
*IBM 84 Sorter, 1959. Sorted cards at 2000/minute

In August 1957, a basic 082 rented for $55 per month; an 083 for twice that. 
By 1969, only the 82, 83, and 84 were made available for rental by IBM.

==Modern card sorters==
In the early 2020s, TCG Machines introduced a card sorting machine to process trading card game cards. The punched cards and brushes in these modern sorters have been replaced with image sensors (cameras) and computer vision technology, but their form and operation remain essentially identical to that of their historical predecessors.

<doc id="193044" wikidata="Q4077" url="?curid=193044" title="Görlitz">
<text>Görlitz (; ; ; ; East Lusatian: , , ) is a town in the German state of Saxony. It is on the river Lusatian Neisse and is the largest town in Upper Lusatia as well as the second-largest town in the region of Lusatia after Cottbus. Görlitz is the easternmost town in Germany (the easternmost village being Zentendorf (Šćeńc)) and lies opposite the Polish town of Zgorzelec, which was the eastern part of Görlitz until 1945. The town has approximately 56,000 inhabitants, which make Görlitz the sixth-largest town in Saxony. It is the seat of the district of Görlitz. Together with Zgorzelec it forms the Euro City of Görlitz/Zgorzelec, which has a combined population of around 86,000. Whilst not Lusatiophone itself, the town is situated just east of the Sorbian-speaking parts of Lusatia.

The town&#x27;s recorded history began in the 11th century as a Sorbian settlement. Through its history it has been under German, Polish, Czech (Bohemian) and Hungarian rule. From 1815 until 1918 Görlitz belonged to the Province of Silesia in the Kingdom of Prussia and later to the Province of Lower Silesia in the Free State of Prussiait was the Silesian provinces&#x27; largest town west of the Oder-Neisse line, and hence Görlitz became part of East Germany from 1949 until German reunification in 1990.

Görlitz is culturally diverse. Whilst it is in Saxony, its inhabitants also identify as Upper Lusatian. The East Lusatian dialect (&#x27;) of the town differs from the [[Upper Saxon]] dialects spoken in most parts of Saxony, especially those of [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]]. Because the town had been integrated into the former provinces of [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] and later [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]] respectively there is also a strong [[Silesia]]n element in the city&#x27;s culture, which is reflected by the presence of some [[Silesian cuisine|Silesian dishes]] such as&#x27; and &#x27;, a [[Schönhof (Görlitz)|Silesian Museum]] (), and the Silesian Christmas Market (&#x27;). There is also a Sorbian element, since Görlitz was founded and first settled by the Sorbs, a Slavic people. This is evidenced by the name of the town and the etymology of some of its incorporated villages and geographical features being of Slavic origin.

Spared from the destruction of World War II, the town also has a rich architectural heritage. Many movie-makers have used the various sites as filming locations.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Slavs migrated into the area during the Early Middle Ages. The nearby Landeskrone () mountain, as &quot;Businc&quot;, is considered the main stronghold of the Bieżuńczanie tribe and &quot;Gorelic&quot; is said to mean a small village. Other references state the origin of the name Görlitz is the Slavic word for &#x27;burned land&#x27;, referring to the technique used to clear land for settlement. Polish &quot;Zgorzelec&quot; and Czech &quot;Zhořelec&quot; have the same derivation.

In the Early Middle Ages, the area was inhabited by the Bieżuńczanie tribe, one of the old Polish tribes. In the late 9th or 10th century, the Bieżuńczanie were subjugated by the Sorbian Milceni tribe, who bordered from the west, who in turn were subjugated in 990 by the Margraviate of Meissen, a frontier march of the Holy Roman Empire. The settlement was then conquered by Polish ruler Bolesław I the Brave in 1002 and formed part of Poland until 1031, after which the region fell back to the Margraviate of Meissen. In 1075 the village was assigned to the Duchy of Bohemia. &quot;Goreliz&quot; was first mentioned in a document from the King of Germany, and later Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV in 1071. This document granted Görlitz to the religious Diocese of Meissen, then under Bishop Benno of Meissen. This document can now be found in the Saxony State Archives in Dresden. In 1126–1131 Bohemian Duke Soběslav I erected a castle, one of several new castles on the Bohemian-Polish border. It may have been on the site of the present St Peter and Paul church. The date the town was founded is unknown but in the 13th century the village gradually became a town. Owing to its location on the Via Regia, an ancient and medieval trade route, the settlement prospered.

In 1319 it became part of the Duchy of Jawor of fragmented Poland, and Duke Henry I of Jawor confirmed the town&#x27;s privileges. Later on, the town fell back to Bohemia. From 1346 Görlitz was a wealthy member of the Lusatian League, which consisted of Bautzen, Görlitz, Kamenz, Lubań, Löbau and Zittau. Around 1348 a Jewish woman, Adasse, was made a citizen of the town. In 1352 during the reign of Polish King Casimir III the Great, Lusatian German colonists from Görlitz founded the town of Gorlice in southern Poland near Kraków. From 1377 to 1396 it was the capital of an eponymous duchy. In 1469, along with the Lusatian League, the town recognized the rule of King Matthias Corvinus, thus passing to Hungarian rule, and in 1490 it reverted to Bohemia then ruled by Vladislaus II of Hungary.

===Modern period===

The Protestant Reformation came to Görlitz in the early 1520s and by the last half of the 16th century, it and the surrounding vicinity, became almost completely Lutheran.

In 1623, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was captured and occupied alternately by Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire. In 1635, the region of Upper Lusatia (including Görlitz) was ceded to the Electorate of Saxony. From 1639, the town was occupied by Sweden again, and then it was besieged by Imperial and Saxon forces in 1641. After the war it was part of the Electorate of Saxony, from 1697 within the Polish–Saxon personal union. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often travelled that route. Napoleon visited the town several times in 1807, 1812 and 1813.

After the Napoleonic Wars, the 1815 Congress of Vienna transferred the town from the Kingdom of Saxony to the Kingdom of Prussia. Görlitz was subsequently administered within the Province of Silesia and, after World War I, the Province of Lower Silesia, until 1945. During World War I an internment camp for Greek soldiers was located in present-day Zgorzelec, whilst 500 Greek officers lived in private quarters throughout the town. A burial ground for Greek soldiers was located in the local cemetery.

===Interbellum and World War II===
Shortly after the Nazi Party&#x27;s rise to power, in March 1933, the SA established the Leschwitz concentration camp in Leschwitz (present-day district of Weinhübel). Political prisoners were held and tortured in the camp before it was dissolved in August 1933 and the prisoners were deported to other concentration camps. In 1936, during a nationwide Nazi campaign of changing of placenames, two present-day districts of Görlitz were renamed to erase traces of Slavic origin—Leschwitz to &quot;Weinhübel&quot; and Nikrisch to &quot;Hagenwerder&quot;. On Kristallnacht in November 1938 an arson attack was carried out on the city&#x27;s synagogue. However the building survived the attack without major damage because firefighters resisted the order not to extinguish the fire. It is the only synagogue in the present state of Saxony that survived Nazi rule. In the interwar period most of the Jews had left the city and their number dropped from 567 in 1925 to 134 in 1939. Many remaining Jews were then killed in the Holocaust during World War II.
During World War II, a Nazi prison was operated in the town, with four forced labour subcamps within the town limits and three in nearby villages. The Nazis also established and operated two subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, located in present-day districts of Biesnitz and Kunnerwitz, in which over 1,500 Jewish men and women were used as forced labour, and 470 of whom died. Numerous subcamps of the Stalag VIII-A prisoner-of-war camp were located in the town, in which over 10,000 POWs worked as forced labour in 1942, and one of the largest subcamps was located in nearby Weinhübel (district of Görlitz since 1949). After the Soviet offensive of 1944 and the partial evacuation of the German court staff from the General Government in German-occupied Poland, a special court of the General Government was established at the local courthouse. Several Polish citizens were detained in Görlitz and sentenced to prison or death at this court for rescuing Jews from the Holocaust.

Near the end of World War II German troops destroyed all bridges crossing the Lusatian Neisse. The redrawing of boundaries in 1945—in particular the location of the East German-Polish border to the present Oder-Neisse line—divided the town. The right bank became part of Poland and was initially renamed Zgorzelice, and then Zgorzelec in 1948, with both names being historically used in the Polish language, while the main portion on the left bank became part of East Germany, now within the state of Saxony.

On 12 June 1945 the city issued a set of four of its own postage stamps.

===German Democratic Republic and reunited Germany===

When the East German states were dissolved in 1952 Görlitz became part of the Dresden District, but the states were restored on German reunification in 1990. In 1972 the East German-Polish border was opened for visa-free travel, resulting in intense movement between Görlitz and Zgorzelec, which lasted until 1980, when East Germany unilaterally closed the border because of anti-communist protests and the emergence of the Solidarity movement in Poland. On 27 June 1994 the town became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Görlitz but it remains a Lutheran Protestant stronghold.

In 2002 Lake Berzdorf, occupying a former open-cast lignite mine south of Görlitz, began to be filled. The &quot;Altstadtbrücke&quot; (literally &quot;old town bridge&quot;) between Görlitz and sister city Zgorzelec was rebuilt between 2003 and 2004. It was officially opened on 20 October 2004. As soon as Poland signed the Schengen Agreement (20 December 2007), movement between the two banks of the river again became unrestricted, since border controls were eliminated. Indeed, users of the new pedestrian bridge are not informed by any signs that they are leaving one country and entering another.

Since reunification and as of 2013 more than 700 buildings have been renovated. It is a popular place for retirement among the elderly of Germany, being quiet and relatively affordable by German standards. Its tourist potential is rapidly expanding since it is very much an eastern counterpart to towns such as Heidelberg. In the case of Görlitz much of the funding for the renovations of the town&#x27;s buildings has come from an anonymous donor, who, since 1995, has sent an annual donation of more than €500,000, totalling more than €10,000,000.

In 2021 the surviving old synagogue was reopened.

==Arts and culture==
Today Görlitz and Zgorzelec, two towns on opposite banks of the narrow river, are well connected. Two bridges have been rebuilt, a bus line connects the German and Polish parts of the town and there is a common urban management, with annual joint sessions of both town councils.

The town has a rich architectural heritage (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical and Art Nouveau). One example of this heritage is the Schönhof, one of the oldest civic Renaissance buildings in Germany. Another medieval heritage is a model of the Holy Sepulchre the construction of which began in 1465 under Bürgermeister Georg Emmerich.

In 2006 the twin cities of Görlitz and Zgorzelec applied to be the European City of Culture for 2010. It was hoped that the concept of Polish-German cooperation would be sufficient to convince the jury, but Essen won and Görlitz was placed second. As a result of the campaign Görlitz was renamed the &quot;City of Culture&quot; in order to further German-Polish relations and to attract tourists from all over the world.

As Görlitz was part of Silesia from 1815 onward, it has a Silesian Museum dedicated to the region (). The exhibition features the 1000-year-old cultural history of Silesia.

Görlitz is also the birthplace of the German version of nonpareils, popularly known in Germany as (German for &quot;love pearls&quot;). Invented by confectioner Rudolf Hoinkis (1876–1944), the name derives from a conversation Hoinkis had with his wife, proclaiming his love for her was like these &#x27;pearls&#x27;, the nonpareil. Unsure of what to call the treat he invented, his wife suggested calling them love pearls and the name stuck. The factory where he first manufactured the treat, founded in 1896, is now run by his great-grandson, Mathias.

==Geography==
Görlitz is situated on the border with Poland, adjacent to the Polish town of Zgorzelec on the opposite bank of the Lusatian Neisse. The municipality measures from north to south, and from east to west. Its area is .

===Divisions===
Görlitz is divided into 9 &quot;Stadtteile&quot; (town divisions) and 8 &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (formerly independent municipalities). These are:
*Stadtteile: Historische Altstadt, Innenstadt, Nikolaivorstadt, Südstadt, Rauschwalde, Biesnitz, Weinhübel, Königshufen and Klingewalde
*Ortsteile: Ober-Neundorf, Ludwigsdorf, Schlauroth, Kunnerwitz, Klein Neundorf, Deutsch-Ossig, Hagenwerder and Tauchritz

===Transport===

Görlitz station is on the Berlin – Görlitz and the Dresden–Görlitz lines of Deutsche Bahn. The station also provides an international connection to Wrocław, Poland.

Local public transport is provided by:
* The Verkehrsgesellschaft Görlitz (VGG) provides public transport service in the city, including the Görlitz tramway and bus services.
* The Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacji Samochodowej (PKS) provides bus service over the river between Görlitz and its sister city, Zgorzelec.

===Climate===
The climate is oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) or on the western edge of humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;) at the 0 °C isotherm. The location on the easternmost border of Germany, far from the sea, gives a climate less affected by prevailing westerly winds although these do reach further into the western half of Poland. Summers can be warm, though not as much as in Southern Europe, and the winters are cold; snow is sporadic, not persisting all winter.

The Görlitz weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 7 August 2015.
* Its lowest temperature was on 9 February 1956.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 1939.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1943.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2,162.5 hours in 2011.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,368.3 hours in 1977.

==Film location==

Due to the historical parts of the city, many movie-makers have used the various sites as locations. Eli Roth shot the movie-in-a-movie &quot;Nation&#x27;s Pride&quot; () for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (which incidentally purports to be France) in the Lower Market Square and Upper Market Square in the oldest parts of the city. Other films shot in Görlitz include the 2013 war drama &quot;The Book Thief&quot; and the teen years in &quot;The Reader&quot;. Görlitz was used as the primary shooting location for the Wes Anderson film &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;, with Görlitz standing in for a resort in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka. A vacant department store in the city was redecorated to serve as the hotel itself.

==Governance==
===Mayor and city council===

The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Matthias Lechner of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served from 1990 to 1998. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. Rolf Karbaum served from 1998 until 2005, Joachim Paulick from 2005 to 2012, and Siegfried Deinege from 2012 to 2019; all were independents. In 2019, CDU politician Octavian Ursu was elected mayor. The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2019, with a runoff held on 16 June, and the results were as follows:

<doc id="193045" wikidata="Q3212451" url="?curid=193045" title="La Rotonde">
<text>La Rotonde is the official French-language student newspaper at the University of Ottawa. It is the oldest French-language student paper outside of Quebec.

The newspaper publishes weekly throughout the fall and winter sessions on regular topics including news, arts and culture, sports, and travel. Previously owned by the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa, &quot;La Rotonde&quot; achieved an independent status on May 1, 2008. A not-for-profit corporation, &quot;Les Publications La Rotonde Inc.&quot;, has been created to manage the newspaper. Its directors are elected by University of Ottawa students during an annual general meeting.

While &quot;The Fulcrum&quot; is the official English-language student newspaper, the two publications are not repetitions of each other and offer unique, and sometimes conflicting, content and opinions.

== History ==
&quot;La Rotonde&quot; was founded in 1932 by the Société de Débats Français.

In the 50s, the paper became increasingly autonomous and challenging of the political order, leading to several conflicts with the university administration. In 1956, &quot;La Rotonde&quot; was named the most censored newspaper in Canada by the Canadian University Press. In 1958, 3 editors were expelled for writing an article that the administration disliked. Later that year, the paper was shut down, not resuming operations until 1959.

In 1965, student newspaper ownership was transferred to the SFUO. 4 years later, the union merged &quot;La Rotond&quot;e and the &quot;Fulcrum&quot; to create a bilingual paper called &quot;Id&quot;. &quot;Id&quot; was unsuccessful however, and &quot;La Rotonde&quot; began publishing again in 1970.

In 1986, the paper was almost shut down after serious financial difficulties.

In 1999, the SFUO banned journalists from either of the student papers from entering the SFUO offices, stating a danger of journalists overhearing potentially sensitive information.

In January 2002, the SFUO executive censored the publication of the 15th of January issue of &quot;La Rotonde&quot;. In that issue, the paper was to publish an editorial responding to accusations made by the SFUO&#x27;s Pride Centre Coordinator. The SFUO&#x27;s publishing committee then overturned the executive&#x27;s decision. This was then appealed to the Student Arbitration Committee, who also ruled in favour of overturning the executive&#x27;s decision. However, the SFUO&#x27;s Board of Administration voted to uphold the executive&#x27;s decision. The BoA, however, debated the issue in-camera, and refused to allow &quot;La Rotonde&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief access to the debate to defend the paper, while allowing the Pride Centre coordinator access to the debate to defend her case against the paper. The &quot;Fulcrum&quot; commented on the affair, criticising the SFUO, saying that &quot;it is sometimes hard to be proud of an institution as politically dysfunctional as the SFUO. The SFUO executive&#x27;s blasé attitude towards the constitution, the undermining of the student arbitration process and its casual manner of dismissing its critics is uninspiring. Often the SFUO resembles less a democratic student government than a gang of school children running around at recess, who simply make up the rules to their games as they go along.&quot;

In 2006, when the paper was still under the control of the SFUO, the editorial board decided to change the way it hired its General Manager. Previously, the General Manager was just chosen by the editorial board, but under the new system, the other staff of the paper would be given a lot more say. However, the SFUO then refused to accept the hiring of Wassim Garzouzi, on the grounds that the SFUO wanted more control over the papers&#x27; finances and that the SFUO disapproved of the new hiring system. In reaction to the SFUO&#x27;s interference, the editorial board wrote a letter demanding more autonomy and collected over 800 signatures for a petition and the News Editor resigned. However, the SFUO&#x27;s BoA refused to let Garzouzi assume his position. Earlier that year, the SFUO was involved in another scandal involving the paper after the SFUO was threatened with a lawsuit following an article the paper had printed. This later led to the SFUO&#x27;s lawyers telling the SFUO BoA to monitor the paper and to not &quot;support the status quo of allowing [La Rotonde] to print whatever they want.&quot;

In 2013, 80% of the copies of &quot;La Rotonde&quot;&#x27;s post-election issue were stolen.

In October 2016, &quot;La Rotonde&quot; published an investigative piece into Vet&#x27;s Tour, a highly sexual pub crawl organised by the Science Students&#x27; Association. The investigation revealed that the very secretive event promoted rape culture and abuse of alcohol, with a slogan of &quot;It&#x27;s not peer pressure, it&#x27;s just your turn&quot;. After publication of the article, the paper&#x27;s news editor was subject to violent and racist threats.

In March 2017, several members of the SFUO executive were investigated for having allegedly stolen UPasses, a scandal which was brought to light by &quot;La Rotonde&quot;. Those members of the SFUO executive attacked the paper for its coverage of the scandal, calling it &quot;biased&quot;, &quot;fake news&quot; and said the staff of the paper should work for Donald Trump.
A few days laters, those members of the SFUO executive and one incoming member of the SFUO exec stormed &quot;La Rotonde&quot;&#x27;s 2017 AGM with a group of other students and attempted to obtain seats on the paper&#x27;s board of directors in what appeared to be an attempt to take control of the paper. However they failed to obtain seats on Board of Directors because the paper&#x27;s constitution forbids SFUO employees from being directors of La Rotonde.

<doc id="193048" wikidata="Q1284241" url="?curid=193048" title="Tommy Steele">
<text>Sir Thomas Hicks (born 17 December 1936), known professionally as Tommy Steele, is an English entertainer, regarded as Britain&#x27;s first teen idol and rock and roll star.

After being discovered at the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar in Soho, London, Steele recorded a string of hit singles including &quot;Rock with the Caveman&quot; (1956) and the chart-topper &quot;Singing the Blues&quot; (1957). Steele&#x27;s rise to fame was dramatised in &quot;The Tommy Steele Story&quot; (1957), the soundtrack of which was the first British album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. With collaborators Lionel Bart and Mike Pratt, Steele received the 1958 Ivor Novello Award for Most Outstanding Song of the Year for &quot;A Handful of Songs&quot;. He starred in further musical films including &quot;The Duke Wore Jeans&quot; (1958) and &quot;Tommy the Toreador&quot; (1959), the latter spawning the hit &quot;Little White Bull&quot;.

Steele shifted away from rock and roll in the 1960s, becoming an all-round entertainer. He originated the part of Kipps in &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; in the West End and on Broadway, reprising his role in the 1967 film version. As an actor, he notably appeared in the films &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; (1967) and &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968) and as the lead in several West End productions of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. Also an author and sculptor, Steele remains active. He was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to entertainment and charity and was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in 2021.

==Early life==
Steele was born Thomas Hicks in Bermondsey, London, in 1936. His father, Thomas Walter Hicks, was a racing tipster and his mother, Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Ellen Bennett, worked in a factory; they had married in 1933, in Bermondsey.

As a child, Steele spent time in hospital for porphyria. He dreamt of being a star performer after his parents took him to the London Palladium, but &quot;didn&#x27;t think you could be English and be a star&quot;. In 1952, at the age of 15, Steele joined the Merchant Navy, working on the Cunard line. He was not eligible for national service because of a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy.

Steele attended Bacon&#x27;s College in Rotherhithe, south London.

Through his paternal line, the full family name (Still-Hicks) influenced his future stage name, as he adapted it to become known professionally as Tommy Steele.

==Career==
===Singer===

Whilst working as a merchant seaman, Steele learned to play guitar and began performing country and calypso music, inspired most by Hank Williams. He has claimed that when a ship he was serving on docked in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., he saw Buddy Holly perform and fell in love with rock and roll. The story conflicts with the known performances of Holly, making it appear impossible that it could have occurred as described.

On shore leave in summer 1956, Steele met writer Lionel Bart and actor Mike Pratt at a Soho party. The trio began writing together and formed a loose band, the Cavemen. Usually with the Cavemen, Steele began playing in Soho bars, including &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; alongside country songs in his set. A performance backed by members of the Vipers Skiffle Group at the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar was seen by John Kennedy, a photographer and publicity man who, within two weeks, got Steele a deal with Decca. With impresario Larry Parnes, Kennedy arranged a publicity stunt in which Steele performed at a staged debutante ball, getting the singer his first national press in &quot;The People&quot; under the headline &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll has got the debs too!&quot;. Within weeks, Steele was headlining variety bills.

Steele&#x27;s first single, &quot;Rock with the Caveman&quot;, was one of the first British rock and roll hits, reaching number 13 on the UK Singles Chart in November 1956. He promoted the single with his first television appearance, on bandleader Jack Payne&#x27;s BBC series &quot;Off the Record&quot;, and quickly became a national teen idol. Steele&#x27;s success saw him dubbed &quot;Britain&#x27;s Elvis&quot;, though his appeal has been characterised as less provocative than Presley&#x27;s. A 1957 concert review by Trevor Philpott of &quot;Picture Post&quot; described Steele&#x27;s act as possessing &quot;not a trace of sex, real or implied&quot;, whilst Stephen Glynn has written that Steele&#x27;s voice &quot;was genial before threatening, his stage demeanour more playground skip than bedroom thrust&quot;. Steele&#x27;s live performances were marked by frenzy from the teenage audience. His first album, &quot;Tommy Steele Stage Show&quot;, was recorded at a London concert the night before his twentieth birthday and issued in March 1957.

&quot;Doomsday Rock&quot;, Steele&#x27;s second single, failed to chart after its apocalyptic theme drew controversy. His third, &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;, reached number 1 in January 1957, staving off a recording by Guy Mitchell for one week. Steele was among the first British pop stars to be heavily merchandised, with tie-in sweaters, shoes and toy guitars. Only a few months after his first chart presence, the singer was filming his life story; &quot;The Tommy Steele Story&quot; (1957) featured twelve new songs, written hastily by Steele, Bart and Pratt, that expanded the singer&#x27;s repertoire to incorporate ballads and calypso music. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was the first UK number one album by a British act, and the hit single &quot;A Handful of Songs&quot; received the 1958 Ivor Novello Award for Most Outstanding Song of the Year, Musically and Lyrically. By the end of 1957, Steele had bought a four-bedroomed house in South London for his parents and was reported to be earning more than British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.

Steele made several appearances on the BBC programme &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; (1957–58), though agent Ian Bevan restricted the singer&#x27;s bookings in the belief that television &quot;tends to cheapen an artist of that nature&quot;. He performed at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the BBC&#x27;s Third Annual Festival of Dance Music in April 1957 and topped the bill at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in November 1957. In 2008, theatre producer Bill Kenwright alleged that Elvis Presley was taken on a tour of London by Steele in 1958, challenging Glasgow Prestwick Airport&#x27;s accepted status as the only place in the United Kingdom where Presley set foot. The
unverified claim caused controversy, with Steele telling the media &quot;I swore never to divulge what took place and I regret that it has found some way of &#x27;getting into the light&#x27;. I can only hope he [Elvis] can forgive me.&quot;

Steele starred in a dual role in his second film vehicle, &quot;The Duke Wore Jeans&quot;, released in March 1958. The film&#x27;s soundtrack topped the UK Albums Chart. In May 1958, Steele was hospitalised after being mobbed by fans at a concert at Caird Hall, Dundee, having had his right arm hurt, chunks of his hair pulled out and his shirt ripped off. Steele subsequently largely withdrew from performing concerts and increasingly worked in the theatre. He continued to record rock and roll over 1958 and 1959, finding chart success with covers of US hits, including &quot;Come On, Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot;. In September 1958, he appeared in the first episode of &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;, Jack Good&#x27;s ITV series which featured several new British rock and roll stars, including Cliff Richard and Marty Wilde.

In August 1959, Steele undertook a three-day concert visit to Moscow, where &quot;The Tommy Steele Story&quot; was screened at the Kremlin. In his first colour film, &quot;Tommy the Toreador&quot; (1959), Steele proved &quot;a real, true Danny Kaye&quot;, according to its cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. A hit single from the film, &quot;Little White Bull&quot;, became a children&#x27;s favourite after it was released in aid of a cancer research unit for children.

Considered Britain&#x27;s first rock and roll star, Steele has been described by AllMusic as &quot;the English teenager who let the genie out of the bottle, even if he wasn&#x27;t the genie.&quot; Steele&#x27;s rock and roll recordings have often divided critical opinion. In &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop&quot; (2013), Bob Stanley describes Steele&#x27;s early singles as &quot;charming and naïve, endearingly amateurish, with odd smudges of echo and strangely slurred vocals&quot;. In his 1970 book &quot;Revolt into Style: The Pop Arts in Britain&quot;, George Melly derided Steele’s films of being emblematic of the &quot;castration of early rock and roll&quot;. In 2009, the greatest hits collection &quot;The Very Best of Tommy Steele&quot; reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart, the first UK chart entry for Steele in over 46 years.

===Actor===
The increase in home-grown musical talent during the 1950s and 1960s allowed Steele to progress to a career in stage and film musicals, leaving behind his pop-idol identity. In 1957, he was voted the seventh-most-popular actor at the British box office.

In 1960, a tour of Australia had not been particularly successful and upon his return to England he received two offers, one to star in the play &quot;Billy Liar&quot;, the other to join the Old Vic Company. He chose the latter.

In the West End, he appeared in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, and played the title role of &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot;. On film, he recreated his London and Broadway stage role in &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; and starred in &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. In this last film, he played Og, the leprechaun turning human and co-starred with Petula Clark and Fred Astaire. In 1968, British exhibitors voted him the fourth most popular star at the local box office. The following year, he starred with Stanley Baker in the period drama &quot;Where&#x27;s Jack?&quot;

In April 1971, Steele starred in his own show, &quot;Meet Me in London&quot;, originating in Las Vegas before a limited run at London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre. The London production was troubled when Steele demanded cuts to the first act on opening night. Singer Clodagh Rodgers refused to accommodate the cuts, and walked out fifteen minutes before the first night curtain. She was eventually replaced by Susan Maughan.

In 1978, Steele performed in a TV movie version of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (misspelt as &quot;The Yeoman...&quot;), singing the role of the hapless jester Jack Point.

In 1983, Steele directed and starred in the West End stage production of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; at the London Palladium. In 1991, he toured with &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; the stage version of the Billy Wilder film. In 2003, after a decade-long hiatus, save his one-man shows &quot;An Evening With Tommy Steele&quot; and &quot;What A Show!&quot;, he toured as Ebenezer Scrooge in a production of &quot;Scrooge: The Musical&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Scrooge&quot;. Following this return, he reprised his role at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, over Christmas 2004 and brought the production to the London Palladium for Christmas 2005 and which toured over the next ten years. In 2008, at the age of 71, Steele toured in the lead role of the stage musical &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;. In 2015, Steele began touring as Glenn Miller in a new stage production of &quot;The Glenn Miller Story &quot;(1954) which enjoyed two UK tours before heading for a summer season at the London Coliseum.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1958 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. In December 2019, he hosted a &quot;Magic of the Musicals&quot; event at the British Film Institute, where he narrated and spoke about some of his favourite musical theatre film routines.

===Sculptor===
Steele is a respected sculptor and four of his major works have been on public display. &quot;Bermondsey Boy&quot;, at Rotherhithe Town Hall in London, was stolen in 1998: its whereabouts are unknown. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, which he sculpted and donated to the City of Liverpool as a tribute to the Beatles, stands in Stanley Street, Liverpool, not far from the Cavern Club. &quot;Union&quot;, featuring two rugby players, is on display at Twickenham Stadium. &quot;Trinity&quot;, designed during the regeneration of the docklands area in Bermondsey, stood outside the Trinity building in Bermondsey. When Steele lived in Montrose House, Petersham, Surrey, his life-sized sculpture of Charlie Chaplin as &quot;The Tramp&quot; stood outside his front door. He is also an artist of some note and has exhibited at the Royal Academy.

===Writing career===
In 1981, Steele wrote and published a novel titled &quot;The Final Run&quot; about World War II and the evacuation of Dunkirk.

He also wrote a children&#x27;s novel, entitled &quot;Quincy&quot;, about a reject toy trying to save himself and his fellow rejects in the basement of a toy store from the furnace the day after Christmas. Released in 1981, it was based on his own television film, &quot;Quincy&#x27;s Quest&quot;, from 1979, in which Steele played Quincy and Mel Martin played Quincy&#x27;s girlfriend doll, Rebecca.

Steele co-wrote many of his early songs with Lionel Bart and Mike Pratt, but he used the pseudonym of Jimmy Bennett, using his mother&#x27;s maiden name, from 1958 onwards.

On 7 November 2019, Steele was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the British Music Hall Society at a celebratory luncheon in Mayfair&#x27;s Lansdowne Club. Those paying tribute to his then 63 years and two days in show business included Tim Rice, Wyn Calvin and Bill Kenwright.

In May 2020, Steele announced a new project which he had been working on titled &quot;Breakheart&quot;, which was available exclusively online throughout May. Announced via a specially recorded video during the COVID-19 lockdown, &quot;Breakheart&quot; was a seven-episode audio thriller, written by Steele and set during the Second World War. A new episode was released each day for a week culminating in the full story. Following the re-release of the complete version of &quot;Breakheart&quot; for the 2020 festive period, Steele also released a specially recorded festive tale, &quot;The Christmas Mystery of Muchhope&quot;. This story was re-released for the festive period of 2022 with new edits and sound effects and a new story, &#x27;The Magic of Christmas,&#x27; was written and recorded by Steele for a limited release for Christmas 2023. 

In June 2021, to celebrate his 65 years in the entertainment industry, his authorised biography, &quot;A Life in the Spotlight&quot;, was published by FontHill Media, written by fan and archivist Sebastian Lassandro.

==Personal life==
Steele and Winifred Ann Donoghue or Donoughue (born 1936) married at St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church, Soho Square, London, in spring 1960.

The couple have one daughter.

==Honours==
In 2019, Steele was awarded the Freedom of the City of London. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony at Mansion House was delayed until 20 July 2021.

In the 1979 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his work as an entertainer and actor. He was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to entertainment and charity.

==Legacy==
Steele&#x27;s teen idol stardom was the subject of several contemporary parodies. On his album &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot; (1958), Peter Sellers portrays Cockney rock and roll star named &quot;Mr. Iron&quot; in the sketch &quot;The Trumpet Volunteer&quot;. Steele&#x27;s rise to fame was satirised in the 1958 West End musical &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot; and its 1959 film adaptation starring Cliff Richard.

There is a London Borough of Southwark blue plaque on Nickleby House, in the Dickens Estate in Bermondsey, commemorating Steele.

<text>Torquay United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Torquay, Devon, England. The team currently compete in the National League South, the sixth level of the English football league system. They have played their home matches at Plainmoor since 1921 and are nicknamed &quot;The Gulls&quot;. The club&#x27;s primary colours are yellow and blue.

Founded in 1899, the club first entered the East Devon League. They went on to win the Torquay &amp; District League in 1908–09, the Plymouth &amp; West Devon League 1911–12, and were admitted into the Football League in 1927 after claiming the Southern League title and second-place in the Western League in 1926–27. They remained in the Third Division South for the next 31 years and were promoted out of the Fourth Division at the end of the 1959–60 season, though were relegated after two seasons in the Third Division. Torquay were again promoted in 1965–66, only to suffer another relegation six years later. They survived re-election votes after last place finishes in the Fourth Division in 1985 and 1986.

Torquay gained promotion after winning the Fourth Division play-offs in 1991, having been losing finalists in 1988. Relegated in 1992, they lost another play-off final in 1998, before securing automatic promotion in 2003–04. They lasted just one season in League One and were relegated out of the Football League after finishing bottom of League Two in 2007. Torquay lost the 2008 FA Trophy final, but won the 2009 Conference play-off final. They spent five seasons in League Two, missing out in the play-offs in 2011 and 2012, before losing their Football League status for a second time with a last place finish in 2014. Torquay were relegated from the National League in 2018, but secured immediate promotion after winning the National League South in 2018–19. At the end of the 2022–23 season, Torquay were relegated back to the National League South and less than a year later, in April 2024, went into administration.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1899–1912)===
The original Torquay United was formed in 1899 by a group of school-leavers under the guidance of Sergeant-Major Edward Tomney. The newly founded club played its inaugural match against an Upton Cricket Club XI on one of local farmer, John Wright&#x27;s fields, situated at the top of Penny&#x27;s Hill, on Teignmouth Road. After a season of friendlies the club joined the East Devon League and moved into the Recreation Ground, their home for the next four years. Plainmoor at the time was occupied by Torquay Athletic Rugby Club in what is a reversal of the modern day situation. In 1904 Athletic secured the lease on the Recreation Ground from United, with League rivals Ellacombe taking over the lease of Plainmoor, leaving United homeless for the first time in their existence – facilitating a return to the farmer&#x27;s fields on Teignmouth Road.

However the club was on the move once more when the fields were sold to be developed into what would later be known as Parkhurst Road. United soon found another home, sharing with Torquay Cricket Club in nearby Cricketfield Road (a site still used for football in the modern day by South Devon League side Upton Athletic F.C.) for four years. It was during this time that they won their first honour; the 1909 Torquay and District League title. Following this breakthrough for the club, United merged with local rivals Ellacombe Football Club in 1910 and adopted the name Torquay Town. It was then that United finally moved into Plainmoor where they would remain to this day. During this period the ground was shared with the team&#x27;s remaining local rival Babbacombe. Both sides were playing in the same league, the Plymouth and District League alongside the reserve teams of Exeter City and Plymouth Argyle, Torquay Town would later win the league in the 1911–12 season.

=== Election to the Football League (1920–1950) ===

In 1920 after the resumption of the Football League following the First World War, United&#x27;s local rivals Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City were both elected to the Football League as founder members of the Football League Third Division, this prompted a movement in the town to merge the two remaining teams and create a new entity capable of competing at this level and being elected into the new league. After many discussions, Babbacombe at last agreed to a merger, enabling the new club to become the sole representative of the town and turn professional to further its case for league election, the new team was to be called Torquay United again.

In 1921, Torquay United moved from the Plymouth and District League to the Western League; they spent one season there, before transferring to the Southern League for the 1922–23 season. Torquay went on to finish sixth that season and during the summer applied for Football League status, but failed to gain a single vote. They remained in the Southern League until the end of the 1926–27 season. In 1925, the club reached the first round of FA Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. In 1927, Torquay won their first league title since the Torquay and District League of 1912, winning the western division of the Southern League.

Capitalizing on this momentum, the club once again applied for league membership and were successful this time, joining the Football League Third Division. The town of Torquay had had joined Plymouth and Exeter in the football league at last. Torquay&#x27;s first match in the league took place on 27 August 1927, a crowd of 11,625 watched a 1–1 draw. The team&#x27;s first season in the league however, was not a success, finishing their first season in the football league bottom of the table on 30 points and with a goals against tally of 103. Though they were successfully re-elected to the league for the next season. Throughout the 1930s, Torquay struggled against financial problems, they also failed to finish higher than 10th in twelve seasons. When league football was resumed in 1946 after the second world war, United continued to struggle and finished that season 19th.

=== Webber, O&#x27;Farrell and the glory years (1950–1970) ===

Torquay United finished 5th in 1950. In 1954 United changed their club colours again, the black and white stripes being changed to gold and blue to reflect the resort&#x27;s &quot;sun, sand and sea image&quot;, colours which the club has maintained to this day. With the change of colours came a change in fortunes starting with the club&#x27;s greatest ever FA Cup moment that very season. Torquay were drawn against Leeds United, away, in the third round of the Cup. Torquay went into the game clear under-dogs, yet they managed to hold the Yorkshire club to a 2–2 draw. The following Wednesday, 12 January, Torquay beat Leeds 4–0, with a gate of 11,000. Torquay United went on to play Huddersfield Town in the fourth round FA Cup game at Plainmoor. Torquay lost 1–0 to the higher-placed Division One club, but the official attendance of 21,908 remains a club record.

Following their FA Cup heroics, in the 1956–57 season Torquay just missed out on promotion to Division Two on goal average. The season had begun well – and by April, the possibility of a first promotion to Division Two was the talk of the town. A trip to Crystal Palace for the team and over 1,500 Torquay fans travelling on the last day of the season beckoned. Torquay only needed to win the game to be certain of going up, but they managed only a 1–1 draw at Selhurst Park and Ipswich, who won their final match away to Southampton, took the title. United failed to repeat this form the following season and after finishing 22nd in the league and were placed in the new Division Four, created by the de-regionalisation of the two third level divisions. With Eric Webber still in charge, United ended their first season in the League&#x27;s new basement division in twelfth place; but the next season, the club returned to form, and on 27 April 1960, 8,749 fans saw Torquay United beat Gillingham 2–0 at Plainmoor to return to the Third Division with two games of the season remaining. They were relegated on the last day of the campaign in May 1962.

Torquay came very close to regaining their Division Three status when they finished sixth in both the 1962–63 and 1963–64 campaigns. In 1963, Webber signed striker Robin Stubbs for a club record fee of £6,000 from Birmingham City; he went on to be the club&#x27;s top goalscorer at the end of the 1963–64 scoring 24 goals in 34 games. Torquay&#x27;s FA Cup run of 1964–65 was the highlight of a disappointing mid-table season as United again failed to return to the Third Division. In the third round, Torquay were drawn at home to English football giants; Tottenham Hotspur. In front of Plainmoor&#x27;s second ever largest attendance, slightly above 20,000 – the team performed well, in the last few minutes, it was the turn of record signing Robin Stubbs to net two goals and make it 3–3.

The first attempt at a replay in London was cancelled, with the majority of United&#x27;s travelling fans having already arrived in the capital. A week later though, in front of 55,000-strong crowd at White Hart Lane, the match went ahead. Jimmy Greaves scored a hat trick as Tottenham showed their class to win 5–1. After finishing in 12th at the end of the season, Eric Webber was finally sacked after 15 years as manager. Webber&#x27;s replacement was Frank O&#x27;Farrell. In his first season in charge, O&#x27;Farrell oversaw Torquay&#x27;s second promotion when they finished third in Division Four. At the end of their 1966–67 campaign United finished in seventh, and at the end of their 1967–68 season, United came very close to promotion to Division Two, once again, finishing fourth, two points behind Oxford United and Bury. This period also coincided with the club&#x27;s fans being voted the &#x27;Best Behaved Supporters in the League&#x27;. The O&#x27;Farrell era ended in 1968–69, when he left to manage First Division Leicester City and later Manchester United.

=== Lower league disappointment (1970–1988) ===
Another two seasons of indifference in Division Three saw the club finish in mid-table positions, then at the end of the 1971–72 campaign, United found themselves in the relegation zone, and back in the basement division. This led to a relatively uneventful decade with the club consistently scratching out mid-table finishes. O&#x27;Farrell made a return to Plainmoor in 1977 into the position of consultant manager, with Green taking hold of first team duties, The end of the 1977–78 season saw the Gulls finish in ninth place. Green then left the club, to be replaced at the helm, for the third time, by Frank O&#x27;Farrell. O&#x27;Farrell didn&#x27;t stay in charge of team matters for long, bringing in ex-Scotland international Bruce Rioch to become player-coach. Though the Gulls finished in fifteenth place in the 1981–82 season.


During the following summer Rioch was named manager, and the following 1982–83 campaign saw United finish 12th, but reached the fourth round of the FA Cup for the third time, going out of the competition at Plainmoor after a thrilling 3–2 defeat at the hands of Sheffield Wednesday. United would go on to finish the season in a strong 9th place. However, in Webb&#x27;s first full season at the helm, the 1984–85 season United finished bottom of Division Four and had to apply for re-election to stay in the Football League. For the second successive year United finished bottom of Division Four, and again successfully applied for re-election. The 1986–87 season saw the club survive automatic relegation to the Football Conference by drawing their last game with a goal in injury-time, which had been added after a Torquay player was bitten by a police dog.

=== A new era and the Bateson years (1988–2008) ===
At the start of the 1987–88 season, Cyril Knowles was appointed manager. That year, Torquay beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 at Plainmoor in the FA Cup. The team also reached the semi-final of the Football League Trophy. In May 1988, Lee Sharpe transferred to Manchester United for £180,000, one of the biggest transfer fees in Torquay United&#x27;s history. Torquay reached the final of the Football League Trophy in 1989. A crowd of 46,513 watched them lose 4–1 to Bolton Wanderers at Wembley. Under newly appointed John Impey Torquay were relegated after only one season in Division Three.

Soon after, Don O&#x27;Riordan took the senior job, guiding United to the play-offs again during the 1993–94 season, in which the club finished sixth. However, the team lost 4–1 at Deepdale in the final. At the end of the 1995–96 season, Torquay finished bottom of Division Three. However, they were saved from relegation when Stevenage Borough&#x27;s ground was deemed unfit for League football. In the 1997–98 season, the club finished fifth and reached the play-offs, but lost 1–0 to Colchester United in the Wembley final. In 1999 and 2001, Torquay only narrowly avoided relegation to non-League football. Newly appointed Roy McFarland only managed to deliver a 19th-place finish the following year, subsequently stepping down. At the end of the 2003–04 season, the club won automatic promotion, but their stay in the third tier was only to last one season, and they were relegated at the end of 2004–05.

In the 2005–06 FA Cup 3rd round, Torquay managed a 0–0 draw with the then-Premier League side Birmingham City. However, they lost the replay 2–0 at St Andrew&#x27;s. Torquay United lost their eighty-year Football League status on 14 April 2007, following a 1–1 draw at home to Peterborough United. Soon after, a £15M National Lottery winner, Paul Bristow, bought the club. Rowe was installed as the new chairman, and Paul Buckle appointed the club&#x27;s new manager.

On 15 March 2008, Torquay played at Wembley for the first time in ten years to reach the FA Trophy final. Having finished third in the Conference, Torquay played fierce rivals Exeter City away in the play-offs, and Exeter won 4–0. On 10 May 2008, Torquay lost the FA Trophy final 1–0 to Ebbsfleet United at Wembley. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2008–09, playing Coventry City in front of 6,018, and lost 1–0. Torquay United were promoted to the Football League on 17 May 2009 in the play-off final at Wembley, with 35,000 in attendance.

=== From Football League to non-League (2008–present) ===

In their first season back in League Two, Torquay finished in 17th place and the club reached the third round of the 2009–10 FA Cup, where they lost 1–0 to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. The next season, Torquay United reached the fourth round, equaling the club record. That season, Torquay came 7th but they lost 1–0 in the play off final to Stevenage and remained in League Two. United enjoyed an even more successful season in 2011–12 under new manager Martin Ling, achieving a record high of second place in League Two. However, they lost 4–1 on aggregate to Cheltenham Town in the play-off semi-finals.

The club was relegated to the Conference Premier in 2013–14. Torquay finished 13th in their first season back in non-league. In June 2015, ownership of the club was taken up by a new consortium made up of ten local business people. Paul Cox was appointed as manager but left Torquay three months later. Shortly afterward, United suffered their biggest defeat in 20 years, losing 7–3 at home to Bromley. On 28 September 2015, the club announced Kevin Nicholson would be the new player-manager. During 2016–17, a deal with a Swindon-based gaming and leisure company, Gaming international, was agreed and confirmed by the National League in March 2017.

On 21 April 2018, Torquay were relegated to the sixth tier of English football for the first time. Soon after, Gary Johnson was appointed manager. They were crowned champions of the National League South on 13 April 2019, their first league championship title since 1927. In 2019–20, Torquay finished 14th in the fifth tier after the season was cancelled in March 2020 due to disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020–21, the Gulls finished second. In the play-off final at Ashton Gate, Torquay&#x27;s goalkeeper Lucas Covolan equalised in the 95th minute. However, Torquay lost out to Hartlepool United 5–4 on penalties. Two years later, Torquay were relegated back to the National League South.

====Administration====
On 22 February 2024, club chairman, Clarke Osborne, stated he was planning to appoint administrators and stood down. On 30 June 2023, the Gulls lost £1,163,124 and Osborne&#x27;s loans to the club rose to £5.28m. After announcing likely administration, manager Gary Johnson left the club by mutual agreement and his assistant Aaron Downes was appointed interim manager. On 13 March 2024, the National League deducted Torquay ten points, dropping the club from 12th to 17th place in the table.

The club formally went into administration on 5 April 2024. On 12 April 2024, Torquay was deducted a further point for fielding a suspended player, dropping the club to 19th with three games to play. Torquay finished the 2023–24 season 18th in the sixth tier, their lowest league finish since 1927. Off the pitch, a consortium of local businessmen, the Bryn Consortium, was set to take over the club. On 14 May 2024, Torquay appointed former Truro City boss Paul Wotton as their new manager, working with football advisor Neil Warnock.

==Crest and colours==

===Crest===
Torquay&#x27;s initial crest was based heavily on the town&#x27;s coat of arms, featuring a three-masted ship, to represent the region&#x27;s longstanding association with shipping, it also displayed a castled gateway and the golden wings were to represent wings of the local seagulls. The crest remained in use until the mid eighties, with one change in the 1970s to incorporate the &#x27;gulls wings&#x27; emblem which is familiar today. That meant, however, that the three-masted ship was removed from the design.

During an unsuccessful spell on the pitch during the 1980s, during which time the club finished bottom of the Football League system twice, the emblem was switched to a circular design incorporating two palm trees. In 1986, the club chose to go back to the gull emblem, encircled by the club name. In the years that followed multiple versions of this crest were produced, so in 2017 the badge was refreshed to &#x27;unify&#x27; these multiple versions and produce a cleaner, more modern design.

===Colours===
Torquay United went through various team colours before settling on the familiar yellow and blue of today. In the club&#x27;s formative days they played in a light and dark blue kit, before switching to a black and white striped kit reminiscent of a modern-day Newcastle United kit. This identity change led to the club being dubbed &#x27;the magpies&#x27;. The magpies played in this colour scheme until the club opted for a fresh identity In 1954. United based their new image around the town&#x27;s traditional seaside character and they chose a more distinctive yellow, or gold and blue kit. The new colours were chosen to represent the area&#x27;s golden sands and blue sky and sea.
For the majority of the years since this change the club has worn these colours in varying styles, currently favouring a predominantly yellow shirt with blue trim.
The switch from black and white also heralded the birth of a new nickname &#x27;The Gulls&#x27;.

==Stadium==
===Early years and Plainmoor===

United played their first game, a friendly, against an Upton Cricket Club XI on one of farmer John Wright&#x27;s fields, which was situated at the top of Penny&#x27;s Hill, on Teignmouth Road. After a season of friendlies the club joined the East Devon League and moved to the Recreation Ground, which was to be their home for the following four years. In 1904 Torquay Athletic Rugby Football Club secured the lease of the Recreation Ground (it remains their home today) and United moved back to the Teignmouth Road site, but again was forced to move when the field was sold to developers to build Parkhurst Road. At the time Torquay Cricket Club were located nearby in Cricketfield Road, and so this site was United&#x27;s next home.

The club remained in Cricketfield Road for four years. In 1910 United merged with Ellacombe to become Torquay Town. Ellacombe&#x27;s Plainmoor ground became the home of the new club, and the shared home of local rivals Babbacombe. Torquay Town and Babbacome finally merged and became Torquay United (again) in 1921. The club has remained at Plainmoor ever since. On 17 May 1985, a fire swept through the then fifty-year-old main stand &#x27;The Grandstand&#x27;, just six days after a fire at Valley Parade Stadium in Bradford, in which over fifty people lost their lives. This incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, and nobody was injured. After initially suspecting that this could have been a copycat arson of the Bradford City stadium fire, eventual cause was attributed to an electrical fault, the ground&#x27;s capacity fell to below 5,000.

Throughout the late eighties and early nineties the infrastructure at the ground was given a major overhaul, with the mini stand at the home end of the ground being redeveloped. In its place is now the family stand – a covered, all seater stand with board rooms, a club shop, restaurant and club bar. After this was completed attention turned to redevelopment of the &#x27;popular side&#x27;, which was fully covered and updated to modern-day standards. In 2000–01 the away end was also redeveloped with a new covered standing area. The old wooden grandstand, initially costing £150 and erected at Plainmoor for United&#x27;s inaugural season in the Football League stood until 2011. Prior to its time at Plainmoor the stand had previously stood at Buckfastleigh Racecourse. It was demolished to create a new stand built in 2012 named Bristow&#x27;s Bench in memory of the late Paul Bristow.

===Possible move===

Following his takeover of the club in October 2006, chairman Chris Roberts went on record stating his desire to move the club to a new multipurpose stadium catering for football, rugby and athletics. Speculation placed the site of the new complex at the Torquay Recreation Ground, currently occupied by Torquay Athletic Rugby Club. Since Roberts&#x27; resignation this move has become unlikely, with succeeding chairman Alex Rowe distancing himself from the plans saying that the club and the fans wish to remain at Plainmoor and will build upon the current ground to increase capacity. The club are looking to buy the houses behind the away end and building an extension to the away end and also to acquire the nearby school (Westlands) and build a bigger grandstand to increase the capacity to around 9,000.

Plans for an extended grandstand were submitted to the council for planning permission, in co-operation with Westlands school in 2010.
This was approved on 9 June 2011 with the increased cost believed to be approximately £2 million with the new structure to be named &quot;Bristow&#x27;s Bench&quot; in memory of the late Paul Bristow, who essentially underwrote the Gulls&#x27; return to the football league. With the demolition of the old Grandstand and the new stand not being ready for the 2011–12 season Plainmoor capacity stood at 4,500 for the 2011–12 season. It was however ready in time for the start of the 2012–13 season where it witnessed its first sell out crowd with the visit of Devon neighbours Plymouth Argyle in early September.

Rumours of a potential move away from Plainmoor resurfaced following the takeover of the club by Gaming International. The club&#x27;s new owners were keen to relocate the stadium facilities and incorporate football into a new multi-use complex in Torbay, developing the existing Plainmoor site for housing.
However plans have proved controversial with United fans, and further certainty has been called for. This led to a decision in 2017 to postpone talks between Torbay Council and GI over the purchase of the freehold.

<text>Crystalis is a 1990 action role-playing video game developed and published by SNK for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A port for the Game Boy Color developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo was released in 2000.

The game begins with a young magician awakening from the cryogenic sleep he was placed in by the villains of the Great War before nuclear war rained down in the year 1997. Even though he is unable to recall his name or who he was, he exits the Mezame Shrine and discovers that he may be the key to save this world from destruction. Aided by four wise sages and a mysterious woman, he rises up against the tyrannical Draygonian Empire to ensure that humanity ultimately does not repeat the Great War.

The original NES version has been re-released via the &quot;SNK 40th Anniversary Collection&quot; on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Crystalis&quot; is an action role-playing game. The world is presented in a top-down perspective so the player character can be moved in eight directions using the control pad. One action button is used for attacking with a sword while the second is mapped to either an equipped magical power or an item from the player&#x27;s inventory. The start and select buttons bring up the status screen and the inventory menu, respectively. In addition, the player can equip various suits of armor and shields. Defeating monsters allows the player to gain experience points which increases his level thus boosting his health, defense, and attack strength.

The primary means of defeating monsters is through the use of four elemental swords scattered throughout the game (the fifth sword, Crystalis, is obtained in the final dungeon). The swords are capable of both normal slashes and powered-up attacks that launch elemental projectiles. Each of the four swords is imbued with a distinct elemental power (wind, fire, water, and thunder), making each sword more effective than the others in various situations. The elemental nature of each sword also provides a necessary means of traversing otherwise impassable obstacles; certain barriers succumb to the power blasts of individual swords, and the Sword of Water creates a bridge of ice across some shallow, narrow sections of rivers. Some enemies are immune to certain types of elements and must be killed using the opposing element (for instance, ice creatures are weak against fire). Also bosses and enemies require the hero be a certain level or else they cannot be harmed, even if the correct sword is used. The player can also jump over enemies, and certain enemies can form puddles to slide under the sword&#x27;s reach.

==Synopsis==
===Plot===
&quot;Crystalis&quot; takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, in 2097, one hundred years after &quot;1997, October 1, The END DAY&quot;, when a global thermonuclear war began that reverted civilization to a primitive, medieval existence populated with fierce mutated creatures. Science and advanced technology have been abandoned, with the survivors deciding to study the ways of magic. The survivors of the destruction built a floating &quot;Tower&quot; to prevent any future cataclysms, as its occupants would have the power to govern the world, due to the Tower&#x27;s weapons systems. A man known as Draygon, however, revived the forbidden ways of science and combined them with magic. With these skills, he controls the world&#x27;s last remaining military power and seeks to conquer what is left of the planet by attempting to enter the Tower.

The protagonist awakens with no memory, but, guided by four wise sages, gradually learns that the world is sinking into turmoil, due to the Draygonia Empire&#x27;s destructive influence. Entrusted with the Sword of Wind, he seeks to aid Mesia, another survivor from his time, and to combine the four elemental Swords of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder into the legendary sword, &quot;Crystalis&quot;. Together, they must defeat Draygon before he uses the Tower to achieve his evil ambitions.

===Characters===
The anonymous male protagonist (named SNK by default in the NES version, Simea in the Game Boy Color version) and his female accomplice, Mesia, are scientists who were cryogenically frozen, to be released when the tower began to activate. The protagonist is assisted by four sages named Zebu, Tornel, Asina, and Kensu, primarily in learning magic spells and gaining information about the world and the quest. They are encountered frequently throughout the game, and the player can seek their advice using the telepathy spell. In the GBC version, the sages are each responsible for creating one of the four swords: Zebu for Wind, Tornel for Fire, Asina for Water, and Kensu for Thunder. The original game does not mention who forged the ancient swords.

There are also four recurring boss characters, &quot;Dragonia&#x27;s Finest Four&quot;. Comprising this group are: General Kelbesque, Sabera the Witch, the Swordsman Mado, and Karmine the Wizard. Each of them has a distinct elemental weakness and, with the exception of Karmine, each is encountered twice during the adventure. Though not the final adversary in the game, Emperor Draygon is the ultimate antagonist and the root of all of evil in &quot;Crystalis&quot;. After defeating his false self, the hero encounters the real one and reveals his true, dragon-like form. After defeating the real Draygon, the hero gains access to the Tower for a final showdown with a machine called DYNA.

==Development==
Two of the characters from &quot;Crystalis&quot; are subtle nods to earlier SNK characters who later became part of &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series; the latter two sages, Kensu and Asina, are based on Kensou Sie and Athena Asamiya from the &quot;Psycho Soldier&quot; arcade game. In &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, Kensou is well known for his obsession with Athena, a quality demonstrated even in &quot;Crystalis&quot;.

== Release ==
The game was released in Japan on April 13, 1990, and later released in North America in July.

===Game Boy Color version===
Nearly ten years after the game&#x27;s initial release, Nintendo, with licensing from SNK, re-released &quot;Crystalis&quot; for the Game Boy Color on June 26, 2000. This version, however, is a significantly different game, exemplified by a different opening sequence. The nature of the Tower&#x27;s origin and its purpose were fundamentally altered, with the Tower now being a weapon created by the game&#x27;s antagonist, and the protagonist has been elevated to a hero of ancient prophecy destined to save the world. This story sequence was used in the instruction manual for the NES version.

Other major changes include an almost completely new soundtrack, re-translation differences (for example, Draygon is now known as Dragonia, as in the Japanese version) and rewriting of story-items and events (Kensu&#x27;s Body and the dialogue in the Dwarven village, for example). The game now has a different final sequence too: in the original, after defeating Draygon&#x27;s two forms in the pyramid, a character named Azteca dies and then the players travel to the flying tower to fight the final boss DYNA, the computer controlling the tower. In the Game Boy Color version, the players go to the flying tower directly (which has been shortened compared to the original). Once inside, the players fight DYNA and then fight Draygon&#x27;s two forms. The re-ordering of these last battles caused Azteca&#x27;s death scene to be excised from the game. Also, a digital voice was added to state the name of each sword upon discovery.

Unlike the original version, enemies are not immune to certain elemental swords. The lower resolution of the Game Boy Color screen, compared to that of the NES, results in a field of view smaller than in the original, making the GBC port more difficult; some enemies can now attack the player from off-screen.

===&quot;SNK 40th Anniversary Collection&quot; version===
SNK re-released &quot;Crystalis&quot; for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018, as part of the &quot;SNK 40th Anniversary Collection&quot;. This collection, including &quot;Crystalis&quot;, was released in 2019 for Sony PlayStation 4 on March 19, for Xbox One on May 2, and for Steam on June 7. The PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam releases of the &quot;SNK 40th Anniversary Collection&quot; mark the first time that &quot;Crystalis&quot;, a game once exclusive to the NES, had been made officially available outside of a Nintendo console.

==Reception==
The original NES version of &quot;Crystalis&quot; was praised for its advanced graphics, high quality soundtrack, and elaborate plot. For their review of the Nintendo Switch emulated port of &quot;Crystalis&quot; in the &quot;SNK 40th Anniversary Collection&quot;, &quot;Switch RPG&quot; noted that &quot;&quot;Crystalis&quot; features one of the best soundtracks from the NES era&quot;. Critics remarked that the story and art design seemed to draw heavily from the Hayao Miyazaki anime film &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. The main criticism of the game was its repetitive gameplay, as many enemies can be overcome by continuous rapid pressing of one button. The reviewer &quot;Pocket Squirrel&quot; also mentioned flawed collision detection in his review for &quot;RPGFan&quot;. IGN ranked Crystalis #42 on its list of the Top 100 NES Games.

The Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a score of 28 out of 40. Famitsu writers compared it as similar to both &quot;Ys&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. In December 2005, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked the NES release of &quot;Crystalis&quot; at number 115 in a list of the 200 best games ever to appear on a Nintendo system, the &quot;NP Top 200&quot;. In a retrospective, Kotaku stated that &quot;&quot;Crystalis&quot; has flaws, but makes up for it with bold strides in its narrative and gameplay&quot;. &quot;1up.com&quot; called it a &quot;hidden Gem&quot; for the NES, and said it was one of the better games inspired by Zelda on the system, contrasting it with &quot;Willow&quot;, which they said was quite poor. &quot;Switch RPG&quot; called &quot;Crystalis&quot; &quot;easily one of the best action RPGs from the NES era&quot;.

The Game Boy Color port was not received as favorably, the majority of reviews citing it as an inferior copy, due to reduced screen resolution and altered plot, as well as its being seen as dated compared to more recently made games. The music is regarded as one of the port&#x27;s worst aspects. The port was given an 8.0 rating by &quot;IGN&quot;, however, which denotes an &quot;impressive&quot; game. &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the game for being too linear and having a low difficulty level but praised its large world and visually detailed &quot;cinema cutscenes&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; also gave the Game Boy Color port an 8.0, saying of the original NES release: &quot;Crystalis&#x27; sheer depth - and the quality of its presentation - was without peer, and it is still regarded as a milestone title in the [action RPG] genre&quot;.

<doc id="193052" wikidata="Q355643" url="?curid=193052" title="Jean-Charles Pichegru">
<text>Jean-Charles Pichegru (; 16 February 1761 – 5 April 1804) was a French general of the Revolutionary Wars. Under his command, French troops overran Belgium and the Netherlands before fighting on the Rhine front. His royalist positions led to his loss of power and imprisonment in Cayenne, French Guiana during the Coup of 18 Fructidor in 1797. After escaping into exile in London and joining the staff of Alexander Korsakov, he returned to France and planned the Pichegru Conspiracy to remove Napoleon from power, which led to his arrest and death. Despite his defection, his surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 3.

==Early life and career==
Pichegru was born in a peasant family at Arbois (or, according to Charles Nodier, at Les Planches-près-Arbois, near Lons-le-Saulnier), in the then Franche-Comté (now in the Jura department of France). The friars of Arbois were entrusted with his education, and sent him to the military school of Brienne-le-Château. There, he taught mathematics, and among his pupils was the young Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1783, he entered the 1st regiment of artillery, where he rapidly rose to the rank of adjutant-second lieutenant, and briefly served in the American Revolutionary War.

When the Revolution erupted in 1789, he became leader of the Jacobin Club in Besançon, and, when a regiment of volunteers of the department of the Gard marched through the city, he was elected lieutenant colonel.

==Rhine front==
The fine condition of his regiment was noticed in the French Revolutionary Army section of the Rhine, and his organizing ability got him appointed in the headquarters, and then promoted &quot;général de brigade&quot;.

In 1793, Lazare Carnot and Louis de Saint-Just were sent to find &quot;roturier&quot; (non-aristocratic) generals who could prove successful (&quot;see: Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars&quot;). Carnot discovered Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and Saint-Just discovered Louis Lazare Hoche and Pichegru. At first, Pichegru was appointed &quot;général de division&quot; and commander of the &quot;Division of the Upper Rhine&quot;.

Appointed commander-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine, Pichegru attacked the Coalition army of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser in the Battle of Haguenau in 1793. Over a period of weeks the Coalition Forces were driven back step by step in bitter fighting. The intervention of the Army of the Moselle under Hoche at the Battle of Froeschwiller in late December finally caused Wurmser to abandon Alsace. For the Second Battle of Wissembourg, Pichegru was placed under the command of Hoche, who proved to be a difficult superior. Nevertheless, the French again won the battle, compelling Wurmser to retreat to the east bank of the Rhine and the Prussian army to withdraw toward Mainz.

==Northern front==

In December 1793, Hoche was arrested, probably owing to his colleague&#x27;s denunciations, and Pichegru became commander-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle. He was summoned to succeed Jourdan in the Army of the North in February 1794, subsequently fighting three major campaigns within the year. The forces of the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and Habsburg Austria held a strong position along the Sambre to the North Sea.

After attempting to break the Austrian centre, Pichegru suddenly turned their left, and defeated the Count of Clerfayt at Cassel, Menin and Courtrai, while his subordinate, Joseph Souham, defeated Prince Josias of Coburg in the battle of Tourcoing in May 1794. After a lull, during which Pichegru feigned a siege of Ypres, he again attacked Clerfayt, and defeated him at Roeselare and Hooglede, while Jourdan, commanding the newly named Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, withstood Austrian attacks in the battle of Fleurus (27 June 1794), which eventually led to Allied evacuation of the Low Countries.
Pichegru began his second campaign by crossing the Meuse on 18 October, and, after taking Nijmegen, drove the Austrians beyond the Rhine. The Anglo-Hanoverian army withdrew behind the Waal. Then, while Pichegru&#x27;s troops prepared to go into winter quarters, the Convention ordered the Army of the North to mount a winter campaign. On 27 December two brigades crossed the Meuse on the ice, and stormed the Bommelerwaard. On 10 January Pichegru&#x27;s army crossed the ice of the Waal between Zaltbommel and Nijmegen, then, on 13 January, entered Utrecht, which surrendered on the 16th. The Anglo-Hanoverian army retreated behind the IJssel and then withdrew to Hanover and Bremen. Pichegru, who had successfully penetrated the frozen Hollandic Water Line, arrived in Amsterdam on 20 January, after the Batavian Revolution had taken place. The French occupied the rest of the Dutch Republic in the next month.

This major victory was marked by unique episodes, such as the Capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder by French hussars, and exceptional discipline of the French battalions in Amsterdam, who, although faced with the opportunity of plundering the richest city in Europe, showed self-restraint.

==Thermidor and Directory==
Although a former associate of Saint-Just, Pichegru offered his services to the Thermidorian Reaction, and, after having received the title of &quot;Sauveur de la Patrie&quot; (&quot;Saviour of the Fatherland&quot;) from the National Convention, subdued the sans-culottes of Paris when they rose in insurrection against the Convention on 12 Germinal (1 April).

Pichegru then took command of the armies of the North, the Sambre-and-Meuse, and the Rhine, and, crossing the Rhine in force, took Mannheim in May 1795.

==Going over to the Royalists==

Although he was at the height of his fame as general, Pichegru allowed his colleague Jourdan to be defeated, betrayed all his plans to the enemy, and took part in organizing a conspiracy for the return and crowning of Louis XVIII as King of France. The plans were suspected, and, when he offered his resignation to the Directory in October 1795, it was promptly accepted (much to his surprise). He retired in disgrace, but secured his election to the Council of Five Hundred in May 1797 as a leader of the Royalists.

==Coup attempts and death==
Pichegru planned a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; but was arrested during the anti-royalist &quot;Coup of 18 Fructidor&quot; and with fourteen others was deported to Cayenne, French Guiana, in 1797. He and seven others escaped and fled to Paramaribo. The gouverneur De Friderici allowed them to get on board a ship to the United States. Shortly thereafter, he went to London, where he joined other French &quot;émigrés&quot;. There, he served on General Aleksandr Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s staff in the campaign of 1799.

Pichegru went to Paris in August 1803 with Georges Cadoudal to head a royalist uprising against the First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte. Betrayed by a friend, Pichegru was arrested on 28 February 1804, and was later found strangled in prison on the morning of April 6. The government reported that he had committed suicide, but Napoleon has often been blamed for orchestrating the murder. However, there is little evidence that Napoleon was involved. His supporters often argue that Napoleon had nothing to gain from having Pichegru murdered, especially after the execution of d&#x27;Enghien, which infuriated royalty across Europe. 

Pichegru was buried in the &quot;cimetière Sainte-Catherine&quot;, a Paris cemetery with its entrance in the former &quot;rue de Fer&quot;, and which was closed in 1824.

<doc id="193053" wikidata="Q945127" url="?curid=193053" title="Triviality (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the adjective trivial is often used to refer to a claim or a case which can be readily obtained from context, or an object which possesses a simple structure (e.g., groups, topological spaces). The noun triviality usually refers to a simple technical aspect of some proof or definition. The origin of the term in mathematical language comes from the medieval trivium curriculum, which distinguishes from the more difficult quadrivium curriculum. The opposite of trivial is nontrivial, which is commonly used to indicate that an example or a solution is not simple, or that a statement or a theorem is not easy to prove.

The judgement of whether a situation under consideration is trivial or not depends on who considers it since the situation is obviously true for someone who has sufficient knowledge or experience of it while to someone who has never seen this, it may be even hard to be understood so not trivial at all. And there can be an argument about how quickly and easily a problem should be recognized for the problem to be treated as trivial. So, triviality is not a universally agreed property in mathematics and logic.

==Trivial and nontrivial solutions==
In mathematics, the term &quot;trivial&quot; is often used to refer to objects (e.g., groups, topological spaces) with a very simple structure. These include, among others:

*Empty set: the set containing no or null members
*Trivial group: the mathematical group containing only the identity element
*Trivial ring: a ring defined on a singleton set

&quot;Trivial&quot; can also be used to describe solutions to an equation that have a very simple structure, but for the sake of completeness cannot be omitted. These solutions are called the trivial solutions. For example, consider the differential equation

formula_1

where formula_2 is a function whose derivative is formula_3. The trivial solution is the zero function

formula_4

while a nontrivial solution is the exponential function

formula_5

The differential equation formula_6 with boundary conditions formula_7 is important in mathematics and physics, as it could be used to describe a particle in a box in quantum mechanics, or a standing wave on a string. It always includes the solution formula_8, which is considered obvious and hence is called the &quot;trivial&quot; solution. In some cases, there may be other solutions (sinusoids), which are called &quot;nontrivial&quot; solutions.

Similarly, mathematicians often describe Fermat&#x27;s last theorem as asserting that there are no &quot;nontrivial&quot; integer solutions to the equation formula_9, where &quot;n&quot; is greater than 2. Clearly, there are some solutions to the equation. For example, formula_10 is a solution for any &quot;n&quot;, but such solutions are obvious and obtainable with little effort, and hence &quot;trivial&quot;.

==In mathematical reasoning==
&quot;Trivial&quot; may also refer to any easy case of a proof, which for the sake of completeness cannot be ignored. For instance, proofs by mathematical induction have two parts: the &quot;base case&quot; which shows that the theorem is true for a particular initial value (such as &quot;n&quot; = 0 or &quot;n&quot; = 1), and the inductive step which shows that if the theorem is true for a certain value of &quot;n&quot;, then it is also true for the value &quot;n&quot; + 1. The base case is often trivial and is identified as such, although there are situations where the base case is difficult but the inductive step is trivial. Similarly, one might want to prove that some property is possessed by all the members of a certain set. The main part of the proof will consider the case of a nonempty set, and examine the members in detail; in the case where the set is empty, the property is trivially possessed by all the members of the empty set, since there are none (see vacuous truth for more).

The judgement of whether a situation under consideration is trivial or not depends on who considers it since the situation is obviously true for someone who has sufficient knowledge or experience of it while to someone who has never seen this, it may be even hard to be understood so not trivial at all. And there can be an argument about how quickly and easily a problem should be recognized for the problem to be treated as trivial. The following examples show the subjectivity and ambiguity of the triviality judgement.

Triviality also depends on context. A proof in functional analysis would probably, given a number, trivially assume the existence of a larger number. However, when proving basic results about the natural numbers in elementary number theory, the proof may very well hinge on the remark that any natural number has a successor – a statement which should itself be proved or be taken as an axiom so is not trivial (for more, see Peano&#x27;s axioms).

=== Trivial proofs ===
In some texts, a &quot;trivial proof&quot; refers to a statement involving a material implication &quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q,&quot; where the consequent &quot;Q&quot;, is always true. Here, the proof follows immediately by virtue of the definition of material implication in which as the implication is true regardless of the truth value of the antecedent &quot;P&quot; if the consequent is fixed as true.

A related concept is a vacuous truth, where the antecedent &quot;P&quot; in a material implication &quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q&quot; is false. In this case, the implication is always true regardless of the truth value of the consequent &quot;Q&quot; – again by virtue of the definition of material implication.

== Humor ==

* A common joke in the mathematical community is to say that &quot;trivial&quot; is synonymous with &quot;proved&quot;—that is, any theorem can be considered &quot;trivial&quot; once it is known to be proved as true.
* Two mathematicians who are discussing a theorem: the first mathematician says that the theorem is &quot;trivial&quot;. In response to the other&#x27;s request for an explanation, he then proceeds with twenty minutes of exposition. At the end of the explanation, the second mathematician agrees that the theorem is trivial. But can we say that this theorem is trivial even if it takes a lot of time and effort to prove it?
* When a mathematician says that a theorem is trivial, but he is unable to prove it by himself at the moment that he pronounces it as trivial, is the theorem trivial?
* Often, as a joke, a problem is referred to as &quot;intuitively obvious&quot;. For example, someone experienced in calculus would consider the following statement trivial:formula_11However, to someone with no knowledge of integral calculus, this is not obvious, so it is not trivial.

== Examples ==
*In number theory, it is often important to find factors of an integer number &quot;N&quot;. Any number &quot;N&quot; has four obvious factors: ±1 and ±&quot;N&quot;. These are called &quot;trivial factors&quot;. Any other factor, if it exists, would be called &quot;nontrivial&quot;.
*The homogeneous matrix equation formula_12, where formula_13 is a fixed matrix, formula_14 is an unknown vector, and formula_15 is the zero vector, has an obvious solution formula_16. This is called the &quot;trivial solution&quot;. Any other solutions, with formula_17, are called &quot;nontrivial&quot;.
*In group theory, there is a very simple group with just one element in it; this is often called the &quot;trivial group&quot;. All other groups, which are more complicated, are called &quot;nontrivial&quot;.
*In graph theory, the trivial graph is a graph which has only 1 vertex and no edge.
*Database theory has a concept called functional dependency, written formula_18. The dependence formula_18 is true if &quot;Y&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;, so this type of dependence is called &quot;trivial&quot;. All other dependences, which are less obvious, are called &quot;nontrivial&quot;.
* It can be shown that Riemann&#x27;s zeta function has zeros at the negative even numbers −2, −4, … Though the proof is comparatively easy, this result would still not normally be called trivial; however, it is in this case, for its &quot;other&quot; zeros are generally unknown and have important applications and involve open questions (such as the Riemann hypothesis). Accordingly, the negative even numbers are called the trivial zeros of the function, while any other zeros are considered to be non-trivial.

<text>Georges Cadoudal (; January 1, 1771 – June 25, 1804), sometimes called simply Georges, was a Breton counter-revolutionary and leader of the &quot;Chouannerie&quot; during the French Revolution. He was posthumously named a Marshal of France in 1814 by the reinstated Bourbons. &quot;Cadoudal&quot; means in Breton language &quot;warrior returning from the fight&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Brech, in Brittany, after completing his education, he remained true to his Royalist and Roman Catholic convictions during the start of the Revolution. From 1793 he organized a rebellion in the Morbihan against the National Convention of the First Republic. It was quickly suppressed, and he thereupon joined the army of the Vendée insurrection, taking part in the battles of Le Mans and of Savenay in December of the same year.

Returning to Morbihan, he was arrested, and imprisoned at Brest. He succeeded, however, in escaping, and began again the struggle against the Revolution. In spite of the defeat of his party, and of the fact that he was forced several times to take refuge in England, Cadoudal did not cease both to wage war and to conspire in favour of the Royalist pretender Louis, count of Provence. In 1799 he was a regular visitor at Mont Orgueil, Jersey where he would meet Philippe d&#x27;Auvergne, a British spymaster. He refused to come to any understanding with the government, although offers were made to him by Napoleon Bonaparte, who admired his skill and his obstinate energy.

From 1800 it was impossible for Cadoudal to continue to wage open war, so he centered his efforts on conspiracies. In December, he was indirectly involved in an attempt on the life of the First Consul, led by in the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise, and fled to England again.

On the night of 23 August 1803, landed Georges and several other Chouans at the foot of the cliffs of Biville. The conspirators wanted to undertake a new kidnap or assassination attempt on Bonaparte whilst on the road to Malmaison. Although under nominal police surveillance, he succeeded in eluding pursuit for six months, but was arrested for long periods. Found guilty and sentenced to death, he refused to ask for pardon and was guillotined in Paris, along with eleven of his companions. Before being executed, he shouted to the crowd: &quot;And now, it&#x27;s time to show to the Parisians how Christians, Royalists and Bretons die&quot;.

During the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Cadoudal was made a Marshal of France posthumously by Louis XVIII.

Cadoudal features as a main character in the 1940 Rafael Sabatini novel, &quot;The Marquis of Carabas&quot; (also known as &quot;Master-At-Arms&quot;). He is also portrayed in &quot;The Companions of Jehu&quot; and &quot;The Knight of Sainte-Hermine&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père.

<text>The Intel i486SL is the power-saving variant of the i486DX microprocessor. The SL was designed for use in mobile computers. It was produced between November 1992 and June 1993. Clock speeds available were 20, 25 and 33 MHz. The i486SL contained all features of the i486DX.

In addition, the System Management Mode (SMM) (the same mode introduced with i386SL) was included with this processor. The system management mode makes it possible to shut down the processor without losing data. To achieve this, the processor state is saved in an area of static RAM (SMRAM).

In mid-1993, Intel incorporated the SMM feature in all its new 80486 processors and discontinued the SL series.

Refer to the respective section of the list of Intel microprocessors for technical details.

<text>In mathematics, a trivial group or zero group is a group that consists of a single element. All such groups are isomorphic, so one often speaks of the trivial group. The single element of the trivial group is the identity element and so it is usually denoted as such: , , or depending on the context. If the group operation is denoted then it is defined by . 

The similarly defined  is also a group since its only element is its own inverse, and is hence the same as the trivial group. 

The trivial group is distinct from the empty set, which has no elements, hence lacks an identity element, and so cannot be a group.

== Definitions ==
Given any group , the group that consists of only the identity element is a subgroup of , and, being the trivial group, is called the of .

The term, when referred to &quot; has no nontrivial proper subgroups&quot; refers to the only subgroups of being the trivial group and the group itself.

== Properties ==
The trivial group is cyclic of order ; as such it may be denoted or . If the group operation is called addition, the trivial group is usually denoted by . If the group operation is called multiplication then can be a notation for the trivial group. Combining these leads to the trivial ring in which the addition and multiplication operations are identical and . 

The trivial group serves as the zero object in the category of groups, meaning it is both an initial object and a terminal object.

The trivial group can be made a (bi-)ordered group by equipping it with the trivial non-strict order .

<doc id="193062" wikidata="Q211754" url="?curid=193062" title="Eurovision Song Contest 1978">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1978 was the 23rd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Paris, France, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau et l&#x27;Enfant&quot; by Marie Myriam. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (TF1), the contest was held at the Grand Amphitheatre inside the on 22 April 1978 and was directed by . The contest was presented by French television presenters Denise Fabre and Léon Zitrone. This was the first time that more than one presenter had hosted the contest as well as the first to have a male presenter since .

Twenty countries participated, the highest number of competing countries in the history of the competition at the time. and both returned to the contest. Denmark had not participated since , 12 years before.

The winner of the contest was with the song &quot;A-Ba-Ni-Bi&quot; by Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta. The winning entry was a love song sung in the Hebrew equivalent of Ubbi dubbi (the title is an expansion of the Hebrew word , meaning &quot;I&quot;). This was &#x27;s first Eurovision win, and it was also the first winning song to be performed in one of the Semitic languages. Furthermore, it was also the only winning song to be conducted by a woman, Nurit Hirsh. finished last for the fifth time, gaining the first &quot;nul points&quot; after the new voting system was implemented in .

== Location ==

 (TF1) staged the contest at the , a multi propose venue in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. Designed by French architect Guillaume Gillet, the venue was inaugurated in 1974.

== Participating countries ==

Denmark returned to the competition after having been absent for twelve years, while Turkey did so after missing out two years. This meant that, for the first time, the contest had twenty entries competing.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Jean Vallée had represented ; and Norbert Niedermeyer as part of Springtime had represented as part of Milestones. In addition, Ireen Sheer representing Germany, had represented .

== Format ==
The postcards were filmed live, featuring the artists making their way to the stage. They took a corridor, then an elevator. Leaving the lift, they were greeted by the previous participants and then made their entrances to the stage. The camera also made several shots of the audience, notably Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg.

Each song was accompanied by a 45-piece orchestra.

The Swedish participant Björn Skifs was unhappy with the rule that every country would have to perform in their native language. He planned to sing in English anyway, but changed his mind at the last moment, causing him to completely forget the lyrics. He therefore sang the first few lines in gibberish before finding the words again.

The Israeli win caused problems for several North African and Middle-Eastern nations that were televising the contest, even though they were not participating. According to author and political commentator John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor in his book &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History&quot;, when Israel became the clear winners during the voting, most of the Arabic stations ended their transmission of the contest. Jordan Television finished the show with a photo of a bunch of daffodils on screen, later announcing that the Belgian entry (which finished second) was the winner.

== Contest overview ==

The contest was held on 22 April 1978, beginning at 21:30 (CEST).

Fears of terrorist attacks like at the Summer Olympics 1972 in Munich and of stage invasions like in meant that security measures in and around the Palais des Congrès were particularly tight: 200 police officers, some of them as undercover agents, tried to prevent any potential incidents. Spectators had to go through metal detectors upon arrival at the Palais des Congrès.

In addition to his duties as a host together with Denise Fabre, Léon Zitrone also served as commentator for France, in an own commentary box backstage.
=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1978 contest are listed below.
* Matías Prats Luque
* Sven Lindahl
* Meral Savcı
* Colin Berry

== Detailed voting results ==

=== 12 points ===
Below is a summary of all 12 points in the final:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. TF1 provided 29 commentary boxes in the auditorium for foreign broadcasters.

In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in 17 other countries, including Algeria, Iceland, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia; in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and the Soviet Union via Intervision; and in Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. No official accounts of the viewing figures are known to exist; an estimate given in French press outlets ahead of the contest put the expected audience at around 350 million viewers worldwide, while media reports put viewing figures between 500 to 600 million.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="193064" wikidata="Q1077694" url="?curid=193064" title="The Nikkei">
<text>The Nikkei, also known as , is the flagship publication of Nikkei, Inc. (based in Tokyo) and the world&#x27;s largest financial newspaper, with a daily circulation exceeding 1.73 million copies. The Nikkei 225, a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has been calculated by the newspaper since 1950.

It is one of the four national newspapers in Japan; the other three are &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;.

==History==
The roots of the Nikkei started with an in-house newspaper department of Mitsui &amp; Company in 1876 when it started publication of &quot;Chugai Bukka Shimpo&quot; (literally &quot;Domestic and Foreign Commodity Price Newspaper&quot;), a weekly market-quotation bulletin. The department was spun out as the &quot;Shokyosha&quot; in 1882. The paper became daily (except Sunday) in 1885 and was renamed &quot;Chugai Shōgyō Shimpo&quot; in 1889. It was merged with &quot;Nikkan Kōgyō&quot; and &quot;Keizai Jiji&quot; and renamed &quot;Nihon Sangyō Keizai Shimbun&quot; in 1942. Its changed its name to the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; in 1946.

== Criticism ==
According to Shusuke Murai and Reiji Yoshida from &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, critics say the Nikkei is &quot;depending too much on leaks — apparently provided by corporate insiders — and the paper is often seen as reluctant to bluntly criticize Japanese firms.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Hiroko Tabuchi said the Nikkei&#x27;s purchase of the FT &quot;Worrying&quot;, further stating that &quot;[The] Nikkei is basically a PR machine for Japanese biz; it initially ignored the 2011 Olympus accounting scandal (which FT broke). Nikkei has also hardly covered the Takata airbag defect; almost no investigative work on that issue whatsoever. Nikkei is Japan Inc.&quot;

== Hong Kong ==

On August 10, 2020, three Hong Kong Police Force officers visited the Hong Kong branch of &quot;The Nikkei&quot; with a court order amid investigations over an advertisement placed in the newspaper a year prior calling for international support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
