<text>The Air Combat Command (ACC) is one of nine Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in the United States Air Force, reporting to Headquarters, United States Air Force (HAF) at the Pentagon. It is the primary provider of air combat forces for the Air Force, and it is the direct successor to Tactical Air Command. Air Combat Command is headquartered at Langley Air Force Base, Joint Base Langley–Eustis, Virginia, United States.

ACC directly operates 1,110 fighter, attack, reconnaissance, combat search and rescue, airborne command and control and electronic aircraft along with command, control, computing, communications and intelligence (C4I) systems, Air Force ground forces, conducts global information operations, and controls Air Force Intelligence. As of 6 April 2023 ACC operated 48 fighter squadrons and nine attack squadrons.

Air Combat Command consists of approximately 74,240 active duty Airmen and 10,610 Department of the Air Force Civilians. When mobilized, more than 49,000 additional Airmen of the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, along with over 700 additional aircraft, are operationally-gained and assigned to ACC, bringing total aircraft to more than 1,800 and number of Airmen to 123,240.

==Mission==
Air Combat Command&#x27;s mission is to provide air combat forces to the geographic Unified Combatant Commands. ACC organizes, trains, equips, and maintains combat-ready units for rapid deployment abroad while also ensuring air defense of the United States is strong enough for both peacetime and wartime needs. ACC Numbered Air Forces serve as the air components for United States Central Command, United States Southern Command, and United States Northern Command. ACC augments the forces of the United States European Command, United States Africa Command, United States Pacific Command, and United States Strategic Command. 

==History==
Air Combat Command was created 1 June 1992 after the inactivation of the Tactical Air Command (TAC), Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Military Airlift Command (MAC). Upon activation, ACC assumed control of all former-TAC fighters, all bombers, reconnaissance platforms, battle management resources, and Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Furthermore, ACC had some KC-135 and KC-10 aerial refueling tankers and C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in its composite, reconnaissance, and other combat wings. In 1993, control of the ICBM force was transferred to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) until transferred again to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) on 1 December 2009.

Following the inactivation of SAC at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, a new unified command, the United States Strategic Command, was activated at Offutt, created to manage the combined strategic nuclear forces belonging to both the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy.

Historically, Combat Command was an earlier air unit designation. During 1941 and early 1942, the tactical air units of the War Department, formerly known as the GHQ Air Force, formed the Air Force Combat Command. The AFCC was dissolved in the reorganization of the United States Army, effective 9 March 1942, which created the United States Army Air Forces as a major command of the Army, which functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent service branch of the Armed Forces.

===Mission Realignments===


====Combat search and rescue====
Not long after activation, ACC underwent organizational and mission changes. The first such major change was the transfer of the combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission from Air Mobility Command to ACC. With the realigning of search and rescue units, ACC gained additional resources, as well as a new mission. The formal transfer took place on 1 February 1993, when the Air Rescue Service (ARS) was assigned to ACC. On 2 July of the same year, the ARS was disestablished and rescue units became fully integrated in the same manner as other ACC units reporting to numbered air forces. The USAF Combat Rescue School was subsequently assigned to the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, Nevada.

====Flight training====
One of the most significant changes for Air Combat Command resulted from an overhaul of flying training responsibilities. Following its activation, ACC was responsible for aircraft-specific aircrew training, including initial weapon system and continuation training. On 1 July 1993, the 58th and 325th Fighter Wings—F-16 and F-15 training units transferred from ACC to Air Education and Training Command (AETC). Concurrently, Luke AFB, Arizona, and Tyndall AFB, Florida, for which those respective wings were the host units, also moved from ACC to AETC ownership. However, on 1 October 2012, both Tyndall AFB and the 325th Fighter Wing returned to the control of ACC.

====Tanker and airlift====
The next major organizational change resulted from a fine-tuning of aerial refueling and airlift resources. From its activation, Air Combat Command had assumed ownership of some C-130 Hercules theater airlift assets and KC-10 Extender and KC-135 Stratotankers. Just as ownership of overseas C-130 resources had already been transferred to USAFE and PACAF commanders, it was decided that all C-130s based in the CONUS would be under the control of ACC, while at the same time, almost all KC-135 tankers would be assigned to Air Mobility Command.

There was historical precedent for the reassignment of C-130s to Air Combat Command. During the earliest days of Tactical Air Command (TAC), the command had carried out the &quot;tactical&quot; or combat airborne aspect of airlift operations, leaving the &quot;strategic&quot; or logistical mission to Military Air Transport Service, later redesignated Military Airlift Command (the precursor of today&#x27;s Air Mobility Command) in 1966. The tactical airlift mission included logistical airlift, airborne operations, aeromedical evacuation, and air support for special operations. This division of the airlift mission continued until 1 December 1974, when TAC transferred its CONUS-based tactical airlift units, including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard tactical airlift units, to Military Airlift Command (MAC). MAC gained the overseas units from theater commands on 31 March 1975.

On 1 October 1993, all Air Mobility Command C-130s with the exception of those permanently under United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) regions were transferred to ACC, while USAFE and PACAF assumed control of the C-130 permanently based in their respective geographic regions. Concurrently, all KC-10 tankers and all KC-135 tankers except those at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, which supported the fighter and bomber aircraft of the composite wing stationed there, transferred to AMC. ACC also retained two KC-135s at Offutt AFB Nebraska and Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota under ACC control until transferring them to AMC on 1 October 1993. McConnell AFB, Kansas; Fairchild AFB, Washington; and their respective air refueling wings were also transferred to AMC in January 1994 and July 1994, respectively.

In 1997, a subsequent USAF reorganization of ACC and AMC resulted in all CONUS-based C-130 theater airlift aircraft being reassigned from ACC back to AMC. This change also shifted operational claimancy for all &quot;slick&quot; theater airlift mission C-130s in the Air Force Reserve and CONUS-based Air National Guard. USAFE and PACAF C-130 assets remained in those respective MAJCOMs to include PACAF&#x27;s operational claimancy for Alaska Air National Guard C-130 and HC-130 assets.

===Operational deployments===
In Southwest Asia, Air Combat Command provided active duty and reserve component forces for the follow-on to Operation Desert Storm and the establishment of Operation Southern Watch to deter Iraqi aggression. In October 1994, ACC also demonstrated its ability to react quickly to the buildup of Iraqi troops near the border of Kuwait. In addition, ACC, from its inception, has provided indispensable support to counter-drug operations, including Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), reconnaissance and fighter aircraft, as well as radar and connectivity assets.

Participation in humanitarian operations has also been a recurring theme. Air Combat Command supported the humanitarian efforts of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), deploying active duty and air reserve component forces to Provide Promise and Deny Flight in Eastern Europe and Operation Provide Comfort out of Incirlik AB, Turkey. Provide Promise offered humanitarian relief airlift support to the city of Sarajevo, while Deny Flight enforced the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone against Serb air attacks on Bosnian civilians. Operation Provide Comfort, another humanitarian operation, also provided relief to Kurdish inhabitants of northern Iraq who had undergone fierce repression by the Iraqi government.

In addition, ACC supported United States Atlantic Command&#x27;s humanitarian relief to Haitian refugees associated with Operation GTMO at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. Similarly, the command supported Operation Safe Haven and the processing of Cuban refugees during the latter part of the summer of 1994. Across the Atlantic, Air Combat Command units participated in Operation Restore Hope, largely an Air Mobility Command humanitarian operation intended to provide food for Somalia. Also, ACC regular and ACC-gained Air National Guard C-130 units deployed to Uganda and Kenya to participate in Operation Support Hope. This operation, conducted by the United States European Command, comprised part of the United Nations effort to provide humanitarian relief to victims of the civil war in Rwanda.

In keeping with its global responsibilities, ACC initiated a series of &quot;Global Power&quot; missions in 1993. ACC&#x27;s bomber wings are required to perform out-of-CONUS training flights to demonstrate the capability to perform their &quot;quick reaction&quot; worldwide mission. On one of the global power missions, two B-1 Lancer aircraft of the 28th Bomb Wing, Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, set a B-1 flying time record on the first leg of their round-the-world flight, 11–13 August 1993. The following year, two B-52s from the 2d Bomb Wing, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, circumnavigated the globe in 47.2 hours, the longest jet aircraft flight in history.

===Global war on terrorism===
Air Combat Command units flew operational missions during the 2002 Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (OEF-A) and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The task of developing a comprehensive listing of ACC units present in Iraq, Afghanistan and other combat areas is particularly difficult as the events of 11 September 2001 and the Global War on Terrorism has made such an effort significantly difficult. The USAF seeks to improve operational security (OPSEC) and to deceive potential enemies as to the extent of American operations, therefore a listing of which units deploying where and when is unavailable.

However, it is certain that ACC units are actively flying combat missions in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.

<text>The European stonechat (Saxicola rubicola) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a subspecies of the common stonechat. Long considered a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, genetic evidence has placed it and its relatives in the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. It is found across Europe, as far east as Ukraine and the South Caucasus, and in parts of North Africa.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The European stonechat was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla rubicola&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Saxicola&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802. The English name derives from its call, sounding like two stones knocked together. The scientific name &quot;Saxicola&quot; means &quot;rock-dweller&quot;, from Latin &quot;saxum&quot; meaning &quot;a rock&quot; and &quot;incola&quot; meaning &quot;dwelling in&quot;. The specific epithet combines the Latin &quot;rubus&quot; meaning &quot;brambles&quot; with &quot;incola&quot;. The subspecies name &quot;hibernans&quot; refers to Ireland (Latin, &quot;Hibernia&quot;).

In the past, the European stonechat was generally considered conspecific with the Siberian stonechat and African stonechat, lumped together as common stonechat &quot;S. torquatus&quot;. A 2002 study using mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequences and nuclear DNA microsatellite fingerprinting evidence strongly supported their separation into distinct species. Due to a misunderstanding of the rules of Zoological nomenclature, for a short time the name &quot;S. torquatus&quot; was erroneously used for the European stonechat rather than the African stonechat.

Together with the Siberian stonechat and Canary Islands stonechat, the European stonechat constitutes eastern and western representatives of a Eurasian lineage; the Asian and European populations separated during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5–2.5 mya, and Fuerteventura was colonised by western European or northwest African birds somewhat later in the Early Pleistocene, about 1–2 mya.

===Subspecies===
Two weakly defined subspecies are currently recognised:

* &quot;S. r. hibernans&quot; (Hartert, E, 1910) – Northwestern Europe in Atlantic coastal areas, in southwestern Norway, Great Britain, Ireland and northwestern France. Birds in coastal Portugal are also often listed as this subspecies, but this is disputed.
* &quot;S. r. rubicola&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – In the south and east of its range, from Denmark southwest to Spain and Morocco, east to Poland and Ukraine, and southeast to Turkey. Winters in North Africa and the Middle East.

==Description==
The stonechat is long and weighs , slightly smaller than the European robin. Both sexes have distinctively short wings, shorter than those of the more migratory whinchat and Siberian stonechat. The summer male has black upperparts, a black head, an orange throat and breast, and a white belly and vent. It also has a white half-collar on the sides of its neck, a small white scapular patch on the wings, and a very small white patch on the rump often streaked with black. The female has brown upperparts and head, and no white neck patches, rump or belly, these areas being streaked dark brown on paler brown, the only white being the scapular patch on the wings and even this often being buffy-white.

The two subspecies differ in colour intensity following Gloger&#x27;s rule, with &quot;S. r. rubicola&quot; paler and with larger white patches in the drier European continental and mediterranean climates, and &quot;S. r. hibernans&quot; darker brown with less white in the humid Atlantic oceanic climate. They intergrade broadly where their ranges meet, from southeastern England south through France and Spain, and many individuals are not identifiable to subspecies. Extreme examples of &quot;S. r. rubicola&quot; from the driest southern areas of its range such as the Algarve and Sicily are particularly pale and with a large white rump, and can be very similar to Siberian stonechats in appearance. nDNA microsatellite fingerprinting reveals a very small degree of separation between the two subspecies.

The male&#x27;s song is high and twittering like a dunnock. Both sexes have a clicking call like stones knocking together.

==Distribution and habitat==
European stonechats breed in heathland, coastal dunes and rough grassland with scattered small shrubs and bramble, open gorse, tussocks or heather. They are short-distance migrants or non-migratory, with part of the population (particularly from northeastern parts of the range, where winters are colder) moving south to winter further south in Europe and more widely in north Africa.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
European stonechats first breed when they are one year old. They are monogamous during the breeding season but do not pair for life. The nest is built entirely by the female and is placed in dense vegetation close to the ground. It is a loose unwoven cup of dried grass lined with hair and feathers. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals. The clutch is typically 4–6 eggs, which are pale blue to greenish-blue with red-brown freckles that are more numerous at the larger end. The average size of an egg is with a weight of . They are incubated for 13–14 days by the female beginning after the last egg is laid. Both parents care for and feed the chicks. They are brooded by the female. The nestlings fledge 12–16 days after hatching but continue to be fed by both parents for a further 4–5 days after which the female begins building a new nest for another brood while the male continues to feed the young for another 5–10 days. The parents raise two or three broods in a season.

They are mainly riverine living people, but about 20% reside in the dry inland. Their livelihood is based on fishery, livestock-keeping and cropping (mainly pearl millet). The Kavango Region of Namibia is named after the people.

In traditional politics they are divided into five kingdoms (Kwangali, Mbunza, Shambyu, Gciriku and Mbukushu), each headed by a &quot;hompa&quot; or &quot;fumu&quot;, both meaning &quot;king&quot;. Traditional law is still in use and legitimized by the Namibian constitution. The Kavango people are matrilinear. The most common language spoken is RuKwangali (in Kwangali and Mbunza territory); also spoken are Shambyu, Gciriku, and Mbukushu in the corresponding territories. Their religion is mainly Christian although traditional elements still have a place. During the harvest season in April the vakwangali people eat (mafumpura) a tuber like plant which is dug from the soil when it starts to crack. Their kitchens are built outside houses which they call (masuga) the roof of this kitchen is mainly thatch. Their staple food is pearl millet porridge. Pearl millet is also used by them to make a fermented drink.

==The extended family concept==
Ekoro is a very important social relation in kinship systems of Kavango. It may be roughly referred to as an extended family, but it is more than that. It is a social relation dominantly rooted in clan and it is not necessarily determined by blood connections. The clans are ranked according to seniority, and whoever belongs to a junior clan (irrespective of age) is deemed young by those in the senior clan. There is a command of respect and high level of obedience towards the senior clan. Other people can also become clan members by seeking allegiance due to various unifying circumstances such as floods or war.

<text>Zalmay Mamozy Khalilzad (, ; born March 22, 1951) is an American diplomat and foreign policy expert. Khalilzad was the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation from September 2018 to October 2021. Khailzad was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as United States ambassador to the United Nations, serving in the role from 2007 to 2009. Khalilzad was the highest ranking Muslim-American in government at the time he left the position. Prior to this, Khalilzad served in the Bush administration as ambassador to Afghanistan from 2004 to 2005 and Ambassador to Iraq from 2005 to 2007.

Raised in the Afghan capital of Kabul, Khalilzad came to the United States as a high school exchange student, and later received his doctorate at the University of Chicago. During the Reagan Administration, Khalilzad served in the Department of State, where he advised on the U.S. response to the Soviet–Afghan War. Khalilzad later served as a counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and as president of Gryphon Partners and Khalilzad Associates, an international business consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.

Khalilzad was rumored to be a potential candidate in the 2014 Afghan presidential election but ultimately declined to run. In 2017, he was considered for secretary of state by President Donald Trump. Khalilzad was appointed by Trump to serve as special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation on September 5, 2018, remaining in the position under President Joe Biden until October 18, 2021. In this position, Khalilzad helped broker the US–Taliban deal and facilitating the final United States withdrawal from Afghanistan.

==Early life and education==
While his parents hail from the Laghman Province, Khalilzad was born in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, and grew up in the country&#x27;s capital, Kabul. He is an ethnic Pashtun from the Noorzai tribe. Khalilzad began his education at the public Ghazi Lycée school in Kabul.

Khalilzad first spent time in the United States as a high school exchange student with AFS Intercultural Programs in Ceres, California. Later, he attained his bachelor&#x27;s and his master&#x27;s degrees from the American University of Beirut, in Lebanon. Khalilzad received his doctorate at the University of Chicago where he studied closely with Albert Wohlstetter, a prominent nuclear deterrence thinker and strategist. Wohlstetter provided Khalilzad with contacts within the government and RAND. Khalilzad has contributed at least 28 papers to RAND Corporation.

==Early career==

From 1979 to 1989, Khalilzad worked as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Columbia University&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs. During that time, he worked closely with Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Carter administration&#x27;s architect of Operation Cyclone to support the Afghan mujahideen, who resisted the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan.

In 1984, Khalilzad accepted a one-year Council on Foreign Relations fellowship to join the US State Department, where he was an adviser to the Near East and South Asia Bureau, headed by Richard W. Murphy.

From 1985 to 1989, Khalilzad served in the Reagan administration, as a senior State Department official, advising on the Soviet–Afghan War, after the Soviet invasion. During that time, he was a member of the Policy Planning Staff and the State Department&#x27;s special adviser on Afghanistan to Undersecretary of State Michael H. Armacost. In that role, he developed and guided the international program to promote the merits of a mujahideen-led Afghanistan ousting the Soviet occupation. From 1990 to 1992, Khalilzad served under President George H. W. Bush in the Defense Department, as deputy undersecretary for policy planning.

Between 1993 and 2000, Khalilzad was the director of the strategy, doctrine, and force structure at the RAND Corporation. During that time, he helped found RAND&#x27;s Center for Middle Eastern Studies as well as &quot;Strategic Appraisal,&quot; a RAND periodical. He also authored several influential monographs, including &quot;The United States and a Rising China&quot; and &quot;From Containment to Global Leadership? America and the World After the Cold War.&quot; At RAND, he also had a brief stint in consulting for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which was conducting a risk analysis for Unocal, now part of Chevron, for a proposed 1400 km (890 mi), $2-billion, 622 m³/s (22,000 ft³/s) Trans-Afghanistan gas pipeline project, which would have extended from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan and then proceeded to Pakistan.

===Support for U.S. global leadership===
Khalilzad also wrote several articles on the subject of the value of U.S. global leadership in the mid-1990s. The specific scenarios for conflict that he envisioned if a decline in American power occurred have made his writings extremely popular in competitive high school and college policy debate, particularly his writing that links the loss of US hegemony to global instability. Khalilzad was a signatory of the letter from members of the Project for the New American Century to President Bill Clinton sent on January 26, 1998. It called for Clinton&#x27;s help in &quot;removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power&quot; by using &quot;a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts.&quot;

== Views ==

=== American politics ===
Khalilzad has been described as a &quot;lifelong Republican&quot;, though he did not support Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign.

=== United States&#x27; role in the world ===
Khalilzad has sometimes been characterized as a neoconservative, with one profile in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006 characterizing him as &quot;combin[ing] the commitment of an American neocon with the cultural sensitivity of his Islamic background.&quot; At times, Khalilzad has embraced the label, authoring an article titled &quot;The Neoconservative Case for Negotiating With Iran&quot; in &quot;Politico&quot; magazine in 2006.

In 1995, Khalilzad articulated his views regarding the appropriate role of the United States in the Post-Cold War period:The United States should be willing to use force if necessary for this purpose. There are currently two regions whose control by a hostile power could pose a global challenge: East Asia and Europe. The Persian Gulf is critically important for a different reason—its oil resources are vital for the world economy. In the long term, the relative importance of various regions can change. A region that is critical to American interests now might become less important, while some other region might gain in importance.&quot;Regarding U.S. military preeminence, Khalilzad argued in favor of maintaining a sufficiently strong military to be able to embark in &quot;two major regional contingencies nearly simultaneously&quot;:For the foreseeable future, this means having the capability for fighting two major regional contingencies nearly simultaneously, e.g., Korea and the Gulf. The United States should also acquire increased capabilities for occasional intervention in lesser regional conflicts, such as humanitarian relief operations, and for countering weapons of mass destruction and ballistic and cruise missiles. For the longer term, it should consider moving toward sizing its forces to be able to defeat the plausible military challenges to critical American interests that might be posed by the two next most powerful military forces in the world—which are not allied with the United States.

=== Afghanistan ===

==== Taliban ====
In June 2001, Khalilzad argued that the &quot;United States must act now to weaken the Taliban and stem the spread of &quot;Talibanism&quot;.&quot; In a letter, Khalilzad endorsed the following policies to weaken the Taliban&#x27;s control over Afghanistan:

# change the balance of power by offering assistance to the foes of the Taliban;
# oppose the Taliban ideology—giving air time over the Voice of America to Taliban opponents and moderate Islamic leaders;
# press Pakistan to withdraw its support;
# aid victims of the Taliban;
# support moderate Afghans through helping to convene a grand assembly to select a broad transitional government; and
# elevate the importance of Afghanistan at home.

==== Peace Process in Afghanistan ====
In June 2009, Khalilzad stated the following at a UC Berkeley event:
I believe and I&#x27;ve told president Karzai few month ago, because he is talking a lot about reconciliation, which is conceptually an absolute necessity, every war must end, but circumstance must be created for that wish to be successful. I&#x27;ve told him [to] get your house in order first, get the corruption issue dealt with, get governance improved, get services improved, then people would say `ahaa ... i want to be on this side, it looks like it is a better side, the side that is producing resolve.&#x27; But if they see your judges are corrupt, and your governors are not providing any services, initially people would think `why should I die for this, I&#x27;m going to become neutral`, or worse if the other side is providing more security, let&#x27;s say, it [sic] will be even more difficult.&quot; 

=== North Korea ===
In a published 1993 paper, he advocated for &quot;trade sanctions&quot; against North Korea, &quot;enhancing U.S. and South Korean military readiness&quot;, and &quot;direct military attacks&quot;.Use of force by a U.S.—allied coalition has better prospects for achieving the U.S. objective, either by setting back the program or by producing a more compliant North Korea—depending on how much and how effectively the force is applied. However, given the risk of triggering a second Korean war, it is unclear whether the South Koreans or Japanese could be induced to agree. 

== George W. Bush administration (2001-2009) ==

=== U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan ===

In 2001, President George W. Bush asked Khalilzad to head his transition team for the Department of Defense, and Khalilzad briefly served as counselor to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. In May 2001, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice announced Khalilzad&#x27;s appointment as special assistant to the president and senior director for Southwest Asia, Near East, and North African affairs on the National Security Council. In December 2002, Bush appointed Khalilzad to the position of ambassador at large for free Iraqis with the task of coordinating &quot;preparations for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.&quot;

After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Bush came to rely on Khalilzad&#x27;s Afghanistan expertise. Khalilzad was involved in the early stages of planning to overthrow the Taliban and on December 31, 2001, he was selected as Bush&#x27;s special presidential envoy for Afghanistan. He served in that position until November 2003, when he was appointed to serve as US ambassador to Afghanistan. Khalilzad held that position from November 2003 until June 2005.

During that time, he oversaw the drafting of the constitution of Afghanistan, was involved with the country&#x27;s first elections and helped to organize the first meeting of Afghanistan&#x27;s Loya Jirga (traditional grand assembly). At the June 2002 Loya Jirga to select the Head of State, representatives of the US convinced the former king of Afghanistan, 87-year-old Zahir Shah, to withdraw from consideration even though a majority of Loya Jirga delegates supported him. That move angered Pashtuns, who were concerned with the disproportionate power of the Northern Alliance in the Karzai government. During Khalilzad&#x27;s tenure as ambassador, the new Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, consulted closely with him on a regular basis about political decisions, and the two dined together regularly. In 2004 and 2005, he was also involved in helping with the establishment of the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF), which is the first American-style higher learning educational institution in Afghanistan. In 2016, the Friends of the American University of Afghanistan presented him with the International Public Service Award.

=== U.S. Ambassador to Iraq ===
Khalilzad began his job as the U.S. ambassador to Iraq on June 21, 2005. He was credited for helping negotiate compromises which allowed the ratification of the Constitution of Iraq in October 2005. Khalilzad also worked to ensure that the December 2005 elections ran smoothly and played a substantial role in forming the first post-Saddam government. Khalilzad also helped establish the American University of Iraq, in Sulaimaniya, and sits on its board of regents.

In comparison to his predecessors, Paul Bremer and John Negroponte, in Baghdad, Khalilzad was considered a success as an ambassador and credited with bringing a cultural sophistication and human touch to the job that helped connect with Iraqis.

Khalilzad was one of the first high-level administration officials to warn that sectarian violence was overtaking the insurgency as the top threat to Iraq&#x27;s stability. After the Al Askari Mosque bombing, in February 2006, he warned that spreading sectarian violence might lead to civil war and possibly to even a broader conflict, involving neighboring countries. Khalilzad sought political solutions to the problem of sectarianism, and in particular, he worked to integrate the balance of power between Iraq&#x27;s three main ethnic groups to head off growing the growing Sunni violence.

Khalilzad&#x27;s term as ambassador ended on March 26, 2007. He was replaced by Ryan Crocker, a career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.

=== U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations ===
On February 12, 2007, the White House submitted Khalilzad&#x27;s nomination to the Senate to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He was unanimously confirmed by the Democratic-controlled US Senate on March 29, 2007. That marked a strong contrast to Khalilzad&#x27;s predecessor, John R. Bolton, whose often-controversial rhetoric caused him to fail to be confirmed by the Senate but obtained a recess appointment.

Colleagues at the UN noted that Khalilzad has a different style from Bolton and was more conciliatory.

In November 2007, Khalilzad charged that Iran was helping the insurgent groups in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also told the media, soon after the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s release of its report on Iran, that the Iranian government was clearly going ahead with its nuclear program. Khalilzad explained that the US would try to pass another resolution in the Security Council, under Chapter 7, to impose additional sanctions against Iran.

In August 2008, he urged the Security Council to &quot;take urgent action&quot; and to &quot;condemn Russia&#x27;s military assault on the sovereign state of Georgia&quot;. He also stated that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had told US Secretary of State Rice that Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili &quot;must go.&quot;

== Private sector (2009–2018) ==
From 2009 to 2018, Khalilzad served as the President of Khalilzad Associates, LLC, an &quot;international advisory firm that serves clients at the nexus of commerce and public policies, helping global businesses navigate the most promising and challenging international markets.&quot; Khalilzad Associates and its parent company, Gryphon Capital Partners, have, as clients, international and US companies that interested mainly in doing business in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to Khalilzad, they include companies in the sectors of energy, construction, education, and infrastructure.

Khalilzad served as a Counselor at the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) and sits on the Boards of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), America Abroad Media (AAM), the RAND Corporation&#x27;s Middle East Studies Center, the Atlantic Council, the American University of Iraq in Suleymania (AUIS), The American University of Kurdistan (AUK), and the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF).

On September 9, 2014, a news items appeared in the Austrian media, stating that Khalilzad was being investigated by authorities in Austria for suspected money laundering, and that his wife&#x27;s accounts had been frozen. On September 10, the Austrian court made known that the case had been dismissed and the accounts had been ordered unfrozen a week earlier, on September 3. The leak was the result of court documents having been discarded unshredded in the general trash, and then found by scavenging bloggers.

In 2015, he donated over $100,000 to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank.

Khalilzad&#x27;s political autobiography, &quot;The Envoy: From Kabul to the White House, My Journey Through a Turbulent World&quot;, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in 2016.

==Envoy for Afghan Reconciliation and aftermath==

In September 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named Khalilzad as the Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, a newly created envoy with the mission of securing a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan. As of March 2021, he has continued in this role under the new administration of Joe Biden.

On May 18, 2021, at a U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on U.S. policy in Afghanistan, Khalilzad downplayed the prospect of a swift Taliban takeover when U.S. forces leave saying, &quot;If they [Taliban] pursue, in my judgment, a military victory, it will result in a long war, because Afghan security forces will fight, other Afghans will fight, neighbors will come to support different forces.&quot;

He later added at that same hearing, &quot;I personally believe that the statements that the [Afghan] forces will disintegrate, and the Talibs will take over in short order are mistaken. The real choices that the Afghans will face is between a long war and negotiated settlement.&quot; Despite this statement, the 2021 Taliban offensive culminated in a swift Taliban takeover and the dissolution of the Afghan National Army. Ahmad Wali Massoud, a Taliban adversary who was also critical of the government of Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, accused Khalizad of playing a role in orchestrating the Taliban&#x27;s return to power in an interview which was published in TRT World on September 21, 2021. Massoud argued that the Taliban did not have the military capacity to retake Kabul without great assistance and also cast suspicion on growing U.S. efforts to use the Taliban to fight the terrorist group ISIS-K.

In 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Khalilzad attended a dinner with Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Khalilzad reportedly stated &quot;we need an agreement&quot; to end the war in Ukraine, which Antonov was said to have agreed with. Dimitri Simes, president and CEO of the Center for the National Interest, also attended the dinner, where he pitched the idea of starting a new media outlet in Moscow, an idea Khalilzad said could be &quot;very lucrative&quot;.

==Awards==
Khalilzad&#x27;s service in the government has been recognized by three different secretaries of defense: Robert Gates awarded Khalilzad the Department of Defense medal for outstanding public service for his service in Iraq. Donald Rumsfeld awarded Khalilzad the Department of Defense medal for outstanding public service for his work in Afghanistan. Dick Cheney awarded Khalilzad the Department of Defense medal for outstanding public service for his time as assistant deputy under secretary of defense for policy planning from 1991 to 1992.

Khalilzad has also been awarded the highest national medals by the presidents of Afghanistan, Georgia and Kosovo. In Afghanistan he was awarded the King Amanullah Medal in 2005. The Georgian president awarded Khalilzad the Order of the Golden Fleece in 2016. Kosovo&#x27;s president awarded Khalilzad the Order of Independence in 2017.

==Personal life==
Khalilzad is an ethnic Pashtun. Khalilzad&#x27;s wife is author and political analyst Cheryl Benard. They met in 1972 while they were both students at the American University of Beirut. They have two children.

<doc id="193907" wikidata="Q18826" url="?curid=193907" title="Autonomous Region of Bougainville">
<text>Bougainville ( ; Tok Pisin: &quot;Bogenvil&quot;), officially the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (Tok Pisin: &quot;Otonomos Region bilong Bogenvil&quot;), is an autonomous region in Papua New Guinea. The largest island is Bougainville Island, while the region also includes Buka Island and a number of outlying islands and atolls. The current capital is Buka, situated on Buka Island.

In 2011, the region had an estimated population of 250,000. The lingua franca of Bougainville is Tok Pisin, while a variety of Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages are also spoken. The region includes several Polynesian outliers where Polynesian languages are spoken. Geographically, the islands of Bougainville and Buka form part of the Solomon Islands archipelago, but are politically separate from the independent country of Solomon Islands. Historically, Bougainville and Buka, together with the islands of Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands, and Ontong Java, which are all now part of the country of Solomon Islands, formed the German Solomon Islands Protectorate, the geographical area later being referred to as the North Solomon Islands.

Bougainville has been inhabited by humans for at least 29,000 years. During the colonial period, the region was occupied and administered by the Germans, Australians, Japanese, and Americans for various periods. The name of the region originates from French admiral Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who reached it in 1768.

Bougainvillean separatism dates to the 1960s, and the Republic of the North Solomons was declared shortly before the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975; it was subsumed into Papua New Guinea the following year. Conflict over the Panguna mine became the primary trigger for the Bougainville Civil War (1988–1998), which resulted in the deaths of up to 20,000 people. A peace agreement resulted in the creation of the Autonomous Bougainville Government.

In late 2019, a non-binding independence referendum was held with 98% voting for independence rather than continued autonomy within Papua New Guinea. As a result, the regional authorities intend to become independent between 2025 and 2027, pending ratification by the Papua New Guinean government. If ratified, the capital may relocate from Buka back to the previous location of Arawa.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
Bougainville has been inhabited by humans for at least 29,000 years, according to evidence obtained from Kilu Cave on Buka Island. Until about 10,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a single island referred to as &quot;Greater Bougainville&quot; that spanned from the northern tip of Buka Island to the Nggela Islands north of Guadalcanal.

The first inhabitants of Bougainville were Australo-Melanesians who presumably arrived from the Bismarck Archipelago. Around 3,000 years ago, Austronesian peoples brought the Lapita culture to the islands, introducing pottery, agriculture, and domesticated animals such as pigs, dogs, and chickens. Both Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages are spoken on the islands to this day, however there has been significant mixing between the populations to the point that cultural and genetic differences are no longer correlated with language.

===Colonial history===

The first Europeans to sight present-day Bougainville were the Dutch explorers Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire, who glimpsed Takuu Atoll and Nissan Island in 1616. British naval officer Philip Carteret saw Buka Island in 1767 and also visited the islands that were later named in his honour. In 1768, French admiral Louis Antoine de Bougainville sailed along the east coast of the island that now bears his name.

====German administration====
The German Empire, which had already begun operations in New Guinea, annexed present-day Bougainville in 1886, after agreeing with the United Kingdom to divide the Solomon Islands archipelago between them. A German protectorate over the northern islands was established later that year, but the British Solomon Islands Protectorate was not established until 1893. The initial boundary between the two territories was much more southerly, with Choiseul Island, Santa Isabel Island, Ontong Java, the Shortland Islands, and part of the Florida Islands included in the German section. The current boundary between PNG and Solomon Islands is derived from the Tripartite Convention of 1899, which saw those islands ceded to the United Kingdom.

The German Solomon Islands were administered through German New Guinea, although it took almost two decades for an administrative presence to be established. The German administrative station at Kieta, established in 1905, was preceded by a Marist mission, which succeeded in converting a majority of the islanders to Catholicism. The first fully commercial plantation was established in 1908, but German annexation had little economic impact.

====Australian administration====
The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force occupied Bougainville in December 1914, as part of the Australian occupation of German New Guinea. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles established the former colony as a League of Nations mandate, administered by Australia as the Territory of New Guinea. A civilian administration was established in 1920, after which German nationals were deported and their property expropriated. A number of punitive expeditions took place during both the German and Australian administrations, as part of &quot;pacification&quot; programs. The colonial period saw significant changes in the culture of the islanders.
In 1942, Bougainville was invaded by the Japanese in order to provide a support base for the operations elsewhere in the South-West Pacific. The Allied counter-invasion resulted in heavy casualties, beginning in 1943, with full control of the islands not re-established until 1945. After the war the Australian government incorporated Bougainville and the rest of the mandate into the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, the immediate predecessor of present-day Papua New Guinea.

===Modern history===
Papua New Guinea gained its independence from Australia in 1975. As Bougainville is rich in copper and gold, a large mine had been established at Panguna in the early 1970s by Bougainville Copper Limited, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. Disputes by regional residents with the company over adverse environmental impacts, failure to share financial benefits, and negative social changes brought by the mine resulted in a local revival for a secessionist movement that had been dormant. Activists proclaimed the independence of Bougainville (Republic of North Solomons) in 1975 and in 1990, but both times government forces suppressed the separatists.

====Civil war====

In 1988, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) increased their activity significantly. Prime Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu ordered the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) to put down the rebellion, and the conflict escalated into a civil war. The PNGDF retreated from permanent positions on Bougainville in 1990 but continued military action. The conflict involved pro-independence and loyalist Bougainvillean groups as well as the PNGDF. The war claimed an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 lives.

In 1996, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan made the controversial move to hire Sandline International, a private military company previously involved in supplying mercenaries in the civil war in Sierra Leone, to put down the rebellion.

==== Peace agreement and autonomy====

The Bougainville conflict ended in 1997 after negotiations brokered by New Zealand. In 2000, A peace agreement was completed and, together with disarmament, provided for the establishment of an Autonomous Bougainville Government. The parties agreed to have a referendum in the future on whether the island should become politically independent.

On 25 July 2005, rebel leader Francis Ona died after a short illness. A former surveyor with Bougainville Copper, Ona was a key figure in the secessionist conflict and had refused to formally join the island&#x27;s peace process.

In 2015, Australia announced it would establish a diplomatic post in Bougainville for the first time. In 2016, it cancelled those plans acknowledging that it had not obtained the PNG government&#x27;s approval.

==== Independence referendum ====
In 2019, a non-binding independence referendum was held with 98.3% voting for independence rather than continued autonomy within Papua New Guinea. As a result, the regional authorities intend to become independent between 2025 and 2027. A draft constitution for a &quot;Republic of Bougainville&quot; was published by the Autonomous Bougainville Government in May 2024.

== Geography ==
The Bougainville region occupies the north of the Solomon archipelago with Bougainville Island, which is the largest island of this group. The border between Papua New Guinea and the nation of Solomon Islands lies just south in the middle of a strait that separates it from the Shortland Islands.

The island of Buka is north of Bougainville, separated by a narrow strait. The region includes other more or less remote islands and atolls:

*the Green Islands with its main island Nissan;
*the Carteret Islands;
*Takuu Atoll, a Polynesian outlier;
*Nukumanu Atoll, a Polynesian outlier;
*the Nuguria Islands, a Polynesian outlier.

The territory constitutes an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean that has an area of 9384 square kilometres.

==Government and politics==

Elections for the first autonomous government were held in May and June 2005; Joseph Kabui, an independence leader, was elected president. He died in office on 6 June 2008. After interim elections to fill the remainder of his term, John Momis was elected as president in 2010 for a five-year term. He supports autonomy within a relationship with the national government of Papua New Guinea.

The Constitution of Bougainville specifies that the Autonomous Bougainville Government shall consist of three branches:

* Executive: the President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville who chairs the Bougainville Executive Council.
* Legislative: the Bougainville House of Representatives (39 elected members and two ex officio members).
* Judicial: the Bougainville Courts including a Supreme Court and High Court.

The capital city is Buka, which became the centre of government after Arawa was damaged during the Bougainville Civil War. The status of Buka is considered temporary, and the government is deciding on the location of a permanent capital.

===2019 independence referendum===

President John Momis confirmed that Bougainville would hold a non-binding independence referendum in 2019. The governments of both Bougainville and Papua New Guinea held a two-week referendum period which began on 23 November 2019 and closed on 7 December 2019, which is the final step in the Bougainville Peace Agreement. The referendum question was a choice between greater autonomy within Papua New Guinea, or full independence. Over 98% of the valid ballots were cast for independence.

Ishmael Toroama, a former rebel leader, was elected president of Bougainville on 23 September 2020.

Negotiations between Papua New Guinea and Bougainville began on 17 May 2021. While Toroama stated a desire to see Bougainville become independent by June 2025, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape cautioned against setting a specific timetable. On 7 July 2021, it was announced that Bougainville will become independent by the end of 2027 pending approval of the PNG parliament.

===Districts and Local Level Government Areas===
The region is divided into three districts, which are further divided into Local Level Government (LLGs) areas. For census purposes, the LLGAs are subdivided into wards, and those into census units.

==Demographics==
===Religion===
The great majority of Bougainville residents are Christian, with an estimated 70% being Roman Catholic and a substantial minority being of the Protestant United Church of Papua New Guinea since 1968. The Catholic Church has its own diocese in the region (Diocese of Bougainville or &quot;Dioecesis Buganvillensis&quot;). The cathedral and main church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption, and can be found on Buka Island. It was formerly the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in the former mission of Tubiana. There are a total of 33 Catholic parishes and one mission in the region.

===Languages===
Bougainville&#x27;s constitution, written in English, does not specify an official language, but calls for constitutional literature to be translated into Tok Pisin and as many local languages as possible, while also encouraging the &quot;development, preservation, and enrichment of all Bougainville languages&quot;.

The most widely spoken Austronesian language is Halia and its dialects, spoken in the island of Buka and the Selau peninsula of Northern Bougainville. Other Austronesian languages include Nehan, Petats, Solos, Saposa (Taiof), Hahon and Tinputz, all spoken in the northern quarter of Bougainville, Buka and surrounding islands. These languages are closely related. Bannoni and Torau are Austronesian languages not closely related to the former, which are spoken in the coastal areas of central and south Bougainville. On the nearby Takuu Atoll a Polynesian language is spoken, Takuu.

==Economy==
Official statistics about Bougainville&#x27;s economy are not available. The PNG National Research Institute estimates its GDP per capita at $1,100 as of 2019.

A small percentage of the region&#x27;s economy is from mining. The majority of economic growth comes from agriculture and aquaculture. The region&#x27;s biodiversity, which is one of the most important in Oceania, is heavily threatened by mining activities. Mining activities have caused civil unrest in the region many times. In January 2018, a moratorium on one mine was imposed by the Papua New Guinea government, in a bid to calm civil unrest against mining in the region.

Bougainville had one of the world&#x27;s largest open-pit copper mines, the Pangunamine, from 1972 to 1989, which for many years generated a large part of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s gross national product. The mine was operated by the Australian company Bougainville Copper (BLC), a subsidiary of the British-Australian mining company Rio Tinto/CRA, which had majority control of the company. The state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) holds a 19.1% stake in Bougainville Copper.

As a result of the civil war and the rebel-forced closure of the mine, Papua New Guinea&#x27;s government revenues fell by 20%. Some hope for the eventual reopening of the Panguna mine. Negotiations to reopen the Panguna mine began in early March 2006 with talks between former PNG Mines Minister Sam Akoitai and the Rio Tinto corporation in London. Some representatives of landowners in the Panguna area have repeatedly agreed to resume mining operations, albeit in conjunction with demands for large compensation payments from the mine operator BCL.

Yields from the two main exports, cocoa and copra, returned to pre-civil war levels in 2007. Largely operated by Europeans, Asians, churches and corporations, large-scale commercial plantations, which were responsible for a significant share of production before the civil war, are now used by smaller local operators. Further processing is done by small cocoa dryers promoted by AusAid.

Bougainville Region is the most productive in all of PNG for cocoa. Omuru &quot;et al.&quot;, 2001 find households farming cacao (&quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;) average an income of US$215/year. The (&quot;Conopomorpha cramerella&quot;) was considered a large risk for invasion here due to its invasion of nearby areas of Southeast Asia including East New Britain. There was great interest in modelling and phytosanitation practices to forestall its introduction. Unfortunately CPB did arrive here and in 2011 the World Bank&#x27;s was created to help farmers control the insect. From the 2009 production level, bean tonnage fell by over 41% by 2014 (although this also includes trees aging out). The Tinputz area including Namatoa had been the highest-producing part of the region and has seen many farms be abandoned and return to jungle. PPAP hopes to revive the industry around Namatoa. &quot;Cryptolaemus sinestria&quot; is a mealybug of cacao trees here, observed at a Buka agricultural station.

Termites are common agricultural pests in Bougainville. &quot;Microcerotermes biroi&quot; and &quot;Nasutitermes novanimhebridarum&quot; are pests of coconut (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;). &quot;N. novanimhebridarum&quot; is also a pest of cacao (&quot;Theobroma cacao&quot;) here. Termite pests found here tend to be shared with many of the nearby islands.

==Culture==
===National symbols===
A law passed by the provincial assembly – the &quot;Bougainville Flag, Emblem and Anthem (Protection) Act 2018&quot; – affirmed the existing official status of the flag of Bougainville and emblem of Bougainville. Both the flag and emblem feature stylised depictions of the &quot;upe&quot;, a traditional headdress worn by men in parts of Bougainville to symbolise their transition to adulthood. The law also established &quot;My Bougainville&quot; as the region&#x27;s anthem.

===Sport===
Rugby league in Bougainville is administered by the Bougainville Rugby Football League (BRFL), which is affiliated with the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League (PNGRFL). A number of Bougainvilleans have played for the Papua New Guinea national rugby league team, including Bernard Wakatsi, Joe Katsi, Lauta Atoi, and Chris Siriosi.

F.C. Bougainville has played in the National Soccer League since 2019, although it is based in Port Moresby rather than in Bougainville itself. Previously, a team from Bougainville won the national soccer championships in 1977, defeating Rabaul. Historically the Bougainville Soccer Association came into conflict with the Papua New Guinea Football Association over various matters.

During the 1970s and 1980s, teams from Bougainville played against other regions in the PNG national championships for Australian rules football, cricket, and field hockey.

Boxing is popular in Bougainville. The region won the 2017 National Boxing Championships, which were hosted in Arawa. Notable boxers from the region include Commonwealth Boxing Council titleholder Johnny Aba and Pacific Games gold medalist Thadius Katua.

Bougainvillean netball player Maleta Roberts has played professionally in Australia and represented the Papua New Guinea national netball team at the Commonwealth Games.

<text>The Canary Islands stonechat (Saxicola dacotiae), also known as the Fuerteventura stonechat or Fuerteventura chat, and formerly known as the Canary Islands chat due to its once widespread distribution on the Canary Islands, is a sedentary resident bird found only on the island of Fuerteventura where it is known as the Caldereta.
==Taxonomy==
The Canary Islands stonechat is a small passerine bird that was classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher in the Muscicapidae. It, and similar small European species, are often called chats. It was included in the &quot;common stonechat&quot; (&quot;Saxicola torquata&quot;), but it is quite distinct; it is likely to be an insular derivative of ancestral European stonechats that colonised the islands some 1-2 mya, during the Early Pleistocene (Wink &quot;et al.&quot; 2002).

==Description==
The Canary Islands stonechat is intermediate in appearance between the European stonechat and the whinchat; its body size and shape reminiscent of a lithe European robin. Its upperparts are generally coloured as the whinchat, but more contrasting, dark brown with a blackish head and back streaks. It has a purer white supercilium reaching behind the eye and white neck sides, and a light orangey-chestnut breast becoming duller and paler on the underside towards the whitish belly. The rump and tail are dark, the latter with a white pattern visible in flight. There is also a white wing band. The female is similar to a washed-out version of the male, with a brown, black-streaked head and no white neck patches.

The male has a ticking call like a pebble hitting another, and a high twittering song like a European stonechat.

==Ecology==
This Canary Islands stonechat is highly faithful to good habitat. Its main occurrence and only breeding habitat is in &quot;barrancos&quot;, ravines and rocky slopes with fairly sparse (30-50% open ground), shrubby vegetation (Illera &quot;et al.&quot;, 2006). Although they sometimes also venture into more open and arid areas such as &quot;malpaís&quot; (old lava flows with resurgent vegetation), the species prefers copses of palm trees and shrubs (Álamo Tavío 1975) such as the aulaga &quot;Launaea arborescens&quot;, the saltwort &quot;Caroxylon vermiculatum&quot; and the boxthorn &quot;Lycium intricatum&quot; (BirdLife International 2004). Males sing from exposed perches, from where the birds also like to hunt insects on the wing; occasionally, they venture into fields or gardens for feeding. Completely open habitat appears only to be utilised when gathering food for their young (BirdLife International 2004).

Laying 4-5 eggs per clutch and incubating for 13 days, it usually manages to raise two clutches of young a year.

==Conservation status==
This Canary Islands stonechat is now considered Endangered, as construction, mainly tourism-related, encroaches upon the best habitat (Illera &quot;et al.&quot;, 2006). The population is hard to estimate, but most probably between 1300 and 1700 mature birds (BirdLife International 2004), and recognisably in decline. In particular, heavy land clearance on the Jandía peninsula is isolating the local subpopulation and making it vulnerable to adverse effects of small population size.

Desertification, exacerbated by grazing goats and locally sinking water tables, has also contributed to habitat loss. Feral cats and black rats prey on the eggs and young. A conservation action plan has existed for this species since 1999 (BirdLife International 2004). Due to its fairly high reproductive rate, if enough habitat is secured and predators are kept at bay, it should be able to hold its own.

The Chinijo chat, subspecies &quot;murielae&quot; from the Chinijo Archipelago near Lanzarote, became extinct in the early 20th century. Usually claimed as mainly due to deteriorating habitat quality, the extinction may be more due to the effect of introduced predators. It was only reported to inhabit two offshore islands (Montaña Clara and Alegranza).

<text>Albert James Wohlstetter (December 19, 1913 – January 10, 1997) was an American political scientist noted for his influence on U.S. nuclear strategy during the Cold War. He and his wife Roberta Wohlstetter, an accomplished historian and intelligence expert, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan on November 7, 1985.

==Early life and education==
Albert Wohlstetter was born on 19 December 1913, the fourth and youngest child of Philip Wohlstetter and Nellie (née Friedman). His paternal grandparents were cosmopolitan Jews who immigrated to the United States from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Albert&#x27;s father, Philip, was born in the United States about twenty years later. Albert&#x27;s older siblings were William (1902–1967), Helene (1906–1974) and Charles (1910–1995). Albert&#x27;s brother Charles was an accomplished businessman who would help Albert get his start as a young man. Charles also employed Helene at one of his companies, ConTel, where she was killed in a shooting by a disgruntled employee in 1974.

The Wohlstetters lived in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. After attending the City College of New York, Philip Wohlstetter became an attorney and served as chief counsel to the Metropolitan Opera. In 1912, he founded one of the early phonograph companies, the Rex Talking Machine Corporation. Luminaries of the performance world were regular guests in the Wohlstetter home. The Rex company was taken over and its Wilmington, Delaware factory converted to war production during World War I. Philip died of a heart attack in 1918 when Albert was four years old.

===City College of New York===
Wohlstetter started at City College of New York in 1931 through a scholarship in modern dance, earning a B.A. in 1934. At the time he was involved in radical politics, and was a member of the League for a Revolutionary Workers Party, a Trotskyist splinter group, in the mid-1930s.

===Columbia University===
Wohlstetter started at Columbia Law School on a fellowship in 1934. It was in a class there that he met Roberta Morgan. Wohlstetter was bored by law school and left the program after only one year. He stayed at Columbia to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematical logic and the philosophy of science where he studied under Abraham Wald and was a peer of Jacob Wolfowitz. After a thesis titled &quot;Language and Empiricism&quot; earned him an M.A. in June 1937, several fellowships allowed him to work on his dissertation. He had a fellowship with the Social Science Research Council on a project to incorporate modern mathematical methods into economics and business cycle research. From 1941 to 1942 he was a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

In August 1942 the Wohlstetters vacationed with Dwight Macdonald, one of the editors of &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, and his wife, Nancy in Nantucket.

He left Columbia&#x27;s graduate program to work for the U.S. government on war planning during World War II and never completed his doctorate.

==Early career==
During the Second World War, Wohlstetter worked on problems of war production for the Planning Committee of the War Production Board. It is unclear how he ended up there. In an interview, Wohlstetter says that while on the Carnegie associateship with NBER, Simon Kuznets was hired by Robert R. Nathan and it was Kuznets who hired Wohlstetter. Albert&#x27;s brother Charles recounts that it was Arthur F. Burns who gave Albert the job.

Later he worked at Atlas Aircraft Products Company.

After the war, Wohlstetter worked briefly in business in New York. He moved back to Washington, D.C. to serve as the Director of Programs for the National Housing Agency (USHA) in 1946 and 1947, the only time in his career he was a federal employee. At the USHA Wohlstetter worked with Paul Weidlinger, an engineer who had worked during the war for an aircraft company owned by Albert&#x27;s brother, Charles, designing modular buildings such as airplane hangars that could be assembled quickly. At the USHA Wohlstetter and Weidlinger worked on applying such principles to domestic residential buildings.

During the 1937–1938 school year, Roberta had worked as a teaching assistant at the University of Southern California, during which time she became enamored with the California lifestyle. At her urging, and with his brother Charles helping to secure a job for Albert, the Wohlstetters moved to Santa Monica in 1947. Albert went to work for the General Panel Corporation to &quot;tool up&quot; their industrial plant. General Panel Corporation was a company founded by Walter Gropius and Konrad Wachsmann, two important figures in the Bauhaus movement.

==RAND Corporation==
While on a walk, Albert and Roberta ran into Abe Girschick, Olaf Helmer and Chen McKinsey on the street in Santa Monica. Albert knew the three from his days as a student and in government service. The three mathematicians &quot;... were overjoyed to see us. Mathematical logic was a very, very small world. There were only a little over a dozen mathematical logicians before the war in the United States ...&quot; Girschick, Helmer and McKinsey were working at the recently formed RAND Corporation. With their help, Hans Speier, the head of the RAND social science division, hired Roberta, initially to write book abstracts for circulation to the RAND staff. When General Panel Corporation finally went out of business in 1951, Albert wanted to return to academia in the east, but Roberta was intent on remaining in California. She set up a meeting between Albert and Charles J. Hitch, the head of the RAND economics department. The two hit it off and Wohlstetter was brought on as a consultant to the Mathematics Department.

Wohlstetter remained a consultant with RAND for the first few years. It was not until June or July 1953, a few months after he began briefing &quot;Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases&quot; to the Air Force that Hitch finally insisted that his consultant status was &quot;absurd&quot; and that he join the permanent staff.

At RAND, he researched how to posture and operate U.S. strategic nuclear forces to deter plausible forms of Soviet nuclear-armed aggression in way that was credible, cost-effective and controllable.

Wohlstetter&#x27;s &quot;The Delicate Balance of Terror&quot; (1958) was highly influential in shaping the thinking of the Washington foreign policy establishment, particularly in its emphasis on the looming threat of Soviet attack.

During this period, Wohlstetter&#x27;s relationship with fellow RAND strategist Bernard Brodie grew increasingly acrimonious. In 1963, Brodie accused Wohlstetter of a security violation and financial malfeasance. Wohlstetter had shared a draft RAND paper by Constantin Melnik with Henry Rowen, then one of the Whiz Kids working as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs under Robert McNamara. Brodie also claimed that Wohlstetter was extravagant in wining and dining clients and colleagues using RAND funds. Wohlstetter defended himself by pointing out that the Melnik paper was only a &quot;D&quot; designated document, RAND&#x27;s lowest level classification, and as a former RAND employee who had collaborated extensively with Wohlstetter on some of his most important studies, Rowen was authorized to receive the paper. Nevertheless, RAND Director Frank Collbohm demanded that Wohlstetter submit his resignation. When Wohlstetter refused, Collbohm fired him, but agreed to let Wohlstetter stay on at RAND long enough to find another job.

==University of Chicago==
At the suggestion of Hans Morgenthau and with his help, Wohlstetter secured a position as a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he expanded the scope of his research to include alliance policy and nuclear nonproliferation, ballistic missile defense, innovation in military technology, peacetime military competitions, and military potential and economics of civil nuclear energy.

In the 1980s, Wohlstetter frequently criticized proponents of mutual assured destruction who supported targeting of nuclear weapons on civilians and cities instead over enemy combatants and military forces.

Wohlstetter and his wife, Roberta Wohlstetter, also counseled both Democratic and Republican administrations, including advisers to President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. They received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan on November 7, 1985.

During his long career, Wohlstetter also taught at UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 1960s. From 1964 to 1980, he taught in the political science department of the University of Chicago, and chaired the dissertation committees of Paul Wolfowitz, Efraim Inbar and Zalmay Khalilzad. He is often credited with influencing a number of prominent members of the neoconservative movement, including Richard Perle (who, as a teenager, dated Wohlstetter&#x27;s daughter Joan). He is the uncle of John Wohlstetter, author of &quot;Sleepwalking with the Bomb&quot; and &quot;The Long War Ahead and The Short War Upon Us&quot;.

==Death==
On 16 December 1996, his 83rd birthday, Wohlstetter was not feeling well. He and Roberta thought he was just ill or having an asthma attack. Over the telephone from New York their daughter Joan reviewed the symptoms for a heart attack and told Roberta to call an ambulance. Albert made a fuss, not wanting to go to the emergency room. At the hospital he was diagnosed as having had a serious heart attack and was discharged home with around-the-clock nursing care. In the living room he set up a makeshift chair that allowed him to partially recline so he could continue to work. A month later, on 10 January 1997, Wohlstetter died at his Laurel Canyon home.

A memorial was held at the office of the RAND Corporation and a month later Senator Jon Kyl and special guest Richard Perle conducted a brief remembrance in the Senate chamber. Albert Wohlstetter is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Roberta Wolstetter died on 6 January 2007.

==Awards==
He was twice awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, first by Robert McNamara in February 1965 and again by Donald Rumsfeld in November 1976. He is the first recipient not employed by the Department of Defense and the first person awarded it twice.

On 7 November 1985 President Reagan awarded Albert Wohlstetter, along with his wife Roberta Wohlstetter and Paul Nitze, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Albert J. and Roberta Wohlstetter Papers&quot; are available at the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University.

==In popular culture==
Wohlstetter served as one of the inspirations for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film, &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;. In 1962, Kubrick was looking for his next project after &quot;Lolita&quot; and started reading intensively on nuclear issues. One of Kubrick&#x27;s early ideas was to make a realistic thriller, titled after Wohlstetter&#x27;s &quot;Delicate Balance of Terror&quot;. But Kubrick could not conceive of a realistic scenario for an accidental nuclear war, so turned instead to the idea of making a comedy. The character of Dr. Strangelove is a composite of numerous people associated with RAND that besides Wohlstetter included Herman Kahn, John von Neumann, Wernher von Braun, and Edward Teller.

<doc id="193918" wikidata="Q5737" url="?curid=193918" title="Kurgan">
<text>A kurgan is a type of tumulus (Burial mound) constructed over a grave, often characterized by containing a single human body along with grave vessels, weapons, and horses. Originally in use on the Pontic–Caspian steppe, kurgans spread into much of Central Asia and Eastern, Southeast, Western, and Northern Europe during the third millennium BC.

The earliest kurgans date to the fourth millennium BC in the Caucasus, and some researchers associate these with the Indo-Europeans. Kurgans were built in the Eneolithic, Bronze, Iron, Antiquity, and Middle Ages, with ancient traditions still active in Southern Siberia and Central Asia.

== Etymology ==
According to the Etymological dictionary of the Ukrainian language the word &quot;kurhan&quot; is borrowed directly from the Kipchak, part of the Turkic languages, and means: fortress, embankment, high grave. The word has two possible , either from the Old Turkic root &quot;qori-&quot; &quot;to close, to block, to guard, to protect&quot;, or &quot;qur-&quot; &quot;to build, to erect, furnish, or stur&quot;. According to Vasily Radlov it may be a cognate to &quot;qorγan&quot;, meaning &quot;fortification, fortress, or a castle&quot;.

The Russian noun, already attested in Old East Slavic, comes from an unidentified Turkic language. Kurgans are mounds of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves. Popularised by its use in Soviet archaeology, the word is now widely used for tumuli in the context of Eastern European and Central Asian archaeology.

== Origins and spread ==
Some sceptre graves could have been covered with a tumulus, placing the first kurgans as early as the fifth millennium BC in eastern Europe. However, this hypothesis is not accepted unanimously.
Kurgans were used in Ukrainian and Russian steppes, their use spreading with migration into southern, central, and northern Europe in the third millennium BC.
Later, Kurgan barrows became characteristic of Bronze Age peoples, and have been found from Ukraine, Belarus, Bulgaria (Thracians, Getae, etc.), and Romania (Getae, Dacians), the Caucasus, Russia, to Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the Altay Mountains.

== Kurgan hypothesis ==

The Kurgan hypothesis is that Proto-Indo-Europeans were the bearers of the Kurgan culture of the Black Sea and the Caucasus and west of the Urals. Introduced by Marija Gimbutas in 1956, it combines kurgan archaeology with linguistics to locate the origins of the peoples who spoke the Proto-Indo-European language. She tentatively named the culture &quot;Kurgan&quot; after its distinctive burial mounds and traced its diffusion into Europe. The hypothesis has had a significant effect upon Indo-European studies.

Scholars who follow Gimbutas identify a &quot;Kurgan culture&quot; as reflecting an early Proto-Indo-European ethnicity that existed in the steppes and in southeastern Europe from the fifth millennium to the third millennium BC. In Kurgan cultures, most burials were in kurgans, either clan or individual. Most prominent leaders were buried in individual kurgans, now called &quot;royal kurgans&quot;. These individual kurgans have attracted the most attention and publicity because they were more elaborate than clan kurgans and contained grave goods. 

=== Scytho-Siberian monuments ===
The monuments of these cultures coincide with the Scytho-Siberian world (Saka) monuments. Scytho-Siberian monuments have common features and sometimes, common genetic roots. Also associated with these spectacular burial mounds are the Pazyryk, an ancient people who lived in the Altai Mountains that lay in Siberian Russia on the Ukok Plateau, near the borders with China, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. The archaeological site on the Ukok Plateau associated with the Pazyryk culture is included in the Golden Mountains of Altai UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Scytho-Siberian classification includes monuments from the eighth to the third century BC. This period is called the Early or Ancient Nomads epoch. &quot;Hunnic&quot; monuments date from the third century BC to the sixth century AD, and Turkic ones from the sixth century AD to the thirteenth century AD, leading up to the Mongolian epoch.

== Use ==
=== Architecture ===
Burial mounds are complex structures with internal chambers. Within the burial chamber at the heart of the kurgan, elite individuals were buried with grave goods and sacrificial offerings, sometimes including horses and chariots. The structures of the earlier Neolithic period from the fourth to the third millenniums BC, and Bronze Age until the first millennium BC, display continuity of the archaic forming methods. They were inspired by common ritual-mythological concepts.

==== Common components ====

In all periods, the development of the kurgan structure tradition in the various ethnocultural zones is revealed by common components or typical features in the construction of the monuments. They include:

* funeral chambers
* tombs
* surface and underground constructions of different configurations
* a mound of earth or stone, with or without an entrance
* funeral, ritual, and other traits
* the presence of an altar in the chamber
* a stone fence
* a moat
* a bulwark
* funeral paths from the moat or bulwark.
* the presence of an entryway into the chamber, into the tomb, into the fence, or into the kurgan
* the location of a sacrificial site on the embankments, inside the mound, inside the moat, inside the embankments, and in their links, entryways, and around the kurgan
* a fire pit in the chamber
* a wooden roof over or under the kurgan, at the top of the kurgan, or around the kurgan
* the location of stone statues, columns, poles, and other objects 
* bypass passages inside the kurgan, inside tombs, or around the kurgan
Depending on the combination of these elements, each historical and cultural nomadic zone has certain architectural distinctions.

==== Pre-Scytho-Sibirian kurgans (Bronze Age) ====
In the Bronze Age, kurgans were built with stone reinforcements. Some of them are believed to be Scythian burials with built-up soil and embankments reinforced with stone (Olhovsky, 1991).

Pre-Scytho-Sibirian kurgans were surface kurgans. Wooden or stone tombs were constructed on the surface or underground and then covered with a kurgan. The kurgan tombs of Bronze culture across Europe and Asia were similar in construction to the methods of house construction in the culture. Kurgan &quot;Ak-su - Aüly&quot; (twelfth–eleventh centuries BC) with a tomb covered by a pyramidal timber roof under a kurgan has space surrounded by double walls serving as a bypass corridor. This design has analogies with Begazy, Sanguyr, Begasar, and Dandybay kurgans. These building traditions survived into the early Middle Ages, to the eighth–tenth centuries AD.

The Bronze Pre-Scytho-Sibirian culture developed in close similarity with the cultures of Yenisei, Altai, Kazakhstan, southern, and southeast Amur regions.

Some kurgans had facing or tiling. One tomb in Ukraine has 29 large limestone slabs set on end in a circle underground. They were decorated with carved geometrical ornamentation of rhombuses, triangles, crosses, and on one slab, figures of people. Another example has an earthen kurgan under a wooden cone of thick logs topped by an ornamented cornice up to 2 m in height.

==== Scytho-Siberian kurgans (Early Iron Age) ====

The Scytho-Siberian kurgans in the Early Iron Age have grandiose mounds throughout the Eurasian continent.

=== Regional and temporal sex ratios ===
In the eastern Manych steppes and Kuban–Azov steppes during the Yamna culture, a near-equal ratio of female-to-male graves was found among kurgans. 

In the lower and middle Volga river region during the Yamna and Poltavka cultures, females were buried in about 20% of graves and two thousand years later, women dressed as warriors were buried in the same region. David Anthony notes, &quot;About 20% of Scythian – Sarmatian &#x27;warrior graves&#x27; on the lower Don and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle... a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.&quot;

In Ukraine, the ratio was intermediate between the other two regions, therefore approximately 35% were women.

== Archaeological remains ==
The most obvious archeological remains associated with the Scythians are the great burial mounds, some more than 20 m high, which dot the Ukrainian and Russian steppe belts and extend in great chains for many kilometers along ridges and watersheds. From them much has been learnt about Scythian life and art.

=== Excavated kurgans ===
Some excavated kurgans include:
* The Ipatovo kurgan revealed a long sequence of burials from the Maykop culture c. 4000 BC down to the burial of an elite woman of the third century BC, excavated 1998–99.
* Kurgan 4 at Kutuluk near Samara, Russia, dated to c. 2400 BC, contains the skeleton of a man, estimated to have been 35 to 40 years old and about 152 cm tall. Resting on the skeleton&#x27;s bent left elbow was a copper object 65 cm long with a blade of a diamond-shaped cross-section and sharp edges, but no point, and a handle, originally probably wrapped in leather. No similar object is known from Bronze Age Eurasian steppe cultures.
* The Maikop kurgan dates to the third millennium BC.
* The Novovelichkovskaya kurgan of c. 2000 BC on the Ponura River, Krasnodar region, southern Russia, contains the remains of 11 people, including an embracing couple, buried with bronze tools, stone carvings, jewelry, and ceramic vessels decorated with red ocher. The tomb is associated with the Novotitorovka culture nomads.
* The Kostromskaya kurgan of the seventh century BC produced a famous Scythian gold stag (now at Hermitage Museum), next to the iron shield it decorated.

<text>Cornelius Johannes Sanders (7 January 1966 – 23 September 2012) was a South African professional boxer who competed from 1989 to 2008. He won the WBO heavyweight title in 2003 after knocking out Wladimir Klitschko in two rounds, which was considered one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight boxing history; &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named it the Upset of the Year. In 2004, having vacated the WBO title, Sanders faced Wladimir&#x27;s brother Vitali Klitschko in an unsuccessful challenge for the vacant WBC and &quot;Ring&quot; heavyweight titles. He also held the WBU heavyweight title from 1997 until 2000 and the South Africa national heavyweight title in 1991.

Nicknamed &quot;The Sniper&quot;, Sanders was a southpaw with a long reach, and was known for carrying formidable knockout power in his straight left hand. He died in a hospital in the early hours of 23 September 2012 after being shot during an armed robbery. Sanders also held wins against former cruiserweight champions Johnny Nelson, Carlos de Leon, Bobby Czyz, and Al Cole.

==Early life and amateur career==
Sanders grew up in Brits, South Africa. He had two siblings and was of Afrikaner descent. In his youth, he played rugby, cricket, and golf. Having been introduced to boxing by his uncle, Sanders finished his amateur career in the late 1980s with 180 wins and 11 losses. He won the amateur South African heavyweight title four times from 1985-1988.

==Professional career==
Sanders made his professional debut in 1989 with a first-round knockout of King Kong Dyubele on 2 April 1989. He went on to win his next 22 bouts, 14 by knockout. Among the fighters he defeated during that streak were Steve Zouski, Art Card, future WBO cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson, and future world title challenger Bert Cooper. In his 24th bout, on 21 May 1994, Sanders suffered his first defeat, to Nate Tubbs via a second-round knockout.

He fought 12 more times over the next five years, including a first-round knockout over former world cruiserweight champion Carlos De León and a second-round knockout over another former world champion, Bobby Czyz. He lost by seventh-round stoppage in a slugfest fight with future unified and two-time world heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman. Sanders and Rahman both knocked each other down during the bout, and Sanders was ahead on the judges&#x27; scorecards prior to the stoppage. Rahman said of Sanders following their match: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been hit that hard in my life.&quot; Returning to the ring in 2001, he scored a quick win over Michael Sprott and then followed this up with a defeat of Otis Tisdale in 2002. Corrie Sanders&#x27; biggest weapons were his southpaw fast hands that he used to knock fighters out early.

===WBO heavyweight champion===
Despite fighting three rounds in the last two years, the WBO sanctioned a challenge to their heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko. Sanders had accepted the bout on short notice and was a 40-1 underdog. On 8 March 2003, Sanders provided a stunning upset in Hanover, Germany, by dropping Klitschko four times to win the WBO belt by a second-round knockout. &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine named it the Upset of the Year for 2003. Klitschko later called Sanders the hardest puncher he ever faced in a December 2014 interview with &quot;The Ring&quot;, saying: &quot;I’ve been in boxing for 25 years and I never fought anybody in this game that punched like Corrie Sanders.&quot;

===WBC heavyweight title challenge===
Sanders had initially sought a unification bout with WBA heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr., who had also won his title in March 2003, and then with heavyweight contender David Tua. When those negotiations fell through, he was scheduled to defend the WBO title against Lamon Brewster on 18 October 2003. However, due to a conflict between WBO and Sanders&#x27;s promoter, the bout did not take place. Sanders then vacated the WBO title to sign a contract to fight for the vacant WBC belt. The fight took place on 24 April 2004, against Wladimir&#x27;s older brother, Vitali. Sanders was stopped by Vitali in the eighth round of the fight in the Staples Center in Los Angeles. After Sanders death, Vitali went on to pay his respects to Sanders and called this the hardest fight of his career.

Eight months later, Sanders knocked out Alexei Varakin in the second round of a contest in Soelden, Austria in December 2004. He briefly retired after that bout.

Sanders returned to action after two years in November 2006 to score a second round stoppage win over the Australian heavyweight champion Colin Wilson at the Convention Centre in Mafikeng. He had signed with Golden Gloves Promotions, and won another bout in South Africa against Brazilian Daniel Bispo in May 2007. His last bout, of the South African heavyweight title, was a loss to Osborne Machimana, a bout he took despite Sanders being injured beforehand. Sanders&#x27; final record was 42 wins (31 by knockout) and 4 losses.

==Personal life==
Corrie Sanders and his wife Suzette had a son and a daughter.

==Death==
On 22 September 2012, Sanders was fatally shot in an armed robbery at a restaurant called Thatch Haven in Brits, South Africa, where a function was being held for his nephew&#x27;s 21st birthday. He had been near the entrance of the restaurant talking to his 15-year-old daughter Marinique and a cousin when three robbers entered firing their guns. Sanders had used his body to shield his daughter from oncoming bullets and then, while bleeding from bullet wounds in his right arm and stomach, pulled her to the ground and whispered for her to pretend to be dead. Sanders was taken to a hospital in Pretoria, where he died in the early hours of 23 September 2012 of his wounds.

On 27 September 2012, following a tip-off, North West police arrested three men in Oukasie near Brits, charging them with the murder of Sanders. All three were citizens of Zimbabwe. At one address, two suspects were apprehended and police recovered a cellular phone, a vehicle key, a purse and cash stolen during the robbery. Police then went to a second address, arrested a third suspect, and recovered a handbag also stolen in the robbery. The trial was postponed until August 2013 as investigators attempted to use a fourth suspect, now serving a 30-year sentence in Zimbabwe for killing a police officer, to locate the gun used in the crime.

On 11 February 2015 at a High Court in Pretoria, Judge Ferdi Preller sentenced Paida Fish, Chris Moyo and Samuel Mabena each to 43 years&#x27; imprisonment, of which they have to serve 30, on charges of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, and the unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.

<doc id="193938" wikidata="Q2233713" url="?curid=193938" title="Coton, Cambridgeshire">
<text>Coton is a small village and civil parish about three miles (about 5 km) west of Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England and about the same distance east of the Prime Meridian. It is in the district of South Cambridgeshire. The parish covers an area of . In the 2001 census it had a population of 773, with approximately 336 dwellings and 322 households. The population at the 2011 census was 910.

==Location==
Coton is approximately bounded to the north by the A1303 Madingley Road, which forms part of the Cambridge to St Neots road; to the west by open fields which separate the village from that of Hardwick; to the south by open fields separating it from Barton and to the east by the M11 motorway, which divides it from the city of Cambridge and, to the south-east, the village of Grantchester. Coton lies roughly equidistant from junctions 12 and 13 of the M11.

== History ==
Coton is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, as the land forming the village belonged at that time to Grantchester. However, in the Middle Ages, Coton became a separate parish. There are no references to a separate Coton population prior to 1500, but by 1563, 21 families are recorded as living in the village. The population grew slowly over the next two centuries, reaching 126 by 1801 and then more than trebled to 390 during the 19th century. Further population growth came in the 1940s, when an estate of Council houses was built at the west end of the village (Whitwell Way) and in the 1960s, when further houses were built between the High Street and the 1940s estate.

The oldest building in Coton is St Peter&#x27;s Church (there are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website), built in the 12th century as a chapel, dependent on Grantchester church. It gradually established its independence from Grantchester over the course of the 13th and 14th centuries. Some of the original building survives, including the nave (excluding its aisles), the chancel and the font. The shafted south-east angle of the 12th century nave is still visible outside, while the chancel has 12th century windows to the north and south. The aisles date from the 14th and 15th centuries. Extensive restoration work was undertaken in the 1870s and 1880s.

From the 16th century until the early years of the 20th century, most of the land in Coton belonged to Cambridge colleges, including St John&#x27;s, Queens&#x27;, King&#x27;s and St Catharine&#x27;s, which let it for farming.

In 1830, Coton was one of many villages in the south and east of England to suffer damage during the Swing Riots. One farmer had his farmstead burnt down with losses amounting to £1,720.

Notable former inhabitants of Coton include Andrew Downes, a scholar and Cambridge University Regius Professor of Greek in the late 16th century; and Sir John Coke, Secretary of State under Charles I from 1625 to 1639.

A book about the history of Coton has been written by a former Headmistress of both the old and new Coton schools, Kathleen Fowle: &quot;Coton Through the Ages&quot; and updated by the author in 2013, with help from Carolyn Postgate, and editor Elaine Storkey. It is available for purchase from the village church.


==The village today==
In addition to its church, Coton has a primary school with 140 pupils, a restaurant-pub (&quot;The Plough&quot;), a garden centre containing a post office, farm shop and cafe, football, cricket and bowls clubs, and a British Women&#x27;s Institute group (closed in 2019) as well as other local clubs. The well-known Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial is situated on the Coton stretch of Madingley Road. In recent years the Village Hall of Coton has been extended and refurbished, thanks to fundraising activities by local residents and the management of the village hall committee. It is now active, hosting an internet club, produce sales and local clubs, and becomes the village local cinema on Wednesdays each month. Coton Orchard, planted in 1922, produces mainly apple juice, supplying a number of Cambridge colleges.

The Coton Footpath is a recreational cycle or walk from Cambridge to Coton. It begins in the city centre, crossing the River Cam, passing alongside the University&#x27;s West Cambridge site south of Madingley Road, then crossing the M11 motorway, bypassing Coton Orchard and terminating at the village recreation ground. On the roads and gardens around Coton it is often possible to see muntjac deer. The current concern in the village is the siting of a new proposed busway close to the village boundary and bisecting the orchard, and a Park and Ride facility on Madingley Hill, and meetings are underway with the Cambridgeshire planners.

<doc id="193950" wikidata="Q576681" url="?curid=193950" title="Point of Know Return">
<text>Point of Know Return is the fifth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1977. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2002.

== Composition and recording ==
The recording sessions for &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; commenced in June 1977 at Studio in the Country, the Bogalusa, Louisiana facility where Kansas&#x27; previous two albums were recorded: due to the band encountering equipment failure at Studio in the Country, Kansas shifted recording sites, the majority of the recording of &quot;Point of Know Return&quot; being done at Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville over the month of July.

Singer/songwriter Steve Walsh left the group briefly during the recording of this album. In an interview on the weekly &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; radio show, he would admit that, at this point, he had been something of a prima donna and was attracted by the chance of a solo career.

&quot;Dust in the Wind&quot; is known for its sparse acoustic nature. The guitar line for the song was written by Kerry Livgren as a finger exercise for learning fingerpicking. His wife, Vicci, heard what he was doing, remarked that the melody was nice, and encouraged him to write lyrics for it. Livgren was unsure whether his fellow band members would like it since it was a departure from their signature style. However, he did offer it to them, and the song was accepted and then recorded.

The album is critically acclaimed for the singles &quot;Point of Know Return,&quot; which was a late addition to the album, and &quot;Portrait (He Knew),&quot; which was written about Albert Einstein. In 1988, Livgren released an updated version of &quot;Portrait (He Knew)&quot; titled &quot;Portrait II&quot; as part of the album &quot;Prime Mover&quot; credited to his band AD. He changed the subject of the song from Einstein to Jesus Christ. Another song, &quot;Closet Chronicles&quot;, is a Howard Hughes allegory.

== Reception ==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a mixed review, saying that though the transition to shorter songs generally works, the lyrics are &quot;a wan and ridiculous rehash of the bargain-basement exoticism employed by the British art-rock crowd.&quot; They commented that though Kansas lacks a virtuoso soloist, the band&#x27;s ensemble playing is strong and purposeful. Robert Taylor of AllMusic wrote that Kansas&#x27; &quot;interplay and superior musicianship make this both an essential classic rock and progressive rock recording&quot;, despite its &quot;dated sound&quot; and the band&#x27;s struggle &quot;to maintain a healthy balance of progression combined with pop.&quot;

&quot;Point of Know Return&quot; would be Kansas&#x27; highest-charting album in the US, peaking at No. 4 in January 1978, and would sell four million copies in the US and be certified Quadruple Platinum by the RIAA.

== Cultural impact ==

During a debate of greatest &quot;Song 1 Side 1&quot; in history among the lead characters in the movie &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, Jack Black&#x27;s character criticizes one of John Cusack&#x27;s character&#x27;s proposals as &quot;too obvious, like &#x27;Point of Know Return&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; was sampled by rapper J Dilla on the song &quot;So Far&quot; on his 2016 posthumous release &quot;The Diary&quot;. However, the sample is from a cover version rather than the Kansas recording.

== Track listing ==


The remix of &quot;Portrait (He Knew)&quot; in the 2002 remastered edition marks the third time the song has been remixed. A remix appeared on the original single. A different remix appeared on the bonus disc of a Europe-only collection from the late 1990s.

<text>Spaghetti squash or vegetable spaghetti is a group of cultivars of &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;pepo&quot;. They are available in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colours, including ivory, yellow and orange, with orange having the highest amount of carotene. Its center contains many large seeds. When raw, the flesh is solid and similar to other raw squash. When cooked, the meat of the fruit falls away from the flesh in ribbons or strands that look like and can be used as an alternative to spaghetti.

== Preparation ==
Spaghetti squash can be cooked in a variety of ways, including baking, boiling, steaming, air frying, or microwaving. Once cooked the flesh of this fruit can be prepared in a way that its “strands” look like and are as long as traditional spaghetti noodles. It can be served with or without sauce as a substitute for pasta, and its seeds can be roasted, similar to pumpkin seeds.

== Nutrition ==
Spaghetti squash contains many nutrients, including folic acid, potassium, and beta carotene. It is low in calories, averaging 42 calories per 1-cup (155 grams) serving.

== Cultivation ==

Spaghetti squash is relatively easy to grow, thriving in gardens or pots.

The plants are monoecious, with male and female flowers on the same plant. Male flowers have long, thin stems that extend upwards from the vine. Female flowers are shorter, with a small round growth underneath the petals. This round growth turns into the squash if the flower is successfully pollinated.

<doc id="193960" wikidata="Q1305065" url="?curid=193960" title="Steve Bell (cartoonist)">
<text>Steven William Maclean Bell (born 1951) is an English political cartoonist, whose work has appeared in a number of publications, notably &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 1981 to 2023. He is known for his left-wing views.

==Early life==
Born in Walthamstow and raised in Slough, Bell moved with his family in 1968 to North Yorkshire, where he trained as an artist at the Teesside College of Art. He graduated in film-making and art from the University of Leeds in 1974 and trained as an art teacher at St Luke&#x27;s College, Exeter (now St Luke&#x27;s Campus at the University of Exeter), in 1975. He taught art for one year in Birmingham, a period of his life he would later call &quot;the worst year of my life&quot; and &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, before resigning to become a freelance cartoonist in 1977.

==Cartoonist==
While still teaching, Bell did unpaid work providing the magazine &quot;Birmingham Broadside&quot; with illustrations, including a comic strip featuring &quot;Maxwell the Mutant&quot; who changed into someone different every time he drank a pint of mild.

He had been a friend at university with another student, Kipper Williams, who had become a freelance cartoonist. Bell followed his lead, and some contacts, and despite rejections including being turned down for &quot;The Beano&quot; he persevered and obtained paid work for part of 1978 with the comic strip &quot;Dick Doobie the Back to Front Man&quot; for &quot;Whoopee!&quot;. He made repeated attempts to get work in the London listings magazine &quot;Time Out&quot;.

When the premiership of Margaret Thatcher began in May 1979, &quot;Time Out&#x27;s&quot; news editor Duncan Campbell invited Bell to meet the need for a comic strip on the new government. &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot;, with animal characters, appeared in &quot;Time Out&quot; from 1979 to May 1981, then from October 1981 in &quot;City Limits&quot;. Bell produced another comic strip, &quot;Lord God Almighty&quot;, for &quot;The Leveller&quot; during 1980 and 1981. In 1980 he contributed a cartoon interpretation of the lyrics to &quot;Ivan Meets G.I. Joe&quot; to the inner lyric bag of the Clash&#x27;s triple album &quot;Sandinista!&quot; He is probably best known for the daily strip called &quot;If...&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper from 1981 until 2021, and from the mid-1990s until 2023 he was also that newspaper&#x27;s principal editorial cartoonist.

Collections of his cartoons have been published, and he has also illustrated original books in collaboration with authors. He has made short animated films with Bob Godfrey, including a short series of animated cartoons for Channel 4 television in 1999 to mark the 20th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s rise to power, entitled &quot;Margaret Thatcher – Where Am I Now?&quot; He has appeared in a radio programme about the life of 18th-century caricaturist James Gillray. Earlier in his career, he wrote and drew the &quot;Gremlins&quot; comic strip for the British comic &quot;Jackpot&quot;.

Bell&#x27;s parodies include Goya&#x27;s &quot;The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters&quot; (in an editorial cartoon about the UK Independence Party); William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;The Gate of Calais&quot; about the ban on UK meat exports following outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and bovine BSE; and – before the 2005 United Kingdom general election when it briefly seemed as if the Liberal Democrats might seriously threaten the Labour Party – J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;, in which a chirpy Charles Kennedy as tug-boat towed a grotesque and dilapidated Tony Blair to be broken up. Following the death of Thatcher, for his cartoon the next day, 9 April 2013, Bell adapted an illustration by Gustave Doré of Farinata in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, giving Thatcher the speech bubble &quot;Why is this pit still open??&quot; with reference to the closure of coal mines after the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–85).

Bell&#x27;s cartoons regularly feature grotesque caricatures, and have sometimes caused controversy as well as receiving critical acclaim. During the November 2012 Israel/Gaza conflict &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a cartoon by Bell showing the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a puppeteer controlling William Hague and Blair. Dave Rich, blogging for the Community Security Trust, said that the illustration was comparable to those featured in Nazi and other antisemitic publications. While Bell defended his cartoon, the newspaper&#x27;s readers&#x27; editor Chris Elliott concluded in an article on 25 November: &quot;While journalists and cartoonists should be free to express an opinion that Netanyahu is opportunistic and manipulative, in my view they should not use the language – including the visual language – of antisemitic stereotypes.&quot; The UK&#x27;s Press Complaints Commission received 22 complaints, but ruled on 19 December that it was unable to take the matter further and that it was &quot;unable to establish a breach of the Code&quot;.

In the run-up to the 2015 United Kingdom general election, there was outrage on Twitter over an &quot;If...&quot; cartoon strip depicting Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeon as refusing to compromise on their &quot;core demand... for incest and Scottish country dancing&quot;. Numerous tweets branded Bell as racist, while others said that it was no more outrageous than his cartoons mocking other politicians. There were over 300 complaints made to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and nearly 1,000 comments under the online cartoon, mostly negative. The wording referred to a quotation attributed to Sir Arnold Bax, who said a Scottish friend had told him: &quot;You should make a point of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk dancing.&quot; During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Bell&#x27;s cartoon strip depicted Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;Yes&quot; campaigning as promising &quot;No Noness ... and Yes Yesness; Nationalism, Socialism: together they go so well!!&quot;

In July 2019, Bell sent an angry email to &quot;The Guardian&quot; after his &quot;If...&quot; cartoon strip was pulled. The cartoon portrayed the then Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Tom Watson, as the &quot;antisemite finder general&quot; for being critical of what he called antisemitism in the Labour Party. In June 2020, Home Secretary Priti Patel, while listing her experiences of racism in the House of Commons, mentioned a cartoon of Bell&#x27;s published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of being portrayed as &quot;a fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously&quot;.

On 15 July 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; announced planning to cut jobs due to expected losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Media Group said &quot;We will discuss all our proposals, including redundancy terms, during collective consultation with our employee and trade union representatives.&quot; Online social media including Twitter spread a rumour that Bell&#x27;s annual contract (due to expire in 2021) would not be renewed, without confirmation from &quot;The Guardian&quot; or from Bell himself. The UK &quot;Press Gazette&quot; was told by Bell that his annual freelance contract has always been a process of negotiation. For some time he had been in talks with editor-in-chief Katharine Viner about reducing his workload, and &quot;Sadly this probably spells the end for the &#x27;If…&#x27; strip after 39 and a half years, which I enjoy doing immensely, but is a hell of a lot of work for an old codger like me, particularly in full colour. I do hope to continue after next April doing large editorial cartoons.&quot;

In October 2020, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission accused the Labour Party of having broken equalities laws regarding its handling of antisemitism allegations. Jeremy Corbyn said the problem had been &quot;dramatically overstated&quot; by political opponents, and his membership was immediately suspended. Bell produced a cartoon, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, of Keir Starmer presenting Corbyn&#x27;s head on a platter, based on Caravaggio&#x27;s portrayal of &quot;Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist&quot; from the biblical story in the New Testament. &quot;The Guardian&quot; received 32 complaints of antisemitism. Labour peer Lord Andrew Adonis described the cartoon as &quot;repellent&quot;.

===Dismissal from &quot;The Guardian&quot;===
In October 2023, Bell announced that &quot;The Guardian&quot; would no longer be using his cartoons after 42 years of working together. This followed a cartoon Bell produced within the context of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war featuring Netanyahu, with his shirt open, wearing boxing gloves and holding a scalpel over a dotted shape of the Gaza Strip on his stomach. The caption reads: &quot;Residents of Gaza, get out now.&quot; Due to what has been seen by some as a reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s Shylock&#x27;s &quot;pound of flesh&quot;, it prompted accusations that it was antisemitic. Bell said that he was inspired by the 1960s &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Scar&quot; cartoon by David Levine of then U.S. president Lyndon B Johnson within the context of the Vietnam War. In December 2023, former &quot;Guardian&quot; editor Alan Rusbridger commissioned Bell for the Christmas edition of &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine.

<doc id="193965" wikidata="Q14941935" url="?curid=193965" title="Hermetica">
<text>The Hermetica are texts attributed to the legendary Hellenistic figure Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. These texts may vary widely in content and purpose, but by modern convention are usually subdivided into two main categories, the &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;religio-philosophical&quot; &quot;Hermetica&quot;.

The category of &quot;technical&quot; &quot;Hermetica&quot; encompasses a broad variety of treatises dealing with astrology, medicine and pharmacology, alchemy, and magic, the oldest of which were written in Greek and may go back as far as the second or third century BCE. Many of the texts belonging in this category were later translated into Arabic and Latin, often being extensively revised and expanded throughout the centuries. Some of them were also originally written in Arabic, though in many cases their status as an original work or translation remains unclear. These Arabic and Latin Hermetic texts were widely copied throughout the Middle Ages (the most famous example being the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;).

The &quot;religio-philosophical&quot; &quot;Hermetica&quot; are a relatively coherent set of religio-philosophical treatises that were written mostly in the second and third centuries, though the very earliest one of them, the &quot;Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius&quot;, may go back to the first century CE. They are chiefly focused on the relationship between human beings, the cosmos, and God (thus combining philosophical anthropology, cosmology, and theology). Many of them are also moral exhortations calling for a way of life (the &quot;way of Hermes&quot;) leading to spiritual rebirth, and eventually to divinization in the form of a heavenly ascent. The treatises in this category were probably all originally written in Greek, although some of them survive only in Coptic, Armenian, or Latin translations. During the Middle Ages, most of them were only accessible to Byzantine scholars (an important exception being the &quot;Asclepius&quot;, which mainly survives in an early Latin translation), until a compilation of Greek Hermetic treatises known as the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; was translated into Latin by the Renaissance scholars Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500).

Though strongly influenced by Greek and Hellenistic philosophy (especially Platonism and Stoicism), and to a lesser extent also by Jewish ideas, many of the early Greek Hermetic treatises also contain distinctly Egyptian elements, most notably in their affinity with traditional Egyptian wisdom literature. This used to be the subject of much doubt, but it is now generally admitted that the &quot;Hermetica&quot; as such did in fact originate in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt, even if most of the later Hermetic writings (which continued to be composed at least until the twelfth century CE) did not. It may even be the case that the great bulk of the early Greek &quot;Hermetica&quot; were written by Hellenizing members of the Egyptian priestly class, whose intellectual activity was centred in the environment of Egyptian temples.

==Technical &quot;Hermetica&quot;==

=== Greek ===

==== Greek astrological &quot;Hermetica&quot; ====

The oldest known texts associated with Hermes Trismegistus are a number of astrological works which may go back as far as the second or third century BCE:

* The Salmeschoiniaka (the &quot;Wandering of the Influences&quot;), perhaps composed in Alexandria in the second or third century BCE, deals with the configurations of the stars.
* The Nechepsos-Petosiris texts are a number of anonymous works dating to the second century BCE which were falsely attributed to the Egyptian king Necho II (610–595 BCE, referred to in the texts as Nechepsos) and his legendary priest Petese (referred to in the texts as Petosiris). These texts, only fragments of which survive, ascribe the astrological knowledge they convey to the authority of Hermes.
* The Art of Eudoxus is a treatise on astronomy which was preserved in a second-century BCE papyrus and which mentions Hermes as an authority.
* The Liber Hermetis (&quot;The Book of Hermes&quot;) is an important work on astrology laying out the names of the decans (a distinctly Egyptian system that divided the zodiac into 36 parts). It survives only in an early (fourth- or fifth-century CE) Latin translation, but contains elements that may be traced to the second or third century BCE.

Other early Greek Hermetic works on astrology include:

* The Brontologion: a treatise on the various effects of thunder in different months.
* The Peri seismōn (&quot;On earthquakes&quot;): a treatise on the relation between earthquakes and astrological signs.
* The Book of Asclepius Called Myriogenesis: a treatise on astrological medicine.
* The Holy Book of Hermes to Asclepius: a treatise on astrological botany describing the relationships between various plants and the decans.
* The Fifteen Stars, Stones, Plants and Images: a treatise on astrological mineralogy and botany dealing with the effect of the stars on the pharmaceutical powers of minerals and plants.

==== Greek alchemical &quot;Hermetica&quot; ====

Starting in the first century BCE, a number of Greek works on alchemy were attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. These are now all lost, except for a number of fragments (one of the larger of which is called Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus) preserved in later alchemical works dating to the second and third centuries CE. Especially important is the use made of them by the Egyptian alchemist Zosimus of Panopolis (fl. c. 300 CE), who also seems to have been familiar with the religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot;. Hermes&#x27; name would become more firmly associated with alchemy in the medieval Arabic sources (see below), of which it is not yet clear to what extent they drew on the earlier Greek literature.

==== Greek magical &quot;Hermetica&quot; ====

* The Cyranides is a work on healing magic which treats of the magical powers and healing properties of minerals, plants and animals, for which it regularly cites Hermes as a source. It was independently translated both into Arabic and Latin.
* The Greek Magical Papyri are a modern collection of papyri dating from various periods between the second century BCE and the fifth century CE. They mainly contain practical instructions for spells and incantations, some of which cite Hermes as a source.

=== Arabic ===

Many Arabic works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus still exist today, although the great majority of them have not yet been published or studied by modern scholars. For this reason too, it is often not clear to what extent they drew on earlier Greek sources. The following is a very incomplete list of known works:

==== Arabic astrological &quot;Hermetica&quot; ====

Some of the earliest attested Arabic Hermetic texts deal with astrology:

* The Qaḍīb al-dhahab (&quot;The Rod of Gold&quot;), or the Kitāb Hirmis fī taḥwīl sinī l-mawālīd (&quot;The Book of Hermes on the Revolutions of the Years of the Nativities&quot;) is an Arabic astrological work translated from Middle Persian by ʿUmar ibn al-Farrukhān al-Ṭabarī (. 816 CE), who was the court astrologer of the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur ().
* The Carmen Astrologicum is an astrological work originally written by the first-century CE astrologer Dorotheus of Sidon. It is lost in Greek, but survives in an Arabic translation, which was in turn based upon a Middle Persian intermediary. It was also translated by ʿUmar ibn al-Farrukhān al-Ṭabarī. The extant Arabic text refers to two Hermeses, and cites a book of Hermes on the positions of the planets.
* The Kitāb Asrār an-nujūm (&quot;The Book of the Secrets of the Stars&quot;, later translated into Latin as the Liber de stellis beibeniis) is a treatise describing the influences of the brightest fixed stars on personal characteristics. The Arabic work was translated from a Middle Persian version which can be shown to date from before c. 500 CE, and which shared a source with the Byzantine astrologer Rhetorius (fl. c. 600 CE).
* The Kitāb ʿArḍ Miftāḥ al-Nujūm (&quot;The Book of the Exposition of the Key to the Stars&quot;) is an Arabic astrological treatise attributed to Hermes which claims to have been translated in 743 CE, but which in reality was probably translated in the circles of Abu Ma&#x27;shar al-Balkhi (787–886 CE).

==== Arabic alchemical &quot;Hermetica&quot;====

* The Sirr al-khalīqa wa-ṣanʿat al-ṭabīʿa (&quot;The Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature&quot;), also known as the Kitāb al-ʿilal (&quot;The Book of Causes&quot;) is an encyclopedic work on natural philosophy falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15–100, Arabic: Balīnūs or Balīnās). It was compiled in Arabic in the late eighth or early ninth century, but was most likely based on (much) older Greek and/or Syriac sources. It contains the earliest known version of the sulfur-mercury theory of metals (according to which metals are composed of various proportions of sulfur and mercury), which lay at the foundation of all theories of metallic composition until the eighteenth century. In the frame story of the &quot;Sirr al-khalīqa&quot;, Balīnūs tells his readers that he discovered the text in a vault below a statue of Hermes in Tyana, and that, inside the vault, an old corpse on a golden throne held the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;. It was translated into Latin by Hugo of Santalla in the twelfth century.
* The Emerald Tablet: a compact and cryptic text first attested in the &quot;Sirr al-khalīqa wa-ṣanʿat al-ṭabīʿa&quot; (late eighth or early ninth century). There are several other, slightly different Arabic versions (among them one quoted in a text attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, and one found in the longer version of the pseudo-Aristotelian &quot;Sirr al-asrār&quot; or &quot;Secret of Secrets&quot;), but these are all likely to date from a later period. It was translated several times into Latin in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and was widely regarded by medieval and early modern alchemists as the foundation of their art. Isaac Newton (1642–1726) still used it as a source of inspiration.
* The Risālat al-Sirr (&quot;The Epistle of the Secret&quot;) is an Arabic alchemical treatise probably composed in tenth-century Fatimid Egypt.
* The Risālat al-Falakiyya al-kubrā (&quot;The Great Treatise of the Spheres&quot;) is an Arabic alchemical treatise composed in the tenth or eleventh century. Perhaps inspired by the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;, it describes the author&#x27;s (Hermes&#x27;) attainment of secret knowledge through his ascension of the seven heavenly spheres.
* The Kitāb dhakhīrat al-Iskandar (&quot;The Treasure of Alexander&quot;): a work dealing with alchemy, talismans, and specific properties, which cites Hermes as its ultimate source.
* The Liber Hermetis de alchemia (&quot;The Book of Hermes on Alchemy&quot;), also known as the Liber dabessi or the Liber rebis, is a collection of commentaries on the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;. Translated from the Arabic, it is only extant in Latin. It is this Latin translation of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; on which all later versions are based.

* The Kitāb al-Isṭamākhīs, Kitāb al-Isṭamāṭīs, Kitāb al-Usṭuwwaṭās, Kitāb al-Madīṭīs, and Kitāb al-Hādīṭūs, also known as the Pseudo-Aristotelian Hermetica, are a number of closely related and partially overlapping texts. Purporting to be written by Aristotle in order to teach his pupil Alexander the Great the secrets of Hermes, they deal with the names and powers of the planetary spirits, the making of talismans, and the concept of a personal &quot;perfect nature&quot;. Perhaps composed in the ninth century, extracts from them appear in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s &quot;Sirr al-khalīqa wa-ṣanʿat al-ṭabīʿa&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature&quot;, c. 750–850, see above), in the &quot;Epistles of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ&quot; (&quot;The Epistles of the Brethren of Purity&quot;, c. 900–1000), in Maslama al-Qurṭubī&#x27;s &quot;Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm&quot; (&quot;The Aim of the Sage&quot;, 960, better known under its Latin title as &quot;Picatrix&quot;), and in the works of the Persian philosopher Suhrawardī (1154–1191). One of them was translated into Latin in the twelfth or thirteenth century under the title &quot;Liber Antimaquis&quot;.
* The Cyranides is a Greek work on healing magic which treats of the magical powers and healing properties of minerals, plants and animals, for which it regularly cites Hermes as a source. It was translated into Arabic in the ninth century, but in this translation all references to Hermes seem to have disappeared.
* The Sharḥ Kitāb Hirmis al-Ḥakīm fī Maʿrifat Ṣifat al-Ḥayyāt wa-l-ʿAqārib (&quot;The Commentary on the Book of the Wise Hermes on the Properties of Snakes and Scorpions&quot;): a treatise on the venom of snakes an other poisonous animals.
* The Dāʾirat al-aḥruf al-abjadiyya (The Circle of Letters of the Alphabet&quot;): a practical treatise on letter magic attributed to Hermes.

==Religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot;==

Contrary to the &quot;technical&quot; &quot;Hermetica&quot;, whose writing began in the early Hellenistic period and continued deep into the Middle Ages, the extant religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot; were for the most part produced in a relatively short period of time, i.e., between c. 100 and c. 300 CE. They regularly take the form of dialogues between Hermes Trismegistus and his disciples Tat, Asclepius, and Ammon, and mostly deal with philosophical anthropology, cosmology, and theology. The following is a list of all known works in this category:

===&quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;===
Undoubtedly the most famous among the religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot; is the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, a selection of seventeen Greek treatises that was first compiled by Byzantine editors, and translated into Latin in the fifteenth century by Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500). Ficino translated the first fourteen treatises (I–XIV), while Lazzarelli translated the remaining three (XVI–XVIII). The name of this collection is somewhat misleading, since it contains only a very small selection of extant Hermetic texts, whereas the word is usually reserved for the entire body of extant writings related to some author or subject. Its individual treatises were quoted by many early authors from the second and third centuries on, but the compilation as such is first attested only in the writings of the Byzantine philosopher Michael Psellus (c. 1017–1078).

The most well known among the treatises contained in this compilation is its opening treatise, which is called the &quot;Poimandres&quot;. However, at least until the nineteenth century, this name (under various forms, such as &quot;Pimander&quot; or &quot;Pymander&quot;) was also commonly used to designate the compilation as a whole.

In 1462 Ficino was working on a Latin translation of the collected works of Plato for his patron Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, but when a manuscript of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; became available, he immediately interrupted his work on Plato in order to start translating the works of Hermes, which were thought to be much more ancient, and therefore much more authoritative, than those of Plato. This translation provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on the flourishing of alchemy and magic in early modern Europe, as well as influencing philosophers such as Ficino&#x27;s student Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), Francesco Patrizi (1529–1597), Robert Fludd (1574–1637), and many others.
===&quot;Asclepius&quot;===

The &quot;Asclepius&quot; (also known as the &quot;Perfect Discourse&quot;, from Greek &quot;Logos teleios&quot;) mainly survives in a Latin translation, though some Greek and Coptic fragments are also extant. It is the only Hermetic treatise belonging to the religio-philosophical category that remained available to Latin readers throughout the Middle Ages.

===&quot;Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius&quot;===

The &quot;Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius&quot; is a collection of aphorisms that has mainly been preserved in a sixth-century CE Armenian translation, but which likely goes back to the first century CE. The main argument for this early dating is the fact that some of its aphorisms are cited in multiple independent Greek Hermetic works. According to Jean-Pierre Mahé, these aphorisms contain the core of the teachings which are found in the later Greek religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot;.

===Stobaean excerpts===

In fifth-century Macedonia, Joannes Stobaeus or &quot;John of Stobi&quot; compiled a huge &quot;Anthology&quot; of Greek poetical, rhetorical, historical, and philosophical literature in order to educate his son Septimius. Though epitomized by later Byzantine copyists, it still remains a treasure trove of information about ancient philosophy and literature which would otherwise be entirely lost. Among the excerpts of ancient philosophical literature preserved by Stobaeus are also a significant number of discourses and dialogues attributed to Hermes. While mostly related to the religio-philosophical treatises as found in the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, they also contain some material that is of a rather more &quot;technical&quot; nature. Perhaps the most famous of the Stobaean excerpts, and also the longest, is the Korē kosmou (&quot;The Daughter of the Cosmos&quot; or &quot;The Pupil [of the eye] of the Cosmos&quot;).

The Hermetic excerpts appear in the following chapters of Stobaeus&#x27;s &quot;Anthology&quot; (which is organized by subject matter, and contains in the same chapters many excerpts and doctrines attributed to others):

* In the chapter &quot;God is Craftsman of Existing Things and Pervades the Universe with his Design of Providence&quot;: 1.1.29a
* In the chapter &quot;On Justice, Punisher of Errors, Arrayed alongside God to Oversee Human Deeds on Earth&quot;: 1.3.52
* In the chapter &quot;On (Divine) Necessity, by which things Planned by God Inevitably Occur&quot;: 1.4.7b, 1.4.8
* In the chapter &quot;On Fate and the Good Ordering of Events&quot;: 1.5.14, 1.5.16, 1.5.20
* In the chapter &quot;On the Nature and Divisions of Time, and the Extent of its Causation&quot;: 1.8.41
* In the chapter &quot;On Matter&quot;: 1.11.2
* In the chapter &quot;On the Cosmos: Whether it Has a Soul, is Administered by Providence, the Location of its Ruling Faculty, and its Source of Nourishment&quot;: 1.21.9
* In the chapter &quot;On Nature and its Derived Causes&quot;: 1.41.1, 1.41.4, 1.41.6, 1.41.7, 1.41.8, 1.41.11
* In the chapter &quot;How Resemblances from Parents and Ancestors Are Transmitted&quot;: 1.42.7
* In the chapter &quot;On the Soul&quot;: 1.49.3, 1.49.4, 1.49.5, 1.49.6, 1.49.44 (= the excerpt), 1.49.45, 1.49.46, 1.49.47
* In the chapter &quot;On the Interpreters of Divine Matters and How the Truth concerning the Essence of Intelligible Realities is Incomprehensible to Human Beings&quot;: 2.1.26
* In the chapter &quot;On What is in Our Power&quot; (&quot;Free Will&quot;): 2.8.31
* In the chapter &quot;On Truth&quot;: 3.11.31
* In the chapter &quot;On Bold Speech&quot;: 3.13.65

===Hermes among the Nag Hammadi findings===

Among the Coptic treatises which were found in 1945 in the Upper Egyptian town of Nag Hammadi, there are also three treatises attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. Like all documents found in Nag Hammadi, these were translated from the Greek. They consist of some fragments from the &quot;Asclepius&quot; (VI,8; mainly preserved in Latin, see above), The Prayer of Thanksgiving (VI,7) with an accompanying scribal note (VI,7a), and an important new text called The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth (VI,6). They all share a bipartite rather than a tripartite anthropology.

===Oxford and Vienna fragments===

The Oxford Hermetica consists of a number of short fragments from some otherwise unknown Hermetic works. The fragments are preserved in pages 79–82 of &quot;Codex Clarkianus gr. II&quot;, a 13th- or 14th-century manuscript held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The texts, anthologized from much earlier materials, deal with the soul, the senses, law, psychology, and embryology.

The Vienna Hermetica consists of four short fragments from what once was a collection of ten Hermetic treatises, one of which was called &quot;On Energies&quot;. The fragments are preserved on the back sides of two papyri, &quot;P. Graec. Vindob.&quot; 29456 recto and 29828 recto, now housed in Vienna. The front sides of the papyri contain fragments of &quot;Jannes and Jambres&quot;, a Jewish romance.

===&quot;Book of the Rebuke of the Soul&quot;===

Written in Arabic and probably dating from the twelfth century, the Kitāb fi zajr al-nafs (&quot;The Book of the Rebuke of the Soul&quot;) is one of the few later Hermetic treatises belonging to the category of religio-philosophical writings.

==Fragments and testimonies==

Fragments of otherwise lost Hermetic works have survived through their quotation by various historical authors. The following is a list of authors in whose works such literal fragments have been preserved:

*Tertullian, in &quot;On the Soul&quot; and &quot;Against the Valentinians&quot;
*Cyprian (or pseudo-Cyprian), in &quot;Quod idola dii non sint&quot; (&quot;Idols are Not Gods&quot;)
*Lactantius, in &quot;Divine Institutes&quot; and &quot;Epitome of the Divine Institutes&quot;
*Iamblichus, in &quot;On the Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus&quot;
*Zosimus of Panopolis, in &quot;On the Letter Omega&quot;
*Ephrem the Syrian, in &quot;Prose Refutations&quot;
*Cyril of Alexandria, in &quot;Against Julian&quot;
*Marcellus of Ancyra, in &quot;On the Holy Church&quot;
*John Lydus, in &quot;On Months&quot;
*Gregory of Nazianzus, in &quot;Oration&quot;
*Didymus of Alexandria, in &quot;Commentary on Ecclesiastes&quot; and &quot;Psalms Commentary&quot;
*Gaius Iulius Romanus, quoted by Charisius in &quot;The Art of Grammar&quot;
*Augustine of Hippo, in &quot;The City of God&quot; 8.23–26
*Quodvultdeus, in &quot;Against Five Heresies&quot;
*Ibn Umayl, in &quot;The Silvery Water and the Starry Earth&quot;
*Michael Psellus, in &quot;Opusculum&quot;
*Albert the Great, in &quot;Book of Minerals&quot;, &quot;On Intellect and the Intelligible&quot;, and &quot;Commentary on John&quot;
*Nicholas of Cusa, in &quot;On Learned Ignorance&quot;

Apart from literal fragments from Hermetic works, testimonies concerning the ideas of Hermes (likely deriving from Hermetic works but not quoted literally) have also been preserved in the works of various historical authors:

==History of scholarship on the &quot;Hermetica&quot;==

During the Renaissance, all texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were still generally believed to be of ancient Egyptian origin and to date from before the time of Moses, or even from before the biblical flood. In the early seventeenth century, the classical scholar Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614) demonstrated that some of the Greek texts betrayed too recent a vocabulary and must rather date from the early Christian period. Other authors made similar criticisms of the &quot;Hermetica&quot;, largely as a means of undermining various religious and esoteric movements of the time that drew inspiration from them. By the end of the century most scholars had ceased to regard them as sources of primeval wisdom.

Studies in the early twentieth century sought to discern who had written the &quot;Hermetica&quot;. Richard Reitzenstein first argued that the &quot;Hermetica&quot; were a product of a coherent religious community whose ideas derived from Egyptian religion, although in later years he thought Hermetic beliefs were largely Iranian in origin, a position that received little support. Scholars in the middle of the century, such as Arthur Darby Nock, C. H. Dodd, and most influentially André-Jean Festugière, argued that the intellectual background of the &quot;Hermetica&quot; was overwhelmingly Greek, with possible influences from Iranian religions and Judaism, but little connection with authentic Egyptian beliefs. Festugière believed the philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot; had only slight connections to the technical &quot;Hermetica&quot;, and that the former originated with a small philosophical school rather than a religious community. Birger A. Pearson has argued for the presence of Jewish elements in the , while Peter Kingsley discounts Christian influence in favor of Greek and Jewish elements.

More recent research suggests a greater continuity with the culture of ancient Egypt than had previously been believed. In the 1970s and 1980s, Jean-Pierre Mahé analyzed the &quot;Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius&quot; together with the recently published &quot;Hermetica&quot; from Nag Hammadi. Mahé pointed out that the earliest Greek Hermetic treatises contain many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods, and that close comparisons can be found with Egyptian wisdom literature, which (like many of the early Greek &quot;Hermetica&quot;) was characteristically couched in words of advice from a &quot;father&quot; to a &quot;son&quot;. Soon afterward, Garth Fowden argued that the philosophical and technical &quot;Hermetica&quot; were distinct but interdependent, and that both were products of complex interactions between Greek and Egyptian culture. Richard Jasnow and Karl-Theodor Zauzich have identified fragments of a Demotic (late Egyptian) text that contains substantial sections of a dialogue between Thoth and a disciple, written in a format similar to the &quot;Hermetica&quot;. This text probably originated among the scribes of a &quot;House of Life&quot;, an institution closely connected with major Egyptian temples. Christian Bull argued in 2018 that the &quot;Hermetica&quot; were in fact written by Egyptian priests in late Ptolemaic and Roman times who presented their traditions to Greek-speaking audiences in Greek philosophical terms.

In contradistinction to the early Greek religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot;, which have long been studied from a scholarly perspective, the &quot;technical&quot; &quot;Hermetica&quot; (both the early Greek treatises and the later Arabic and Latin works) remain largely unexplored by modern scholarship.

<text>The  is a collection of 17 Greek writings whose authorship is traditionally attributed to the legendary Hellenistic figure Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The treatises were originally written between and , but the collection as known today was first compiled by medieval Byzantine editors. It was translated into Latin in the 15th century by the Italian humanist scholars Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500).

Although the Latin word is usually reserved for the entire body of extant writings related to some author or subject, the contains only a very small selection of extant Hermetic texts (texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, commonly known as ). Its individual treatises were quoted by many authors from the second and third centuries on, but the compilation as such is first attested only in the writings of the Byzantine philosopher Michael Psellus (c. 1017–1078).

Following their translation into Latin by Ficino and Lazzarelli, the greatly influenced the Western esoteric tradition. It was especially considered to be important during the Renaissance and the Reformation, in which Hermeticism would often function as a type of intermediate position between Christianity and paganism. Hermes&#x27; perceived antiquity ensured that any writing attributed to him would take an important place in Ficino&#x27;s doctrine of the (&#x27;ancient theology&#x27;), which affirms that a single, true theology exists that is present in all religions and that was given by God to humankind in the distant, primeval past.

==Background==
Most of the texts are presented in the form of a dialogue, a favorite form for didactic material in Classical antiquity. The most well known treatise in the is its opening treatise, which is called the &quot;Poimandres&quot;. However, at least until the 19th century, this name (under various forms, such as &quot;Pimander&quot; or &quot;Pymander&quot;) was also commonly used to designate the compilation as a whole.

The 15th-century translation of the into Latin provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on philosophers such as Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), Francesco Patrizi (1529–1597), Robert Fludd (1574–1637), and many others.

==Latin translation==
In 1462, Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) was working on a Latin translation of the collected works of Plato for his patron Cosimo de&#x27; Medici (the first member of the famous de&#x27; Medici family who ruled Florence during the Italian Renaissance). However, when a manuscript of the became available, he immediately interrupted his work on Plato in order to start translating the works of Hermes, which at the time were thought to be much more ancient, and therefore much more authoritative, than those of Plato.

While Ficino translated the first fourteen treatises (I–XIV), Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500) translated the remaining three (XVI–XVIII). The Chapter no. XV of early modern editions was once filled with an entry from the Suda (a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia) and three excerpts from Hermetic works preserved by Joannes Stobaeus (fl. fifth century), but this chapter was left out in later editions, which therefore contain no chapter XV.

<text>Étienne Clavière (29 January 17358 December 1793) was a Genevan-born French financier and politician of the French Revolution. He was the French Minister of Finance between 24 March and 12 June 1792, and between 10 August 1792 and 2 June 1793.

==Career in Geneva and exile==
Clavière was born on 29 January 1735 in Geneva, Republic of Geneva to Jean-Jacques Clavière, a cloth merchant. His father was a Huguenot refugee from Serres who was admitted to the bourgeoisie of Geneva in 1735. After a commercial apprenticeship in Christian-Erlang, Clavière became a partner in the company &quot;Cazenove, Clavière et Fils&quot;. He emerged as a spokesman for the bourgeoisie during the Genevan political unrest of 1766–1768, and became a member of the Council of Two Hundred in 1770. 

Clavière was one of the democratic leaders of the Geneva Revolution of 1782. After its suppression, he went into exile, becoming a financier in Paris in 1784. His brother moved to Brussels. Clavière associated with personalities from Neuchâtel and Geneva, among them Jean-Paul Marat and Étienne Dumont. Their plans for a &quot;new Geneva&quot; in Ireland—which the government of William Pitt the Younger favoured—were given up when Jacques Necker came to power in France, and Clavière, with most of his comrades, settled in Paris. In 1785, he collaborated with Theophile Cazenove. 

In 1787, Clavière visited the Dutch Republic, together with Jacques Pierre Brissot, and met with the banker Pieter Stadnitski. The Patriots were losing influence and territory and the French politicians went back. He co-founded the with Brissot in 1787.

==French Revolution==
 
In 1789, he and Dumont allied themselves with Honoré Mirabeau, secretly collaborating for him on the &quot;Courrier de Provence&quot; and also preparing speeches for Mirabeau to deliver—this association with Clavière sustained Mirabeau&#x27;s reputation as a financier. He was one of the founding members and the first president of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks and of the Jacobin Club.

Clavière also published some pamphlets under his own name, and through these and his friendship with Brissot, whom he had met in London, he was Minister of Finance in the Girondist ministry, from 24 March to 12 June 1792 as a suppleant member of the Legislative Assembly for Seine, and supported Brissot.

After the 10 August storming of Tuileries Palace, he was again given charge of the finances in the provisional executive council, but could not offer a remedy to France&#x27;s financial difficulties (in particular, rampant inflation caused primarily by the excessive production of assignats). Clavière was a casualty of the fall of the Girondins, being arrested on 2 June 1793, but was not placed on trial with the rest in October. He remained in prison until 8 December, when, on receiving notice that he was to appear on the next day before the Revolutionary Tribunal, he died by suicide.

<doc id="193973" wikidata="Q314984" url="?curid=193973" title="Jacques Pierre Brissot">
<text>Jacques Pierre Brissot (, 15 January 1754 – 31 October 1793), also known as Brissot de Warville, was a French journalist, abolitionist, and revolutionary leading the faction of Girondins (initially called Brissotins) at the National Convention in Paris. The Girondins favored exporting the revolution and opposed a concentration of power in Paris. He collaborated on the Mercure de France and the &quot;Courier de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, which sympathized with the insurgents in the American colonies.

In February 1788, Brissot founded the anti-slavery Society of the Friends of the Blacks. With the outbreak of the revolution in July 1789, he became one of its most vocal supporters. As a member of the Legislative Assembly, Brissot advocated for war against Austria and other European powers in order to secure France&#x27;s revolutionary gains, which led to the War of the First Coalition in 1792. He voted against the immediate execution of Louis XVI which made him unpopular with the Montagnards. He was friendly with Jean-Paul Marat, but in 1793 they were the greatest enemies.

On 3 April 1793, Maximilien Robespierre declared in the Convention that the whole war was a prepared game between Dumouriez and Brissot to overthrow the First French Republic. Conflicts with Robespierre, who accused him of royalism, eventually brought about his downfall. On 8 October, the Convention decided to arrest Brissot. Like Madame Roland and Pétion, Brissot was accused of organising (or taking part in) conspicuous dinners. At the end of October 1793, he was guillotined along with 28 other Girondins by Charles-Henri Sanson.

==Early life and family==

Brissot was born in Chartres, the 13th child of a wealthy traiteur; but nine of his siblings died at infancy. Alongside his elder brother he was placed under the care of an uncle, residing in the countryside as priest. In 1762 he entered college, studying Latin and developing an admiration for the works of Voltaire, Diderot, and Rousseau. Transitioning to a career path, he began his tenure as a law clerk in 1769, initially in Chartres and later, from 1774, at the Parlement of Paris. Despite his legal aspirations, Brissot found himself embroiled in controversy due to the critical nature of some of his pamphlets, which scrutinized the government and the church. In 1777 Madame du Barry introduced him to Voltaire. In the same year he briefly visited London upon invitation. He relocated to Boulogne-sur-Mer when he was appointed editor of &quot;Courier de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, a periodical that did not do well and failed. He decided to &quot;anglicize&quot; his last name by appending &quot;Warville&quot;, after Ouarville, where his mother owned property. Brissot inherited a substantial amount of &quot;livres&quot; when his father died. In 1780 he moved to Reims to complete his studies.

His initial literary endeavors, including &quot;Théorie des lois criminelles&quot; (1781) and &quot;Bibliothèque philosophique du législateur&quot; (1782), delved into the philosophy of law, demonstrating a profound influence of the ethical principles championed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During a month-long stay with the affluent sugar and coffee planter Pierre-Alexandre DuPeyrou, Brissot found himself immersed in intellectual discourse. DuPeyrou, a Suriname native who relocated to Neuchâtel in 1747, had maintained a close relationship with Rousseau, providing financial support and overseeing the publication of his complete works. Brissot sent a summary to Voltaire, who praised his style and energy in a letter. Meanwhile, a law degree hardly charmed him, Brissot was more interested in linguistics and decided to become a journalist. In June he paid a visit to Clavière in Geneva. In September he married Félicité Dupont, the governess of the Duke of Chartres. Brissot visited London where he got engaged in establishing an Academy of Arts and Sciences; he lived at Newman Street with his wife and younger brother. Meanwhile, she translated English works, including those by Oliver Goldsmith and Robert Dodsley.

==Writer on social causes==

In the preface of &quot;Théorie des lois criminelles&quot;, a plea for penal reform, Brissot explains that he submitted an outline of the book to Voltaire and quotes his answer from 13 April 1778. Brissot had a falling out with Catholicism, and wrote about his disagreements with the church&#x27;s hierarchical system. 
Brissot became known as a writer and journalist who was engaged on the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, the &quot;Courier de l&#x27;Europe&quot; and other facilitating the distribution of libelles. Devoted to the cause of humanity, he proposed a plan for the collaboration of all European intellectuals. His newspaper &quot;Journal du Lycée de Londres&quot;, was to be the organ of this commercial enterprise starting at Pall Mall in January 1784. He was in conflict with Charles Théveneau de Morande. The plan was unsuccessful and Brissot lost his investments. In May he was arrested and put in jail at Gray&#x27;s Inn Road; a friend paid the printer for the prospectus. Soon after his return to Paris, Brissot was on the charge of having published a pornographic pamphlet &quot;Passe-temps de Toinette&quot; against the queen of France Marie Antoinette. The pamphlet was considered extremely provocative as it was perceived as opposing the queen. On 12 July Brissot was imprisoned in the Bastille but was released after two months as he was not the author. He read Confessions six times and a popular account of the New World, &quot;Letters of an American Farmer&quot; by Jean de Crèvecoeur.

After gaining release, Brissot returned to pamphleteering, most notably his 1785 open letter to emperor Joseph II of Austria, &quot;Seconde lettre d&#x27;un défenseur du peuple a l&#x27;Empereur Joseph II, sur son règlement concernant, et principalement sur la révolte des Valaques&quot;, which supported the right of subjects to revolt against the misrule of a monarch (in Bulgaria). Because of the controversy, this generated, he went to London for a time. He was influenced by the dissenters Richard Price and Joseph Priestley.

In 1785, the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, admirer of the British parliamentary system and the constitutional monarchy, the main opposition to the French absolute monarchy, approved Brissot&#x27;s plan to dispatch the fencer Chevalier de Saint-Georges to London. He believed it was a way to ensure the Regent-in-waiting&#x27;s support of Philippe as the future &quot;Regent&quot; of France. But Brissot had a secret agenda as well. He considered Saint-Georges, a &quot;man of color&quot;, the ideal person to contact his fellow abolitionists in London and ask their advice about Brissot&#x27;s plans for &quot;Les Amis des Noirs&quot; (Friends of the Blacks) modeled on the English Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. It is supposed Saint Georges delivered Brissot&#x27;s request to translate the publications of the abolitionists MPs William Wilberforce, John Wilkes, and Reverend Thomas Clarkson into French. On his first trip Saint-Georges passed Brissot&#x27;s request to the British abolitionists, they complied by translating their publications into French for his fledgling &quot;Société des amis des Noirs&quot;. Banat assumes Saint-Georges met with them again, but Adam Hochschild in Bury the Chains did not find any trace of this.

In collaboration with Clavière, Brissot published &quot;De la France et des Etats-Unis ou de l&#x27;importance de la révolution de l&#x27;Amérique pour le bonheur de la France&quot;, an important advocacy of possible economic benefits to France stemming from the American Revolution. In summer 1787 he and Clavière visited Utrecht, then a &quot;democratic eldorado&quot; to study the resistance against the House of Orange and Habsburg. Just before the Prussian invasion of Holland they travelled to Rotterdam, where they met Abbé Sièyes, and then to Amsterdam where they met with a Dutch banker Pieter Stadnitski. By the end of September they were back in Paris. At some time Stadnitsky decided sent Brissot as an undercover asset scout to Philadelphia.

==Abolitionists==

On a second visit to London, accompanied by Charles-Louis Ducrest, the brother of Madame de Genlis, he became acquainted with some of the leading abolitionists. After returning to Paris on 19 February 1788, he and Clavière founded an anti-slavery group known as &quot;Society of the Friends of the Blacks&quot; (&quot;Société des amis des Noirs&quot;) and was their secretary. In 1788, Choderlos de Laclos, who replaced Brissot as Philippe&#x27;s chief of staff, intensified Brissot&#x27;s campaign to promote Philippe as an alternative to the monarchy.

As an agent of the newly formed society, Brissot travelled to the United States from June 1788 to January 1789 to visit abolitionists there. The country had gained independence several years before but was still a slave state. He also met with members of the constitutional convention in Philadelphia to find out what he could about the domestic debt of the United States and researching investment opportunities in Scioto Company. Brissot launched a plan to promote emigration to the United States. At one point, he was interested in emigrating to America with his family. Thomas Jefferson, the American ambassador in Paris when he returned, was familiar enough with him to note, &quot;Warville is returned charmed with our country. He is going to carry his wife and children to settle there.&quot; However, such an emigration never happened. In 1789 he published a pamphlet arguing that 
French deputies owed any black Frenchman and any enslaved people in the French colonies their &quot;sacred rights&quot; as much as any white man. In 1789 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Brissot was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1789.

He was president of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks during 1790 and 1791. The rising ferment of revolution engaged Brissot in schemes for progress through political journalism that would make him a household name. In 1791 he published his &quot;Nouveau Voyage dans les États-Unis de l&#x27;Amérique septentrionale&quot; (3 vol.). Brissot believed that American ideals could help improve the French government. In 1791, Brissot along with Marquis de Condorcet, Thomas Paine, and Étienne Dumont created a newspaper promoting republicanism titled &quot;Le Républicain&quot;.

==French Revolution==

From the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Brissot became one of its most vocal supporters. He edited the &quot;Patriote français&quot; from 1789 to 1793 and took a prominent part in politics. Famous for his speeches at the Jacobin Club, he was elected a member of the municipality of Paris, then of the Legislative Assembly. He witnessed at the marriage of Camille and Lucile Desmoulins in December 1790, together with Pétion de Villeneuve and Robespierre.

=== Champ de Mars Massacre involvement ===
Leading up to this event, France was in political turmoil following the attempted escape of King Louis XVI and his family. The escape attempt heightened tensions and divisions within French society, particularly among the Third Estate. Brissot, a leading republican in the Girondin faction and a leading voice of the republican movement, was involved in drafting a petition demanding the removal of King Louis XVI. He along with other members managed to get approximately 6,000 signatures for the petition they circulated on 17 July 1791, during the gathering at the Champ de Mars. This petition, backed by the Cordeliers Club and other parties, argued that the king, by attempting to flee, had effectively abdicated his throne. The petition called for a national referendum on the future of the monarchy and was essentially a republican manifesto. In 1791 Robespierre persuaded the Jacobin clubs not to support the petition by Danton and Brissot.

===Foreign policy===

News of the Declaration of Pillnitz (27 August 1791) reached France shortly before the convening of the new Legislative Assembly, which Brissot rapidly came to dominate. The declaration was from Austria and Prussia, warning the people of France not to harm Louis XVI or these nations would &quot;militarily intervene&quot; in the politics of France. Threatened by the declaration, Brissot rallied the support of the Assembly, which subsequently declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792. They wanted to fortify and secure the revolution. This decision was initially disastrous as the French armies were crushed during the first engagements, leading to a major increase in political tensions within the country.

During the Legislative Assembly, Brissot&#x27;s knowledge of foreign affairs enabled him as a member of the diplomatic committee to control much of France&#x27;s foreign policy during this time. Brissot was a key figure in the declaration of war against Leopold II, the Habsburg monarchy, the Dutch Republic, and the Kingdom of Great Britain on 1 February 1793. It was also Brissot who characterized these wars as part of revolutionary propaganda.

On 26 March 1792, Guadet accused Robespierre of superstition, relying on divine providence. Shortly after Robespierre was accused by Brissot and Guadet of trying to become the idol of the people. Being against the war Robespierre was also accused of acting as a secret agent for the &quot;Austrian Committee&quot;. The Girondins planned strategies to out-maneuver Robespierre&#x27;s influence among the Jacobins. On 27 April, as part of his speech responding to the accusations by Brissot and Guadet against him, he threatened to leave the Jacobins, claiming he preferred to continue his mission as an ordinary citizen.

On 17 May, Robespierre released the first issue of his weekly periodical (&quot;The Defender of the Constitution&quot;). In this publication, he criticized Brissot and expressed his skepticism over the war movement.

===Election===

In August 1792 Brissot urged the preservation of the constitution, advocating against both the dethronement of the king and the election of a new assembly. Robespierre was no longer willing to cooperate with Brissot, who promoted the Duke of Brunswick, and Roland. On Sunday morning 2 September the members of the Commune, gathering in the town hall to proceed the election of deputies to the National Convention, decided to maintain their seats and have Rolland and Brissot arrested.

In Paris suspected Girondin and Feuillant candidates were boycotted; Robespierre made sure Brissot (and his fellow Brissotins Pétion and Condorcet) could not be elected in Paris. Mayor Pétion de Villeneuve, (&quot;Roi Pétion&quot;) finally rallied to Brissot. Brissot refrained from further visits to the Jacobin club. Madame Roland wrote to a friend: &quot;We are under the knife of Robespierre and Marat, those who would agitate the people.&quot;

In September 1792 he was elected deputy in the National Convention. where he represented Eure-et-Loir. On 24 October 1792, Brissot published another pamphlet, in which he declared the need for a coup against anarchists and the decentralized, populist element of the French Revolution, going so far as to demand the abolition of the Paris Commune. In December he published an account on the trial of the King. In March 1793, Robespierre was convinced Brissot and Dumouriez wanted to overthrow the First French Republic. Dumouriez&#x27;s defection on the next day changed the course of the events for the Brissotins. On 6 April the Committee of Public Safety was installed; Philippe Égalité was arrested. Robespierre accused Brissot, Isnard, Vergniaud, Guadet and Gensonné as infidel deputies.

===Arrest and execution===

On 6 April 1793 the Committee of Public Safety was installed on the proposal of Maximin Isnard, supported by Georges Danton. The Committee was composed of nine deputies from the Plaine and the Dantonists, but no Girondins or Robespierrists. As one of the first acts of the Committee, Marat, president of the Jacobin club, called for the expulsion of twenty-two Girondins. Robespierre, who was not elected, was pessimistic about the prospects of parliamentary action and told the Jacobins that it was necessary to raise an army of Sans-culottes to defend Paris and arrest infidel deputies, naming and accusing Brissot, Isnard, Vergniaud, Guadet and Gensonné.

The end of Brissot appeared in sight when, on 26 May 1793, Brissot authored &quot;To His Constituents&quot;, in which he demanded the guillotining of &quot;the anarchists&quot;, and tried to rouse the middle classes to resist the decentralized departments, which had not taken the lead from Robespierre but rather from The Mountain and largely local organizers and agitators. Brissot was condemned and then escaped from Paris, going to Normandy and Brittany, where he and other Girondists, such as Pétion, Gaudet, Barbaroux, Louvet, Buzot, and Lanjuinais, had planned to organize Counter-Revolutionary Vendée Uprising. Here Brissot had seized the delegates of the convention, having them arrested, but the uprising was short-lived, as the masses marched through the streets and overthrew Brissot and his clique.

On 28 May a weak Robespierre excused himself twice for his physical condition but attacked in particular Brissot of royalism. He referred to 25 July 1792 where their points of view split. In late May 1793, the Montagnards in the convention, meeting in the Salle du Manège, called for the removal of the Commission of Twelve. The convention was further radicalized by the call for the removal and arrest of Brissot and the entire Girondin faction made by the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; in the Parisian National Guard, which had armed with cannons and surrounded the convention. When the refusal of the convention to make such a hasty decision was delivered to the National Guard, François Hanriot, its leader, replied: &quot;Tell your stupid president that he and his Assembly are doomed and that if within one hour he doesn&#x27;t deliver to me the twenty-two, I&#x27;m going to blast it!&quot; Under this threat of violence, the Convention capitulated and on 2 June 1793, Brissot and the other Girondins were arrested.

Brissot was one of the first Girondins to escape but was also one of the first captured. Passing through his hometown Chartres on his way to the city of Caen, the centre of anti-revolutionary forces in Normandy, he was caught travelling with false papers on 10 June and taken back to Paris. On 3 October, the trial of Brissot and the Girondins began. They were charged with being &quot;agents of the counter-revolution and the foreign powers, especially Britain.&quot; Brissot, who conducted his own defence, attacked point by point the absurdities of the charges against him and his fellow Girondins.

On 8 October the Convention decided to arrest Brissot and the Girondins. Robespierre called for the dissolution of the Convention; he believed they would be admired by posterity. Pierre-Joseph Cambon replied that was not his intention; applause followed and the session was closed.

He was unsuccessful, and on 30 October the death sentence was delivered to Brissot and the 21 other Girondins. The next day, the convicted men were taken by tumbrel to the guillotine, singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as they travelled, and embracing the role of martyred patriots. Brissot was executed on 31 October 1793 at age 39. His corpse was buried in the Madeleine cemetery or the Chapelle expiatoire
alongside his guillotined associates.

The Chevalier de Saint-Georges was suspected of having been friendly with Marie-Antoinette, Brissot, and Philippe Égalité, executed in the following weeks. In early December, 73 Girondins were allowed to take their seats back in the Convention.

==Spying allegations==

Robespierre and Marat were among those who accused Brissot of various kinds of counterrevolutionary activity, such as, Orléanism, &quot;federalism&quot;, being in the pay of Great Britain, having failed to vote for the immediate death of the former king, and having been a collaborator with General Dumouriez, widely considered a traitor following his April 5 defection to the Austrians.

Brissot&#x27;s activities after the siege of the Bastille have been closely studied. While enthusiasts and apologists consider Brissot to be an idealist and unblemished, &quot;philosophe&quot; revolutionary, his detractors have challenged his credibility and moral character. They have repeated contemporary allegations that during the mid-1780s, he defrauded his business partner, was involved in the production and dissemination of &quot;libelles&quot; – pornographic and otherwise – and spied for the police. The accusations were led by Jean-Paul Marat, Camille Desmoulins, Maximilien Robespierre, and above all the notorious scandal-monger, extortioner, and perjurer Charles Théveneau de Morande, whose hatred, Brissot asserted, &#x27;was the torment of my life&#x27;. Brissot was accused of organizing (or taking part in) conspicuous dinners.

In 1968 historian Robert Darnton affirmed some of these accounts, and reaffirmed them in the 1980s, holding Brissot up as a case-study in the understanding of the difficult circumstances many &quot;philosophes&quot; encountered attempting to support themselves by their writing. Brissot&#x27;s life and thinking are so well documented, from his early age through to his execution, many historians have examined him as a representative figure displaying the Enlightenment attitudes that drove many of the leading French revolutionaries. Thus, he undoubtedly exemplified the beliefs of many supporters of the Revolution. Darnton sees him in this way, but also argued that he was intimately tangled in the business of &quot;Grub Street&quot;, the scrappy world of publishing for profit in the eighteenth century, which was essential to the spread of Enlightenment ideas. Thus, Darnton explores his relationship to his business partners, to the &quot;libellistes&quot; who wrote scandalous accusations against the crown and other leading figures, and to the police, arguing that based on suggestive evidence it is probable that when Brissot fell on hard financial times in the mid-1780s he agreed to operate as a police spy. Historian Frederick Luna has argued that the letters and memoirs from which Darnton drew his information were written fifteen years after his supposed employment and that the timeline does not work out because Brissot was documented as having left Paris as soon as he was released from the Bastille (where he was held on suspicion of writing &quot;libelles&quot;) and therefore could not have talked with the police as alleged. More convincing still is the work of historian Simon Burrows who, drawing on the Brissot papers (deposited in the Archives Nationales in 1982), comprehensively engages each of Darnton&#x27;s speculations demonstrating that Brissot&#x27;s financial problems were not evidence of fraud, that while – like many others – he traded in books and may have transported libelles, there is no evidence that he wrote them, and that while like many others he collected and collated general information on contemporary opinion in France for royal officials, there is no evidence that he operated as a paid police spy. As Burrows further notes, Darnton has progressively retreated from his earlier speculations, and he argues Brissot&#x27;s behaviour in the 1780s and after, while it demonstrates his willingness to compromise with authority to advance his career, also demonstrates him to be &quot;a committed &quot;philosophe&quot; and reformer, keen to avoid unnecessary entanglements in illegal activities, who despite his political radicalism, aspired to advise the regime and serve like-minded patrons.&quot;

==Legacy==
Through his writings, Brissot made important contributions to &quot;pre-revolutionary and revolutionary ideology in France&quot;. His early works on legislation, his many pamphlets, speeches in the Legislative Assembly and the convention, demonstrated dedication to the principles of the French Revolution. Brissot&#x27;s idea of a fair, democratic society, with universal suffrage, living in moral as well as political freedom, foreshadowed many modern liberationist ideologies.

Brissot was also very interested in science. He was a strong disciple of Sextus Empiricus and applied those theories to modern science at the time in order to make knowledge well known about the enlightenment of Ethos.

The varying actions of Brissot in the 1780s also helped create a key understanding of how the Enlightenment Republic of letters was transformed into a revolutionary Republic of Letters.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 11th edition, remarked: &quot;Brissot was quick, eager, impetuous, and a man of wide knowledge. However, he was indecisive, and not qualified to struggle against the fierce energies roused by the events of the Revolution.&quot; Brissot&#x27;s stance on the King&#x27;s execution and the war with Austria, and his moderate views on the Revolution intensified the friction between the Girondins and Montagnards, who allied themselves with disaffected &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. Brissot ultimately attempted to rein in the violence and excesses of the Revolution by calling for the reinstatement of the constitutional monarchy that had been established by the French Constitution of 1791, a ploy that landed on deaf ears.

On 30 November 1789, Brissot suggested a scheme of municipal constitution for Paris, working in collaboration with the National Assembly and the Assembly of Representatives of the Paris commune, but this plan had to be abandoned when it was refused by the local, decentralized districts of Paris, who had always been more revolutionary than their leaders. Historian and political theorist Peter Kropotkin suggested that Brissot represented the &quot;defenders of property&quot; and the &quot;states-men&quot;, which would become the Girondins, also known as the &quot;War Party.&quot; They were known for this name because they clamoured for a war that would ultimately force the king to step down (as opposed to a popular revolution); Brissot is quoted as saying, &quot;We want some great treachery.&quot; His opinion, recorded in his pamphlet &quot;A sel commettants&quot; (&quot;To Salt Principals&quot;), was that the masses had no &quot;managing capacity&quot; and that he feared a society ruled by &quot;the great unwashed.&quot; Writing on 23 May 1793, Brissot had commented...
&quot;I have declared, since the beginning of the Convention that there was in France a party of dis-organizers, which was tending towards the dissolution of the Republic, even while it was in its cradle... I can prove to-day: first, that this party of anarchists has dominated and still dominates nearly all the deliberations of the Convention and the workings of the Executive Council; secondly, that this party has been and still is the sole cause of all the evils, internal as well as the external, which afflict France; and thirdly, that the Republic can only be saved by taking rigorous measures to wrest the representatives of the nation from the despotism of this faction... Laws that are not carried into effect, authorities without force and despised, crime unpunished, property attacked, the safety of the individual violated, the morality of the people corrupted, no constitution, no government, no justice, these are the features of anarchy!&quot;
The Girondins, or Brissotins as they were initially called, were a group of loosely affiliated individuals, many of whom came from Gironde, rather than an organized party, but the main ideological emphasis was on preventing revolution and protecting private property. This group was first led by Brissot. Robespierre, representing the party of the extreme left, loathed the Girondins.

<text>Edible mushrooms are the fleshy fruit bodies of numerous species of macrofungi (fungi that bear fruiting structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye). Edibility may be defined by criteria including the absence of poisonous effects on humans and desirable taste and aroma. Mushrooms that have a particularly desirable taste are described as &quot;choice&quot;. Edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional and culinary value. Mushrooms, especially dried shiitake, are sources of umami flavor.

To ensure safety, wild mushrooms must be correctly identified before their edibility can be assumed. Deadly poisonous mushrooms that are frequently confused with edible mushrooms include several species of the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, particularly &quot;A. phalloides&quot;, the death cap. Some mushrooms that are edible for most people can cause allergic reactions in others; old or improperly stored specimens can go rancid and cause food poisoning. Additionally, mushrooms can absorb chemicals within polluted locations, accumulating pollutants and heavy metals including arsenic and iron—sometimes in lethal concentrations.

Several varieties of fungi contain psychedelic compounds—the &quot;magic mushrooms&quot;—while variously resembling non-psychoactive species. The most commonly consumed for recreational use are &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (the fly agaric) and &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, with the former containing alkaloids such as muscimol and the latter predominately psilocybin.

Edible mushrooms include many fungal species that are either harvested wild or cultivated. Easily cultivated and common wild mushrooms are often available in markets; those that are more difficult to obtain (such as the prized truffle, matsutake, and morel) may be collected on a smaller scale and are sometimes available at farmers&#x27; markets or other local grocers. Despite long-term use in folk medicine, there is no scientific evidence that consuming &quot;medicinal mushrooms&quot; cures or lowers the risk of human diseases.

== Description ==
Mushrooms can appear either below ground (hypogeous) or above ground (epigeous) and can be picked by hand. Edibility may be defined by criteria including the absence of poisonous effects on humans and desirable taste and aroma. Edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional and culinary value. Mushrooms, especially dried shiitake, are sources of umami flavor.

== List of edible mushrooms ==
=== Commercially cultivated ===

* &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; dominates the edible mushroom market in North America and Europe, in several forms. It is an edible basidiomycete mushroom native to grasslands in Europe and North America. As it ages, this mushroom turns from small, white and smooth to large and light brown. In its youngest form, it is known as the &#x27;common mushroom&#x27;, &#x27;button mushroom&#x27;, &#x27;cultivated mushroom&#x27;, and &#x27;champignon mushroom&#x27;. Its semi-mature form is known variously as &#x27;cremini&#x27;, &#x27;baby-bella&#x27;, &#x27;Swiss brown&#x27; mushroom, &#x27;Roman brown&#x27; mushroom, &#x27;Italian brown&#x27; mushroom, or &#x27;chestnut&#x27; mushroom Its fully mature form is known as &#x27;portobello’.

* &quot;Boletus edulis&quot; or edible Boletus, native to Europe, known in Italian as (plural ) (pig mushroom), in German as (stone mushroom), in Russian as , (white mushroom), in French as the , and in the UK as the penny bun. It is also known as the king bolete, and is renowned for its delicious flavor. It is sought after worldwide, and can be found in a variety of culinary dishes.
* &quot;Boletus griseus&quot;, the gray bolete
* &quot;Boletus variipes&quot;
* &quot;Boletus pinophilus&quot;, the pinewood king bolete
* &quot;Calbovista subsculpta&quot;, commonly known as the sculptured giant puffball is a common puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America. The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to , white becoming brownish in age, and covered with shallow pyramid-shaped plates or scales. It fruits singly or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations, from summer to autumn. It is considered a choice edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.
* &quot;Calvatia gigantea&quot;, the giant puffball. Giant puffballs are considered a choice edible species and are commonly found in meadows, fields, and deciduous forests usually in late summer and autumn. It is found in temperate areas throughout the world. They can reach diameters up to and weights of . The inside of mature giant puffballs is greenish brown, whereas the interior of immature puffballs is white. The large white mushrooms are edible when young.
* &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot; (the chanterelle). The yellow chanterelle is one of the best and most easily recognizable mushrooms and can be found in Asia, Europe, North America and Australia. There are poisonous mushrooms that resemble it, though these can be confidently distinguished if one is familiar with the chanterelle&#x27;s identifying features.
* &quot;Craterellus tubaeformis&quot;, the tube chanterelle, yellow foot chanterelle or yellow-leg
* &quot;Clitocybe nuda&quot;, blewit (or blewitt)
* &quot;Cortinarius caperatus&quot;, the Gypsy mushroom

* &quot;Pleurotus ostreatus&quot;
* &quot;Termitomyces&quot; species are symbiotes of termites and the mushrooms grow out of termite mounds. This genus includes the largest edible mushroom, &quot;Termitomyces titanicus&quot;, with a cap that averages 1 m in diameter, though most species are much smaller. Research is underway to determine how to cultivate these mushrooms.
* &quot;Tricholoma matsutake&quot;, the , a mushroom highly prized in Japanese cuisine.
* &quot;Tuber&quot; genus (truffles). Truffles have long eluded the modern techniques of domestication known as &quot;trufficulture&quot;. Although the field of trufficulture has greatly expanded since its inception in 1808, several species still remain uncultivated. Domesticated truffles include:

=== Conditionally edible species ===
* &quot;Amanita fulva&quot; (tawny grisette) must be cooked before eating.
* &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; is edible if parboiled to leach out toxins; fresh mushrooms cause vomiting, twitching, drowsiness, and hallucinations due to the presence of muscimol. Although present in &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, ibotenic acid is not in high enough concentration to produce any physical or psychological effects unless massive amounts are ingested.
* &quot;Amanita rubescens&quot; (the blusher) must be cooked before eating.
* &quot;Coprinopsis atramentaria&quot; (&quot;Coprinus atramentarius&quot;, common inkcap) is edible without special preparation, but consumption with alcohol is toxic due to the presence of coprine. Some other &quot;Coprinus&quot; spp. share this property.
* &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot; (false morel, turban, brain mushroom) is eaten by some after it has been parboiled, but many mycologists do not recommend it. Raw &quot;Gyromitra&quot; are toxic due to the presence of gyromitrin, and it is not known whether all of the toxin can be removed by parboiling.
* &quot;Lactarius spp.&quot; Apart from &quot;Lactarius deliciosus&quot; (saffron milkcap), which is universally considered edible, other &quot;Lactarius spp.&quot; that are considered toxic elsewhere in the world are eaten in some Eastern European countries and Russia after pickling or parboiling.
* &quot;Lactarius indigo&quot;
* &quot;Lactarius paradoxus&quot;
* &quot;Lactarius corrugis&quot;
* &quot;Lactarius volemus&quot;
* &quot;Lactarius hygrophoroides&quot;
* &quot;Lepista saeva&quot; (field blewit, blue leg, or &quot;Tricholoma personatum&quot;) must be cooked before eating.
* &quot;Morchella esculenta&quot; (morel) must be cooked before eating.
* &quot;Verpa bohemica&quot; is considered choice by some—it even can be found for sale as a &quot;morel&quot;—but cases of toxicity have been reported. Verpas appear to contain monomethylhydrazine and similar precautions apply to them as &quot;Gyromitra&quot; species.
* &quot;Tricholoma terreum&quot; (grey knight), might cause rhabdomyolysis

== Cultivation ==
Mushroom cultivation has a long history, with over twenty species commercially cultivated. Mushrooms are cultivated in at least 60 countries. A fraction of the many fungi consumed by humans are currently cultivated and sold commercially. Commercial cultivation is important ecologically, as there have been concerns of the depletion of larger fungi such as chanterelles in Europe, possibly because the group has grown popular, yet remains a challenge to cultivate.

Some mushrooms, particularly mycorrhizal species, have not yet been successfully cultivated.

In 2019, world production of commercial mushrooms and recorded truffle collection reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization was 11.9 million tonnes, led by China with 75% of the total:

==Safety concerns==
Some wild species are toxic, or at least indigestible, when raw. Failure to identify poisonous mushrooms and confusing them with edible ones has resulted in death. Although in the 21st century primitive digital applications exist to aid with identification, these are unreliable and some inexperienced hunters relying upon them have been seriously poisoned.

Deadly poisonous mushrooms that are frequently confused with edible mushrooms and responsible for many fatal poisonings include several species of the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, particularly &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;, the death cap. Some mushrooms that are edible for most people can cause allergic reactions in some individuals with no prior knowledge of an allergy; old or improperly stored specimens can go rancid quickly and cause food poisoning. Great care should therefore be taken when eating any fungus for the first time, and only small quantities should be consumed in case of individual allergies or reactions. Even normally edible species of mushrooms may be dangerous, as certain mushrooms growing in polluted locations can act as chemical-absorbers, accumulating pollutants and heavy metals, including arsenic and iron, sometimes in lethal concentrations. On the other hand, some cooking preparations may reduce the toxicity of slightly poisonous mushrooms enough to be consumed as survival food, for example, many prized fungi will cause gastric upset when eaten uncooked, such as the &quot;Morchella&quot; genus.

Additionally, several varieties of fungi are known and documented to contain psychedelic drugs—the so-called magic mushrooms—yet resemble perfectly edible, non-psychoactive species. While not necessarily lethal to consume, to the uninitiated, an accidentally induced psychedelic experience can run the gamut from benign to terrifying, even depressing or psychotic. The most commonly consumed for recreational psychoactive use are &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (the fly agaric) and &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, with the former containing alkaloids such as muscimol and the latter predominately psilocybin. Both have the potential to induce in the user feelings of awe, wonder with nature, interesting visual hallucinations and inner peace (even in mild doses), but excessive or accidental consumption can create feelings of insanity, helplessness and fear, usually persisting for a few hours.

==Nutrition==
Higher mushroom consumption has been associated with lower risk of breast cancer. , mushroom consumption has not been shown to conclusively affect risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

A commonly eaten mushroom is the white mushroom (&quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;). In a reference serving, &quot;Agaricus&quot; mushrooms provide of food energy and are 92% water, 3% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 0.3% fat. They contain high levels of riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid, with moderate content of phosphorus (see table). Otherwise, raw white mushrooms generally have low amounts of essential nutrients. Although cooking by boiling lowers mushroom water content only 1%, the contents per 100 grams for several nutrients increase appreciably, especially for dietary minerals.

The content of vitamin D is absent or low unless mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or purposely treated with artificial ultraviolet light, even after harvesting and processed into dry powder.

=== Vitamin D ===


When exposed to UV light before or after harvest, mushrooms convert their large concentrations of ergosterol into vitamin D2. This is similar to the reaction in humans, where vitamin D3 is synthesized after exposure to sunlight.

Testing showed an hour of UV light exposure before harvesting made a serving of mushrooms contain twice the FDA&#x27;s daily recommendation of vitamin D. With 5 minutes of artificial UV light exposure after harvesting, a serving of mushrooms contained four times as much. Analysis also demonstrated that natural sunlight produced vitamin D2.

The form of vitamin D found in UV-irradiated mushrooms is ergocalciferol, or vitamin D2. This is not the same as cholecalciferol, called vitamin D3, which is produced by UV-irradiation of human or animal skin, fur, and feathers. Although vitamin D2 has vitamin-D activity in humans, and is widely used in food fortification and nutritional supplements, vitamin D3 is more commonly used in dairy and cereal products.

== Uses ==

Edible mushrooms include many fungal species that are either harvested wild or cultivated. Easily cultivated and common wild mushrooms are often available in markets; those that are more difficult to obtain (such as the prized truffle, matsutake, and morel) may be collected on a smaller scale by private gatherers, and are sometimes available at farmers&#x27; markets or other local grocers. Mushrooms can be purchased fresh when in season, and many species are also sold dried.

Before assuming that any wild mushroom is edible, it should be correctly identified. Accurate determination of and proper identification of a species is the only safe way to ensure edibility, and the only safeguard against possible poisoning. Some edible species cannot be identified without the use of advanced techniques such as chemistry or microscopy.

=== History ===
Mycophagy (), the act of consuming mushrooms, dates back to ancient times. Edible mushroom species have been found in association with 13,000-year-old archaeological sites in Chile. Ötzi, the mummy of a man who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE in Europe, was found with two types of mushroom. The Chinese value mushrooms for their supposed medicinal properties as well as for food. Ancient Romans and Greeks, particularly the upper classes, used mushrooms for culinary purposes. Food tasters were employed by Roman emperors to ensure that mushrooms were safe to eat. &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot;, a 14th-century compilation of medieval English recipes, features a recipe of mushrooms and leeks cooked in broth.

=== Culinary ===
====Cooking====

Mushrooms may be cooked before consumption to improve texture and lower trace levels of toxic hydrazines. Frying, roasting, baking, and microwaving are all used to prepare mushrooms. Cooking lowers the amount of water present in the food. Mushrooms do not go mushy with long term cooking because the chitin that gives most of the structure to a mushroom does not break down until which is not reached in any normal cooking.

====Storage====

Mushrooms will usually last a few days, longer if refrigerated. Mushrooms can be frozen, but are best cooked first. They can also be dried or pickled.

=== In traditional medicine ===

Medicinal mushrooms are mushrooms or extracts from mushrooms that are thought to be treatments for diseases, yet remain unconfirmed in mainstream science and medicine, and so are not approved as drugs or medical treatments. Such use of mushrooms therefore falls into the domain of traditional medicine for which there is no direct high-quality clinical evidence of efficacy.

Preliminary research on mushroom extracts has been conducted to determine if anti-disease properties exist, such as for polysaccharide-K or lentinan. Some extracts have widespread use in Japan, Korea and China, as potential adjuvants for radiation treatments and chemotherapy.

<text>A camera lens, photographic lens or photographic objective is an optical lens or assembly of lenses (compound lens) used in conjunction with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on photographic film or on other media capable of storing an image chemically or electronically.

There is no major difference in principle between a lens used for a still camera, a video camera, a telescope, a microscope, or other apparatus, but the details of design and construction are different. A lens might be permanently fixed to a camera, or it might be interchangeable with lenses of different focal lengths, apertures, and other properties.

While in principle a simple convex lens will suffice, in practice a compound lens made up of a number of optical lens elements is required to correct (as much as possible) the many optical aberrations that arise. Some aberrations will be present in any lens system. It is the job of the lens designer to balance these and produce a design that is suitable for photographic use and possibly mass production.

==Theory of operation==
Typical rectilinear lenses can be thought of as &quot;improved&quot; pinhole &quot;lenses&quot;. As shown, a pinhole &quot;lens&quot; is simply a small aperture that blocks most rays of light, ideally selecting one ray to the object for each point on the image sensor. Pinhole lenses have a few severe limitations:

* A pinhole camera with a large aperture is blurry because each pixel is essentially the shadow of the aperture stop, so its size is no smaller than the size of the aperture (third image). Here a pixel is the area of the detector exposed to light from a point on the object.
* Making the pinhole smaller improves resolution (up to a limit), but reduces the amount of light captured.
* At a certain point, shrinking the hole does not improve the resolution because of the diffraction limit. Beyond this limit, making the hole smaller makes the image blurrier as well as darker.

Practical lenses can be thought of as an answer to the question: &quot;how can a pinhole lens be modified to admit more light and give a smaller spot size?&quot;. A first step is to put a simple convex lens at the pinhole with a focal length equal to the distance to the film plane (assuming the camera will take pictures of distant objects). This allows the pinhole to be opened up significantly (fourth image) because a thin convex lens bends light rays in proportion to their distance to the axis of the lens, with rays striking the center of the lens passing straight through. The geometry is almost the same as with a simple pinhole lens, but rather than being illuminated by single rays of light, each image point is illuminated by a focused &quot;pencil&quot; of light rays.

From the front of the camera, the small hole (the aperture), would be seen. The virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens&#x27;s entrance pupil; ideally, all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film (provided the object point is in the field of view). If one were inside the camera, one would see the lens acting as a projector. The virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens&#x27;s exit pupil. In this simple case, the aperture, entrance pupil, and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture, but in general these three will be in different places. Practical photographic lenses include more lens elements. The additional elements allow lens designers to reduce various aberrations, but the principle of operation remains the same: pencils of rays are collected at the entrance pupil and focused down from the exit pupil onto the image plane.

==Construction==
A camera lens may be made from a number of elements: from one, as in the Box Brownie&#x27;s meniscus lens, to over 20 in the more complex zooms. These elements may themselves comprise a group of lenses cemented together.

The front element is critical to the performance of the whole assembly. In all modern lenses the surface is coated to reduce abrasion, flare, and surface reflectance, and to adjust color balance. To minimize aberration, the curvature is usually set so that the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction are equal. In a prime lens this is easy, but in a zoom there is always a compromise.

The lens usually is focused by adjusting the distance from the lens assembly to the image plane, or by moving elements of the lens assembly. To improve performance, some lenses have a cam system that adjusts the distance between the groups as the lens is focused. Manufacturers call this different things: Nikon calls it CRC (close range correction); Canon calls it a floating system; and Hasselblad and Mamiya call it FLE (floating lens element).

Glass is the most common material used to construct lens elements, due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching. Other materials are also used, such as quartz glass, fluorite, plastics like acrylic (Plexiglass), and even germanium and meteoritic glass. Plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly aspherical lens elements which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass, and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance. Plastics are not used for the outermost elements of all but the cheapest lenses as they scratch easily. Molded plastic lenses have been used for the cheapest disposable cameras for many years, and have acquired a bad reputation: manufacturers of quality optics tend to use euphemisms such as &quot;optical resin&quot;. However many modern, high performance (and high priced) lenses from popular manufacturers include molded or hybrid aspherical elements, so it is not true that all lenses with plastic elements are of low photographic quality.

The 1951 USAF resolution test chart is one way to measure the resolving power of a lens. The quality of the material, coatings, and build affect the resolution. Lens resolution is ultimately limited by diffraction, and very few photographic lenses approach this resolution. Ones that do are called &quot;diffraction limited&quot; and are usually extremely expensive.

Today, most lenses are multi-coated in order to minimize lens flare and other unwanted effects. Some lenses have a UV coating to keep out the ultraviolet light that could taint color. Most modern optical cements for bonding glass elements also block UV light, negating the need for a UV filter. However, this leaves an avenue for lens fungus to attack if lenses are not cared for appropriately. UV photographers must go to great lengths to find lenses with no cement or coatings.

A lens will most often have an aperture adjustment mechanism, usually an iris diaphragm, to regulate the amount of light that passes. In early camera models a rotating plate or slider with different sized holes was used. These Waterhouse stops may still be found on modern, specialized lenses. A shutter, to regulate the time during which light may pass, may be incorporated within the lens assembly (for better quality imagery), within the camera, or even, rarely, in front of the lens. Some cameras with leaf shutters in the lens omit the aperture, and the shutter does double duty.

==Aperture and focal length==


The two fundamental parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture. The lens&#x27; focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane, and the aperture the light intensity of that image. For a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view, short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses. A wider aperture, identified by a smaller f-number, allows using a faster shutter speed for the same exposure. The camera equation, or G#, is the ratio of the radiance reaching the camera sensor to the irradiance on the focal plane of the camera lens.

The maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number, defined as the lens&#x27;s focal length divided by the effective aperture (or entrance pupil), a dimensionless number. The lower the f-number, the higher light intensity at the focal plane. Larger apertures (smaller f-numbers) provide a much shallower depth of field than smaller apertures, other conditions being equal. Practical lens assemblies may also contain mechanisms to deal with measuring light, secondary apertures for flare reduction, and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow SLR cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower depth of field, theoretically allowing better focus accuracy.

Focal lengths are usually specified in millimetres (mm), but older lenses might be marked in centimetres (cm) or inches. For a given film or sensor size, specified by the length of the diagonal, a lens may be classified as a:

* Normal lens: angle of view of the diagonal about 50° and a focal length approximately equal to the image diagonal. 
* Wide-angle lens: angle of view wider than 60° and focal length shorter than normal.
* Long-focus lens: any lens with a focal length longer than the diagonal measure of the film or sensor. Angle of view is narrower. The most common type of long-focus lens is the telephoto lens, a design that uses special optical configurations to make the lens shorter than its focal length.

A side effect of using lenses of different focal lengths is the different distances from which a subject can be framed, resulting in a different perspective. Photographs can be taken of a person stretching out a hand with a wideangle, a normal lens, and a telephoto, which contain exactly the same image size by changing the distance from the subject. But the perspective will be different. With the wideangle, the hands will be exaggeratedly large relative to the head. As the focal length increases, the emphasis on the outstretched hand decreases. However, if pictures are taken from the same distance, and enlarged and cropped to contain the same view, the pictures will have identical perspective. A moderate long-focus (telephoto) lens is often recommended for portraiture because the perspective corresponding to the longer shooting distance is considered to look more flattering.

The widest aperture lens in history of photography is believed to be the Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7, which was designed and made specifically for the NASA Apollo lunar program to capture the far side of the Moon in 1966. Three of these lenses were purchased by filmmaker Stanley Kubrick in order to film scenes in his 1975 film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, using candlelight as the sole light source.

==Number of elements==

The complexity of a lens — the number of elements and their degree of asphericity — depends upon the angle of view, the maximum aperture, and intended price point, among other variables. An extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations, which are worse at the edge of the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming. A long-focus lens of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality: a doublet (two elements) will often suffice. Some older cameras were fitted with convertible lenses (German: &quot;&quot;) of normal focal length. The front element could be unscrewed, leaving a lens of twice the focal length, and half the angle of view and half the aperture. The simpler half-lens was of adequate quality for the narrow angle of view and small relative aperture. This would require the bellows had to be extended to twice the normal length.

Good-quality lenses with maximum aperture no greater than f/2.8 and fixed, normal, focal length need at least three (triplet) or four elements (the trade name &quot;Tessar&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;tessera&quot;, meaning &quot;four&quot;). The widest-range zooms often have fifteen or more. The reflection of light at each of the many interfaces between different optical media (air, glass, plastic) seriously degraded the contrast and color saturation of early lenses, particularly zoom lenses, especially where the lens was directly illuminated by a light source. The introduction of optical coatings, and advances in coating technology over the years, have resulted in major improvements, and modern high-quality zoom lenses give images of quite acceptable contrast, although zoom lenses with many elements will transmit less light than lenses made with fewer elements (all other factors such as aperture, focal length, and coatings being equal).

==Lens mounts==

Many single-lens reflex cameras and some rangefinder cameras have detachable lenses. A few other types do as well, notably the Mamiya TLR cameras and SLR, medium format cameras (RZ67, RB67, 645-1000s)other companies that produce medium format equipment such as Bronica, Hasselblad and Fuji have similar camera styles that allow interchangeability in the lenses as well, and mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras. The lenses attach to the camera using a lens mount, which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens and camera body.

The lens mount design is an important issue for compatibility between cameras and lenses. There is no universal standard for lens mounts, and each major camera maker typically uses its own proprietary design, incompatible with other makers. A few older manual focus lens mount designs, such as the Leica M39 lens mount for rangefinders, M42 lens mount for early SLRs, and the Pentax K mount are found across multiple brands, but this is not common today. A few mount designs, such as the Olympus/Kodak Four Thirds System mount for DSLRs, have also been licensed to other makers. Most large-format cameras take interchangeable lenses as well, which are usually mounted in a lensboard or on the front standard.

The most common interchangeable lens mounts on the market today include the Canon EF, EF-S and EF-M autofocus lens mounts. Others include the Nikon F manual and autofocus mounts, the Olympus/Kodak Four Thirds and Olympus/Panasonic Micro Four Thirds digital-only mounts, the Pentax K mount and autofocus variants, the Sony Alpha mount (derived from the Minolta mount) and the Sony E digital-only mount.

==Types of lenses==
===&quot;Close-up&quot; or macro===
A macro lens used in macro or &quot;close-up&quot; photography (not to be confused with the compositional term &quot;close up&quot;) is any lens that produces an image on the focal plane (i.e., film or a digital sensor) that is one quarter of life size (1:4) to the same size (1:1) as the subject being imaged. There is no official standard to define a macro lens, usually a prime lens, but a 1:1 ratio is, typically, considered &quot;true&quot; macro. Magnification from life size to larger is called &quot;Micro&quot; photography (2:1, 3:1 etc.). This configuration is generally used to image &quot;close-up&quot; very small subjects. A macro lens may be of any focal length, the actual focus length being determined by its practical use, considering magnification, the required ratio, access to the subject, and illumination considerations. It can be a special lens corrected optically for close up work or it can be any lens modified (with adapters or spacers, which are also known as &quot;extension tubes&quot;.) to bring the focal plane &quot;forward&quot; for very close photography. Depending on the camera to subject distance and aperture, the depth-of-field can be very narrow, limiting the linear depth of the area that will be in focus. Lenses are usually stopped down to give a greater depth-of-field.

===Zoom===

Some lenses, called zoom lenses, have a focal length that varies as internal elements are moved, typically by rotating the barrel or pressing a button which activates an electric motor. Commonly, the lens may zoom from moderate wide-angle, through normal, to moderate telephoto; or from normal to extreme telephoto. The zoom range is limited by manufacturing constraints; the ideal of a lens of large maximum aperture which will zoom from extreme wideangle to extreme telephoto is not attainable. Zoom lenses are widely used for small-format cameras of all types: still and cine cameras with fixed or interchangeable lenses. Bulk and price limit their use for larger film sizes. Motorized zoom lenses may also have the focus, iris, and other functions motorized.

===Special-purpose===

* Apochromat (apo) lenses have added correction for chromatic aberration.
* Process lenses have extreme correction for aberrations of geometry (pincushion distortion, barrel distortion) and are generally intended for use at a specific distance and at small aperture.
* Enlarger lenses are made to be used with photographic enlargers (specialised projectors), rather than cameras.
* Lenses for aerial photography.
* Shift lens allow the lens to be raised or lowered relative to the film of sensor plane to correct or exaggerate perspective distortion.
* Fisheye lenses: extreme wide-angle lenses with an angle of view of up to 180 degrees or more, with very noticeable (and intended) distortion.
* Stereoscopic lenses, to produce pairs of photographs which give a 3-dimensional effect when viewed with an appropriate viewer.
* Soft-focus lenses which give a soft, but not out-of-focus, image and have an imperfection-removing effect popular among portrait and fashion photographers.
* Infrared lenses
* Ultraviolet lenses
* Swivel lenses rotate while attached to a camera body to give unique perspectives and camera angles.
* Shift lenses and tilt/shift lenses (collectively perspective control lenses) allow special control of perspective on SLR cameras by mimicking view camera movements.
* telecentric lenses (or orthographic lenses) make any object appear as the same size regardless of their distance from the lens.

<doc id="193983" wikidata="Q57664" url="?curid=193983" title="Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont">
<text>Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont (Adelheid Emma Wilhelmina Theresia; 2 August 1858 – 20 March 1934) was Queen of the Netherlands and Grand Duchess of Luxembourg as the wife of King-Grand Duke William III. An immensely popular member of the Dutch Royal Family, Queen Emma served as regent for her daughter, Queen Wilhelmina, during the latter&#x27;s minority from 1890 until 1898.

==Early life==

Emma was born a princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont on 2 August 1858 in Arolsen Castle in Arolsen, the capital of the small German principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont. She was the fourth daughter of Georg Viktor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and Princess Helena of Nassau-Weilburg. Her brother, Prince Friedrich I, was the last reigning prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. Her sister, Princess Helena, was the wife of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of Queen Victoria.

Her maternal grandfather was Wilhelm I, Duke of Nassau, a grandson of Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, through which she inherited a place in the line of succession to the Dutch Crown until 1887.

Emma had a religious education from a very liberal-minded pastor. With her English governess, Emma studied crafts, drawing, and French literature. Her upbringing has been described as fairly informal, though with a focus on a sense of duty. She was given an interest in social work early on due to the charity work she became involved in already as young, and an interest in medical work due to the illness of her eldest sister, who suffered from tuberculosis. Emma was described as tactful, sensible, and engaging.

==Queen of the Netherlands==
Princess Emma married the much older King William III at Arolsen Castle on 7 January 1879, two years after the death of his first wife, Sophie of Württemberg. The king, born in 1817, was no less than forty-one years older than Emma; indeed, all three of his children from his first marriage were older than her. Two of his three sons were still alive at the time of Emma&#x27;s wedding, and the match was not motivated by the need to produce an heir. The marriage was suggested during William&#x27;s visit to Pyrmont in 1878. Emma was one of several daughters of a minor German prince, with very moderate marriage prospects, and her parents were enthused by the idea that their daughter would become a queen on her wedding day. Emma, raised in a loving and conservative family, acceded to the wishes of her beloved parents without demur. Immediately after the engagement, she began receiving lessons in the Dutch language.

The king had three sons from his first marriage, William, Maurice, and Alexander, the youngest of whom was seven years older than Emma. Maurice had died in childhood, but the other two were alive to receive their step-mother. Six months after the wedding, Crown Prince William died in France of a combination of typhus, and liver complaints (excessive indulgence in drink). The King&#x27;s youngest son, Alexander, then became heir apparent.

In August 1880, Emma became a mother with the birth of what would be her only child, the future Queen Wilhelmina. When her last surviving stepson Alexander, Prince of Orange died in 1884, her daughter became heiress to the throne. This changed Emma&#x27;s position, since it was likely that her daughter would succeed while yet a minor, in which case Emma herself would be regent during the minority.

After the death of his youngest son, the king retired from public life due to his health conditions, and Emma undertook the task of nursing him.

==Regency==

Three days before William died on 23 November 1890, Emma became regent for her incapacitated husband. She continued her regency until Wilhelmina&#x27;s eighteenth birthday on 31 August 1898. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the crown of which according to the House-Treaty should not be inherited by a woman, passed to Adolf, Duke of Nassau, who happened to be Queen Emma&#x27;s maternal uncle.

Emma was the first woman to rule The Netherlands since Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau a century before, and the first woman to rule the Kingdom of the Netherlands. She took her position of regent seriously. Her task was not simple, since William had antagonized many politicians with his autocratic ways. She managed to establish better relations between the royal house and the political world fairly quickly with good advisors, particularly Jhr J. Röell and Jhr GCJ van Reenen. She met personally with every government minister at least once every two weeks to keep herself informed of all political issues, and strictly adhered to the rules of the constitutional monarchy. She used the trust she gained by respecting the constitutional forms and her influence on political issues she cared about, which resulted in compromises where she often managed to get her way. One statesman commented that Emma was efficient because she combined a strong will with soft forms, something they had not been used to.

As regent Emma presided over three cabinets. In 1891, Emma refused to appoint the suggested minister Johannes Tak van Poortvliet, with whom she had a tense relationship, in favor of G. van Tienhoven. In 1894 she was convinced by Tak van Poortvliet to dissolve Parliament. When a new cabinet was to be sworn in, she refused until she had read and approved of their political program. In 1897, she demanded that both the Liberal parties were to be included in the new cabinet and the Aceh War was to continue, before she agreed to have the new government sworn in. She wrote and held her speeches in Dutch, and engaged herself in the Dutch Colonial Empire, attending the military parades and celebrations associated with Imperial achievements.

In addition to her administrative duties, Emma paid great attention to the education of her daughter. When Wilhelmina reached the age of 16, Emma considered her childhood over and Wilhelmina spent the next two years being prepared for her job as a reigning queen. During her government, she took Wilhelmina on tours through the provinces to visit local charities, hospitals, churches and factories and acquaint Wilhelmina with her future duties.

==Queen mother==
On 31 August 1898 her daughter, Queen Wilhelmina, reached legal majority and Queen Emma thereby retired from regency on Wilhelmina&#x27;s inauguration on 6 September. In her farewell speech as regent, she expressed her wish that The Netherlands should continue to be great in the way small nations could show greatness.

Emma continued to live with her daughter until Wilhelmina&#x27;s marriage to Henry of Mecklenburg in 1901, after which she moved to her own residence Lange Voorhout in The Hague. When her granddaughter Juliana was born in 1909, it was declared that in case Juliana succeeded to the throne as a minor, her grandmother Emma should be regent rather than her father.

As queen mother Emma continued to attend to public royal representational duties, supporting her daughter and son-in-law, and was a well known figure in her black widow lace. She was called &quot;queen of charity&quot; and especially engaged in improvement of the conditions for those suffering from tuberculosis. 
She retired from public life when her granddaughter Juliana was declared adult and started to participate in public duties in 1927.

The queen mother died in The Hague on 20 March 1934, of complications from bronchitis at the age of 75, and was buried in Delft.

<doc id="193995" wikidata="Q160800" url="?curid=193995" title="Anna Pavlovna of Russia">
<text>Anna Pavlovna of Russia ( ; ; – 1 March 1865) was Queen of the Netherlands by marriage to King William II of the Netherlands. She was a Russian patriot who upheld a strict royal etiquette in the Netherlands, where she never felt at home, and identified more as a Russian Grand Duchess than a Dutch Queen. She had no political influence, but was active within charity.

==Youth==

Anna Pavlovna was born in 1795 at Gatchina Palace, the eighth child and sixth daughter of Paul I of Russia and Empress Maria Feodorovna (born Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg), and thus was &quot;Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia&quot;. Following the death of Anna&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Catherine the Great, in 1796, her father became the emperor, but, was deposed and killed in 1801, when she was six years old. Anna Pavlovna&#x27;s brother Alexander succeeded to the throne.

Anna was raised by her mother at the summer residence of the Romanovs, Tsarskoye Selo. She spent her childhood there with her two younger brothers, Nicholas (1796–1855) and Michael (1798–1849). Anna was tutored by the Swiss governess Louise de Sybourg (&#x27;Bourcis&#x27;) and received a broad education, including foreign languages (Russian, German and French) and mathematics. She was good at handicrafts and painting.

Anna had a good relationship with her brother, the Emperor Alexander, but she was closest to her mother and to her two younger brothers, the future Emperor Nicholas and Grand Duke Michael, with whom she was to correspond by letters her whole life after leaving Russia. After the death of her mother in 1828, she came to rely greatly on Nicholas, who responded by giving her all sorts of favors when he became emperor in 1825. She had a fairly good relationship with her sister Maria as well, but the relationship between Anna and her sister Catherine (Ekaterina) was never a good one.

In 1809, Emperor Napoleon I of France asked for Anna&#x27;s hand in marriage after failing to secure her elder sister Ekaterina as a potential bride. Her mother managed to delay her reply long enough for Napoleon to lose interest and to marry Archduchess Marie Louise, the eighteen-year-old daughter of the Austrian emperor, in 1810. Other suitors were Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry (1778–1820, a prospective Bourbon heir to the French throne), and the British Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (1765–1837).

==Marriage==
On 21 February 1816 at the Grand Church of the Winter Palace in St Petersburg, she married the Prince of Orange, who would later become King William II of the Netherlands. The marriage had been suggested by her brother the Tsar Alexander I in 1815, as a symbol of the alliance created after the Congress of Vienna. Since Peter the Great had decided that no member of the Romanov family should be forced to marry against their will, William was invited to Russia before the wedding so that Anna could get to know him and consent to marry him, which she did, as she was pleased with him with the exception of his birth, which she considered inferior to hers. At the time of their marriage, it was agreed that Prince Willem&#x27;s children should be raised as Protestants, although Anna herself remained Russian Orthodox. Alexander Pushkin celebrated the marriage in a special poem entitled &quot;To the Prince of Orange&quot;. The couple remained in Russia for one year. She was given a dowry of one million roubles, and her governess Bourcis accompanied her to the Netherlands.

==Crown Princess==

In the Netherlands, Anna and William were given the Kneuterdijk Palace and Soestdijk Palace as their residence. Anna Pavlovna was shocked over the differences between Russia and her new home country, as the distance between royalty and commoners as well as between the aristocracy and the rest of society was much more egalitarian in the Netherlands than in her native Russia, and she had difficulties adjusting herself to this.

During the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the future Belgium was also a part of the same monarchy. Anna and William preferred Brussels to the Netherlands and lived there until the Belgian Revolution forced them to leave in 1830. They lived in the Hof van Brabant until the fire of 1820, after which they were given a new residence in Brussels. William preferred Brussels partially because of his bad relationship with his father the king. Anna liked Brussels much more than the north, as the French aristocratic society in the less egalitarian Brussels reminded her much more of the court life in her native Saint Petersburg than the egalitarian and more simple and Spartan court life of The Hague. She was also popular among the Belgian nobility and high society, who were to remain loyal to the House of Orange in the first years after the declaration of Belgian independence.

The 1820s were dominated by the birth of her children. She had a good relationship with Henry and Sophie, but her favorite was Alexander. Anna was convinced he had no faults, as proven by a letter she wrote to her brother Nicholas in 1839. In truth, however, the relationship between her and the freedom loving, easy going Alexander could be tempestuous. When Anna insisted he accompany her on a journey to Italy in 1846, Alexander complained of being dragged off like a monkey in a cage. Anna&#x27;s capriciousness and angry outbursts left him exasperated at times and caused several major rows. Although Alexander wasn&#x27;t the perfectly compliant, obedient son his mother made him out to be (especially in letters to her Russian family), his death at age 29 in 1848 was a heavy blow for her. She mourned him intensely for the rest of her life and hung on to many of his possessions. Anna focused her attention on her eldest son William because of his position as heir. William, like his mother, was capricious and hot headed. Her relationship with him was strained, especially after his marriage, which she strongly disapproved of. Comments in her letters suggest that she tried to dominate and influence him, though she did not quite succeed.

Her marriage was stormy. From the beginning, Anna considered herself superior in rank to William. In 1829, several pieces of her jewellery were stolen in Brussels, and she suspected her spouse of stealing them, as he was at the time in debt and mixing with people she considered to be questionable. The adultery of her spouse created conflicts between them.

The Belgian Revolution forced both Anna and William to leave their home in Brussels and relocate to the Netherlands. During the revolution William and his father the king had different opinions in how to deal with the revolution, and Anna acted as mediator to ease the tension between them. This was the only occasion when Anna became involved in political affairs. She showed support to her spouse in public, and accompanied him when his father exiled him to Willemsdorp near Moerdijk.

After 1830 Anna stayed in the Netherlands as crown princess, and focused on this role. During her time in the Netherlands, she studied the Dutch language, history and culture, and founded more than fifty orphanages. Anna spoke French with her spouse, as French was the international language of the European aristocracy, but she was tutored in the Dutch language by Arie van der Spuij, and came to speak better Dutch than William. She considered it her duty to fulfil her public role as a royal woman and charity was a part of this role: she founded the &quot;commissiën van weldadigheid&quot; (&quot;charity commission&quot;) in Soest and Baarn, and the &quot;Koninklijke Winternaaischool Scheveningen&quot;, a school in needlework for poor women and girls, and gave financial contributions to the schools Anna Paulowna and Sophiaschool. During the Belgian Revolution, she founded the hospital &quot;Willemshospitaal&quot; in The Hague for wounded soldiers, whom she visited. After the death of her mother-in-law in 1837, she took over the protection of the charity organization &#x27;moedergenootschappen&#x27; (&#x27;mother foundations&#x27;).

==Queen==

On 7 October 1840, on the abdication of her father-in-law William I of the Netherlands, she became queen consort of the Netherlands, and her husband was inaugurated in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam. Anna attended his inauguration in a dress of silver cloth.

As queen, Anna was described as dignified, proud and distant toward the public: she was never to be a popular queen, but it was not her goal to become popular with the public, rather to be respected for having performed her role in accordance to duty. She valued ceremonial court etiquette and royal representation, and the Dutch court was reportedly given more of a &quot;royal allure&quot; than before.

Anna Pavlovna was described as a tall, stately woman with a majestic appearance: proud and always identifying with her rank as an Imperial Grand Duchess, she never gave up her Imperial rank and was as a strict follower of etiquette and ceremony. Anna was acknowledged to be a talented and intelligent person who quickly mastered a new language as well as being well informed and with a clear understanding of contemporary politics. She was also a strong willed character with a heated temperament, which could cause outbursts and result in her refusing to leave her rooms for days, referred to as her &quot;nerves&quot;. She was also deeply devoted to her mother and her two younger brothers and their family affairs.

Anna Pavlovna corresponded with her mother and brothers in Russia, treasured the memory of her birth country and remained a strong Russian patriot her entire life, and it has been said of her that she remained a Russian Grand Duchess more than she ever became queen of the Netherlands. She had a Russian Orthodox private chapel in her private quarters, and had her own priest and Russian choir boys to serve her. She kept her Orthodox religion and continued to live in accordance with Russian custom (albeit in her case the French influenced Russian aristocratic version) and sometimes appeared in Russian national costume.

Her correspondence as well as the diary of her courtier Baron Mackay van Ophemert illustrated that she was well informed and held clear political opinions, though she was never involved in politics or expressed any political views in public.

==Queen dowager==
King William II struggled with ill health during the late 1840s. His complaints were further worsened by unhealthy habits (such as overexerting himself physically and constant smoking), worry over the unstable political situation at home and abroad and concern over the rapidly deteriorating health of his son Alexander. In the summer of 1847 it was clear his heart condition would soon become fatal. Williams health rapidly worsened in the winter of 1849 and he died on the 17th of March. Anna came to Tilburg when he was on his death bed, but was not allowed into the sick room for fear of upsetting her dying husband. Instead, she listened at the door. When he had died, she threw herself on the lifeless body in flouts of tears. William&#x27;s sudden death was reportedly a shock to Anna. He died with large debts and his bookkeeping in total disarray. Anna was forced to sell some of her own possessions in order to keep her preferred residence, the Soestdijk Palace. She made Soestdijk into a shrine in memory of her deceased husband and son Alexander.

As queen dowager, Anna left the royal palace, retired from court life and lived a private life. Her relationship with her son King William III was always tense and she once said contemptuously about him that he was lucky to be a king of a constitutional empire. She did not get along with her daughter-in-law and niece Sophie, whom her son had married against her will. She was the daughter of the sister she liked the least, Catherine. Allegedly Anna was jealous of Catherine&#x27;s beauty and status as their mother&#x27;s favorite child. She had a better relationship to her two younger children, but as they were abroad her last years were lonely. She considered returning to Russia after a conflict with her son in 1855, but in the end, she did not.

Anna died 1 March 1865.

==Children==
Anna and William II of the Netherlands had five children:
* William III of the Netherlands (1817–1890). Married firstly Sophie of Württemberg and secondly Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, had 3 sons from the first marriage and 1 daughter from the second.
* William &quot;Alexander&quot; Frederick Constantine Nicholas Michael &quot;Sasha&quot; of the Netherlands (1818–1848). Unmarried, had no issue.
* William Frederick &quot;Henry&quot; &quot;the Navigator&quot; of the Netherlands (1820–1879). Married firstly Amalia of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and secondly Marie of Prussia, but had no issue.
* Prince William Alexander Frederick Ernest Casimir of the Netherlands (May - October 1822).
* Wilhelmina Marie Sophie Louise of the Netherlands (1824–1897). Married Karl Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach had 1 son and 3 daughters.

==Legacy==
The municipality Anna Paulowna in the Dutch province of North Holland is named after her.

The genus of trees &quot;Paulownia&quot; was coined by the German botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold to honour Anna Pavlovna. The common name of &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; is Royal Paulownia, (also known as Empress Tree, Princess Tree, and Foxglove Tree.

<doc id="193997" wikidata="Q3926360" url="?curid=193997" title="Qari Ahmadullah">
<text>Qari Ahmadullah () (born 1975) was an Afghan militant and the Taliban&#x27;s Minister of Security (or Intelligence Service) in 1996.

He was responsible for bribing anti-Taliban commanders to desert the ranks of the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan opposition. Ahmadullah also commanded troops fighting on frontlines in the north of the country against the Northern Alliance.

==Background==
According to the Official Journal of the European Union and the testimony of Abdul Haq Wasiq, before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, Ahmadullah was the Minister of Security and also Minister of Intelligence and Governor of Takhar Province. Abdul Haq described Ahmadullah as an uneducated man.

==Supposed death==
He was supposedly killed in the opening days of 2002 in the American airstrike against Mullah Taha&#x27;s house in Zadran (though the Pentagon was unable to confirm Ahmadullah&#x27;s death). 12 years after the incident, an investigation by Harper&#x27;s Weekly alleged Ahmadullah was alive.

<doc id="194000" wikidata="Q246915" url="?curid=194000" title="Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester">
<text>Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester (born Lady Alice Christabel Montagu Douglas Scott; 25 December 1901 – 29 October 2004) was a member of the British royal family. She was the wife of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the third son of King George V and Queen Mary. She was the mother of Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

The daughter of the 7th Duke of Buccleuch, Scotland&#x27;s largest landowner, she became by marriage a princess of the United Kingdom, and a sister-in-law to Edward VIII and George VI. She was thus an aunt by marriage to Elizabeth II. Princess Alice was extremely well travelled, both before and after her marriage. At the time of her death at age 102, she was the longest-lived member of the British royal family.

==Early life==
Alice Christabel Montagu Douglas Scott was born in Montagu House, Whitehall, London, on Christmas Day 1901, the third daughter and fifth child of John Montagu Douglas Scott, Earl of Dalkeith (later Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry), and his wife, the former Lady Margaret Alice &quot;Molly&quot; Bridgeman, daughter of the 4th Earl of Bradford. Her brothers Walter and William and her nephew John were all Conservative MPs. Her first cousin Marian Louisa, Lady Elmhirst, was the paternal grandmother of Sarah, Duchess of York, former wife of Alice&#x27;s great-nephew Prince Andrew, Duke of York.

Alice was a descendant, in an unbroken male line, of Charles II through his eldest but illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, himself a major political figure during the years leading up to the Glorious Revolution. As she was born on Christmas Day, she was given the middle name of Christabel.

Alice spent much of her childhood travelling &quot;between splendid houses&quot;: Boughton House in Northamptonshire, Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, and Bowhill in the Scottish Borders. Eildon Hall, in Melrose, Scottish Borders, was more or less home base.

An experience of nearly drowning at the age of 14 awoke Alice to a keen sense of making the most of every day. Caught in a current in the Solway Firth, she was convinced that she was going to die and she prayed to God, begging for a miracle to save her life in exchange for her devoting herself to public service:

Alice attended the independent St James&#x27;s School for Girls, in West Malvern, Worcestershire, and later travelled to France, Kenya and India. After school in West Malvern, she spent a year in Paris &quot;before returning home to be presented at Court in 1920&quot;. Alice enjoyed skiing, horse-riding and hunting and was also an accomplished watercolourist. A painting by her, done near Archers Post in Kenya, is today part of the Royal Collection. In Kenya, where she stayed for more than a year, from about 1929–1931, she stayed in the area typical of the so-called Happy Valley set and encountered many of the personalities of said clique, including Evelyn Waugh.

==Marriage==
In 1935, Alice returned to the United Kingdom when she learned that her father&#x27;s health had been deteriorating. In August 1935, Lady Alice became engaged to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. They were married in a private ceremony, in the Private Chapel, Buckingham Palace, on 6 November of that year. A much more elaborate wedding was originally planned for Westminster Abbey; however, after the Duke of Buccleuch died of cancer on 19 October 1935, and in consideration of the King&#x27;s own failing health, it was decided that the wedding should be scaled down to a more private setting.

Although the day was cold and wet, a crowd estimated to be more than one million people lined the streets from the Palace to the railway station to see the couple off on their honeymoon. She was often referred to as the &quot;Winter Princess&quot; from then on.

===Life in the royal family===

Initially the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester lived at the Royal Pavilion in Aldershot, where the Duke was taking the Army staff course. The Duke of Gloucester left the army to take on more public duties following the abdication of Edward VIII in December 1936.

The couple received a grace and favour residence at York House, St James&#x27;s Palace, London, and, in 1938, they purchased Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire. The Duchess suffered two miscarriages, before giving birth to two sons:

:* Prince William of Gloucester (18 December 1941 – 28 August 1972)
:* Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester (born 26 August 1944). He married a Danish commoner, Birgitte van Deurs Henriksen, on 8 July 1972. The couple later had three children.

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester travelled extensively, undertaking various engagements. The public appearances of the Duchess included launching on 19 October 1937. During World War II, the Duchess worked with the Red Cross and the Order of St John. She became head of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) in 1939 as Senior Controller, changed to Air Commandant on 12 March 1940, and appointed Air Chief Commandant on 4 March 1943, when she took over as director until August 1944. When the WAAF became the Women&#x27;s Royal Air Force (WRAF) in 1949, she was appointed an Air Chief Commandant (equivalent to Air vice-marshal) in the new service on 1 February 1949. She was promoted to Air marshal on 1 September 1968, and to air chief marshal in the Royal Air Force on 23 February 1990. She also served as deputy to Queen Elizabeth, the consort of George VI, as Commandant-in-Chief of the Nursing Corps.
From 1945 to 1947, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester lived in Canberra, where the Duke was serving as Governor-General of Australia. He had visited Australia a number of times. In 1939, the Duchess&#x27;s sister and brother-in-law, Lady Angela Dawnay and Sir Peter Dawnay, and their son, Charles, visited from their home in New Zealand. In 1969, the Duke and Duchess were invited to their niece Moyra Dawnay’s wedding to Timothy de Zoete, grandson of cricketer Herman de Zoete. 

The Duchess of Gloucester served as Colonel-in-Chief or deputy Colonel-in-Chief of a dozen regiments in the British Army, including the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, the Northamptonshire Regiment, the 2nd East Anglian Regiment (Duchess of Gloucester&#x27;s Own Royal Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire), the Royal Anglian Regiment, the Royal Hussars, and the Royal Irish Rangers (27th Inniskilling); also, the Royal Corps of Transport. She was Patron of the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust and from 1940 until her death Patron of Queen Margaret College in Edinburgh.

In 1965, while returning from Winston Churchill&#x27;s funeral in their vehicle, the Duke suffered a stroke, which resulted in a car crash, with the Duke being thrown out of the car and the Duchess &quot;suffering facial injuries&quot;. On the occasion she wrote: &quot;I was sitting beside him to grab the wheel or put my foot on the brake if he fell asleep and lost control, but on that occasion I must have dozed off myself. Apparently the Rolls swerved off the road (and) ended upside down in a field of cabbages. Prince Henry had luckily been thrown through the open door...into (stinging) nettles and brambles&quot;.

In 1972, the Duchess&#x27;s elder son, Prince William, was killed in a plane crash while participating in an amateur air show race. Her husband was in such poor health at the time of their son&#x27;s death that the Duchess hesitated whether to tell him, later admitting in her memoirs that she did not but that he may have learned of William&#x27;s death from television coverage. The Duke of Gloucester died on 10 June 1974 at the age of 74.

==Later life==
In 1975, Princess Alice was the first woman to be appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. In 1981, she first published her memoirs under the title &quot;The Memoirs of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.&quot; In 1991, she released a revised edition as &quot;Memories of Ninety Years&quot;.

In 1994, after the Gloucesters had to give up Barnwell Manor for financial reasons, Alice moved from Barnwell to Kensington Palace, where she lived with the current Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. She officially retired from public duties at the age of 98. In 1999, the Duke issued a press release announcing that due to physical frailty, his mother would no longer carry out public engagements outside the environs of Kensington Palace. In July 2000, the Duke said in another statement that his mother had become &quot;increasingly forgetful&quot;.

In December 2001, the royal family held a ceremony to acknowledge Princess Alice&#x27;s 100th birthday. This was Princess Alice&#x27;s last public appearance (as well as the last public appearance of Princess Margaret, the Queen&#x27;s younger sister, who died on 9 February 2002). On the death of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at age 101 in March 2002, Princess Alice became the oldest living member of the British royal family. On 21 August 2003, Princess Alice surpassed the Queen Mother&#x27;s record as the oldest person in the history of the British royal family by reaching the age of 101 years and 238 days. On 20 September 2003, at the age of 101 years and 269 days, she was certified by Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s longest-lived royal of all time, surpassing Leonilla, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn.

==Death==
On the evening of 29 October 2004, Princess Alice died in her sleep from heart failure at Kensington Palace, at the age of 102 years and 309 days. Following her death, the Union Jack flew at half-mast at Buckingham Palace. Her funeral was held on 5 November 2004 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, and she was interred next to her husband, Prince Henry, and her elder son, Prince William, in the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore. The funeral was attended by Elizabeth II and other members of the British royal family. A memorial service was held at St Clement Danes on 2 February 2005, which was attended by her son and his family and representatives of organisations Princess Alice was involved in; the service was co-ordinated by the Royal Air Force in respect of Princess Alice&#x27;s role as Commandant-in-Chief WRAF.

Contrary to royal tradition, Alice&#x27;s will was not sealed after her death. Her estate was valued at .

==Legacy==
Hugo Vickers called Princess Alice &quot;a very private person who was not widely known to the general public&quot; despite being the third-highest-ranking lady in the royal family at the time of her marriage. 

It was well known she disliked large parties. Peter Townsend said of her: &quot;She possessed classic, serene good looks and sincerity shone from her mild face. But she was painfully shy, so that conversation with her was sometimes halting and unrewarding, for you felt that she had so much more to say, but could not bring herself to say it.&quot; Alice herself wrote in her autobiography: &quot;I was very shy and rather plump, ... I made a miserable debut at a dance at Windsor for Princess Mary&#x27;s birthday, uncomfortably squeezed into a white satin frock.&quot;

Although generally a woman of few and soft-spoken words, Princess Alice was known for her dry humour. Soon after her marriage, when the couple moved to York House, they were warned that the drawing-room floor would not stand the weight of more than twenty people. &quot;So we made a party list,&quot; recalled the Duchess many years later, &quot;of the twenty-one people whom we disliked most.&quot;
The Queen Mother said of Princess Alice after her son&#x27;s death in an air crash in 1972: &quot;The tragic accident was a great shock to all the family, but I feel desperately for his dear little mother. She has the courage of a lion, and has suffered so many cruel blows in the past few years...&quot;. Alice herself later admitted that following her son&#x27;s death &quot;I was completely stunned and have never quite been the same since&quot;.

*10 June 1974 – 29 October 2004: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester

On 10 June 1974, Prince Henry died, and was succeeded as Duke of Gloucester by their second son, Prince Richard (the couple&#x27;s elder son, Prince William, had been killed in an aeroplane crash in 1972). As a widow, she requested permission from her niece the Queen to use the title and style &quot;HRH&quot; Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, instead of adopting &quot;HRH&quot; The Dowager Duchess of Gloucester. The Queen allowed her aunt to adopt this title, in part to avoid confusion with her daughter-in-law, the new Duchess of Gloucester (formerly Birgitte van Deurs Henriksen).

<text>Ryan Clark Crocker (born June 19, 1949) is a retired American diplomat who served as a career ambassador within the United States Foreign Service. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he served as United States ambassador to Afghanistan (2011–2012), Iraq (2007–2009), Pakistan (2004–2007), Syria (1998–2001), Kuwait (1994–1997), and Lebanon (1990–1993). In January 2010, he became dean of Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s George Bush School of Government and Public Service.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell called Crocker &quot;one of our very best foreign service officers.&quot; President George W. Bush called him &quot;America&#x27;s Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and noted that General David Petraeus had said that &quot;it was a great honor for me to be his military wingman.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Crocker was born in Spokane, Washington. Growing up, he had family members in the U.S. Air Force and in Turkey. He lived in Morocco, Canada and Turkey. Crocker attended University College Dublin and Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, where he received a bachelor of arts in English literature in 1971 and is a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

== Career ==

=== Diplomatic posts ===
After graduating from college, he joined the United States Foreign Service, and after Persian language training, was assigned to the American consulate in Khorramshahr, Iran, in 1972. His subsequent assignment was to the newly established embassy in Doha, Qatar, in 1974 as an economic-commercial officer, and in 1976, Crocker returned to Washington, D.C., for long-term Arabic training. He completed the 20-month program at the Foreign Service Institutes Arabic School in Tunis in June 1978. Crocker was then assigned as chief of the economic-commercial section at the U.S. interests section in Baghdad, Iraq. Crocker served in Beirut, Lebanon, as chief of the political section from 1981 to 1984. On September 18, 1982, he reported back to the Department of State about the Sabra and Shatila massacre. He also survived the 1983 United States Embassy bombing.

He spent the 1984–85 academic year at Princeton University as a State Department mid-career fellow in Near Eastern studies. He served as deputy director of the Office of Israel and Arab–Israeli affairs from 1985 to 1987 and was a political counselor at the American Embassy in Cairo from 1987 to 1990. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Crocker became the director of the Iraq–Kuwait Task Force.

In 1998, as the ambassador to Syria, his residence was plundered by an angry mob.

In the days after the 9/11 attacks, Crocker and other senior U.S. State Department officials flew to Geneva to meet secretly with representatives of the government of Iran. For several months, Crocker and his Iranian counterparts under Major General Qasem Soleimani cooperated on capturing Al Qaeda operatives in the region and fighting the Taliban government in Afghanistan. These meetings stopped after President George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech hardened Iranian attitudes toward cooperating with the U.S.

In January 2002, he was appointed interim chargé d&#x27;affaires to the new government of Afghanistan, and was confirmed as the ambassador to Pakistan in October 2004. In September 2004, President Bush nominated for and appointed him to the diplomatic rank of career ambassador, the highest rank in the Foreign Service, equivalent to a four-star flag officer in the U.S. military. On January 8, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced that the Bush administration would nominate Crocker as U.S. ambassador to Iraq, replacing Zalmay Khalilzad, once Khalilzad&#x27;s confirmation as ambassador to the UN was complete. Before leaving Islamabad, Crocker joined Pakistani journalist Ahmed Quraishi in a farewell TV interview on state-run PTV, where he opened up about his experiences in Iraq and the Middle East. Crocker used the occasion to share an incident involving then Vice President Dick Cheney during a short surprise visit to Pakistan in February 2007.

On December 4, 2009, the Bush School of Government and Public Service announced the appointment of Crocker as its next dean, effective January 25, 2010.

Although retired from the State Department and the Foreign Service, Crocker was called upon by the Obama administration and nominated by President Barack Obama in April 2011 to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan. The appointment was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on June 30, 2011. In July 2012 he stepped down, as announced in May due to unspecified health reasons. When he stepped down, Crocker was named an Honorary Marine by the United States Marine Corps.

In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate degree from the American University of Afghanistan.

On May 10, 2013, he was nominated to serve as a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

In December 2013, he voiced his opinion that America should quietly work with the Syrian government, despite its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, as a lesser of the evils.

In October 2020, Crocker received the Sylvanus Thayer Award presented by the United States Military Academy&#x27;s Association of Graduates for exemplifying personal devotion West Point&#x27;s motto, &quot;duty, honor, country.&quot;

In December 2024, Texas A&amp;M awarded Crocker with an honorary doctoral degree for Public Service Excellence. 

===2002 memo concerning Iraq===
According to the book, &quot;Soldier: The Life of Colin Powell&quot; by &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Karen DeYoung, as the Bush administration was preparing for war with Iraq in late 2002, then-Secretary of State, Colin Powell ordered Crocker and then–special assistant to the secretary of state, William J. Burns, to prepare a secret memo examining the risks associated with a U.S. invasion of Iraq. The six-page memo, titled &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, stated that toppling Saddam Hussein could unleash long-repressed sectarian and ethnic tensions, that the Sunni minority would not easily relinquish power, and those powerful neighbors such as Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia would try to move in to influence events. It also cautioned that the United States would have to start from scratch in building a political and economic system because Iraq&#x27;s infrastructure was in tatters.

===Testimony before U.S. Congress===
On September 10, 2007, Crocker and Commander of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq David H. Petraeus testified before the U.S. House of Representatives about the status of the Iraq war. Similar testimony was given on the following day to the U.S. Senate. In their &quot;Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq&quot;, Crocker stated that &quot;It is no exaggeration to say that Iraq is, and will remain for some time, a traumatized society.&quot;

Regarding the politics of Iraq, he said, &quot;In many respects, the debates currently occurring in Iraq--de-Baathification and provincial powers--are akin to those surrounding our civil rights movement or struggle over states rights.&quot; He also said, &quot;I do believe that Iraq&#x27;s leaders have the will to tackle the country&#x27;s pressing problems, although it will take longer than we originally anticipated because of the environment and the gravity of the issues before them.&quot; Crocker argued that &quot;a secure, stable democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors is attainable.&quot;

== Personal life ==
On August 14, 2012, he was arrested in Spokane Valley, Washington, for driving while intoxicated and leaving an automobile accident scene. In November he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving. During court proceedings, it was stated that Crocker had been administered two blood alcohol tests after the accident, with the results of .160 and .152 percent, both exceeding the legal limit of .08. In addition, Crocker&#x27;s attorney indicated that at the time of the accident, he had recently undergone brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma, which might have negatively affected his cognitive abilities. Crocker was sentenced to a thirty-day suspension of his driver&#x27;s license, a $1,000 fine, and 24 months of probation. In addition, he was required to make restitution for the damage he caused to the other vehicle involved in the accident.

==Honors==
Crocker has received a Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 1994, the State Department Secretary&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award in 2008 and 2012, the Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Awards in 1997 and 2008, and the Defense Distinguished Public Service Award in 2012. He also holds the State Department Distinguished Honor Award, Award for Valor, three Superior Honor Awards, and the American Foreign Service Association Rivkin Award.

<text>Drøbak is a town and the centre of the municipality of Frogn, in Akershus county, Norway. The city is located along the Oslofjord, and has 13,409 inhabitants.

== History ==
Drøbak and Frogn was established as a parish on its own through a royal decree on 8 September 1823. It had been a part of Ås parish.

Drøbak was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It was merged with Frogn on 1 January 1962.

Traditionally, Drøbak was the winter harbour of Norway&#x27;s capital, Oslo, since in severe winters the fjord will freeze from outside Drøbak all the way up to Oslo. It had city status between 1842 and 1962, upon which point the municipality was merged into the rural municipality Frogn and lost its city status. The city status was regained by the municipality council on 13 February 2006. It was also decided that adjacent villages such as Heer would be included within the city.

A notable event in Drøbak&#x27;s history is the World War II sinking of the German cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot; in the Drøbak narrows (only 1 mile (1.5 km) wide), on the early morning of 9 April 1940. The cruiser was transporting German soldiers and bureaucrats for the planned swift occupation of Oslo, but the Battle of Drøbak Sound, resulting in the sinking by the Oscarsborg fortress delayed this, and thus allowed for the evacuation of the Norwegian royal family, parliament, and cabinet, and for the nation&#x27;s gold reserves to be denied the occupiers.

From early on Drøbak had ferries that crossed the fjord, in modern times it has largely been replaced by the Oslofjordtunnel. However, some of the old ferries are still used as &quot;floating restaurants&quot; during the summer.

== Tourism ==
In summertime, cruise ships visit Oslo almost every day. Often, as many as four or five cruise ships visit each day, in addition to all the regular traffic, it has made Drøbak a popular sea-side tourist spot. However, the numerous restaurants, art galleries and mild summers are probably more important factors for visiting tourists.

Drøbak is also known for its many art galleries. The town has a Christmas shop called Julehuset (the Christmas house), and letters often end up in Drøbak from Europe similarly to how they end up in Santa Claus, Indiana in the United States.

During the summer months, there are tourist buses going from Oslo to Drøbak on day trips for tourists. Visitors can experience a traditional Norwegian fjord town. It is also a popular Oslo suburb for citizens to live in as public transportation is well connected between Drøbak and Oslo, both by bus and boat.

In the marina at the approach to Drøbak is a sculpture, made by Reidar Finsrud, cast in bronze of three mermaids sitting on a rock. The sculpture was unveiled in 1999.


lfish is open to the public and shows live video footage of the sea life in the fjord where fish, lobster and crab are often visible for the aquarium visitors. Norsk Luftambulanse used to have its headquarters in Drøbak.

==Etymology==
The Norse form of the name was &quot;Drjúgbakki&quot;. The first element is &quot;drjúgr&quot; &#x27;hard; long&#x27;, the last element is &quot;bakki&quot; m &#x27;(up)hill&#x27;.
This is related to the very steep roads winding down into the city centre of Drøbak.

==Drøbak Church==
Drøbak Church (&quot;Drøbak Kirke&quot;) is located in Drøbak parish in the Søndre Follo deanery within the Diocese of Borg. The church was opened on 29 October 1776. The church was a gift from timber merchant, landowner and shipowner Niels Carlsen (1734–1809) and his wife Martha Zachariassen (1743–1821). Significant repairs were made to the church in the 1820s. Domenico Erdmann (1879–1940) led the restoration in conjunction with the 150th anniversary in 1926.

==Places==

Drøbak is divided into eight notable areas. These places include:

*Gylteåsen, which mainly consists of cabins and &quot;season-housing&quot;.
*Husvik, where most of the year-round boats are kept. This area was also significant in the sinking of the German cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot; in 1940, as the location of the Husvik Battery of Oscarsborg Fortress. The guns of the battery are still in place in these hills as tourist attractions.
*Sentrum (city centre), here lies &quot;Julehuset&quot; and most of the local stores. Most of the city centre is protected by local laws as &quot;Verneverdig&quot; which in short means that it has a significant cultural value and cannot be changed or rebuilt. Therefore, much of the city centre looks like it did 100 years ago.
*Skiphelle and Elleflaten, an area consisting of suburban housing and a former hotel called &quot;Drøbak Fjordhotell&quot;.
*Sogsti and Ullerud, consisting much of Drøbak&#x27;s suburban housing.
*Odalen and Haveråsen is the &quot;outer banks&quot; of Drøbak, where the housing and population is more agricultural in nature.
*Belsjø and Heer, the suburban housing around the large golf course surrounding most of northern Drøbak.
*Skorkeberg and Dyrløkke, a large hill of suburban housing. In this area the local mall Drøbak City and a high school is located.

<text>Las Posadas is a &quot;novenario&quot; (an extended devotional prayer). It is celebrated chiefly in Latin America, El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and by Latin Americans in the United States. It is typically celebrated each year between December 16 and December 24. Latin American countries have continued to celebrate the holiday, with very few changes to the tradition.

==Etymology==
&quot;Las Posadas&quot; derives from the Spanish word &quot;posada&quot; (&quot;lodging&quot;, or &quot;accommodation&quot;) which, in this case, refers to the inn from the Nativity story. It uses the plural form as the celebration lasts for a nine-day interval (called the &quot;novena&quot;) during the Christmas season, which represents the nine-month pregnancy of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ.

==History==

This celebration has been a Mexican tradition for over 430 years, starting in 1586. Many Mexican holidays include dramatizations of original events, a tradition which has its roots in the ritual of Bible plays used to teach religious doctrine to a largely illiterate population in 10th- and 11th-century Europe. The plays lost favor with the Church and were eventually banned as they became popular through the addition of folk music and other non-religious elements; they were reintroduced in the 16th century by two Spanish saints as the Christmas pageant — a new kind of religious ceremony to accompany the Christmas holiday.

In Mexico, the winter solstice festival was one of the most important celebrations of the year that came on December 12 according to the Julian calendar used by the Spanish until 1582. According to the Aztec calendar, Tonantzin (the mother of the gods) was celebrated on the winter solstice, and she is still feted on December 12, while their most important deity, the sun god Huitzilopochtli&quot;,&quot; was born during the month of December (panquetzaliztli). The parallel in time between this native celebration and the celebration of Christmas lent itself to an almost-seamless merging of the two holidays. Seeing the opportunity to proselytize, Spanish missionaries brought the reinvented religious pageant to Mexico where they used it to teach the story of Jesus&#x27; birth. In 1586, Friar Diego de Soria obtained a Papal bull from Pope Sixtus V, stating that a Christmas mass should be observed throughout Mexico on the nine days preceding Christmas Day.

While its roots are in Catholicism, Protestant Latinos also follow the tradition.

==Re-enactment==
Two people dress up as Mary and Joseph and certain houses are designated to be &quot;inns&quot;; the head of the procession carries a candle inside a paper shade. The actors travel to one house each night for nine nights. At each house, the resident responds by singing a song and the pair are recognized and allowed to enter; the group of guests come into the home and kneel around the Nativity scene to pray (typically, the Rosary). The final location may be a church instead of a home.

Individuals may play the various parts of Mary (María) and Joseph (José), with the expectant mother riding a real donkey, attendants such as angels and shepherds joining along the way, or pilgrims who may carry images of the holy personages instead, while children may carry poinsettias. The procession is followed by musicians, with the entire procession singing posadas such as pedir posada. At the end of each night, Christmas carols are sung, children break open star-shaped piñatas and everyone sits for a feast. The piñatas used during the holiday are traditionally made out of clay.

==Regional variations==
One event in Portland, Oregon, finishes with Santa Claus and Christmas gifts donated to needy children.

A large procession has been held since 1966 along the San Antonio River Walk. It traverses large landmarks in San Antonio, Texas, including the Arneson River Theater, Museo Alameda, and the Spanish Governor&#x27;s Palace, ending at the Cathedral of San Fernando.

In the Philippines, the tradition of &quot;Las Posadas&quot; is illustrated by the Panunulúyan pageant; sometimes it is performed immediately before the Misa de Gallo (Midnight Mass) and sometimes on each of the nine nights. The main difference, compared to Mexico, is that actors are used for Mary and Joseph instead of statues and sing the requests for accommodation. The lines of the &quot;innkeepers&quot; are also often sung, but sometimes these respond without singing. Another difference is that the lyrics are not in Spanish but in a Philippine language.

In Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador, families and friends gather from the 16th to the 24th of December to pray the Novena de Aguinaldos.

<doc id="194011" wikidata="Q746070" url="?curid=194011" title="Cooke triplet">
<text>The Cooke triplet is a photographic lens designed and patented in 1893 by Dennis Taylor who was employed as chief engineer by T. Cooke &amp; Sons of York. It was the first lens system that allowed the elimination of most of the optical distortion or aberration at the outer edge of the image.

The &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; is noted for being able to correct the five Seidel aberrations. The compound lens design consists of three air-spaced simple lens elements: two biconvex (positive) lenses surrounding a biconcave (negative) lens in the middle. It is one of the most important objective designs in the history of photography.

==Design==

According to Taylor, the lens design was derived by considering a cemented achromatic doublet consisting of one thin negative element and one thin positive element, both of equal power; such a doublet would result in a compound lens with zero net power but also a flat field of focus. However, by separating the elements, the resulting air gap would act as an additional lens element, giving the system a positive overall power while retaining the flat-field characteristic. To correct the oblique aberrations, Taylor recommended splitting one element and mounting them on either side of the remaining element; although he patented versions in which either the negative or positive element was split, in his preferred embodiment, he split the positive element.

A &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; comprises a negative flint glass element in the centre with a positive crown glass element on each side. In this design, the Petzval sum is zero, so the field of focus is flat. In other words, the negative lens can be as strong as the outer two combined, when one measures in dioptres, yet the lens will converge light, because the rays strike the middle element close to the optical axis. The curvature of field is determined by the sum of the dioptres, but the focal length is not.

===Impact and production===
At the time, the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; was a major advancement in lens design. For one wavelength, the design can correct, using only three elements, spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, field curvature, and distortion. However, Kingslake noted &quot;there is no symmetry to help the designer, and there is no control over distortion&quot;, leading to a trial-and-error design process. It was surpassed by later designs in high-end cameras, including the double Gauss design, but is still widely used in inexpensive cameras, including variations using aspheric elements, particularly in cell-phone cameras.
T. Cooke &amp; Sons were reluctant to manufacture the lens, possibly because of the difficulty in grinding the strong central negative element, and the design was licensed to Taylor, Taylor and Hobson, who named the product the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot;.

Starting from the early 1900s, the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; was adopted by other major optical lens manufacturers and were produced for many decades.

===Further development===

Arthur Cox noted that anastigmat lenses were &quot;almost exclusively, the logical development of two main types, the symmetrical lens, and the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; of &quot;H. D. Taylor.&quot;&quot; One of the first derivatives was the Voigtländer &quot;Heliar&quot;, developed by Hans Harting in 1900 as a symmetrical modification of the original &quot;Cooke triplet&quot;. Harting continued to develop the lens, resulting in the &quot;Dynar&quot; (1903), whose design was later adopted as a new version of the &quot;Heliar&quot; after World War I. Anecdotal evidence indicates that a &quot;Heliar&quot; was used to take official portraits of Emperor Hirohito. Although the contemporary Zeiss &quot;Tessar&quot; (1902) is said to be a development of the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot;, it is more accurately considered a parallel development descended from earlier, four-element designs by Paul Rudolph, including the &quot;Protar&quot; and &quot;Unar&quot;.

To increase the lens speed, either the rear element was further split into two, as patented by Edward Bausch in 1900 and H.W. Lee as the &quot;Speedic&quot; in 1924, or a positive meniscus element was inserted into the front air space, as in Ludwig Bertele&#x27;s enduring &quot;Ernostar&quot; and &quot;Sonnar&quot; designs for Ernemann and Carl Zeiss AG, respectively.

Several of the early lenses used with the Leica camera were derived from the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; by splitting one or more of the three elements into a cemented doublet, including the &quot;Elmar&quot;, &quot;Elmarit&quot;, &quot;Hektor&quot;, and &quot;Thambar&quot;.

== Application ==
Binoculars as well as refracting telescopes often use triplets. The same holds for many projection lenses, e.g., for 35 mm slide projectors.

Rudolf Kingslake notes the &quot;Hologon&quot; is a triplet in which the negative element was split to surround a positive element.

The Cooke triplet has provided the basis for additional designs, including a derivative with five lens elements.

Necker was labelled an &quot;author of the revolution&quot; by Napoleon.

===The Coup d&#x27;État of November 9–10===

* November 9: The coup d&#x27;état of 18 Brumaire begins. French troops loyal to Bonaparte occupy key points in Paris. Lucien Bonaparte, the president of the Council of Five Hundred, warns the deputies that a &quot;terrorist&quot; plot against the legislature has been discovered, and asks that the meetings of the Councils, scheduled for the next day, be moved for their security to the château of Saint-Cloud, some 10 kilometers west of Paris. Bonaparte is named Commander-in-chief of the army in Paris.
* As agreed in advance, two members of the Directory who are complicit in the coup, Sieyès and Ducos, offer their resignation. A third, Barras, is talked into resigning by Talleyrand. The two Jacobin directors, Gohier and Moulin, are arrested by the soldiers of General Moreau and confined at the Luxembourg Palace. Fouché proposes to arrest the leading Jacobin members of the Council of Five Hundred, but Bonaparte does not feel it is necessary, which proves to be a mistake. By the end of the day, Paris is entirely under the control of Bonaparte and officers loyal to him.
*November 10: As proposed by Bonaparte, the members of the two Councils are transported to the château of Saint-Cloud. 6,000 soldiers have been assembled by Bonaparte there, soldiers who are largely hostile to the Councils because of delays in their pay.
* Bonaparte speaks first to the Council of the Ancients, explaining the need for a change in government. The upper Council listens in silence and votes without opposition to accept Bonaparte&#x27;s proposal. Bonaparte then addresses the Council of Five Hundred, meeting in the &quot;orangerie&quot; of the domain of Saint-Cloud. Here his reception is much different: the Jacobin members protest angrily, insult and shout down Bonaparte, threatening to declare him outside the law, which would have led to his immediate arrest. While the Council debated in great confusion inside, Lucien Bonaparte takes Bonaparte outside, and tells the waiting soldiers that the deputies had tried to assassinate Bonaparte. The soldiers, furious, invade the meeting hall and chase out the deputies at the point of bayonets. In the absence of the opposition deputies, two parliamentary commissions name Bonaparte, Sieyès and Duclos as the provisional consuls of a new government.
* November 11–22: Bonaparte and the two other Provisional Consuls form a new government, Berthier as minister of War, Talleyrand in charge of foreign relations, Fouché as minister of Police, and Cambacérès as minister of Justice. 
* December 1: Bonaparte rejects a constitution proposed by Sieyès. 
* December 24: The Councils, now firmly under the control of Bonaparte, adopt the Constitution of the Year VIII. The new Consulate is formally established, with Bonaparte as First Consul, Cambacérès as Second Consul, and Charles-François Lebrun as Third Consul. Traditional histories mark this date as the end of the French Revolution .

<text>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (; RPI) is a private research university in Troy, New York, United States. It is the oldest technological university in the English-speaking world and the Western Hemisphere. It was established in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer and Amos Eaton for the &quot;application of science to the common purposes of life&quot;.

Built on a hillside, RPI&#x27;s campus overlooks the city of Troy and the Hudson River. The institute operates an on‑campus business incubator and the Rensselaer Technology Park.

RPI is organized into six main schools which contain 37 departments, with emphasis on science and technology. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity&quot;.

== History ==
===1824–1900===


Stephen Van Rensselaer established the Rensselaer School on 5 November 1824 with a letter to the Reverend Dr. Samuel Blatchford, in which Van Rensselaer asked Blatchford to serve as the first president. Within the letter he set down several orders of business. He appointed Amos Eaton as the school&#x27;s first senior professor and appointed the first board of trustees. The school opened on Monday, 5 January 1825 at the Old Bank Place, a building at the north end of Troy. Tuition was around $40 per semester (equivalent to $800 in 2012). The fact that the school attracted students from as far as Ohio and Pennsylvania is attributed to the reputation of Eaton. Fourteen months of successful trial led to the incorporation of the school on 21 March 1826 by the state of New York. In its early years, the Rensselaer School strongly resembled a graduate school more than it did a college, drawing graduates from many older institutions.

Under Eaton, the Rensselaer School, renamed the Rensselaer Institute in 1832, was a small but vibrant center for technological research. The first civil engineering degrees in the United States were granted by the school in 1835, and many of the best remembered civil engineers of that time graduated from the school. Important visiting scholars included Joseph Henry, who had previously studied under Amos Eaton, and Thomas Davenport, who sold the world&#x27;s first working electric motor to the institute.

In 1847 alumnus Benjamin Franklin Greene became the new senior professor. Earlier he had done a thorough study of European technical schools to see how Rensselaer could be improved. In 1850 he reorganized the school into a three-year polytechnic institute with six technical schools. In 1861 the name was changed to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. A severe conflagration of 10 May 1862, known as &quot;The Great Fire&quot;, destroyed more than 507 buildings in Troy and gutted in the heart of the city. The &quot;Infant School&quot; building that housed the institute at the time was destroyed in this fire. Columbia University proposed that Rensselaer leave Troy altogether and merge with its New York City campus. Ultimately, the proposal was rejected, and the campus left the crowded downtown for the hillside. Classes were temporarily held at the Vail House and in the Troy University building until 1864, when the institute moved to a building on Broadway on 8th Street, now the site of the Approach.

One of the first Latino student organizations in the United States was founded at RPI in 1890. The Club Hispano Americano was established by the international Latin American students that attended the institute at this time.

===Since 1900===
In 1904 the institute was for the fourth time devastated by fire, when its main building was completely destroyed. However, RPI underwent a period of academic and resource expansion under the leadership of President Palmer Ricketts. Named president in 1901, Ricketts liberalized the curriculum by adding the Department of Arts, Science, and Business Administration, in addition to the Graduate School. He also expanded the university&#x27;s resources and developed RPI into a true polytechnic institute by increasing the number of degrees offered from two to twelve; these included electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, chemistry, and physics. During Rickett&#x27;s tenure, enrollment increased from approximately 200 in 1900 to a high of 1,700 in 1930.

Another period of expansion occurred following World War II as returning veterans used their GI Bill education benefits to attend college. The &quot;Freshman Hill&quot; residence complex was opened in 1953 followed by the completion of the Commons Dining Hall in 1954, two more halls in 1958, and three more in 1968. In this same time frame (1966) Herta Regina Leng was appointed as RPI&#x27;s first female full professor. She is now honored there with an annual lecture series. In 1961, there was major progress in academics at the institute with the construction of the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator, then the most powerful in the world, and the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center. The current Student Union building was opened in 1967.

The next three decades brought continued growth with many new buildings (see &#x27;Campus&#x27; below), and growing ties to industry. The &quot;H-building&quot;, previously used for storage, became the home for the RPI incubator program, the first such program sponsored solely by a university. Shortly after this, RPI decided to invest $3 million in pavement, water and power on around of land it owned south of campus to create the Rensselaer Technology Park. In 1982 the New York State legislature granted RPI $30 million to build the George M. Low Center for Industrial Innovation, a center for industry-sponsored research and development.

In 1999, RPI gained attention when it was one of the first universities to implement a mandatory laptop computer program. This was also the year of the arrival of Shirley Ann Jackson, a former chairperson of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under U.S. President Bill Clinton, as the eighteenth president of RPI. She instituted &quot;The Rensselaer Plan&quot; (discussed below), an ambitious plan to revitalize the institute. Many advances have been made under the plan, and Jackson has enjoyed the ongoing support of the RPI Board of Trustees. However, her leadership style did not sit well with many faculty; on 26 April 2006, RPI faculty voted 149 to 155 in a failed vote of no-confidence in Jackson. In September 2007, RPI&#x27;s Faculty Senate was suspended for over four years over conflict with the administration. In 2011, the college was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors &quot;for infringement of governance standards&quot;.

On 3 October 2008, RPI celebrated the opening of the $220 million Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center. That same year the national economic downturn resulted in the elimination of 98 staff positions across the institute, about five percent of the workforce. Campus construction expansion continued, however, with the completion of the $92 million East Campus Athletic Village and opening of the new Blitman Commons residence hall in 2009. As of 2015, all staff positions had been reinstated at the institute, experiencing significant growth from pre-recession levels and contributing over $1 billion annually to the economy of the Capital District. That same year, renovation of the North Hall, E-Complex, and Quadrangle dormitories began and was later completed in 2016 to house one of the largest incoming classes in Rensselaer&#x27;s history. In 2022, Rensselaer hosted a incoming class size of 2,110 students, the largest class size in Rensselaer&#x27;s history. 

In July 2022, Martin A. Schmidt, formerly provost of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, became RPI&#x27;s nineteenth president.

RPI&#x27;s campus sits upon a hill overlooking Troy and the Hudson River. The surrounding area is mostly residential neighborhoods, with the city of Troy lying at the base of the hill. The campus is bisected by 15th Street, with most of the athletic and housing facilities to the east, and the academic buildings to the west. A footbridge spans the street, linking the two halves. Much of the campus features a series of Colonial Revival style structures built in the first three decades of the 20th century. Overall, the campus has enjoyed four periods of expansion.

===1824–1905===
RPI was originally located in downtown Troy, but gradually moved to the hilltop that overlooks the city. Buildings that remain from this time include Winslow Chemical Laboratory, a building on the National Register of Historic Places. Located at the base of the hill on the western edge of campus, it currently houses the Social and Behavioral Research Laboratory.

===Ricketts Campus, 1906–1935===

President Palmer Ricketts supervised the construction of the school&#x27;s &quot;Green Rooftop&quot; Colonial Revival buildings that give much of the campus a distinct architectural style. Buildings constructed during this period include the Carnegie Building (1906), Walker Laboratory (1907), Russell Sage Laboratory (1909), Pittsburgh Building (1912), Quadrangle Dormitories (1916–1927), Troy Building (1925), Amos Eaton Hall (1928), Greene Building (1931) and Ricketts Building (1935). Also built during this period was &quot;The Approach&quot; (1907), a massive ornate granite staircase found on the west end of campus. Originally linking RPI to the Troy Union Railroad station, it again serves as an important link between the city and the university. In 1906 the &#x27;86 Field, home field of the football team until 2008, was completed with support of the Class of 1886.

===Post-war expansion, 1946–1960===
After World War II, the campus again underwent major expansion. Nine dormitories were built at the east edge of campus bordering Burdett Avenue, a location that came to be called &quot;Freshman Hill&quot;. The Houston Field House (1949) was reassembled, after being moved in pieces from its original Rhode Island location. West Hall, which was originally built in 1869 as a hospital, was acquired by the institute in 1953. The ornate building is an example of French Second Empire architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Another unique building is the Voorhees Computing Center (VCC). Originally the St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary chapel, it was built in 1933 and acquired by Rensselaer in 1958, and after renovation served as the institute&#x27;s library from 1960 until the completion of the new Folsom Library, in 1976. The Folsom Library, located adjacent to the computing center, has a concrete exterior that was designed to harmonize with the light gray brick of the chapel; architecturally, it is an example of the modern brutalist style. Subsequently, the university was unsure of what to do with the chapel, or whether to keep it at all, but in 1979 decided to preserve it and renovate it to house computer labs and facilities to support the institute&#x27;s computing initiatives. Today the VCC serves as the backbone for the institute&#x27;s data and telephony infrastructure.

===Modern campus, since 1961===
The modern campus features the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center (J-ROWL) (1961), Materials Research Center (MRC) (1965), Rensselaer Union (1967), Cogswell Laboratory (1971), Darrin Communications Center (DCC) (1973), Jonsson Engineering Center (JEC) (1977), Low Center for Industrial Innovation (CII) (1987), a public school building which was converted into Academy Hall (1990), and the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (2004). Tunnels connect the Low Center, DCC, JEC and Science Center. A tenth dormitory named Barton Hall was added to Freshman Hill in August 2000, featuring the largest rooms available for freshmen.

On 3 October 2008, the university celebrated the grand opening of the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) situated on the west edge of campus. The building was constructed on the precipice of the hill, with the main entrance on top. Upon entering, elevated walkways lead into a 1,200-seat concert hall. Most of the building is encased in a glass exoskeleton, with an atrium-like space between it and the &quot;inner building&quot;. Adjacent to and underneath the main auditorium there is a 400-seat theater, offices, and two black-box studios with to ceilings. Originally budgeted for $50 million, the EMPAC construction costs ballooned to over $200 million due to difficulty of anchoring the foundation in the soft clay of the hill.

In 2008, RPI announced the purchase of the former Rensselaer Best Western Inn, located at the base of the hill, along with plans to transform it into a new residence hall. After extensive renovations, the residence hall was dedicated on 15 May 2009, as the Howard N. Blitman, P.E. &#x27;50 Residence Commons. It houses about 300 students in 148 rooms and includes a fitness center, dining hall, and conference area. The new residence hall is part of a growing initiative to involve students in the Troy community and help revitalize the downtown. RPI owns and operates three office buildings in downtown Troy, the Rice and Heley buildings and the historic W. &amp; L.E. Gurley Building. RPI also owns the Proctor&#x27;s Theater building in Troy, which was purchased in 2004, with the intention of converting it into office space. As of 2011, Rensselaer had signed an agreement with Columbia Development Companies to acquire both Proctor&#x27;s Theatre and Chasan Building in Troy and launch a redevelopment.

===Other campuses and online programs===
The institute ran a campus in Hartford, Connecticut, and a distance learning center in Groton, Connecticut, the latter of which was closed in 2018. The Hartford campus was sold in 2023. These centers were used by graduates and working professionals and are now managed by the online branch of RPI, Rensselaer at Work which offers graduate degrees in business, computer science, and engineering. There are also certificate programs and skills training programs for working professionals.

==Academics==

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has five schools: the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, the Lally School of Management &amp; Technology, and the School of Science. The School of Engineering is the largest by enrollment, followed by the School of Science, the School of Management, the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, and the School of Architecture. There also exists an interdisciplinary program in Information Technology that began in the late 1990s, programs in prehealth and prelaw, Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) for students desiring commissions as officers in the armed forces, a program in cooperative education (Co-Op), and domestic and international exchange programs. Altogether, the university offers over 145 programs in nearly 60 fields that lead to bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. In addition to traditional majors, RPI has around a dozen special interdisciplinary programs, such as Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences (GSAS), Design, Innovation, and Society (DIS), Minds &amp; Machines, and Product Design and Innovation (PDI). RPI is a technology-oriented university; all buildings and residence hall rooms have hard-wired and wireless high speed internet access, and all incoming freshmen have been required to have a laptop computer since 1999. 

===Rensselaer Plan===
With the arrival of President Shirley Ann Jackson came the &quot;Rensselaer Plan&quot;, announced in 1999. Its goal is to achieve greater prominence for Rensselaer as a technological research university. Various aspects of the plan include bringing in a larger graduate student population and new research faculty, and increasing participation in undergraduate research, international exchange programs, and &quot;living and learning communities&quot;. So far, there have been a number of changes under the plan: new infrastructure such as the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, and Computational Center for Nanotechnology Innovations (CCNI) have been built to support new programs, and application numbers have increased. In 2018, Rensselaer received a record number of applications: 20,337. According to Jared Cohon in 2006, then-president of Carnegie Mellon University, &quot;Change at Rensselaer in the last five years has occurred with a scope and swiftness that may be without precedent in the recent history of American higher education.&quot;

The university set an initial goal of $100 million annually. Fourteen years later, in FY2013, research expenditures reached this goal. To help raise money, the university mounted a $1 billion capital campaign with a public phase that began in September 2004 and was expected to finish by 2008. In 2001, a major milestone of the campaign was the pledging of an unrestricted gift of $360 million by an anonymous donor, believed to be the largest such gift to a U.S. university at the time. The university had been a relative stranger to such generosity as the prior largest single gift was $15 million. By September 2006, the $1 billion goal has been exceeded much in part to an in-kind contribution of software commercially valued at $513.95 million by the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE). In light of this, the board of trustees increased the goal of the $1 billion capital campaign to $1.4 billion by June 30, 2009. The new goal was met by October 1, 2008.

In anticipation of RPI&#x27;s 200th anniversary, an updated version called the &quot;Rensselaer Plan 2024&quot; was announced in 2012.

In 2016, Jackson announced during the Fall Town Hall Meeting that the institute was in the final stages of organizing a new capital campaign which it would launch in 2017 to meet the goals of the Rensselaer Plan 2024. The goal of the campaign was cited as being primarily for the support of financial aid for undergraduate students and the expansion of on-campus research facilities to accommodate planned increases in doctoral and graduate enrollment. The fundraising goal of the capital campaign was $1 billion, with over $400 million raised prior to the campaign going public.

Ambitious spending on the Rensselaer Plan has led the university into financial difficulties, with its credit rating lowered by several agencies.

===Rankings===
For 2021, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Rensselaer tied for 53rd among national universities in the U.S., 40th out of 180 for &quot;Best Value&quot; in undergraduate education, and tied for 68th out of the top 83 in &quot;Most Innovative Schools&quot;. The same rankings placed Rensselaer&#x27;s undergraduate engineering program tied at 32nd among schools whose highest degree is a doctorate, and its graduate program is ranked tied for 43rd out of 218 engineering schools.

The Leiden Ranking (2016) placed RPI at 127 among the top 900 world universities and research institutions according to the proportion of the top 1% most frequently cited publications of a university. In 2016, &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked Rensselaer No. 18 among four-year non-vocational colleges and universities and Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings placed Rensselaer among the top 50 universities for technology in the world. In 2016, Rensselaer was listed among the top ten universities for highest median earnings.

Civil liberties organization FIRE gave RPI its 2020 &quot;Lifetime Censorship Award&quot; &quot;For its unashamed, years-long record of censoring its critics and utter disinterest in protecting students’ rights&quot;.

=== Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at RPI ===
One of the major departments at RPI is the ECSE department, or Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering department. The department offers students the ability to gain bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in Electrical Engineering, or Computer Systems Engineering. While the school itself was founded in 1824, Electrical Engineering was first introduced to Rensselaer Polytechnic in 1907 with the class of 1911, long before the invention of the first computers but twenty-eight years after the invention of the lightbulb. The department was listed as Physics and Electrical Engineering in 1924 while under President Palmer Ricketts. Computer system engineering was added later. Today Computer Systems Engineering and Electrical Engineering are in many ways similar, with many of the core classes being shared between the two. Electrical Engineering, however tends to focus more on hardware, while computer systems engineering tends to focus on algorithms and systems. Many students take dual majors, the common ones being Electrical Engineering and Computer Systems Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanic Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics, and Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science. Many students in the ECSE department often do minors in other fields such as economics or psychology. The ECSE department currently does research in the areas of information science and systems, communication and network, control and autonomy, energy and power systems, electronics and photonics, and computer systems design. Notable alumni from the ECSE department include James A. Parsons, B. Jayant Baliga, Alan Borck, founder of RLC Electronics, Bruce Carlson, Mukesh Chatter, Allen B. Du Mont, Nariman Farvardin, Peter Hart, inventor of the A* search algorithm, Herman A. Haus, Marcian E. Hoff, creator of the microprocessor, Doug Mercer, who was influential in the field of analog to digital converters, Sean O’Sullivan, Curtis P. Priem, founder of NVIDIA, George Saridis, Steven J. Sassoon, inventor of digital camera, Chauncey Starr, Raymond S. Tomlinson, inventor of e-mail, and Eitan Yudilevich.

==Research and development==

Rensselaer is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;. Rensselaer has established six areas of research as institute priorities: biotechnology, energy and the environment, nanotechnology, computation and information technology, and media and the arts. Research is organized under the Office of the Vice President for Research, Jonathan Dordick. In 2018, Rensselaer operated 34 research centers and maintained annual sponsored research expenditures of $100.8 million.
One of the most recent of Rensselaer&#x27;s research centers is the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, a 218,000 square-foot research facility for fundamental and applied research in biotechnology. The primary target of the research center is biologics, a research priority based on data-driven understanding of proteomics, protein regulation, and gene regulation. It involves using biocatalysis and synthetic biology tools to block or supplement the actions of specific cells or proteins in the immune system. Over the past decade, CBIS has produced over 2,000 peer-reviewed publications with over 30,000 citations and currently employs over 200 scientists and engineers. The center is used primarily to train undergraduate and graduate students, with over 1,000 undergraduates and 200 doctoral students trained. The center has numerous academic and industry partners, including the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. These partnerships have resulted in numerous advances over the last decade through new commercial developments in diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, and regenerative medicine which are a direct result of research at the center. Examples of advancements include the creation of synthetic heparin, antimicrobial coatings, detoxification chemotherapy, on-demand biomedicine, implantable sensors, and 3D cellular array chips.

Rensselaer also hosts the Tetherless World Constellation, a multidisciplinary research institution focused on theories, methods, and applications of the World Wide Web. Research is carried out in three inter-connected themes: Future Web, Semantic Foundations and Xinformatics. At Rensselaer, a constellation is a multidisciplinary team composed of senior and junior faculty members, research scientists, and postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students. The faculty experts for the TWC constellation are James Hendler, Deborah McGuinness and Peter Fox. Faculty alumni of TWC includes Heng Ji (Natural Language Processing). In 2016, the Constellation received a one million dollar grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for continuing work on a novel data visualization platform that will harness and accelerate the analysis of vast amounts of data for the foundation&#x27;s Healthy Birth, Growth, and Development Knowledge Integration initiative.

In conjunction with the constellation, Rensselaer operates the Center for Computational Innovations which is the result of a $100 million collaboration between Rensselaer, IBM, and New York State to further nanotechnology innovations. The center is currently home to the most powerful private-university based supercomputer in the world and its supercomputer is consistently ranked among the most powerful in the world, capable of performing over 1.1 peta-FLOPS. The center&#x27;s main focus is on reducing the cost associated with the development of nanoscale materials and devices, such as those used in the semiconductor industry. The university also utilizes the center for interdisciplinary research in biotechnology, medicine, energy, and other fields. Rensselaer operates a nuclear reactor and testing facility–the only university-run reactor in New York State–as well as the Gaerttner Linear Accelerator, which is currently being upgraded under a $9.44 million grant from the US Department of Energy.

In 2024, Rensselaer, in partnership with IBM, unveiled a new quantum computer on campus, aiming to further quantum computer research for both the university and the New York State area.

Starting December 15th, 2024, Rensselaer unveiled their new intellectual property policy, which granted more freedoms to undergraduates and researchers who use Rensselaer facilities to retain ownership of their work. This came after professor Chulsung Bae sued the school, citing that they licensed his patents to another business.

==Student life==

The students of RPI have created and participate in a variety of clubs and organizations funded by the Student Union. About 170 of these organizations are funded by the Student Union, while another thirty, which consist mostly of political and religious organizations, are self-supporting. In 2006 the &quot;Princeton Review&quot; ranked RPI second for &quot;more to do on campus.&quot; The Union was the last entirely student-run union at a private university in the United States until September 2017.

===Student organizations===
Phalanx is RPI&#x27;s Senior Honor Society. It was founded in 1912, when Edward Dion and the Student Council organized a society to recognize those RPI students who had distinguished themselves among their peers in the areas of leadership, service and devotion to the &quot;alma mater&quot;. It is a fellowship of the most active in student activities and has inducted more than 1,500 members since its founding.

RPI has around twenty intramural sports organizations, many of which are broken down into different divisions based on level of play. Greek organizations compete in them as well as independent athletes. There are also thirty-nine club sports.

Given the university&#x27;s proximity to the Berkshires, Green Mountains and Adirondacks, the Ski Club and the Outing Club are some of the largest groups on campus. The Ski Club offers weekly trips to local ski areas during the winter months, while the Outing Club offers trips on a weekly basis for a variety of activities.

&quot;The Rensselaer Polytechnic&quot; is the student-run weekly newspaper. &quot;The Poly&quot; printed about 7,000 copies each week and distributed them around campus until 2018 when the newspaper switched to online-only distribution due to budget concerns. Although it is the Union club with the largest budget, &quot;The Poly&quot; receives no subsidy from the Union and obtains all funding through the sale of advertisements. There is also a popular student-run magazine called &quot;Statler &amp; Waldorf&quot; which prints on a semesterly basis.

RPI has an improvisational comedy group, Sheer Idiocy, which performs several shows a semester. There are also several music groups ranging from &quot;a cappella&quot; groups such as the rusty pipes, Partial Credit, the Rensselyrics and Duly Noted, to several instrumental groups such as the orchestra, the jazz band and a classical choral group, the Rensselaer Concert Choir.

Another notable organization on campus is WRPI, the campus radio station. WRPI differs from most college radio in that it serves a radius including the greater Albany area. With 10 kW of broadcasting power, WRPI maintains a stronger signal than nearly all college radio stations and some commercial stations. WRPI currently broadcasts on 91.5 FM in the Albany area.
The RPI Players is an on‑campus theater group that was formed in 1929. The Players resided in the Old Gym until 1965 when they moved to their present location at the 15th Street Lounge. This distinctive red shingled building had been a USO hall for the U.S. Army before being purchased by RPI. The Players have staged over 300 productions in its history.

===RPI songs===

There are a number of songs commonly played and sung at RPI events. Notable among them are:
* &quot;The Alma Mater (Here&#x27;s to Old RPI)&quot; – sung at formal events such as commencement and convocation, also played and sung by the Pep Band at hockey and football games, and played daily at noon by the quadrangle bell tower. It was published in the first book of &quot;Songs of Rensselaer&quot; printed in 1913.
* &quot;Hail, Dear Old Rensselaer&quot; – used to be the fight song during the 1960s. It is still played today by the Pep Band at athletic events.
* &quot;All We&#x27;ve Learned at Rensselaer&quot; – sung at the RPI commencement ceremonies by the Rensselyrics. Although the Rensselyrics are an &quot;a cappella&quot; group, this song is accompanied by piano. Each verse or section has a different musical style, several of which are closely based on Billy Joel songs or other popular songs.

===First Year Experience and CLASS programs===
Another notable aspect of student life at RPI is the &quot;First-Year Experience&quot; (FYE) program. Freshman begin their stay at RPI with a week called &quot;Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond&quot; or NRB week. The Office of the First-Year Experience provides several programs that extend to not only freshman, but to all students. These include family weekend, community service days, the Information and Personal Assistance Center (IPAC), and the Community Advocate Program. The FYE program was awarded the 2006 NASPA Excellence Gold Award, in the category of &quot;Enrollment Management, Orientation, Parents, First-Year, Other-Year and related&quot;.

Starting in 2008, the Division of Student Life updated the structure of its residential college model based upon the concept of &quot;Clustered Learning Advocacy and Support for Students&quot; (CLASS), which included a planned requirement for all sophomores to live on campus and to live with special &quot;residence cluster deans&quot;.
The transition to this program began in early 2010 among some resistance from some fraternities and students who had planned to live off campus.

===NROTC===
RPI Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps is an officer accession program hosted at RPI with the goal of developing Midshipmen into commissioned officers into the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The unit consists of students from RPI as well as Union College. The program was officially started at RPI in September 1941, just a few months before the US involvement in WWII. RPI NROTC was part of the V-12 training program that was aimed at increasing the number of total commissioned officers during WWII. It focused on developing officers for the military specializing in technical degrees such as engineering, medicine, and foreign languages. The RPI class of 1945 had a large majority of its student body in the NROTC program with around 70% of the 932 students.

Since 1926, over 75 Naval Officers have attained flag officer rank with a degree from RPI. Besides the US Naval Academy, this is the largest number of flag officers produced from one single institute. RPI NROTC is home to several notable alumni including NASA Astronaut CDR Reid Wiseman and RDML Lewis Combs. RDML Combs is the founder of the Navy Construction Battalion, commonly referred to as the &quot;Seabees,&quot; which plays a crucial role in creating forward deployed bases as well as humanitarian efforts to bring fresh water to underdeveloped communities.

===Grand Marshal and President of the Union===

The positions of Grand Marshal and President of the Union at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are typically awarded (by student vote) to the students who are respected by the student body and are represented by a top hat and a derby hat respectively. While Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has had the position of Grand Marshal (GM) since 1865, the position of President of the Union did not come about until 1890 when the union was developed. However, between 1890 and 1894, there was only a President of the Union, no Grand Marshal. Starting with the 1894–1895 school year, the President of the Union and Grand Marshal ran side by side. The week of voting for said positions is called GM Week, and typically has events on campus for students to do to promote the voting.

The Grand Marshal position is elected by the student body (typically in the spring) and is the highest position a student can hold at RPI. The GM plays a big role in the student government by doing projects, appointing officers, and aiding the general campus community. The first GM was Albert M. Harper, and the current GM as of 2024–2025 is Vivian Rost-Nasshan (158th).

The President of the Union is elected by the student body (typically in the spring). Their main responsibility is to appoint an executive board of 15–20 students (responsible for the Rensselaer Union&#x27;s budget). The executive board is the chief financial body of the Rensselaer Union. They are responsible for preparing and approving the budget for the following fiscal year, keeping track of and distributing union funds, and managing the business affairs with other facilities. In addition to appointing the executive board, they also work closely with the union&#x27;s staff, athletics staff, and student clubs. The first PU was W.C.H. Slagle, and the current as of 2024-2025 is Catherine Philipps (135th).

===Greek life===


Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has an extensive history of Greek community involvement on campus, including past presidents, honorary academic building dedications, and philanthropic achievements. The overall Greek system at Rensselaer stresses Leadership, Fortitude, Innovation, and Evolution. RPI currently has 29 active fraternities as well as 6 sororities, with 32 percent involvement of all males and 18 percent involvement of all females, organized under the Interfraternal Council and Panhellenic Council. Of those Greek organizations, three were founded at Rensselaer including the Theta Xi national engineering fraternity, the Sigma Delta Hispanic-interest local sorority, and the Rensselaer Society of Engineers local engineering fraternity. Theta Xi fraternity was established by RPI students on 29 April 1864, the only national fraternity founded during the Civil War. The Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, Rensselaer is home to the Epsilon Zeta chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega, or &quot;APO,&quot; national service fraternity, which operates a test-bank and office at the top floor of the Student Union. The organization also hosts a campus lost &amp; found, universal can tab collection, and a public 3D printing service.

In 2017, Chi Phi and Theta Chi at Rensselaer co-hosted an event called &quot;Brave A Shave For Kids With Cancer,&quot; along with several other Greek organizations - raising over $22,000 for pediatric cancer research with dozens of participants shaving their heads to spread awareness of pediatric cancers. Many fraternities and sororities also engage in Adopt-a-Highway and host events in the local community. Since its inception, all members of Greek Life have also participated in Navigating Rensselaer &amp; Beyond - RPI&#x27;s official continuation of student orientation through hosting annual events open to all students such as Beach Day/Hike with Greek Life, a day of hiking and team building activities for incoming freshmen, and Saratoga Therapeutic Equine Program, a day of service focused on horse rehabilitation programs.

Greek Life organizations also operate Greek-affiliated groups including the Alumni Inter-Greek Council, Greek Greeks - a student-run venture which aims to promote sustainability and safe environmental practices in Greek chapter houses, Greek Spectrum - an LGBTQIA support and advocacy group, and the undergraduate Greek leadership society Order of Omega.

==Student body==

In 2018, Rensselaer&#x27;s enrollment was 7,442 total resident students, including 6,590 undergraduate and 1,329 graduate. Over 71% of Rensselaer&#x27;s students are from out of state. More than 20% of students are international. Rensselaer students represent all 50 U.S. states and over 60 countries. The undergraduate student to faculty ratio is 13:1. Among the class of 2020, 66% are in the top 5 percent of their high school class, 93% in the top quarter, and 99% in the top half. The average unweighted high school GPA for enrolled students was 3.88 on a 4.0 scale, with 65% having a 3.75 GPA or higher and 99% having at least a 3.0.

Rensselaer&#x27;s yield rate for the Class of 2021 surpassed 20 percent in the year 2018 with over 20,000 applications received by Rensselaer&#x27;s Office of Admissions. The average SAT score range was 1330–1500 for the mid-50% range with a median SAT score of 1420 on a scale of 1600. The average ACT score range was 29–33 for the mid-50% range with a median ACT score of 31. In 2016, Rensselaer&#x27;s freshman retention rate was 94% and admissions selectivity rating was 35th in the nation according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Since 2000, undergraduate enrollment grew by over 1,700 students, from 4,867 to 6,590 during calendar year 2018, and the full-time graduate enrollment declined from 1500 to 1,188.

Roughly 12% of students received the Rensselaer medal, a merit scholarship with a cumulative value of $100,000 for exceptional high school students in science and mathematics. 95% of full-time domestic undergraduate students receive either need-based or merit-based financial aid, averaging 85% of total financial need met per student. In 2018, Rensselaer invested over $140 million in financial aid and scholarships for students.

===Gender ratio===
RPI became coeducational in 1942. In 1966, the male-to-female ratio was 19:1, in the 1980s it reached as low as 8:1, and in the early 1990s the ratio was around 5:1. In 2009, RPI had a ratio of 2.5:1 (72% male / 28% female), In 2016, the ratio for the incoming freshman class had fallen to 2.1:1 (68% male / 32% female), the lowest in the history of the institute. In the fall of 2016, more than 1,000 women enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s undergraduate engineering programs for the first time in its history. These women represented 30 percent of the student body in engineering at the university, and 32 percent of the university&#x27;s total gender composition. Shekhar Garde, Rensselaer&#x27;s dean of engineering, claims he wants to increase the female composition of the institute to 50 percent before 2030.

==Athletics ==
The RPI Engineers are the athletic teams for the university. RPI currently sponsors 23 sports, 21 of which compete at the NCAA Division III level in the Liberty League; men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey compete at the Division I level in ECAC Hockey. The official nickname of some of the school&#x27;s Division III teams was changed in 1995 from the Engineers to the Red Hawks. However, the hockey, football, cross-country, tennis and track and field teams all chose to retain the Engineers name. The Red Hawks name was, at the time, very unpopular among the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted with thrown concessions and chants of &quot;kill the chicken!&quot;. In 2009 the nickname for all teams has since been changed back to Engineers. In contrast, the official ice hockey mascot, known as Puckman, has always been very popular. Puckman is an anthropomorphic hockey puck with an engineer&#x27;s helmet.

During the 1970s and 1980s, one RPI cheer was:
:&quot;E to the x, dy/dx, E to the x, dx&quot;
:&quot;Cosine, secant, tangent, sine&quot;
:&quot;3.14159&quot;
:&quot;Square root, cube root, log of pi&quot;
:&quot;Disintegrate them, RPI!&quot;

===Ice hockey (men&#x27;s)===

RPI has a competitive Division I hockey team who won NCAA national titles in 1954 and 1985. Depending on how the rules are interpreted, the RPI men&#x27;s ice hockey team may have the longest winning streak on record for a Division I team; in the 1984–85 season it was undefeated for 30 games, but one game was against the University of Toronto, a non-NCAA team. Continuing into the 1985–86 season, RPI continued undefeated over 38 games, including two wins over Toronto. The streak ended at Boston University against the Terriers. Adam Oates and Daren Puppa, two players during that time, both went on to become stars in the NHL. Joé Juneau, who played from 1987 to 1991, and Brian Pothier, who played from 1996 to 2000, also spent many years in the NHL. Graeme Townshend, who also played in the late 1980s, had a brief NHL career. He is the first man of Jamaican ancestry to play in the National Hockey League.

The ice hockey team plays a significant role in the campus&#x27;s culture, drawing thousands of fans each week to the Houston Field House during the season. The team&#x27;s popularity even sparked the tradition of the hockey line, where students lined up for season tickets months in advance of the on-sale date. Today, the line generally begins a week or more before ticket sales. Another tradition since 1978 has been the &quot;Big Red Freakout!&quot; game held close to the first weekend of February. Fans usually dress in the school&#x27;s colors red (cherry) and white, and gifts such as T-shirts are distributed en masse. In ice hockey, the RPI&#x27;s biggest rival has always been the upstate engineering school Clarkson University. In recent years RPI has also developed a spirited rivalry with their conference travel partner Union College, with whom they annually play a nonconference game in Albany for the Mayor&#x27;s Cup.

===Ice hockey (women&#x27;s)===

The women&#x27;s ice hockey team moved to the NCAA Division I level in 2005. During the 2008–09 season the team set the record for most wins in one season (19-14-4). On 28 February 2010, Rensselaer made NCAA history. The Engineers beat Quinnipiac, 2–1, but it took five overtimes. It is now the longest game in NCAA Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey history. Senior defenseman Laura Gersten had the game-winning goal. She registered it at 4:32 of the fifth overtime session to not only clinch the win, but the series victory.

===Lacrosse (men&#x27;s)===
The lacrosse team represented the United States in the 1948 Olympics in London. It won the Wingate Memorial Trophy as national collegiate champions in 1952. Future NHL head coach Ned Harkness coached the lacrosse and ice hockey teams, winning national championships in both sports.

===Baseball===
The Engineers baseball squad is perennially atop the Liberty League standings and has seen 8 players move on to the professional ranks, including 4 players selected in the MLB draft. The team is coached by Jason Falcon. The Engineers play their home games at the historic Robison Field.

===American football===
American rugby was played on campus in the late 1870s. Intercollegiate football begin as late as 1886 when an RPI team first played a Union College team on a leased field in West Troy (Watervliet). Since 1903, RPI and nearby Union have been rivals in football, making it the oldest such rivalry in the state. The teams have played for the Dutchman&#x27;s Shoes since 1950. RPI Football had their most successful season in 2003, when they finished 11–2 and lost to St. Johns (Minn.) in the NCAA Division III semifinal game.

===Athletic facilities===
The Houston Field House is a 4,780‑seat multi-purpose arena located on the RPI campus. It opened in 1949 and is home to the RPI Engineers men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams. The Field House was renovated starting in 2007 as part of the major campus improvement project to build the East Campus Athletic Village. The renovations included locker rooms upgrades, addition of a new weight room, and a new special reception room dedicated to Ned Harkness. Additionally, as part of the renovations through a government grant, solar panels were installed on the roof to supply power to the building.

As part of the Rensselaer Plan, the institute recently completed a major project to improve its athletic facilities with the East Campus Athletic Village. The plan included construction of a new and much larger 4,842‑seat football stadium, a basketball arena with seating for 1,200, a new 50-meter pool, an indoor track and field complex, new tennis courts, new weight rooms and a new sports medicine center. The institute broke ground on 26 August 2007, and construction of the first phase is expected to last two years. The estimated cost of the project is $78 million for phase one and $35–$45 million for phase two. Since the completion of the new stadium, the bleachers on the Class of &#x27;86 football field on the central campus have been removed and the field has become an open space. In the future the new space could be used for expansions of the academic buildings, but for now members of the campus planning team foresee a &quot;historic landscape with different paths and access ways for students and vehicles alike&quot;.

== History of women ==
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has historically been a male dominated institute. The first woman to apply to RPI applied in 1873, and her name was Elizabeth R. Bruswell. However, she did not attend as she was the only female to apply, and it was suggested that she would not be accepted as it would not be comfortable for her as the only woman on campus. For many years afterwards, the school continued to only allow admission to men. It wasn&#x27;t until 1942 that women were welcome to enroll in classes at Rensselaer.

=== First women ===

==== Students ====
Camilla (Trent) Cluett (Architecture), Elizabeth English (Biology), Helen Ketchum (Architecture), Lois Graham (Mechanical Engineering), and Mary Ellen Rathbun (Metallurgical Engineering) were the first women to enroll in 1942. Lois Graham and Mary Ellen Rathbun became the first to graduate on April 22, 1945. In addition, Antoinette A. Patti was the first woman to receive a master&#x27;s degree from RPI in February 1947, in Chemistry. The first Doctoral Degree received by a woman at RPI was Reva R. G. Servoss in June 1954, in Chemistry as well.

==== Faculty ====
Miss Hazel Brennan was the first woman assistant instructor in chemistry in 1918 and was officially the first woman instructor. The following year, 1919, Marie De Pierpont was hired as an instructor in French and was later named professor as well as being named head of the language department in 1928. She was the first woman to hold a full professorship at the institute and ended her position in 1932. It wasn&#x27;t for another 11 years (1943) that another woman was hired as an instructor. Herta Leng, who worked in the Physics Department, was given the title of assistant professor in 1945, and became a full professor in 1966, the second woman to be a full professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

While the percentage of women enrolled at RPI remains comparatively low, it has improved significantly over time. The ratio as of 2020 was about 32% women and 68% men.

== Notable alumni ==
According to the Rensselaer Alumni Association, there are nearly 100,000 RPI graduates living in the United States, and another 4,378 living abroad. In 1995, the Alumni Association created the Rensselaer Alumni Hall of Fame.
