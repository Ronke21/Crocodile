<text>In vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine. In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and stores it. The bile is then released via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion of fats.

The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.

==Structure==
The human gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately in length and in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about .

The gallbladder is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder is divided into three sections: the &quot;fundus&quot;, &quot;body&quot;, and &quot;neck&quot;. The &quot;fundus&quot; is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The &quot;body&quot; lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The &quot;neck&quot; tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as &quot;Hartmann&#x27;s pouch&quot;.

Lymphatic drainage of the gallbladder follows the cystic node, which is located between the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct. Lymphatics from the lower part of the organ drain into lower hepatic lymph nodes. All the lymph finally drains into celiac lymph nodes.

===Microanatomy===

The gallbladder wall is composed of a number of layers. The innermost surface of the gallbladder wall is lined by a single layer of columnar cells with a brush border of microvilli, very similar to intestinal absorptive cells. Underneath the epithelium is an underlying lamina propria, a muscular layer, an outer perimuscular layer and serosa. Unlike elsewhere in the intestinal tract, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae, and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers.

The mucosa, the inner portion of the gallbladder wall, consists of a lining of a single layer of columnar cells, with cells possessing small hair-like attachments called microvilli. This sits on a thin layer of connective tissue, the lamina propria. The mucosa is curved and collected into tiny outpouchings called &quot;rugae&quot;.

A muscular layer sits beneath the mucosa. This is formed by smooth muscle, with fibres that lie in longitudinal, oblique and transverse directions, and are not arranged in separate layers. The muscle fibres here contract to expel bile from the gallbladder. A distinctive feature of the gallbladder is the presence of &quot;Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses&quot;, deep outpouchings of the mucosa that can extend through the muscular layer, and which indicate adenomyomatosis. The muscular layer is surrounded by a layer of connective and fat tissue.

The outer layer of the fundus of gallbladder, and the surfaces not in contact with the liver, are covered by a thick serosa, which is exposed to the peritoneum. The serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics. The surfaces in contact with the liver are covered in connective tissue.

===Variation===

The gallbladder varies in size, shape, and position among different people. Rarely, two or even three gallbladders may coexist, either as separate bladders draining into the cystic duct, or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic duct. Additionally, the gallbladder may fail to form at all. Gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist. These abnormalities are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic.

The location of the gallbladder in relation to the liver may also vary, with documented variants including gallbladders found within, above, on the left side of, behind, and detached or suspended from the liver. Such variants are very rare: from 1886 to 1998, only 110 cases of left-lying liver, or less than one per year, were reported in scientific literature.

An anatomical variation can occur, known as a Phrygian cap, which is an innocuous fold in the fundus, named after its resemblance to the Phrygian cap.

===Development===
The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.

During the fourth week of embryological development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the &quot;cystic diverticulum&quot;, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.

==Function==

The main functions of the gallbladder are to store and concentrate bile, also called gall, needed for the digestion of fats in food. Produced by the liver, bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately through the cystic duct (parts of the biliary tree) into the gallbladder, where it is stored. At any one time, of bile is stored within the gallbladder.

When food containing fat enters the digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I cells of the duodenum and jejunum. In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually draining into the duodenum. The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and bile salts, and also acts as a means of eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism, from the body.

The bile that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder. During gallbladder storage of bile, it is concentrated 3–10 fold by removal of some water and electrolytes. This is through the active transport of sodium and chloride ions across the epithelium of the gallbladder, which creates an osmotic pressure that also causes water and other electrolytes to be reabsorbed.

A function of the gallbladder appears to be protection against carcinogenesis as indicated by observations that removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) increases subsequent cancer risk. For instance, a systematic review and meta analysis of eighteen studies concluded that cholecystectomy has a harmful effect on the risk of right-sided colon cancer. Another recent study reported a significantly increased total cancer risk, including increased risk of several different types of cancer, after cholecystectomy.

==Clinical significance==
===Gallstones===
Gallstones form when the bile is saturated, usually with either cholesterol or bilirubin. Most gallstones do not cause symptoms, with stones either remaining in the gallbladder or passed along the biliary system. When symptoms occur, severe &quot;colicky&quot; pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen is often felt. If the stone blocks the gallbladder, inflammation known as cholecystitis may result. If the stone lodges in the biliary system, jaundice may occur; if the stone blocks the pancreatic duct, pancreatitis may occur. Gallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound. When a symptomatic gallstone occurs, it is often managed by waiting for it to be passed naturally. Given the likelihood of recurrent gallstones, surgery to remove the gallbladder is often considered. Some medication, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, may be used; lithotripsy, a non-invasive mechanical procedure used to break down the stones, may also be used.

===Inflammation===

Known as cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder is commonly caused by obstruction of the duct with gallstones, which is known as cholelithiasis. Blocked bile accumulates, and pressure on the gallbladder wall may lead to the release of substances that cause inflammation, such as phospholipase. There is also the risk of bacterial infection. An inflamed gallbladder is likely to cause sharp and localised pain, fever, and tenderness in the upper, right corner of the abdomen, and may have a positive Murphy&#x27;s sign. Cholecystitis is often managed with rest and antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins and, in severe cases, metronidazole. Additionally the gallbladder may need to be removed surgically if inflammation has progressed far enough.

===Gallbladder removal===

A cholecystectomy is a procedure in which the gallbladder is removed. It may be removed because of recurrent gallstones and is considered an elective procedure. A cholecystectomy may be an open procedure, or a laparoscopic one. In the surgery, the gallbladder is removed from the neck to the fundus, and so bile will drain directly from the liver into the biliary tree. About 30 percent of patients may experience some degree of indigestion following the procedure, although severe complications are much rarer. About 10 percent of surgeries lead to a chronic condition of postcholecystectomy syndrome.

===Complication===

Biliary injury (bile duct injury) is the traumatic damage of the bile ducts. It is most commonly an iatrogenic complication of cholecystectomy — surgical removal of gall bladder, but can also be caused by other operations or by major trauma. The risk of biliary injury is more during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than during open cholecystectomy. Biliary injury may lead to several complications and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. Ideally biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in endoscopy, radiology and surgery.

Biloma is collection of bile within the abdominal cavity. It happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for removing the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), with an incidence of 0.3–2%. Other causes are biliary surgery, liver biopsy, abdominal trauma, and, rarely, spontaneous perforation.

===Cancer===

Cancer of the gallbladder is uncommon and mostly occurs in later life. When cancer occurs, it is mostly of the glands lining the surface of the gallbladder (adenocarcinoma). Gallstones are thought to be linked to the formation of cancer. Other risk factors include large (&gt;1 cm) gallbladder polyps and having a highly calcified &quot;porcelain&quot; gallbladder.

Cancer of the gallbladder can cause attacks of biliary pain, yellowing of the skin (jaundice), and weight loss. A large gallbladder may be able to be felt in the abdomen. Liver function tests may be elevated, particularly involving GGT and ALP, with ultrasound and CT scans being considered medical imaging investigations of choice. Cancer of the gallbladder is managed by removing the gallbladder, however, the prognosis remains poor.

Cancer of the gallbladder may also be found incidentally after surgical removal of the gallbladder, with 1–3% of cancers identified in this way. Gallbladder polyps are mostly benign growths or lesions resembling growths that form in the gallbladder wall, and are only associated with cancer when they are larger in size (&gt;1 cm). Cholesterol polyps, often associated with cholesterolosis (&quot;strawberry gallbladder&quot;, a change in the gallbladder wall due to excess cholesterol), often cause no symptoms and are thus often detected in this way.

===Tests===

Tests used to investigate for gallbladder disease include blood tests and medical imaging. A full blood count may reveal an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection. Tests such as bilirubin and liver function tests may reveal if there is inflammation linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder, and whether this is associated with inflammation of the liver, and a lipase or amylase may be elevated if there is pancreatitis. Bilirubin may rise when there is obstruction of the flow of bile. A CA 19-9 level may be taken to investigate for cholangiocarcinoma.

An ultrasound is often the first medical imaging test performed when gallbladder disease such as gallstones are suspected. An abdominal X-ray or CT scan is another form of imaging that may be used to examine the gallbladder and surrounding organs. Other imaging options include MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), ERCP and percutaneous or intraoperative cholangiography. A cholescintigraphy scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder.

==Other animals==
Most vertebrates have gallbladders, but the form and arrangement of the bile ducts may vary considerably. In many species, for example, there are several separate ducts running to the intestine, rather than the single common bile duct found in humans. Several species of mammals (including horses, deer, rats, and laminoids), several species of birds (such as pigeons and some psittacine species), lampreys and all invertebrates do not have a gallbladder.

The bile from several species of bears is used in traditional Chinese medicine; bile bears are kept alive in captivity while their bile is extracted, in an industry characterized by animal cruelty.

==History==
Depictions of the gallbladder and biliary tree are found in Babylonian models found from 2000 BCE, and in ancient Etruscan model from 200 BCE, with models associated with divine worship.

Diseases of the gallbladder are known to have existed in humans since antiquity, with gallstones found in the mummy of Princess Amenen of Thebes dating to 1500 BCE. Some historians believe the death of Alexander the Great may have been associated with an acute episode of cholecystitis. The existence of the gallbladder has been noted since the 5th century, but it is only relatively recently that the function and the diseases of the gallbladder has been documented, particularly in the last two centuries.

The first descriptions of gallstones appear to have been in the Renaissance, perhaps because of the low incidence of gallstones in earlier times owing to a diet with more cereals and vegetables and less meat. Anthonius Benevinius in 1506 was the first to draw a connection between symptoms and the presence of gallstones. Ludwig Georg Courvoisier, after examining a number of cases in 1890 that gave rise to the eponymous Courvoisier&#x27;s law, stated that in an enlarged, nontender gallbladder, the cause of jaundice is unlikely to be gallstones.

The first surgical removal of a gallstone (cholecystolithotomy) was in 1676 by physician Joenisius, who removed the stones from a spontaneously occurring biliary fistula. Stough Hobbs in 1867 performed the first recorded cholecystotomy, although such an operation was in fact described earlier by French surgeon Jean Louis Petit in the mid eighteenth century. German surgeon Carl Langenbuch performed the first cholecystectomy in 1882 for a sufferer of cholelithiasis. Before this, surgery had focused on creating a fistula for drainage of gallstones. Langenbuch reasoned that given several other species of mammal have no gallbladder, humans could survive without one.

The debate whether surgical removal of the gallbladder or simply gallstones was preferred was settled in the 1920s, with the consensus that removal of the gallbladder was preferred. It was only in the mid and late parts of the twentieth century that medical imaging techniques such as use of contrast medium and CT scans were used to view the gallbladder. The first laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by Erich Mühe of Germany in 1985, although French surgeons Phillipe Mouret and Francois Dubois are often credited for their operations in 1987 and 1988 respectively.

==Society and culture==
To have &quot;gall&quot; is associated with bold, belligerent behaviour, whereas to have &quot;bile&quot; is associated with sourness.

In the Chinese medicine, the gallbladder () is associated with the Wuxing element of wood, in excess its emotion is belligerence and in deficiency cowardice and judgement, in the Chinese language it is related to a myriad of idioms, including using terms such as &quot;a body completely [of] gall&quot; () to describe a forward person, and &quot;single, alone gallbladder hero&quot; () to describe a lone hero, or &quot;they have a lot of gall to talk like that&quot;.

In the Zangfu theory of Chinese medicine it is an extraordinary Fu or yang organ, as it holds bile. The gallbladder not only has a digestive role, but is seen as the seat of decision-making and judgement.

<doc id="197021" wikidata="Q851111" url="?curid=197021" title="Bile duct">
<text>A bile duct is any of a number of long tube-like structures that carry bile, and is present in most vertebrates. The bile duct is separated into three main parts: the fundus (superior), the body (middle), and the neck (inferior). 

Bile is required for the digestion of food and is secreted by the liver into passages that carry bile toward the hepatic duct. It joins the cystic duct (carrying bile to and from the gallbladder) to form the common bile duct which then opens into the intestine.

==Structure==
The top half of the common bile duct is associated with the liver, while the bottom half of the common bile duct is associated with the pancreas, through which it passes on its way to the intestine. It opens into the part of the intestine called the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater.

==Segments==
The biliary tree (see below) is the whole network of various sized ducts branching through the liver.

The path is as follows: bile canaliculi → canals of Hering → interlobular bile ducts → intrahepatic bile ducts → left and right hepatic ducts &quot;merge to form&quot; → common hepatic duct &quot;exits liver and joins&quot; → cystic duct (from gall bladder) &quot;forming&quot; → common bile duct → &quot;joins with&quot; pancreatic duct → &quot;forming&quot; ampulla of Vater → &quot;enters&quot; duodenum.

===Nerve supply===
Inflation of a balloon in the bile duct causes, through the vagus nerve, activation of the brain stem and the insular cortex, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex.

==Clinical significance==
===Blockage===
Blockage or obstruction of the bile duct by gallstones, scarring from injury, or cancer prevents the bile from being transported to the intestine and the active ingredient in the bile (bilirubin) instead accumulates in the blood. This condition results in jaundice, where the skin and eyes become yellow from the bilirubin in the blood. This condition also causes severe itchiness from the bilirubin deposited in the tissues. In certain types of jaundice, the urine will be noticeably darker, and the stools will be much paler than usual. This is caused by the bilirubin all going to the bloodstream and being filtered into the urine by the kidneys, instead of some being lost in the stools through the ampulla of Vater.

====Jaundice====
Jaundice is commonly caused by conditions such as pancreatic cancer, which causes blockage of the bile duct passing through the cancerous portion of the pancreas; cholangiocarcinoma, cancer of the bile ducts; blockage by a stone in patients with gallstones; and from scarring after injury to the bile duct during gallbladder removal.

====Drainage====
Biliary drainage is performed with a tube or catheter (called a &quot;biliary drain&quot;, &quot;biliary stent&quot; or &quot;biliary catheter&quot;) by a surgeon or, commonly, an interventional radiologist. It can be used to relieve a blockage in the bile duct, either permanently or as a temporary solution before definite treatment such as surgery. The drain can be placed percutaneously through the liver, with the procedure then being called &quot;percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage&quot; (PTBD). This can additionally be performed as part of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, then a form of interventional radiology. A biliary drain can also be used to take bile samples for diagnostic workup or disease monitoring, as well as providing a route of administration for medical substances.

A surgically created passage between the common bile duct and the jejunum in a procedure called a choledochojejunostomy, can be carried out to relieve the symptoms of biliary obstruction as well as allows the bile duct to drain.

In infants with biliary atresia, hepatoportoenterostomy is an alternative method of providing bile drainage.

===Cholangiocarcinoma===

Cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer is a form of cancer that is composed of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts. Cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis.

=== Injury ===
In cholecystectomy there is a slight risk (0.3–0.5%) of injury of the bile ducts, most commonly of the common bile duct. This complication can range from mild forms, which are easy to address during the operation, to more severe forms. If not addressed such injury can be debilitating and lead to considerable morbidity. Such injury can be prevented by routinely using X-ray investigation of the bile ducts (intraoperative cholangiography).

<doc id="197025" wikidata="Q937704" url="?curid=197025" title="Paisley (design)">
<text>Paisley or paisley pattern is an ornamental textile design using the &quot;boteh&quot; () or &quot;buta&quot;, a teardrop-shaped motif with a curved upper end. Of Persian origin, paisley designs became popular in the West in the 18th and 19th centuries, following imports of post-Mughal Empire versions of the design from India, especially in the form of Kashmir shawls, and were then replicated locally.

The English name for the patterns comes from the town of Paisley, in the west of Scotland, a centre for textiles where paisley designs were reproduced using jacquard looms.

The pattern is still commonly seen in Britain and other English-speaking countries on men&#x27;s ties, waistcoats, and scarfs, and remains popular in other items of clothing and textiles in Iran and South and Central Asian countries.

==Origins==

Some design scholars believe the &quot;buta&quot; is the convergence of a stylized floral spray and a cypress tree: a Zoroastrian symbol of life and eternity. The &quot;bent&quot; cedar is also a sign of strength and resistance but modesty. The floral motif originated in the Sassanid dynasty, was used later in the Safavid dynasty of Persia (1501–1736), and was a major textile pattern in Iran during the Qajar and Pahlavi dynasties. In these periods, the pattern was used to decorate royal regalia, crowns, and court garments, as well as textiles used by the general population. Persian and Central Asian designs usually range the motifs in orderly rows, with a plain background. Another likely theory is that is based on the shape of a mango.

=== Ancient Indo-Iranian origins ===
There is significant speculation as to the origins and symbolism of &quot;boteh jegheh&quot;, or &quot;ancient motif&quot;, known in English as paisley. With experts contesting different time periods for its emergence, to understand the proliferation in the popularity of boteh jegheh design and eventually Paisley, it is important to understand South Asian history. The early Indo-Iranian people flourished in South Asia, where they eventually exchanged linguistic, cultural, and even religious similarities. The ancient Indo-Iranian people shared a religion called Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism, some experts argue, served as one of the earliest influences for boteh jegheh&#x27;s design with the shape representing the cypress tree, an ancient Zoroastrian religious symbol. Others contest that the earliest representation of the pattern&#x27;s shape comes from the later Sassanid dynasty. The design was representative of a tear drop. Some will argue that &quot;boteh jegheh&#x27;s&quot; origins stem from old religious beliefs and its meaning could symbolize the sun, a phoenix, or even an ancient Iranian religious sign for an eagle. Around the same time, a pattern called &quot;Boteh&quot; was gaining popularity in Iran; the pattern was a floral design, and was used to represent elite status, mostly serving to decorate royal objects. The pattern was traditionally woven onto silk clothing using silver and gold material. The earliest evidence of the design being traded with other cultures was found at the Red Sea, with both Egyptian and Greek peoples trading from the 1400s.

== Spread of the pattern in South Asia ==
One of the earliest evidence of the pattern as it relates to Islamic culture has been found at Noh Gumba mosque, in the city of Balkh in Afghanistan, where it is believed that the pattern was included in the design as early as the 800s when the mosque was built. In early Iranian culture, the design was woven onto Termeh, one of the most valuable materials in early Iran where the design served to make clothing for the nobility. At this time, the Iranian nobility wore distinct uniforms called khalat; historically, the design was commonly found on the khalat uniforms. It is stated that at some point in the 1400s, Boteh was transported from Persia to Kashmir. 

In the same century, in the 1400s, some of the earliest recorded Kashmir shawls were produced in India, records from the 1500s, during Emperor Akbar&#x27;s reign over the Mughal people in this area indicate that shawl making was already fashionable in India prior to Mughal conquest which took place in the early 1400s. It has been stated that during Emperor Akbars reign over the Mughal empire, boteh jegheh shawls were extremely popular and fashionable. While one shawl was traditionally worn previously, it was during the rule of Emperor Akbar that the emperor decided to wear two shawls at a time to serve as a status symbol. Along with wearing the shawls frequently, Emperor Akbar also used the shawls as gifts to other rulers and high officials. It is believed that by the 1700s, Kashmir shawls were produced in the image that someone today would associate with modern paisley.

== Introduction of boteh jegheh to Western culture ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the British East India Company introduced Kashmir shawls from India to England and Scotland, where they were extremely fashionable and soon duplicated. The first place in the Western world to imitate the design was the town of Paisley in Scotland, Europe&#x27;s top producer of textiles at this time. Before being produced in Paisley, thus gaining its name in Western culture, the paisley motif was originally referred to by Westerners simply as &quot;pine and cone.&quot; European technological innovation in textile manufacturing made Western imitations of Kashmir shawls competitive with Indian-made shawls from Kashmir.

The shawls from India could be quite expensive at the time, but, with the industrial revolution taking place in Europe, paisley shawls were manufactured on a large scale, so lowering their price that they became commonplace among the middle class and boosting the design&#x27;s popularity even more. While the Western world appropriated much of Eastern culture and design, the Boteh design was by far the most popular. Records indicate that William Moorcroft, an English businessman and explorer, visited the Himalayan mountains in the mid-1800s; upon his arrival, he was enthralled by Boteh-adorned Kashmir shawls and tried to arrange for entire families of Indian textile workers to move to the United Kingdom. The earliest paisley shawls made in the United Kingdom, in Paisley, Scotland, were of fleece, a material with a soft, fluffy texture on one side.

In Asia, the paisley shawls were primarily worn by males, often in formal or ceremonial contexts, but in Europe they were primarily worn instead by women. While still closely resembling its original form, the paisley design would change once it began to be produced in Western culture, with different towns in the United Kingdom applying their own spin to the design. 

In the 1800s, European production of paisley increased, particularly in the Scottish town from which the pattern takes its modern name. Soldiers returning from the colonies brought home cashmere wool shawls from India, and the East India Company imported more. The design was copied from the costly silk and wool Kashmir shawls and adapted first for use on handlooms, and, after 1820, on Jacquard looms. The paisley pattern also appeared on European-made bandanas from the early 1800s, the patterns imitating Kashmir shawls. 

From roughly 1800 to 1850, the weavers of the town of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland, became the foremost producers of Paisley shawls. Unique additions to their hand-looms and Jacquard looms allowed them to work in five colours when most weavers were producing paisley using only two. The design became known as the &quot;Paisley pattern&quot;. By 1860, Paisley could produce shawls with 15 colours, which was still only a quarter of the number used in the multicolour paisleys then still being imported from Kashmir. In addition to the loom-woven fabric, the town of Paisley became a major site for the manufacture of printed cotton and wool in the 1800s, according to the Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. In this process, the paisley pattern was printed, rather than woven, onto other textiles, including cotton squares which were the precursors of the modern bandanna. Printed paisley was cheaper than the costly woven paisley, and this added to its popularity. The key places of printing paisley were Britain and the Alsace region of France. The peak period of paisley as a fashionable design ended in the 1870s, perhaps as so many cheap printed versions were on the market.

==Modern use==
The 1960s proved to be a time of great revival for the paisley design in Western culture. Popular culture in the United States developed a sort of fixation on eastern cultures, including many traditionally Indian styles. Paisley was one of them, being worn by the likes of the Beatles; even the guitar company Fender used the design to decorate one of their most famous electric guitars, the Fender Telecaster. Today, Brad Paisley plays a Telecaster decorated in that pattern, and the design remains common, appearing on jewellery, suit ties, pocket books, cake decorations, tattoos, mouse pads for computers, scarves, and dresses. Paisley bandanas, long a fixture of cowboys, came in the latter twentieth century to be worn by many blue-collar and labor workers as protection from dust and were sported by entertainers popular with such workers, such as the country musician Willie Nelson. The motif also influences furniture design internationally, with many countries applying paisley decoration to wallpaper, pillows, curtains, bed spreads, and like furnishings. 

=== Music ===
In the mid- to late 1960s, paisley became identified with psychedelic style and enjoyed mainstream popularity, partly due to the Beatles. The style was particularly popular during the Summer of Love in 1967. The company Fender made a pink paisley version of their Telecaster guitar by sticking paisley wallpaper onto the guitar bodies.
Prince paid tribute to the rock and roll history of paisley when he created the Paisley Park Records recording label and established Paisley Park Studios, both named after his 1985 song &quot;Paisley Park&quot;. The Paisley Underground was a music scene active around the same time.

=== Architecture ===
Paisley was a favorite design element of British-Indian architect Laurie Baker. He has made numerous drawings and collages of what he called &quot;mango designs&quot;. He used to include the shape in the buildings he designed also.

=== Sports ===
At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Azerbaijan&#x27;s team sported colorful paisley trousers.
It was the emblem of the 2012 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup, held in Azerbaijan.

It was part of the emblem for the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup, held in India.

==Other languages==
In Persian, Boteh can be translated to shrub or bush, while in Kashmir it carried the same meaning but was referred to as Buta, or Bu.

The modern French words for paisley are &#x27; (meaning bush, cluster of leaves or a flower bud) in Persian as well as &#x27; () and &quot;&quot; (&quot;palm&quot;, which – along with the pine and the cypress – is one of the traditional botanical motifs thought to have influenced the shape of the paisley element as it is now known)..

In various languages of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, the design&#x27;s name is related to the word for mango:
* In Bengali: &quot;kalka&quot;
* In Telugu: &quot;mamidi pinde&quot;, young mango pattern
* In Tamil: &quot;mankolam&quot;, mango pattern
* In Marathi: &quot;koyari&quot;, mango seed
* In Sindhi: &quot;aami or ambri,&quot; small mango.
* In Hindi/Urdu: &quot;carrey&quot; or &quot;kerii&quot;, means unripe mango
* In Punjabi: &quot;ambi&quot;, from &quot;amb&quot;, mango.

In Chinese, paisley is known as the &quot;ham hock pattern&quot; () in mainland China, or &quot;amoeba pattern&quot; in Taiwan (). In Russia, this ornament is known as &quot;cucumbers&quot; ().

<text>The University of East Anglia (UEA) is a public research university in Norwich, England. Established in 1963 on a campus west of the city centre, the university has four faculties and twenty-six schools of study. It is one of five BBSRC funded research campuses with forty businesses, four independent research institutes (John Innes Centre, Quadram Institute, Earlham Institute and The Sainsbury Laboratory) and a teaching hospital (Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital) on site.

The university is a member of Norwich Research Park, which has one of Europe&#x27;s largest concentrations of researchers in the fields of agriculture, genomics, health and the environment. UEA is also one of the nation&#x27;s most-cited research institutions worldwide. The postgraduate Master of Arts in creative writing, founded by Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson in 1971, has produced several successful authors. In 2023/24, UEA had a total income of £315.7 million, of which £33.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £234.2 million. The university also generates £559 million annually for the regional economy, and has one of the highest percentages of 1st and 2:1 undergraduate degrees.

UEA&#x27;s alumni, faculty and researchers, include three Nobel Prize laureates, co-discoverers of the Hepatitis C and D genomes, as well as the small interfering RNA, a co-inventor of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, one President of the Royal Society, three Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, six National Teaching Fellows, eight Fellows of the British Academy and a number of Fellows of the Royal Society. Alumni also include CEOs, one current monarch and former prime minister, two de facto heads of state, one vice president, one deputy prime minister, two former Leaders of the House of Lords, along with winners of the Lasker Award, Booker Prize, Caine Prize and Costa Book Award.

==History==

===1960s===
Attempts to establish a university in Norwich were made in 1919 and 1947, but due to a lack of government funding on both occasions the plans had to be postponed. The University of East Anglia was eventually set up in April 1960 for biological sciences and English studies students. Initially, teaching took place in the temporary &quot;University Village&quot;, which was officially opened by the chairman of the University Grants Committee, Keith Murray, on 29 September 1963. Sited on the opposite side of the Earlham Road to the present campus, this was a collection of prefabricated structures designed for 1,200 students, laid out by the local architectural firm Feilden and Mawson. There were no residences with the vice-chancellor and administration being based in nearby Earlham Hall. UEA was one of the &quot;plate glass universities&quot; that were constructed during the decade to meet the demand for the expansion of higher education.

In 1961, the first vice-chancellor, Frank Thistlethwaite, had approached architect Denys Lasdun, an adherent of the &quot;New Brutalist&quot; trend in architecture, who was at that time building Fitzwilliam College, to produce designs for the permanent campus. The site chosen was on the western edge of the city, on the south side of Earlham Road. The land, formerly part of the Earlham Hall estate was at that time occupied by a golf course. Lasdun presented a model and an outline plan at a press conference in April 1963, but it took another year to produce more detailed plans, which diverged considerably from the model. As a result, the first buildings did not open until late-1966.

Lasdun moved the teaching and research functions into a single long concrete block following the contour of the site. Alongside this teaching wall a walkway was built, giving access to the various entrances of the wall, with frontage roads beneath. Attached to the southern side of the walkway, six linked blocks of terraced accommodation residences were constructed to appear as one structure. The residences became known as the &quot;Ziggurats&quot; and were designed by Lasdun to recall &quot;vineyards in France or a rocky outcrop on a slope&quot;. In 1968, Lasdun was replaced as consultant architect by Bernard Feilden, known for his conservation work on the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal. Feilden completed the university wall, the library, and created an arena-shaped square social space. They would later receive Grade II* listed status.

In 1963, the University of East Anglia Boat Club (UEABC) was founded; it currently has 60 members and rows year-round on the Yare River from September to July. The club has a boathouse and also has use of the UEA Sportspark on campus. In 1964, Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot; became the first drama production to be staged at UEA with John Rhys Davies, the drama society&#x27;s first president and one of the first 105 students admitted to the university. In 1965, composer Benjamin Britten was appointed music adviser for UEA and in 1967, he conducted the UEA Choir in a performance of his composition &quot;War Requiem&quot;.

===1970s===
In the early-1970s, &quot;UEA:TV&quot; (under the name of &quot;Nexus UTV&quot;) was formed and created student-made television with it operating for two hours a day over lunchtime. The monthly student newspaper &quot;Concrete&quot; officially launched in 1973, replacing &quot;Mandate&quot; from 1965; issues have included interviews with Tony Blair, Nick Clegg, Paul McCartney, Coldplay, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Harrison Ford, Greg James, Charles Clarke and Max Mosley. Additional university publications included &quot;Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Can Opener&quot;, &quot;Mustard Magazine&quot; and &quot;Kett&quot; before &quot;Concrete&quot; re-launched in 1992.

Authors Malcolm Bradbury and Angus Wilson both founded the School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing and jointly helped to establish their creative writing course at masters level in 1970, which was then a groundbreaking initiative in the United Kingdom. In 1972, the Centre for Climatic Research opened in the School of Environmental Sciences; the founder and first director was climatologist Hubert Lamb. That same year, UEA&#x27;s consultant architect Bernard Feilden helped the university to win a Civic Trust Award for the design of the main campus social area (The Square).

In the mid-1970s, the School of Computing Sciences first opened at UEA and the university started offering postgraduate and undergraduate education degrees from Keswick Hall, a manor and country house that previously served as a residence of the Gurney family and housed the former Norwich Teacher Training College. The property was sold off in 1981 after the college&#x27;s amalgamation with the university due to an enforced closure. 

The UEA Broad was developed by Atlas Aggregates in conjunction with the university between August 1973 and June 1978. The project involved excavating an area of gravel and was arranged as part of a &quot;no money&quot; deal where the aggregate company took the material leaving a landscaped body of water fed by the River Yare. It is one of the few Broads produced by gravel extraction rather than peat digging.

In 1978, the gift of tribal art and 20th-century paintings and sculptures by artists such as Francis Bacon and Henry Moore from Sir Robert Sainsbury resulted in the construction of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, one of the first major public buildings to be designed by the architects Norman Foster and Wendy Cheesman. The building became Grade II* listed in December 2012.

===1980s===

In 1984, the UEA Law School first moved to Earlham Hall which dates back to 1580 and was the seat of the Gurney family. Social reformer Elizabeth Fry grew up there and Prince William Frederick was once a regular guest. In 1984, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) moved to a new cylindrical building designed by Rick Mather. In 2006, this was named the Hubert Lamb Building in honour of the first director. In 1988, for the university&#x27;s 25th-anniversary celebrations, King Charles III visited the CRU building. It has become one of the leading institutions worldwide concerned with the study of natural and anthropogenic climate change.

Also in 1988, ten years after the Sainsbury Centre opened, all of the cladding had to be replaced with the aluminium panels having deteriorated beyond repair. In 1989, the British Centre for Literary Translation was founded in the School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing by W. G. Sebald, who taught European Literature. In 1987, the Arthur Miller Centre for American Studies was set up to facilitate the study of the United States. Miller spent his 85th-birthday at UEA when he was made an honorary graduate in 2000.

===1990s===
In 1990, the student radio station &quot;Livewire1350AM&quot; launched, completing UEA&#x27;s Media Collective of print, television and radio. It was opened by Radio 1 DJ John Peel (who was awarded an honorary MA degree from UEA) and is now one of the longest running student radio stations in the country. In 1993, the Union of UEA Students took over the management of the Waterfront, a music venue and nightclub located on the bank of the River Wensum which has hosted bands and artists including Pulp, Radiohead, Nirvana, The Verve, Arctic Monkeys, The Prodigy, Amy Winehouse, Stereophonics, Paul Weller, Buzzcocks, MGMT, Travis, Moby, Ellie Goulding and Foals. In 1994, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Queen&#x27;s Building, which hosts classes within the School of Health Sciences. In 1995, the Elizabeth Fry Building was opened, providing new facilities for almost 800 students.

===2000s===
In 2000, UEA&#x27;s reputation within the field of environmental research led to the government choosing the university as the site for the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The centre, named after the 19th-century scientist John Tyndall, brings together scientists, economists, engineers and social scientists from eight partner institutions to &quot;research, assess and communicate from a distinct trans-disciplinary perspective, the options to mitigate, and the necessities to adapt to current climate change and continuing global warming, and to integrate these into the global, UK and local contexts of sustainable development&quot;. In 2000, the Sportspark (containing an Olympic-sized pool, floodlit astro-pitches and the tallest climbing wall in Norfolk) was built due to funding from the Sport England Lottery Fund and has become one of the most successful national sport facilities.

In 2001, UEA alumnus Sir Paul Nurse was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine which he shared jointly with Timothy Hunt and Leland Hartwell &quot;for their discoveries of key regulators of the cell cycle&quot;. In 2002, the Norwich Medical School opened as part of the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice with over 110 students enrolled as a collaboration with the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and the research centres at Norwich Research Park. In 2003, the School of Pharmacy opened along with the Zuckerman Institute for Connective Environmental Research (ZICER).

In November 2009, computer servers at the university&#x27;s Climatic Research Unit were hacked and the stolen information made public. As a result, over 1,000 emails and 2,000 documents were released. Because the CRU was a major repository for data regarding man-made global warming, the release, which occurred directly prior to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, attracted international attention and led to calls for an inquiry, with the controversy gaining the nickname &quot;climategate&quot;. As a result, eight investigations were launched in both the United Kingdom and the United States, but none found evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct, and the academics were subsequently fully exonerated. In 2011, an analysis of temperature data by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group concluded that the CRU&#x27;s &quot;studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2010, the Thomas Paine Study Centre was opened by playwright Trevor Griffiths. It became Norwich Business School which is part of the Faculty of Social Sciences. In 2011, the university won its second Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for its distinguished creative writing programme. This bolstered the region&#x27;s reputation as a literary hub and helped Norwich to achieve its status as England&#x27;s first UNESCO City of Literature in 2012. In 2009, UEA&#x27;s School of International Development had previously been awarded in recognition of sustained responses to environmental change and world poverty. In 2013, the university celebrated its 50th-anniversary, ranking No. 1 in the Times Higher Education Magazine Student Experience league table. UEA also launched its first free Massive open online course (MOOC) in partnership with Future Learn. 

In 2014, UEA opened an environmentally friendly accommodation block (Crome Court) which has won a number of awards for sustainability. In the mid-2010s, the Sainsbury Centre at UEA was used for filming several scenes in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Greenest Building&quot; (The Enterprise Centre) opened on campus using low-carbon local materials; it was featured in an exhibition at COP26 as one of the most exemplary sustainable building projects in the world. Also, Earlham Park played host between 23 and 24 May to BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend 2015 where acts such as Fall Out Boy, Muse, Foo Fighters and Taylor Swift performed.

In late-September 2016, two new accommodation blocks opened; Barton House and Hickling House were named after two of the Norfolk Broads and increased the number of rooms available to new students. That same year, vice-chancellor David Richardson unveiled a &quot;2030 vision&quot; which included a £300m investment in campus – refurbishing existing buildings as well as creating new teaching and learning spaces in order to help UEA become a major global university. In 2019, Norwich Business School received an Athena SWAN Bronze award for good practices in higher education and research institutions towards the advancement of gender equality.

=== 2020–present ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, the university gave empty student accommodation to NHS staff, allowing them to isolate from at-risk family members and to avoid commuting. In June 2021, plans for a BBC film documenting the 2009 CRU email controversy were announced, featuring Jason Watkins playing the role of climatologist Phil Jones. The film (&quot;The Trick&quot;) was shot on location at the university and aired in October 2021. 

In 2023, the university entered a financial crisis when it made a £74m loss in the financial year ending on 31 July 2022. The university&#x27;s income was £295m, but it spent £370m: 48% staff costs, 16% pension scheme provision, 26% other costs, 8% depreciation and 2% interest on loans. The university expected to make a £34m loss in the financial year 2023/24 and had predicted that there would be £45m yearly losses by 2026/27. 

The university&#x27;s teaching block, also known as the Lasdun Wall, urgently required major repairs; its condition was described as &quot;deteriorating fast&quot; and it was said that if repairs were not done it might have &quot;to be closed permanently&quot; and would be &quot;unusable by 2025&quot;. The financial turmoil alongside a previous vote of no-confidence by the UCU branch of East Anglia, and a &quot;scathing&quot; letter written to the UEA Council by the professoriate demanding change, led to the immediate resignation of vice-chancellor David Richardson on 17 February 2023, who had been in the role for ten years.

Questions were asked about the university&#x27;s sudden crisis in Parliament, with the local MP Clive Lewis talking of the institution being in a &quot;death spiral&quot;. Professor David Maguire, formerly vice-chancellor at the University of Greenwich, was appointed as the new vice-chancellor on 22 May 2023, initially on a fixed-term basis. According to a UEA press release, Maguire &quot;will lead UEA through a significant period of transformation and change as it works to secure its future financial stability, and continue its success as a world-leading teaching and research University for future generations of students and staff&quot;. This meant job cuts and threats of compulsory redundancy (113 staff posts were lost over the summer).
In September 2023, it was announced that some of the university&#x27;s student accommodation would be temporarily closed, due to government guidance on the unsafe nature of the building material RAAC. The dwellings affected were the iconic Ziggurats (including both Norfolk and Suffolk Terrace), visiting person accommodation at Broadview Lodge and the top floor levels of both Constable Terrace and Nelson Court. Students were moved to alternative accommodation either on campus or off-campus. Vice-chancellor Maguire noted that they would be closed &quot;until we can be certain that they are safe&quot; and that there would be &quot;no additional costs to students as a result of any changes&quot; to accommodation. 

In April 2024, Dame Jenny Abramsky (previously the BBC&#x27;s most senior female employee; Director of Audio and Music) was appointed as the university&#x27;s chancellor. She succeeded Dame Karen Jones, who had been in the role since 2016. In August 2024, it was announced that contractor Mace was going to carry out a four-phase strip-back-to-frame refurbishment of the Lasdun Wall buildings due to potential architectural risks and failings. The £88m project includes both new research and teaching space in an extended Building 3, while existing facilities will continue to operate within Buildings 4, 5 and 6. It will also provide an 86% betterment in thermal performance, aligning it with UEA&#x27;s net zero emission targets.

In November 2024, a further round of cost-cutting elsewhere around the university was announced with 170 full-time equivalent posts due to be lost through the removal of voluntary redundancies and vacant posts. In a statement, Maguire said the decision to cut staff had not &quot;been taken lightly&quot; and would allow UEA to &quot;save an additional £11m to stay on track with our financial sustainability plan&quot;. A spokesperson for the university said: &quot;The senior team are working their hardest to develop robust evidence-based plans to mitigate the worst impacts of external financial pressures. The UEA Council has approved a multi-year plan to achieve financial sustainability which is currently on target. Despite the difficult choices ahead we believe carrying on with this approach is in the best long-term interests of all at the university.&quot;

==Campus==

Features of the UEA campus include Earlham Hall, which now currently accommodates the UEA Law School; the Sainsbury Centre at the western end of the main wall, designed by Norman Foster to house the art collection of Sir Robert Sainsbury, whose daughter attended UEA; the Sportspark, a multi-sports community facility; and the Enterprise Centre, a supportive hub for start-up companies. Additionally, the campus also includes Norwich Research Park, the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and the UEA Broad.

Until 1994, former RAF accommodation blocks at the RAF Horsham St Faith to the south of Norwich International Airport housed approximately half of the university&#x27;s first-year students. Accommodation blocks on the campus include Constable Terrace, Nelson Court, with Britten, Paston, Colman, Victory, Kett and Browne Houses, in addition to the University Village. The residences are named after Horatio Nelson, John Constable, Benjamin Britten, Jeremiah Colman, Nelson&#x27;s ship , Robert Kett, Sir Thomas Browne and the Paston family (authors of the Paston Letters). UEA&#x27;s newest residences (Crome, Hickling and Barton Houses) offer en suite accommodation with shared kitchens and lounge areas.

Facilities located on campus include the Union Pub and Bar, a 24-hour library, a concert venue (Lower Common Room), a canteen (Campus Kitchen), a café (The Blend), a bar (Unio), a graduate bar (The Scholar&#x27;s Bar), the Street with a 24-hour launderette, the Union Shop and a coffee shop (Ziggy&#x27;s). Other establishments include the Square (a central outdoor meeting place), Café 57, the Bio Cafe, and the UEA Medical Centre and Dental Practice. There are also three statues by sculptor Sir Antony Gormley which were placed on campus in 2017. The work drew controversy due to the fact that the figures resembled people balancing on high ledges.

The campus is linked to Norwich city centre and railway station by frequent buses, operated by First Eastern Counties, via Unthank Road or Earlham Road. Other transport links include First Buses to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and to Bowthorpe, as well as Konectbus services to Watton, Dereham and also Costessey via park and ride. National Express provides coach services to London and Megabus also operates both low cost intercity and long-distance travel to cities including Cambridge, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff. The university is situated nearby an area within the southwestern suburbs known as the Golden Triangle which has been dubbed the Norwich version of London&#x27;s Notting Hill.
==Academic profile==
===Overview===
Experimental novelist Alan Burns was the university&#x27;s first writer-in-residence. The university library is home to the British Archive for Contemporary Writing, which is an archive of material from a range of classical and contemporary writers, including Doris Lessing, Lee Child and Naomi Alderman. Between September 2022 and November 2023, the library also worked on a project entitled &quot;Towards a Centre for Contemporary Poetry in the Archive&quot;, which has included hosting four Poets in Residence: Joelle Taylor, Jay Bernard, Anthony Vahni Capildeo and Gail McConnell. The German émigré novelist W. G. Sebald taught at the School of Literature and Creative Writing and founded the British Centre for Literary Translation.

The Climatic Research Unit, founded in 1972 by Hubert Lamb in the School of Environmental Sciences, has been an early centre of work for climate change research. The school was also stated to be &quot;the strongest in the world&quot; by the chief scientific adviser to the British government, Sir David King, during a lecture at the John Innes Centre in 2005. The university was one of the first in the United Kingdom to establish Film Studies as a serious academic discipline, with developmental funding to support a new lectureship in the field awarded from the British Film Institute. It is also the home of the East Anglian Film Archive which collects and preserves film and videotape primarily from the Eastern counties.

===National and international partnerships===
In 2005, UEA in partnership with the University of Essex, Suffolk County Council, the East of England Development Agency, Ipswich Borough Council and the Learning and Skills Council, secured £15m funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England for the creation of a new campus in the Waterfront area of Ipswich, called University Campus Suffolk (UCS). It opened in September 2007; in May 2016, it became independent of UEA and was renamed the University of Suffolk. In 2008, INTO University Partnerships opened a £35m six-storey building named INTO University of East Anglia (INTO UEA) with 415 en-suite study-bedrooms and classroom space for 600 students. The institution focuses on the provision of foundation courses for international students, including English language for academic purposes. Nationally, UEA is also involved in a number of partnerships including the Nexus Network (with the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and the University of Sussex) which fosters research and practical collaborations across the domains of energy and the environment.

Additionally, UEA is involved in several Doctoral Training Partnerships (DTPs) and Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs), including AgriFoRwArdS (collaboration with the University of Cambridge and the University of Lincoln which focuses on robotics within the agricultural sector), SENSS (partnership promoting social science research training with City, University of London, Cranfield University, University of Essex, Goldsmiths, University of London, University of Lincoln, Middlesex University and the University of Roehampton), ARIES (partnership offering environmental science research with University of Essex, University of Kent, University of Plymouth and Royal Holloway University), as well as CHASE (collaboration providing humanities training with Birkbeck, University of London, Goldsmiths, University of London, The Courtauld Institute of Art, The Open University, SOAS, University of London, University of Essex, University of Kent and the University of Sussex).

===Admissions===

UEA had the joint twenty-fifth highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2015, with new students averaging 407 UCAS points, equivalent to ABBbc in A-Level grades. In 2014, the ratio of applications to acceptances was 5.9 to 1. According to the 2017 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 10.5% of East Anglia&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools.

=== Grade distribution and inflation ===
Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) showed that UEA has one of the highest proportions of First Class and Upper Second Class degrees achieved by students with more than Oxford and Cambridge. Only three universities in the United Kingdom have been awarded a higher proportion of First Class degrees than UEA between the academic years 2014/15 and 2017/18. There is a concern about grade inflation with the degrees awarded by English universities, with the University of East Anglia awarding 35.7% First Class degrees, 52.1% Upper Seconds (2:1), 11.2% Lower Seconds (2:2) and 1% Third Class degrees in 2016/17.

===Rankings and reputation===
The results of the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, published on 12 May 2022, showed that over 91% of the university&#x27;s research activity was deemed to be &quot;world leading&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot; with more than 47% having the highest category of 4* of World Leading Research, significantly higher than the national average of 41%. UEA was ranked thirteenth in the UK for the quality of its research outputs and twentieth overall amongst all mainstream British institutions – a rise of nine places since the last assessment in 2014. The university ranks in the Top 1% worldwide according to the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; world rankings, and within the world Top 100 for research excellence in the Leiden Ranking, with UEA &quot;often out-performing Russell Group universities&quot;. In 2022, UEA was ranked within the Top 50 globally for research citations by the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; world rankings. In 2012, UEA was named the tenth best university in the world under 50-years-old and third best within the UK. In 2017, the university was rated &quot;gold&quot; by the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) for quality of teaching. In the 2023 TEF assessment, UEA&#x27;s award was revised to &quot;silver&quot;.

In national league tables, UEA has been ranked within the Top 20 by &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot;. In April 2013, the university was ranked first for student experience according to the &quot;Times Higher Education Magazine&quot;. In the 2014 &quot;National Student Survey&quot;, UEA was jointly classified with the University of Exeter, the University of Law and the University of Buckingham as the UK&#x27;s second most successful university in terms of student ratings, with a learner satisfaction level of 92%. In 2020, UEA had a joint third position with Exeter University on the survey with a score of 91%, ahead of Oxford and Cambridge. The 2024 survey results featured comments from students noting university staff as &quot;knowledgeable, passionate and supportive&quot; with 100% positivity scores in certain subject areas such as Physics, Liberal Arts, and Chemistry. UEA was also ranked first nationally for graduate job prospects by students in the 2022 &quot;Student Crowd Survey&quot;, with several schools achieving a 100% score of graduates in employment in the 2023 HESA survey, including Norwich Medical School, the School of Chemistry, and the School of Social Work and Psychology.

All students at the university and INTO UEA automatically become members of the union but do have the right to opt out of membership. Membership confers the ability to take part in the union&#x27;s activities such as clubs and societies and being involved in the democratic processes of the union. The union is a democratic organisation run by its members via an elected student officer committee and student council. It is affiliated to the National Union of Students, and also campaigns on a wide range of issues, as directed by the democratic processes. 

The UEA Student Union has over 200 clubs and societies; university sports teams include the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Football Clubs and Lacrosse Teams (UEA Eagles), a Korfball Team (UEA Tigers), a British Universities American Football League (BUAFC) Premier South Division American Football Team (UEA Pirates), and the cheer dance and stunt society (UEA Angels). The UEA Media Collective encompasses the free student newspaper &quot;Concrete&quot;, &quot;UEA:TV&quot; (previously named &quot;Nexus UTV&quot;), and the student radio station &quot;Livewire 1350AM&quot;. Norwich Medical School also has various active medical societies.

The UEA Student Union hosted events like Pimp My Barrow, which was an annual fundraising event for the Big C Cancer Charity and ran from 2006 to 2019. Students acquired a wheelbarrow and decorated it in accordance with their team&#x27;s theme. They were then paraded around the local area, via a selection of local pubs and with a wheelbarrow race through Eaton Park. The annual Derby Day sports event involves UEA taking on the University of Essex in approximately 40 sports. UEA won the Derby Day trophy from 2013 to 2018. The UEA Student Union organises gigs and club nights at the Lower Common Room in Union House.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.ueaticketbookings.co.uk/venues/default.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The union also runs the Waterfront venue, off campus in Norwich&#x27;s King Street, which was awarded a Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) award in 2018 for engagement with alumni. Acts that have performed at these venues include Captain Beefheart, The Cure, Coldplay, Pere Ubu, U2, Haim, The Smiths, Sparks, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead and Iron Maiden. The union operates a number of other services within Union House which underwent a refurbishment in 2015 after a £6m investment.

<doc id="197030" wikidata="Q192315" url="?curid=197030" title="Pierre Gassendi">
<text>Pierre Gassendi (; also Pierre Gassend, Petrus Gassendi, Petrus Gassendus; 22 January 1592 – 24 October 1655) was a French philosopher, Catholic priest, astronomer, and mathematician. While he held a church position in south-east France, he also spent much time in Paris, where he was a leader of a group of free-thinking intellectuals. He was also an active observational scientist, publishing the first data on the transit of Mercury in 1631. The lunar crater Gassendi is named after him.

He wrote numerous philosophical works, and some of the positions he worked out are considered significant, finding a way between skepticism and dogmatism. Richard Popkin indicates that Gassendi was one of the first thinkers to formulate the modern &quot;scientific outlook&quot;, of moderated skepticism and empiricism. He clashed with his contemporary Descartes on the possibility of certain knowledge. His best known intellectual project attempted to reconcile Epicurean atomism with Christianity.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Gassendi was born at Champtercier, near Digne, in France to Antoine Gassend and Françoise Fabry. His earliest education was entrusted to his maternal uncle, Thomas Fabry, the curé of the church of Champtercier. A youthful prodigy, at a very early age he showed academic potential and attended the collège (the town high school) at Digne, where he displayed a particular aptitude for languages and mathematics. In 1609 he entered the University of Aix-en-Provence, to study philosophy under Philibert Fesaye, O.Carm. at the Collège Royal de Bourbon (the Faculty of Arts of the University of Aix). In 1612 the college of Digne called him to lecture on theology. While at Digne, he travelled to Senez, where he received minor orders from Bishop Jacques Martin. In 1614 he received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Avignon, and was elected Theologian in the Cathedral Chapter of Digne. On 1 August 1617 he received holy orders from Bishop Jacques Turricella of Marseille. In the same year, at the age of 24, he accepted the chair of philosophy at the University of Aix-en-Provence, and yielded the chair of theology to his old teacher, Fesaye. Gassendi seems gradually to have withdrawn from theology. He maintained his position as Canon Theologian at Digne, however, and in September 1619, when Bishop Raphaël de Bologne took possession of the diocese of Digne, Gassendi participated and made the speech on behalf of the Chapter.

He lectured principally on the Aristotelian philosophy, conforming as far as possible to the traditional methods while he also followed with interest the discoveries of Galileo and Kepler. He came into contact with the astronomer Joseph Gaultier de la Vallette (1564–1647), the Grand Vicar of the Archbishopric of Aix.

=== Priesthood ===

In 1623 the Society of Jesus took over the University of Aix. They filled all positions with Jesuits, so Gassendi was required to find another institution. He left, returning to Digne on 10 February 1623, and then returned to Aix to witness an eclipse of the moon on 14 April and the presence of Mars in Sagittarius on 7 June, from which he returned again to Digne. He travelled to Grenoble on behalf of the Chapter of Digne for a lawsuit, most reluctantly, since he was working on his project on Aristotle&#x27;s paradoxes. In 1624 he printed the first part of his . A fragment of the second book later appeared in print at The Hague (1659), but Gassendi never composed the remaining five, apparently thinking that the &quot;Discussiones Peripateticae&quot; of Francesco Patrizzi left little scope for him.

He spent some time with his patron Nicolas Peiresc. After 1628 Gassendi travelled in Flanders and in Holland where he encountered Isaac Beeckman and François Luillier. He returned to France in 1631. In 1634 the Cathedral Chapter of Digne had become disgusted at the wasteful behavior of Provost Blaise Ausset, and they voted to replace him. They obtained an arrêt of the Parliament of Aix, dated 19 December 1634, which consented to his deposition and to the election of Gassendi as provost of the Cathedral Chapter. Gassendi was formally installed on 24 December 1634. He held the Provostship until his death in 1655.

During this time he wrote some works, at the insistence of Marin Mersenne. They included his examination of the mystical philosophy of Robert Fludd, an essay on parhelia, and some observations on the transit of Mercury.

=== 1640s ===

Gassendi then spent some years travelling through Provence with the duke of Angoulême, governor of the region. During this period he wrote only the one literary work, his &quot;Life&quot; of Peiresc, whose death in 1637 seemed to afflict him deeply; it received frequent reprintings and an English translation. He returned to Paris in 1641, where he met Thomas Hobbes. He gave some informal philosophy classes, gaining pupils or disciples; according to the biographer Grimarest, these included Molière, Cyrano de Bergerac (whose participation in classes is disputed), Jean Hesnault and Claude-Emmanuel Chapelle, son of Lullier.

In 1640 Mersenne engaged him in controversy with René Descartes. His objections to the fundamental propositions of Descartes appeared in print in 1641; they appear as the Fifth Set of Objections in the works of Descartes and as a separate edition entitled with rejoinders. Though Descartes is often credited with the discovery of the mind-body problem, Gassendi, reacting to Descartes&#x27; mind-body dualism, was the first to state it. Gassendi&#x27;s tendency towards the empirical school of speculation appears more pronounced here than in any of his other writings. Jean-Baptiste Morin attacked his &quot;De motu impresso a motore translato&quot; (1642). In 1643 Mersenne also tried to garner support from the German Socinian and advocate of religious tolerance Marcin Ruar. Ruar replied at length that he had already read Gassendi but was in favour of leaving science to science not to the church.

In 1645 he accepted the chair of mathematics in the Collège Royal in Paris, and lectured for several years with great success. In addition to controversial writings on physical questions, there appeared during this period the first of the works for which historians of philosophy remember him. In 1647 he published the well-received treatise &quot;De vita, moribus, et doctrina Epicuri libri octo&quot;. Two years later appeared his commentary on the tenth book of Diogenes Laërtius. In the same year he had published the more important commentary &quot;Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri&quot;.

In 1648 ill-health compelled him to give up his lectures at the Collège Royal. Around this time he became reconciled to Descartes, after years of coldness, through the good offices of César d&#x27;Estrées.

=== Death and memorial ===

Gassendi travelled in the south of France in the company of his protégé, aide and secretary François Bernier, another pupil from Paris. He spent nearly two years at Toulon, where the climate suited him. In 1653 he returned to Paris and resumed his literary work, living in the house of Montmor, publishing in that year lives of Copernicus and of Tycho Brahe. The disease from which he suffered, a lung complaint, had, however, established a firm hold on him. His strength gradually failed, and he died at Paris in 1655. A bronze statue of him (by Joseph Ramus) was erected by subscription at Digne in 1852. 
A large crater on the Moon is named after him.

==Scientific achievements==
As part of his promotion of empirical methods and his anti-Aristotelian and anti-Cartesian views, Gassendi was responsible for a number of scientific &#x27;firsts&#x27;:
*He explained parhelia in 1629 as due to ice crystals.
*In 1631, Gassendi became the first person to observe the transit of a planet across the Sun, viewing the transit of Mercury that Kepler had predicted. In December of the same year, he watched for the transit of Venus, but this event occurred when it was night time in Paris.
*Use of camera obscura to gauge the apparent diameter of the Moon.
*Dropping a stone from the mast of a ship (in &quot;De motu&quot;) conserves horizontal momentum, removing an objection to the rotation of the Earth.
*Measurement of speed of sound (to about 25% accuracy), showing that it is invariant of pitch.
*Satisfactory interpretation of Pascal&#x27;s Puy-de-Dôme experiment with a barometer in the late 1640s; this suggested a created vacuum is possible.
*He asserted and defended (in &quot;Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri&quot;, 1649, see Philosophical Writings below) the notion that matter is made of atoms, following Epicurus.

In addition to these achievements, Gassendi performed work on determining longitude via eclipses of the Moon and on improving the Rudolphine Tables. He addressed the issue of free fall in &quot;De motu&quot; (1642) and &quot;De proportione qua gravia decidentia accelerantur&quot; (1646).

== Writings ==
Edward Gibbon styled him &quot;Le meilleur philosophe des littérateurs, et le meilleur littérateur des philosophes&quot; (The greatest philosopher among literary men, and the greatest literary man among philosophers).

Henri Louis Habert de Montmor published Gassendi&#x27;s collected works, most importantly the &quot;Syntagma philosophicum&quot; (Opera, i. and ii.), in 1658 (6 vols., Lyons). Nicolaus Averanius published another edition, also in 6 folio volumes, in 1727. The first two comprise entirely his &quot;Syntagma philosophicum&quot;; the third contains his critical writings on Epicurus, Aristotle, Descartes, Robert Fludd and Herbert of Cherbury, with some occasional pieces on certain problems of physics; the fourth, his &quot;Institutio astronomica&quot;, and his &quot;Commentarii de rebus celestibus&quot;; the fifth, his commentary on the tenth book of Diogenes Laërtius, the biographies of Epicurus, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, Tycho Brahe, Nicolaus Copernicus, Georg von Peuerbach, and Regiomontanus, with some tracts on the value of ancient money, on the Roman calendar, and on the theory of music, with an appended large and prolix piece entitled &quot;Notitia ecclesiae Diniensis&quot;; the sixth volume contains his correspondence. The &quot;Lives&quot;, especially those of Copernicus, Tycho and Peiresc, received much praise.

=== &quot;Exercitationes&quot; ===

The &quot;Exercitationes&quot; excited much attention, though they contain little or nothing beyond what others had already advanced against Aristotle. The first book expounds clearly, and with much vigour, the evil effects of the blind acceptance of the Aristotelian &quot;dicta&quot; on physical and philosophical study; but, as occurs with so many of the anti-Aristotelian works of this period, the objections show the usual ignorance of Aristotle&#x27;s own writings. The second book, which contains the review of Aristotle&#x27;s dialectic or logic, throughout reflects Ramism in tone and method. One of the objections to Descartes became famous through Descartes&#x27;s statement of it in the appendix of objections in the &quot;Meditations&quot;.

=== &quot;Animadversiones&quot; ===

His book &quot;Animadversiones&quot;, published in 1649, contains a translation of Diogenes Laërtius, Book X on Epicurus, and appeared with a commentary, in the form of the &quot;Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri&quot;. His labors on Epicurus have historical importance, but he has been criticized for holding doctrines arguably irreconcilable with his strong expressions of empiricism.

In the book, Gassendi maintains his maxim &quot;that there is nothing in the intellect which has not been in the senses&quot; (&quot;nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu&quot;), but he contends that the imaginative faculty (&quot;phantasia&quot;) is the counterpart of sense, because it involves material images, and therefore is intrinsically material, and that it is essentially the same both in men and brutes. However, he also admits that the classic qualifier of humanity, intellect, which he affirms as immaterial and immortal, comes to an understanding of notions and truths that no effort of sensation or imagination could have attained (Op. ii. 383). Gassendi illustrates the capacity to form &quot;general notions&quot;; the conception of universality (ib. 384), which he says brutes never are able to partake in, though they utilize &quot;phantasia&quot; as truly as men; the notion of God, whom he says we may imagine as corporeal, but understand as incorporeal; and lastly, the reflex by which the mind makes the phenomena and operations within it the objects of its attention.

The English Epicurean Walter Charleton produced an English adaptation of this book, &quot;Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charletonia&quot;, in 1654.

=== &quot;Syntagma philosophicum&quot; ===

The &quot;Syntagma philosophicum&quot; is divided, according to the usual fashion of the Epicureans, into logic (which, with Gassendi, as with Epicurus, is truly canonic), physics, and ethics.

The logic contains a sketch of the history of the science &quot;De origine et varietate logicae&quot;, and is divided into theory of right apprehension (&quot;bene imaginari&quot;), theory of right judgment (&quot;bene proponere&quot;), theory of right inference (&quot;bene colligere&quot;), theory of right method (&quot;bene ordinare&quot;). The first part contains the specially empirical positions which Gassendi afterwards neglects or leaves out of account. The senses, the sole source of knowledge, supposedly yield us immediate cognition of individual things; phantasy (which Gassendi takes as material in nature) reproduces these ideas; understanding compares these ideas, each particular, and frames general ideas. Nevertheless, he admits that the senses yield knowledge—not of things—but of qualities only, and that we arrive at the idea of thing or substance by inductive reasoning. He holds that the true method of research is the analytic, rising from lower to higher notions; yet he sees and admits that inductive reasoning, as conceived by Francis Bacon, rests on a general proposition not itself proved by induction. The whole doctrine of judgment, syllogism and method mixes Aristotelian and Ramist notions.

In the second part of the &quot;Syntagma&quot;, the physics, appears the most glaring contradiction between Gassendi&#x27;s fundamental principles. While approving of the Epicurean physics, he rejects the Epicurean negation of God and particular providence. He states the various proofs for the existence of an immaterial, infinite, supreme Being, asserts that this Being is the author of the visible universe, and strongly defends the doctrine of the foreknowledge and particular providence of God. At the same time he holds, in opposition to Epicureanism, the doctrine of an immaterial rational soul, endowed with immortality and capable of free determination. Friedrich Albert Lange claimed that all this portion of Gassendi&#x27;s system contains nothing of his own opinions, but is introduced solely from motives of self-defence.

The positive exposition of atomism has much that is attractive, but the hypothesis of the &quot;calor vitalis&quot; (vital heat), a species of &quot;anima mundi&quot; (world-soul) which he introduces as a physical explanation of physical phenomena, does not seem to throw much light on the special problems which he invokes it to solve. Nor is his theory of the weight essential to atoms as being due to an inner force impelling them to motion in any way reconcilable with his general doctrine of mechanical causes.

In the third part, the ethics, over and above the discussion on freedom, which on the whole is indefinite, there is little beyond a milder statement of the Epicurean moral code. The final end of life is happiness, and happiness is harmony of soul and body (&quot;tranquillitas animi et indolentia corporis&quot;). Probably, Gassendi thinks, perfect happiness is not attainable in this life, but it may be in the life to come.

== Views ==

According to Gabriel Daniel, Gassendi was a little Pyrrhonian in matters of science; but that was no bad thing. He wrote against the magical animism of Robert Fludd, and judicial astrology. He became dissatisfied with the Peripatetic system, the orthodox approach to natural philosophy based on the writings of Aristotle. Gassendi shared an empirical tendency of the age. He contributed to the objections against Aristotelian philosophy, but waited to publish his own thoughts.

There remains some controversy as to the extent to which Gassendi subscribed to the so-called &quot;libertinage érudit&quot;, the learned free-thinking that characterised the &quot;Tétrade&quot;, the Parisian circle to which he belonged, along with Gabriel Naudé and two others (Élie Diodati and François de La Mothe Le Vayer). Gassendi, at least, belonged to the fideist wing of the sceptics, arguing that the absence of certain knowledge implied the room for faith.

In his dispute with Descartes he did apparently hold that the evidence of the senses remains the only convincing evidence; yet he maintains, as is natural from his mathematical training, that the evidence of reason is absolutely satisfactory.

=== Vegetarianism ===
Gassendi acknowledged that while the complete realisation of the continual pursuit of ultimate pleasure through communion with God might not occur in one&#x27;s lifetime, he argued against the consumption of meat, considering it a significant obstacle to achieving a divine vision. Drawing support from scripture and the natural world, he envisioned a restored paradise where humans and animals coexisted in peaceful dominion, contrary to the tyranny displayed in the butchering of animals for pleasure.

Gassendi supported his case for vegetarianism with arguments from medicine, history, and scripture. Inspired by Neoplatonic vegetarians and early Christian thinkers, he aligned vegetarianism with Christian doctrines, emphasizing the immortality of the soul. Gassendi, a Catholic priest, advocated for a plant-based diet without dogmatism, asserting that decisions in this lifetime were crucial for preparing the body and mind for the next. He admired the historical virtue of vegetarian practitioners and urged scholars to extract and follow the best ideas from throughout history, asserting that, especially among humanists, a vegetarian lifestyle should be embraced.

Gassendi himself was not a vegetarian, but admitted that &quot;if I were wise, I would abandon [meat] bit by bit, and nourish myself solely on the gifts on the earth ... I do not doubt that I would be happier for longer and more constantly in better health.&quot;

== Early commentary ==

Samuel Sorbière, a disciple, recounts Gassendi&#x27;s life in the first collected edition of the works, by Joseph Bougerel, &quot;Vie de Gassendi&quot; (1737; 2nd ed., 1770); as does Jean Philibert Damiron, &quot;Mémoire sur Gassendi&quot; (1839). An abridgment of his philosophy was given by his friend, the celebrated traveller, François Bernier (&quot;Abrégé de la philosophie de Gassendi&quot;, 8 vols., 1678; 2nd ed., 7 vols., 1684).

<text>Mencius (; ) was a Chinese Confucian philosopher, often described as the Second Sage () to reflect his traditional esteem relative to Confucius himself. He was part of Confucius&#x27;s fourth generation of disciples, inheriting his ideology and developing it further. Living during the Warring States period, he is said to have spent much of his life travelling around the states offering counsel to different rulers. Conversations with these rulers form the basis of the &quot;Mencius&quot;, which would later be canonised as a Confucian classic.

One primary principle of his work is that human nature is righteous and humane. The responses of citizens to the policies of rulers embodies this principle, and a state with righteous and humane policies will flourish by nature. The citizens, with freedom from good rule, will then allocate time to caring for their wives, brothers, elders, and children, and be educated with rites and naturally become better citizens. This placed him at odds with his near contemporary, Xunzi, who believed that human nature is evil by birth.
==Life==
Mencius was born Meng Ke in the state of Zou, in what is now Zoucheng, Shandong. He was an itinerant philosopher and sage, and one of the principal interpreters of Confucianism. He was supposedly a pupil of Confucius&#x27;s grandson Zisi (). Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform. During the Warring States period (221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the Jixia Academy in the state of Qi from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his filial piety when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother&#x27;s death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.

Mencius was buried in the Cemetery of Mencius (), located to the northeast of Zoucheng&#x27;s central urban area. A stele carried by a giant stone tortoise and crowned with dragons stands in front of his grave.

===Mother===
Mencius&#x27;s mother is often held up as an exemplary female figure in Chinese culture. One of the most famous traditional &quot;chengyu&quot; is ); this saying refers to the legend that Mencius&#x27;s mother moved houses three times before finding a location that she felt was suitable for the child&#x27;s upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of finding the proper environment for raising children.

Mencius&#x27;s father Meng Ji () died when Mencius was very young. His mother Meng Mu (), born Zhang (), raised her son alone. They were very poor. At first they lived by a cemetery, where the mother found her son imitating the paid mourners in funeral processions. Therefore, the mother decided to move. The next house was near a market in the town. There the boy began to imitate the cries of butchers. So the mother moved to a house next to a school. Inspired by the scholars and students, Mencius began to study. His mother decided to remain, and Mencius became a scholar.

Another story further illustrates the emphasis that Mencius&#x27;s mother placed on her son&#x27;s education. As the story goes, once when Mencius was young, he was a truant. His mother responded to his apparent disregard for his education by taking up a pair of scissors and cutting the cloth she had been weaving in front of him. This was intended to illustrate that one cannot stop a task midway, and her example inspired Mencius to be diligent in his studies.

There is another legend about his mother and his wife, involving a time when his wife was at home alone and was discovered by Mencius not to be sitting properly. Mencius thought his wife had violated a rite, and demanded a divorce. His mother claimed that it was written in &quot;The Book of Rites&quot; that before a person entered a room, he should announce his imminent presence loudly to let others prepare for his arrival; as he had not done that in this case, the person who had violated the rite was Mencius himself. Eventually Mencius admitted his fault.

She is one of 125 women of which biographies have been included in the &quot;Biographies of Exemplary Women&quot;, written by Liu Xiang.

== Key ideas ==

===Human nature===
Mencius expounds on the concept that the human is naturally righteous and humane. It is the influence of society that causes bad moral character. Mencius describes this in the context of educating rulers and citizens about the nature of man. &quot;He who exerts his mind to the utmost knows his nature&quot; and &quot;the way of learning is none other than finding the lost mind.&quot;

=== The four beginnings ===
To show innate goodness, Mencius used the example of a child falling down a well.
Human nature has an innate tendency towards goodness, but moral rightness cannot be instructed down to the last detail. This is why merely external controls always fail in improving society. True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments. Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others. This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi, who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not need cultivation, they just needed to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness. The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism. Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one&#x27;s natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence (&quot;ren&quot;).

===Education===

According to Mencius, education must awaken the innate abilities of the human mind. He denounced memorization and advocated active interrogation of the text, saying &quot;One who believes all of a book would be better off without books&quot; (, from ). One should check for internal consistency by comparing sections and debate the probability of factual accounts by comparing them with experience.

===Destiny===
Mencius also believed in the power of Destiny in shaping the roles of human beings in society. What is destined cannot be contrived by the human intellect or foreseen. Destiny is shown when a path arises that is both unforeseen and constructive. Destiny should not be confused with Fate. Mencius denied that Heaven would protect a person regardless of his actions, saying, &quot;One who understands Destiny will not stand beneath a tottering wall&quot;. The proper path is one which is natural and unforced. This path must also be maintained because, &quot;Unused pathways are covered with weeds.&quot; One who follows Destiny will live a long and successful life. One who rebels against Destiny will die before his time.

===Politics and economics===

Mencius emphasized the significance of the common citizens in the state. While Confucianism generally regards rulers highly, he argued that it is acceptable for the subjects to overthrow or even kill a ruler who ignores the people&#x27;s needs and rules harshly. This is because a ruler who does not rule justly is no longer a true ruler. Speaking of the overthrow of the wicked King Zhou of Shang, Mencius said, &quot;I have merely heard of killing a villain Zhou, but I have not heard of murdering [him as] the ruler.&quot;

This saying should not be taken as an instigation to violence against authorities but as an application of Confucian philosophy to society. Confucianism requires a clarification of what may be reasonably expected in any given relationship. All relationships should be beneficial, but each has its own principle or inner logic. A ruler must justify his position by acting benevolently before he can expect reciprocation from the people. In this view, a king is like a steward. Although Confucius admired kings of great accomplishment, Mencius is clarifying the proper hierarchy of human society. Although a king has presumably higher status than a commoner, he is actually subordinate to the masses of people and the resources of society. Otherwise, there would be an implied disregard of the potential of human society heading into the future. One is significant only for what one gives, not for what one takes.

Mencius distinguished between superior men who recognize and follow the virtues of righteousness and benevolence and inferior men who do not. He suggested that superior men considered only righteousness, not benefits. That assumes &quot;permanent property&quot; to uphold common morality. To secure benefits for the disadvantaged and the aged, he advocated free trade, low tax rates, and a more equal sharing of the tax burden.

In regards to the Confucian perspective of the marketplace, more about Confucius’ thoughts from Mencius than from the philosopher himself are learned. The government should have a mostly hands-off approach regarding the marketplace. This was in part, to prevent state-run monopolies, however, it was also the state&#x27;s responsibility to protect against future monopolies that might come into existence. Mencius also advocated for no taxes on imports; the market was to exchange for what you lacked so taxing merchants importing goods would ultimately hurt the villagers. The thought behind this is that people are inherently good and rational and can be trusted to regulate themselves, so price gouging or deception would not be an issue. Taxes on the property were acceptable and to be the only means by which the dukes and states would collect money. They did not need to collect much because taxes were only for supplemental funds. These taxes were also progressive, meaning the families that owned larger, more fertile pieces of land would pay more than the families with uniform land allotments. Scarcity is an issue in any market; however, Mencius emphasizes the reframing of the idea of a scarce resource. Instead of scarce, resources are to be seen as abundant. Resources are gained through work ethic not by any other means so there are no unfair competitions or gains. To preserve these natural resources, they needed to be used or harvested according to their cycles of growth or replenishing. In many cases, posterity has priority over profit.

==Influence==

Mencius&#x27;s interpretation of Confucianism has generally been considered the orthodox version by subsequent Chinese philosophers, especially by the Neo-Confucians of the Song dynasty. Mencius&#x27;s disciples included a large number of feudal lords, and he is said to have been more influential than Confucius had been.

The &quot;Mencius&quot; is one of the Four Books that Zhu Xi (1130–1200) grouped as the core of orthodox Neo-Confucian thought. In contrast to the sayings of Confucius, which are short and self-contained, the &quot;Mencius&quot; consists of long dialogues, including arguments, with extensive prose. It was generally neglected by the Jesuit missionaries who first translated the Confucian canon into Latin and other European languages, as they felt that the Neo-Confucian school largely consisted of Buddhist and Taoist contamination of Confucianism. Matteo Ricci also particularly disliked what they had believed to be condemnation of celibacy as unfilial, which is rather a mistranslation of a similar word referring more to aspects of personality. François Noël, who felt that Zhu&#x27;s ideas represented a natural and native development of Confucius&#x27;s thought, was the first to publish a full edition of the &quot;Mencius&quot; at Prague in 1711 as the Chinese Rites controversy had been recently decided against the Jesuits; however, his edition attained little influence outside central and eastern Europe.

==Mencius Institute==
The first Mencius Institute (a research and educational academic institute in theoretical Confucianism) was established in Xuzhou, China in 2008 under a collaboration between Jiangsu Normal University, China Zoucheng Heritage Tourism Bureau, and Xuzhou Mengshi Clan Friendship Network.

First Mencius Institute outside of China is located at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) Kampar Campus, Malaysia in 2016.

<doc id="197034" wikidata="Q770974" url="?curid=197034" title="Greek chorus">
<text>A Greek chorus () in the context of ancient Greek tragedy, comedy, satyr plays, is a homogeneous group of performers, who comment with a collective voice on the action of the scene they appear in, or provide necessary insight into action which has taken place offstage. Historically, the chorus consisted of between 12 and 50 players, who variously danced, sang or spoke their lines in unison, and sometimes wore masks.

== History ==
A common theory for the origin of the Greek chorus stems from the ancient Greek poet Arion&#x27;s invention of the tragedy, the stationary chorus, and satyrs&#x27; verses. In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics,&quot; he writes that &quot;[Tragedy&#x27;s] beginnings, certainly, were in improvisation [autoschediastikês], as were also those for comedy, tragedy originating in impromptus by the leaders of dithyrambic choruses, and comedy in those of the leaders of the phallic performances which still remain customary in many cities.&quot;

The role of the chorus fluctuated. For example, Aeschylus foregrounded the dialogue by increasing the number of actors and reducing the role of the chorus in his works. They also played a role in the Athenian polis, with members of a chorus forming life-long bonds as they performed this civic duty.

It is thought that choruses had their start in Dionysian dithyrambs, hymns and dances in honor Dionysus, and then other characters began to be incorporated. Satyr-plays were then added to the beginning of performances to make certain that Dionysus continued to be honored.

The Greek playwrights of the 5th century paid homage to the chorus&#x27; musical and choreographic origins. They did so by incorporating dance and sung odes into their work. For example, Aeschylus and Euripides either composed accompaniments to their own tragedies or had accompaniments commissioned, and Sophocles accompanied at least one of his plays on the cithara, an ancient lyre-like instrument.

German poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller also tried to use the chorus in his tragedy &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot;. After it was performed in March 1803 at Weimar, the performance was celebrated by students but
denounced by critics. They specifically critiqued his use of the chorus. German poet Schiller Carlyle said that &quot;the chorus retarded the plot, dissipating and diffusing the sympathies.&quot;

In 1910, Sir William Ridgeway published The Origin of Tragedy, in which he argued that as Greek tragedy originated from the dithyramb, the tragic genre itself stemmed from Dionysian traditions.

==Dramatic function==
All of the extant plays of the ancient Greek theatre include a chorus that offered a variety of background and summary information to help the audience follow the performance. They commented on themes, and, as August Wilhelm Schlegel proposed in the early 19th century to subsequent controversy, demonstrated how the audience might react to the drama. According to Schlegel, the Chorus is &quot;the ideal spectator&quot;, and conveys to the actual spectator &quot;a lyrical and musical expression of his own emotions, and elevates him to the region of contemplation&quot;.

In the Greek tragedy, the chorus makes their first entrance in the &quot;parados&quot;, or the song performed by the chorus upon their entrance into the performance. Throughout the tragedy, episodes, where characters and chorus converse, and stasima, where the chorus performs a &quot;stasimon&quot; (choral ode), at the end of each episode to summarize and contextualize events, are interspersed. In the &quot;exodus&quot;, or the play&#x27;s final scene, the chorus performs a song imparting some message or moral before exiting. Paul Woodruff argues that the chorus most often expresses grief simultaneously with the main characters, calling them &quot;grief-leaders&quot;.

Some historians argue that the chorus was itself considered to be an actor. Scholar Albert Weiner considers that it is better when a chorus is &quot;integrated into the fabric of the play&quot; and more resembles a unified character. Since Euripides&#x27; choruses seem less unified, Sophocles&#x27; choruses more often received praise, and Euripides&#x27; choruses criticized for having little to do with the plot. Aristotle stated in his &quot;Poetics&quot;:

The chorus represents, on stage, the general population of the particular story, in sharp contrast with many of the themes of the ancient Greek plays which tended to be about individual heroes, gods, and goddesses. They were often the same gender as the main character. In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, the chorus comprises the elderly men of Argos, whereas in Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, they are a group of eastern bacchantes, and in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Electra&quot;, the chorus represents the women of Argos. In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, however, the chorus takes the part of a host of avenging Furies.

In some cases, the greek chorus was used as an intermediary between their represented population and the audience, particularly in terms of moral evaluation. In Seneca&#x27;s Thyestes, the chorus details the offstage events of the play in gruesome detail, specifically creating visceral descriptions of the murders of Thyestes&#x27; sons, evoking disgust on behalf of the immoral behavior of Atreus.

In the same play, the chorus is thought to have agency in communicating the themes of the play, making imagistic references to hunger by way of communicating themes of desire, which in Thyestes manifests by way of literal hunger and consumption, but also in the pursuit of revenge. Despite serving as clarifying voices, the greek chorus is not always omniscient; the knowledge they lack sometimes speak to a distance in status between the chorus and a protagonist by way of emphasizing the position of the latter. The chorus thus comes not only to represent the hierarchical positioning of the general Greek society at the time, but their text provides insight into political thoughts and ideals. In reference to Atreus, the text spoken by the chorus oscillates between positive, negative, and neutral connotations; they critique the monarchy, but prescribe necessary points of indifference to the king at hand. Their text can thus be mined into in order to gain insight into the political and societal situations of the time, with particular obedience to the position of the general member of society.

In the surviving tragedies, the choruses represent:
Aeschylus:
* &quot;Agamemnon&quot; – Elders of Argos
* &quot;The Eumenides&quot; – Furies
* &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; – Enslaved Women
* &quot;The Persians&quot; – Elders of Susa

* &quot;Antigone&quot; – Elders of Thebes
* &quot;Electra&quot; – Mycenaean Women
* &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; – Elders of Colonus
* &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; – Elders of Thebae
* &quot;Philoctetes&quot; – Sailors of Neoptolemus
* &quot;Women of Trachis&quot; – Trachinian Women

* &quot;Ion&quot; – Women in the Service of Creusa
* &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; – Chalcidian Women
* &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; – Enslaved Greek Women in Taurica
* &quot;Medea&quot; – Corinthian Women
* &quot;Orestes&quot; – Argive Women
* &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot; – Phoenician Women
* &quot;Rhesus&quot; – Trojan Sentinels
* &quot;The Suppliants&quot; – Mothers and Sons of the Fallen Thebans
* &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; – Trojan Noble Women
==Choral structure and size==
No record beyond the words of the script has survived to describe what an ancient Greek audience might have seen and heard during a performance of a choral ode, but a study of those words, including etymology and other even more decisive evidence, makes it possible to derive a general idea that a performance of choral ode was a mix of lyric poetry, dancing and singing joined together with drama. According to scholar H. D. F. Kitto: &quot;The Greek verb &quot;choreuo&quot;, &#x27;I am a member of the chorus&#x27;, has the sense &#x27;I am dancing&#x27;. The word &quot;ode&quot; means not something recited or declaimed, but &#x27;a song. The large section of the stage where the chorus danced and sang is the &#x27;orchestra&#x27; which is translated to mean a &#x27;dancing floor&#x27;.

The lines of choral odes provide evidence that they were sung. Normal syllabic structure has long sounds that are twice the length of short sounds. However, some lyrics in Greek odes have long syllables that are equal to 3, 4 and 5 shorter syllables. Spoken words cannot do that, suggesting that this was a danced and sung rhythm.

The chorus consisted of fifty members at the start of the 5th century B.C. It was likely Aeschylus who lowered the number to twelve, and Sophocles who raised it to fifteen. The size stayed at fifteen to the end of the 5th century B.C. Fifteen members were used by Euripides and Sophocles in tragedies. There were twenty-four members in comedies.

In terms of gender, starting from the 8th century BC, there are depictions of female ensembles or female members performing alongside men in mixed choruses. However, these examples disappear by the 5th century. There is not a lot of evidence in Greek literature for female choruses. Much of it is indirect reference, which scholars have then parsed for clues.

For example, Euripides&#x27; character Electra complains about her inability to perform in a chorus and festivals. In other examples, poets and playwrights use the term &quot;choros&quot; to refer to female group performances. Although this usage existed, it was not common. Plato referred to women dancing Corybantic dances with choral language, but contextual evidence indicates to scholars Budelmann and Power that he does not regard it on the same level as traditional Greek choruses. Additionally, both Sophocles and Pausanias refer to the Thyiades as a &quot;choros.&quot;

Budelmann and Power agree with the mainstream conclusion that female choruses were a minor part of Greek choral culture, but posit that these ensembles did exist outside of the civic performances dominated by traditional Greek choruses. They were not allowed to perform at major events like the City Dionysia, where female characters were instead portrayed by male ensemble members. Instead, they performed at &quot;polis&quot; festivals, private performances, female-only festivals, and outside urban areas.

Female &quot;choreia&quot; at private performances included the &quot;dekatê&quot; and weddings&quot;. T&quot;he &quot;dekatê,&quot; or the tenth day after birth where the child is given a name, were generally small-scale events attended by close friends and family. Greek weddings during the time period featured dancing and singing by both genders, together and separately, but were very different from formal choral performances.

Female &quot;choreia&quot; also existed outside of Athens, but performances were segregated by gender. Plutarch and Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Lysistrata&quot; both refer to women dancing at Kolias in the Classical period, in honour of Demeter and Aphrodite, respectively.

==Stage management==
The chorus performed using several techniques, including singing, dancing, narrating, and acting. There is evidence that there were strong rhythmic components to their speaking.

They often communicated in song form, but sometimes spoke their lines in unison. The chorus had to work in unison to help explain the play as there were only one to three actors on stage who were already playing several parts each. As the Greek theatres were so large, the chorus&#x27; actions had to be exaggerated and their voices clear so that everyone could see and hear them. To do this, they used techniques such as synchronization, echo, ripple, physical theatre and the use of masks to aid them. A Greek chorus was often led by a &quot;coryphaeus&quot;. They also served as the ancient equivalent for a curtain, as their &quot;parodos&quot; (entering procession) signified the beginnings of a play and their &quot;exodos&quot; (exit procession) served as the curtains closing.

The layout of ancient Greek theatres had an orchestra component, quite literally &quot;dancing space&quot;, which were generally flat. There, the chorus would perform and interact with the actors. Originally, these spaces were simply dirt, but transitioned to paved ground in the Classical period, sometimes with marble. These orchestra areas sometimes also featured a &quot;thymele&quot;, or altar.

==Decline in antiquity==
Before the introduction of multiple, interacting actors by Aeschylus, the Greek chorus was the main performer in relation to a solitary actor. The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century BCE, when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action. Later dramatists depended on the chorus less than their predecessors. As dialogue and characterization became more important, the chorus made less of an appearance. However, historian Alan Hughes argues that there was no such thing as decline, but rather the slow dissolution of one form into another: 

==Modern choruses==
Musical theatre and grand opera sometimes incorporate a singing chorus that serves a similar purpose as the Greek chorus, as noted in &quot;Six Plays by Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot;: &quot;The singing chorus is used frequently to interpret the mental and emotional reactions of the principal characters, after the manner of a Greek chorus.&quot; The idea of the greek chorus as a tactic in musical theatre is significant in winner of the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, A Strange Loop, in which six &quot;Thoughts&quot; follow around the protagonist, Usher, and represent his &quot;perceptions of reality&quot;.

During the Italian Renaissance, there was a renewed interest in the theatre of ancient Greece. The Florentine Camerata crafted the first operas out of the intermezzi that acted as comic or musical relief during the dramas of the time. These were based entirely on the Greek chorus, as historian H.C. Montgomery argues.

Richard Wagner discussed Greek drama and the Greek chorus extensively in his writings, including &quot;Art and Revolution&quot;. His longest work, &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;) is based in the style of &quot;Oresteia&quot; with parallels in rhythm and overall structure (both have three parts, with the exception of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, the prelude to &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;). Montgomery also argues that Wagner&#x27;s use of the orchestra is similar to the Greek chorus as both generally conclude the drama of the plot, &quot;bridg[ing] the space from the dramatic action back to every-day life.&quot;

The musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; features a modern version of a Greek Chorus in the form of characters Crystal, Ronnette, and Chiffon, whose songs provide narration to the play.

A Greek chorus is also used in the Woody Allen film &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;, in which the chorus gives advice to the neurotic main character.

<doc id="197036" wikidata="Q5020798" url="?curid=197036" title="1996 California Proposition 215">
<text>Proposition 215, or the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, is a California law permitting the use of medical cannabis despite marijuana&#x27;s lack of the normal Food and Drug Administration testing for safety and efficacy. It was enacted, on November 5, 1996, by means of the initiative process, and passed with 5,382,915 (55.6%) votes in favor and 4,301,960 (44.4%) against.

The proposition was a statewide voter initiative authored by Dennis Peron, Anna Boyce RN, John Entwistle, Jr., Valerie Corral, Dale Gieringer, Attorney William Panzer, medical marijuana activist and founder of the L.A. Cannabis Resource Center Scott Tracy Imler, attorney Leo Paoli and psychiatrist Tod H. Mikuriya, and approved by California voters. It allows patients with a valid doctor&#x27;s recommendation, and the patients&#x27; designated Primary Caregivers, to possess and cultivate marijuana for personal medical use, and has since been expanded to protect a growing system of collective and cooperative distribution. The Act added Section 11362.5 to the California Health and Safety Code. California Proposition 215 was the first medical marijuana ballot initiative passed at the state level; causing a conflict in the United States between states&#x27; rights advocates and those who support a stronger federal presence.

== Yes on 215 Campaign ==
Proposition 215 was conceived by San Francisco marijuana activist Dennis Peron in memory of his partner, Jonathan West, who had used marijuana to treat symptoms of AIDS. In 1991, Peron organized Proposition P, the San Francisco medical marijuana initiative, which passed with 79% of the vote. Prop P did not have force of law, but was simply a resolution declaring the city&#x27;s support for medical marijuana. Santa Cruz and other cities followed suit with similar measures endorsing medical use of marijuana. The California legislature went on to approve medical marijuana bills advocated by Anna Boyce within the California Senior Legislature and supported by State Senator Milton Marks and Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, but they were vetoed by Governor Pete Wilson. Dennis Peron, suffering from his own personal ill health, worked closely with Dr. Tod Mikuriya to organize Proposition 215. Dr. Mikuriya had worked to decriminalize cannabis and declassify cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance. Dr. Mikuriya spoke worldwide during the 1980s and 1990s in an effort to garner support for the medical use of cannabis. Threats to Dennis Peron would cause Peron to leave the United States following the passage of Proposition 215. Meanwhile, the federal government&#x27;s interagency Task Force, in conjunction with the resources of California&#x27;s Attorney General and California&#x27;s Medical Board, pursued any physician willing to recommend cannabis for medicinal reasons. More than 15 medical doctors would be forced to fight to keep their medical licenses.

Frustrated by the Governor&#x27;s veto and by the Clinton administration&#x27;s ongoing refusal to allow medical marijuana, Peron decided to turn to the voters. In 1995, Peron, Gieringer and Imler organized Californians for Compassionate Use, a PAC dedicated to putting medical marijuana on the ballot. Chuck Blitz, a &quot;social-justice entrepreneur&quot;, arranged a retreat in Santa Barbara in order to organize the movement. In attendance were Peron, seniors who advocated for medical marijuana through the Senior Legislature, philanthropists including Peter Lewis and George Zimmer, Ethan Nadelmann, who worked to fundraise from philanthropists including George Soros, and &quot;political pros&quot; including Bill Zimmerman, who had not worked on Drug War issues before but had notable success in getting ballot initiatives to approve liberal policies. Lewis offered to donate $50,000 if Gieringer could find nine other donors to match his contribution. However, Peron did not accept this offer, believing his group of activists could collect the 500,000 signatures necessary to get the initiative on the ballot themselves. Peron continued to deny help from fundraisers and advocates like Nadelmann until January 1995. At this point, Zimmerman estimated that the campaign would need nearly $2 million to get the signatures and continue the campaign. Nadelmann organized the fundraising, with Soros, Lewis, and Zimmer donating $500,000 each and Laurence Rockefeller, who had recently fell victim to a ponzi scheme, donating $50,000. From that point forward, Zimmerman lead the campaign and shifted the image of the campaign from potentially controversial figures like Peron to doctors and patients.

The opposition campaign to Proposition 215 included a wide variety of law enforcement, drug prevention groups, and elected officials, including three former Presidents and California Attorney General Dan Lungren. Ballot arguments against the proposition were signed by prominent prosecutors and law enforcement officials who claimed that, while appearing well-intentioned, it was an overly vague, bad law that, &quot;allows unlimited quantities of marijuana to be grown anywhere … in backyards or near schoolyards without any regulations or restrictions,&quot; and that it effectively legalized marijuana.

Ballot arguments in support were signed by prominent oncologists, a cancer survivor, a nurse, and two politicians, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos and San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, who wrote that he supported Prop 215 because he didn&#x27;t &quot;want to send cancer patients to jail for using marijuana.&quot; 

The lead-up to the election saw a series of media-based attacks attempting to make the Yes on 215 Campaign a referendum on the controversial headquarters for the initiative, Dennis Peron&#x27;s San Francisco Cannabis Buyer&#x27;s Club. The very first of what would become more than 400 in the state, the SFCBC was a five-story full service medical marijuana club where qualified patients could in fact obtain marijuana for medical purposes (in various forms and qualities) in a retail setting. Far more than just a safe place for patients to consume, the club was a cultural center for many purposes.

Dennis Peron would describe 1996 as a year when &quot;the stars aligned for medical marijuana.&quot; It was a presidential election year with a Democratic incumbent in a heavily Democratic state. The AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s to the early 1990s as well as recent studies regarding relief for chemotherapy patients were opening people&#x27;s minds to medical marijuana. On top of that, 60-year-old &quot;Brownie&quot; Mary Rathbun&#x27;s arrest for baking marijuana brownies made headlines garnering sympathy for medical marijuana.

Proposition 215 passed with 55.6% support, setting off a chain reaction across North America of medical marijuana legislation. Canada now also has federal medical marijuana legislation and also operates a medical marijuana program through Health Canada (which also involves the issuance of ID cards, issuance of recommendations by physicians and maintenance of patient records), although not completely identical to that of the state of California. The issue has ALSO been to the floor of the US Congress in the form of the Hinchey-Rohrbacher Amendment, the Truth in Trials Act, and the States Right to Medical Marijuana Act. None of this legislation succeeded in the U.S. Congress.

== Results ==
== Protections afforded by Proposition 215 ==
Proposition 215 added Section 11362.5 to the California Health and Safety Code, which:
* Exempts patients and defined caregivers who possess or cultivate marijuana recommended by a physician from criminal laws which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana.
* Provides physicians who recommend use of marijuana for medical treatment shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege.
* Declares that the measure is not to be construed to supersede prohibitions of conduct endangering others or to condone diversion of marijuana.

== Implementation and effect ==

The initiative was partially implemented through the California Medical Marijuana Program created by Senate Bill 420. Both San Diego County and San Bernardino County initially refused to implement the program, but were rebuffed by the California Supreme Court. San Diego County has since proposed County regulations allowing 36 marijuana dispensaries to operate within its jurisdiction. Implementation across the State varied widely; urban areas in Northern California were the center of California&#x27;s fledgling marijuana market, while rural areas like Mendocino County, Santa Cruz, and Humboldt saw county-sanctioned gardens and patient registration programs. 

Though medical marijuana was legalized and accepted by the majority of California voters, Proposition 215 does not supersede federal law. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law which causes a conflict between the state and the U.S. Government. City of Garden Grove v. Superior Court, a published California Court of Appeal decision (which in California is binding on all courts), upheld a decision of a trial court to &quot;[order] the Garden Grove Police Department to give [Felix Kha] back his marijuana&quot; stating &quot;[b]ecause the act is strictly a federal offense, the state has &#x27;no power to punish ... [it] ... as such.&#x27;&quot;

Concerning limits on possession created by Senate Bill 420, the California Supreme Court decision People v. Kelly decided multiple issues. First, it reiterated that &quot;unlike [Proposition 215], which did not immunize medical marijuana users from arrest but instead provided a limited &#x27;immunity&#x27; defense to prosecution under state law for cultivation or possession of marijuana [citation], the MMP&#x27;s identification card system is designed to protect against unnecessary arrest.&quot; Secondly, it agreed with both Kelly and the California Attorney General that the limits were an &quot;unconstitutionally amendatory insofar as it limits an in-court CUA defense&quot; but by providing more rights, not less, the section concerning limits on possession &quot;should remain an enforceable part of the MMP, applicable to the extent possible — including to those persons who voluntarily participate in the program by registering and obtaining identification cards that provide protection against arrest.&quot;

In 2009, Oakland became the first U.S city to put a tax on marijuana. Approved by voters by a margin of 80%, the measure puts an $18 tax on every $1,000 in gross marijuana sales. The tax is estimated to bring in $300,000 to $1,000,000 annually.

The California Medical Board prosecuted many California licensed physicians for recommending cannabis under Proposition 215, in an attempt to harm them and take away their licenses to practice medicine despite the clear language of Proposition 215. In a major case against Dr. Tod Mikuriya that went to trial before an Administrative Law Judge in 2002, the Judge decreed that physicians recommending medical cannabis must first do a full physical exam and review all medical tests and information pertinent to the patient despite anecdotal evidence that the patient&#x27;s self-medication was helpful or needed. The administrative law judge rendering the decision was a director of an organization actively trying to prevent the use of cannabis by persons who were prisoners or criminal defendants.

== Federal enforcement in California ==

Since the passage of Proposition 215, federal officials have tried various approaches – from criminal raids and prosecutions to civil injunctions to threatening to seize any property leased for medical cannabis uses – to thwart or slow the progress of medical cannabis in California. On December 30, 1996, Clinton administration officials including Donna Shalala and Janet Reno as well as Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey held a press conference announcing their intention to prosecute all involved in the prescribing of medical marijuana. Dan Abrahamson, legal director of the Lindesmith Center, recruited Graham Boyd to oppose the federal government&#x27;s stance. Boyd worked with the ACLU of Northern California and sued the federal government for violating doctor&#x27;s and patient&#x27;s first amendment rights. Boyd and the ACLU won the case in federal court and the court of appeals. In 2003, the Supreme Court refused to hear the government appeal. According to Ethan Nadelmann, &quot;If we had lost that battle, we wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation today,&quot; referring to a discussion of the success of medical marijuana initiatives across the country. 

It was not until March 2009 that federal officials announced that they would no longer try to thwart medical marijuana distribution/use in California.

During his campaign, President Barack Obama signaled that he would cease the DEA&#x27;s raids in California as President. On March 18, 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced &quot;a shift in the enforcement of federal drug laws, saying the administration would effectively end the Bush administration&#x27;s frequent raids on distributors of medical marijuana.&quot;

Previously, under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the United States Department of Justice had taken drastically different approaches to medical cannabis in California. The DOJ under Clinton limited its enforcement to civil measures, such as seeking to revoke the federal prescription licenses of doctors who recommended cannabis or filing for civil injunctions against the major providers under Proposition 215.

Author, activist, and grower &quot;Ask Ed&quot; Rosenthal (of &quot;High Times&quot; fame) was raided and charged by federal agents the same day DEA Administrator (and later Governor of Arkansas) Asa Hutchinson made a speech to the Commonwealth Club. With local permission, Rosenthal was cultivating marijuana &quot;clones&quot; (or cuttings) to be distributed to Bay Area medical marijuana clubs. The presiding judge, Charles Breyer, did not allow any testimony that would have substantiated what Rosenthal was doing was legal under state law, or that he was doing it with the sanction and knowledge of local officials. The only exception to this was when Judge Breyer allowed the defense to call then Oakland City Council member Nate Miley as a witness to testify that he had been to and inspected the warehouse where Rosenthal was cultivating.

Such incidents (and the fact that Rosenthal was taking the case to trial while making no clear attempt to prove that he wasn&#x27;t growing the marijuana) led the jury to suspect they didn&#x27;t have all the facts. Nonetheless, the jury convicted Rosenthal on all counts. Once released from sequestering, nine of the twelve jurors held a press conference publicly recanting their verdict and asking for leniency in sentencing. The jurors even attended the sentencing hearing, sitting with the defendant they had just convicted. Judge Breyer departed from the 10 Year Mandatory Minimum Sentence and shocked prosecutors by sentencing Rosenthal to 1 day in prison, with credit for time served. Rosenthal would eventually win an appeal only to be retried and re-convicted. He is planning another appeal.

During the Bush Administration, federal officials stepped up the crackdown on medical marijuana in California. There are currently more than 100 people facing federal charges in medical cannabis cases, and the DEA conducted more than 50 raids in 2007 alone. The DEA has also begun threatening landlords who lease to marijuana clubs with Asset Forfeiture, a technique where real property can be seized by the federal government if used in the commission of a drug crime. While DEA agents claim they are merely upholding federal law and only going after &quot;major traffickers&quot;, advocates claim the DEA targets the most prominent political activists with their raids. Media reports have called federal enforcement in California &quot;notably erratic.&quot;

On June 12, 2009, a federal court handed down a sentence to Charles Lynch for a raid that occurred at his Central California medical marijuana dispensary in 2007. The federal judge sentenced Lynch to a year and a day in prison.

Despite statements as a Senator, where Obama called for marijuana decriminalization, promises as a presidential candidate where he stated that marijuana laws needed to be reconsidered and explicit statements as president that he would respect state medical marijuana laws, Barack Obama has presided over 1.7 million arrests for nonviolent drug offenses, over half of these being marijuana arrests, and a nationwide campaign of raiding medical marijuana dispensaries. Dozens of dispensaries have been closed with their owners and workers facing jail and prison sentences. California has been especially hard hit, with numerous dispensary closures and arrests.

In what may be a shift in federal enforcement attitude, especially in those states where it&#x27;s legal or decriminalized, President Obama made clear, in January 2014 that he feels cannabis is not as dangerous as alcohol.

==Guidelines==

According to the California Department of Justice, qualified patients and caregivers may possess 8 ounces of dried marijuana, as long as they possess a state-issued identification card. However, Cal. Health and Safety Code Section 1362.77 does not require a state-issued identification card. Under the Health and Safety Code, a card holder or &quot;qualified patient&quot; (one possessing a doctor&#x27;s recommendation) may possess up to eight oz. of dried herb, plus six mature or 12 immature plants. The state-issued identification card is for the patients&#x27; convenience only and is not required. Further, if the recommending physician indicates that a given patient requires more than the prescribed limits, that patient may possess an amount &quot;consistent with that patient&#x27;s needs.&quot;

In addition, marijuana smoking is also restricted by location. It may not be smoked wherever smoking is prohibited by law, within 1000 feet of a school, recreation center, or youth center, on a school bus, or in a moving vehicle or boat. According to Cal. Health and Safety Code Section 1362.785 Medical Marijuana use is not required to be accommodated inside the workplace or in any type of correctional facilities or during work hours. It is important to note that under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, an employer may terminate an employee who tests positive for marijuana use.

==Proposition 215 and the federal courts==
The U.S. Supreme Court has twice upheld the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law which conflicts with state law.

In 2001, the Oakland Cannabis Buyers&#x27; Cooperative claimed &quot;medical necessity&quot; as their legal justification for violating the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The U.S. Supreme Court struck down this argument, holding there could be no claim of medical necessity because in the CSA Congress had specifically negated this defense by unambiguously classifying marijuana as a substance which can have no authorized medical use.

The 2005 case of &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot; challenged the CSA by claiming that simple cultivation of marijuana plants fell outside of Congress&#x27;s power to regulate economic activity through its Commerce Clause powers. While initially successful in the Ninth Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down this argument. The Court found that personal cultivation of marijuana fell within the scope of federal regulation by employing an expansive definition of economic activity, a definition described as &quot;breathtaking&quot; by Justice O&#x27;Connor in her dissent because it &quot;threatens to sweep all of productive human activity into federal regulatory reach.&quot; However, in the majority opinion Justice Stevens expressed, though denying them support at that time, that he hoped &quot;the voices of voters allied with these respondents may one day be heard in the halls of Congress.&quot; Justice O&#x27;Connor in her dissenting opinion also stated that &quot;a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments,&quot; and that &quot;[t]his case exemplifies the role of states as laboratories.&quot; Justice O&#x27;Connor disagreed with the majority&#x27;s opinion because sanctioning this application of Congress&#x27;s CSA &quot;extinguishes that experiment, without any proof that the personal cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, if economic activity in the first place, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is therefore an appropriate subject of federal regulation.&quot; Despite the dissent&#x27;s favorable attitude toward state medical marijuana policies, federal law still controls, and for medical marijuana to be considered legal, change must be effected through legislation by Congress.

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 18, 2009 refused to hear San Diego&#x27;s case against California, where it claimed it wasn&#x27;t required to issue state-mandated medical marijuana IDs because the federal ban on marijuana trumped California&#x27;s law.

<text>An artificial organ is a human-made organ device or tissue that is implanted or integrated into a humaninterfacing with living tissueto replace a natural organ, to duplicate or augment a specific function or functions so the patient may return to a normal life as soon as possible. The replaced function does not have to be related to life support, but it often is. For example, replacement bones and joints, such as those found in hip replacements, could also be considered artificial organs.

Implied by definition, is that the device must not be continuously tethered to a stationary power supply or other stationary resources such as filters or chemical processing units. (Periodic rapid recharging of batteries, refilling of chemicals, and/or cleaning/replacing of filters would exclude a device from being called an artificial organ.) Thus, a dialysis machine, while a very successful and critically important life support device that almost completely replaces the duties of a kidney, is not an artificial organ.

==Purpose==

Constructing and installing artificial organs, an extremely research-intensive and expensive process initially, may entail many years of ongoing maintenance services not needed by a natural organ:

* providing life support to prevent imminent death while awaiting a transplant (e.g. artificial heart);
* dramatically improving the patient&#x27;s ability for self care (e.g. artificial limb);
* improving the patient&#x27;s ability to interact socially (e.g. cochlear implant); or
* improving a patient&#x27;s quality of life through cosmetic restoration after cancer surgery or an accident.

The use of any artificial organ by humans is almost always preceded by extensive experiments with animals. Initial testing in humans is frequently limited to those either already facing death or who have exhausted every other treatment possibility.

==Examples==

===Artificial limbs===
Artificial arms and legs, or prosthetics, are intended to restore a degree of normal function to amputees. Mechanical devices that allow amputees to walk again or continue to use two hands have probably been in use since ancient times, the most notable one being the simple peg leg. Since then, the development of artificial limbs has progressed rapidly. New plastics and other materials, such as carbon fiber have allowed artificial limbs to become stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic. Prostheses can roughly be categorized as upper- and lower-extremity and can take many shapes and sizes.

New advances in artificial limbs include additional levels of integration with the human body. Electrodes can be placed into nervous tissue, and the body can be trained to control the prosthesis. This technology has been used in both animals and humans. The prosthetic can be controlled by the brain using a direct implant or implant into various muscles.

===Bladder===

The two main methods for replacing bladder function involve either redirecting urine flow or replacing the bladder &quot;in situ&quot;. Standard methods for replacing the bladder involve fashioning a bladder-like pouch from intestinal tissue. As of 2017 methods to grow bladders using stem cells had been attempted in clinical research but this procedure was not part of medicine.

===Brain===

Neural prostheses are a series of devices that can substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive modality that might have been damaged as a result of an injury or a disease.

Neurostimulators, including deep brain stimulators, send electrical impulses to the brain in order to treat neurological and movement disorders, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, treatment resistant depression, and other conditions such as urinary incontinence. Rather than replacing existing neural networks to restore function, these devices often serve by disrupting the output of existing malfunctioning nerve centers to eliminate symptoms.

Scientists in 2013 created a mini brain that developed key neurological components until the early gestational stages of fetal maturation.

===Corpora cavernosa===
To treat erectile dysfunction, both corpora cavernosa can be irreversibly surgically replaced with manually inflatable penile implants. This is a drastic therapeutic surgery meant only for men who have complete impotence resistant to all other treatment approaches. An implanted pump in the groin or scrotum can be manipulated by hand to fill these artificial cylinders, normally sized to be direct replacements for the natural corpora cavernosa, from an implanted reservoir in order to achieve an erection.

===Ear===
In cases when a person is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing in both ears, a cochlear implant may be surgically implanted. Cochlear implants bypass most of the peripheral auditory system to provide a sense of sound via a microphone and some electronics that reside outside the skin, generally behind the ear. The external components transmit a signal to an array of electrodes placed in the cochlea, which in turn stimulates the cochlear nerve.

In the case of an outer ear trauma, a craniofacial prosthesis may be necessary.

Thomas Cervantes and his colleagues, who are from Massachusetts General Hospital, built an artificial ear from sheep cartilage by a 3D printer. With a lot of calculations and models, they managed to build an ear shaped like a typical human one. Modeled by a plastic surgeon, they had to adjust several times so the artificial ear can have curves and lines just like a human ear. The researchers said &quot;The technology is now under development for clinical trials, and thus we have scaled up and redesigned the prominent features of the scaffold to match the size of an adult human ear and to preserve the aesthetic appearance after implantation.&quot; Their artificial ears have not been announced as successful, but they are still currently developing the project. Each year, thousands of children were born with a congenital deformity called microtia, where the external ear does not fully develop. This could be a major step forward in medical and surgical microtia treatment.

===Eye===
The most successful function-replacing artificial eye so far is actually an external miniature digital camera with a remote unidirectional electronic interface implanted on the retina, optic nerve, or other related locations inside the brain. The present state of the art yields only partial functionality, such as recognizing levels of brightness, swatches of color, and/or basic geometric shapes, proving the concept&#x27;s potential.

Various researchers have demonstrated that the retina performs strategic image preprocessing for the brain. The problem of creating a completely functional artificial electronic eye is even more complex. Advances towards tackling the complexity of the artificial connection to the retina, optic nerve, or related brain areas, combined with ongoing advances in computer science, are expected to dramatically improve the performance of this technology.

===Heart===
Cardiovascular-related artificial organs are implanted in cases where the heart, its valves, or another part of the circulatory system is in disorder. The artificial heart is typically used to bridge the time to heart transplantation, or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Artificial pacemakers represent another cardiovascular device that can be implanted to either intermittently augment (defibrillator mode), continuously augment, or completely bypass the natural living cardiac pacemaker as needed. Ventricular assist devices are another alternative, acting as mechanical circulatory devices that partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart, without the removal of the heart itself.

Besides these, lab-grown hearts and 3D bioprinted hearts are also being researched. Currently, scientists are limited in their ability to grow and print hearts due to difficulties in getting blood vessels and lab-made tissues to function cohesively.

===Liver===
HepaLife is developing a bioartificial liver device intended for the treatment of liver failure using stem cells. The artificial liver is designed to serve as a supportive device, either allowing the liver to regenerate upon failure, or to bridge the patient&#x27;s liver functions until transplant is available. It is only made possible by the fact that it uses real liver cells (hepatocytes), and even then, it is not a permanent substitute.

===Lungs===
With some almost fully functional, artificial lungs promise to be a great success in the near future. An Ann Arbor company MC3 is currently working on this type of medical device.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used to take significant load off of the native lung tissue and heart. In ECMO, one or more catheters are placed into the patient and a pump is used to flow blood over hollow membrane fibers, which exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood. Similar to ECMO, Extracorporeal Removal (ECCO2R) has a similar set-up, but mainly benefits the patient through carbon dioxide removal, rather than oxygenation, with the goal of allowing the lungs to relax and heal.

===Ovaries===

The ground work for the development of the artificial ovary was laid in the early 1990s.

Reproductive age patients who develop cancer often receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy, which damages oocytes and leads to early menopause. An artificial human ovary has been developed at Brown University with self-assembled microtissues created using novel 3-D petri dish technology. In a study funded and conducted by the NIH in 2017, scientists were successful in printing 3-D ovaries and implanting them in sterile mice. In the future, scientists hope to replicate this in larger animals as well as humans. The artificial ovary will be used for the purpose of in vitro maturation of immature oocytes and the development of a system to study the effect of environmental toxins on folliculogenesis.

===Pancreas===

An artificial pancreas is used to substitute endocrine functionality of a healthy pancreas for diabetic and other patients who require it. It can be used to improve insulin replacement therapy until glycemic control is practically normal as evident by the avoidance of the complications of hyperglycemia, and it can also ease the burden of therapy for the insulin-dependent. Approaches include using an insulin pump under closed loop control, developing a bio-artificial pancreas consisting of a biocompatible sheet of encapsulated beta cells, or using gene therapy.

=== Red blood cells ===

Artificial red blood cells (RBC) have already been in projects for about 60 years, but they started getting interest when the HIV-contaminated-donor blood crisis. Artificial RBCs will be dependent 100% on nanotechnology. A successful artificial RBC should be able to totally replace human RBC, which means it can carry on all the functions that a human RBC does.

The first artificial RBC, made by Chang and Poznanski in 1968, was made to transport Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide, also fulfilled antioxidant functions.

Scientists are working on a new kind of artificial RBC, which is one-fiftieth the size of a human RBC. They are made from purified human hemoglobin proteins that have been coated with a synthetic polymer. Thanks to the special materials of the artificial RBC, they can capture oxygen when blood pH is high, and release oxygen when blood pH is low. The polymer coating also keeps the hemoglobin from reacting with nitric oxide in the bloodstream, thus preventing dangerous constriction of the blood vessels. Allan Doctor, MD, stated that the artificial RBC can be used by anyone, with any blood type because the coating is immune silent.

=== Testes ===
Men whom have sustained testicular abnormalities through birth defects or injury have been able to replace the damaged testicle with a testicular prosthesis. Although the prosthetic does not restore biological reproductive function, the device has been shown to improve mental health for these patients.

===Thymus===
An implantable machine that performs the function of a thymus does not exist. However, researchers have been able to grow a thymus from reprogrammed fibroblasts. They expressed hope that the approach could one day replace or supplement neonatal thymus transplantation.

As of 2017, researchers at UCLA developed an artificial thymus that, although not yet implantable, is capable of performing all functions of a true thymus.

The artificial thymus would play an important role in the immune system, and it would use blood stem cells to produce more T cells, which in turn, help the body fight infections. It would ultimately give the body a better ability to fight cancer cells. As people age, if their thymus stops working well, an artificial thymus could also be a potentially viable option.

The idea of using T cells to fight against infections has been around for a time, but until recently, the idea of using a T cell source, an artificial thymus is proposed. &quot;We know that the key to creating a consistent and safe supply of cancer-fighting T cells would be to control the process in a way that deactivates all T cell receptors in the transplanted cells, except for the cancer-fighting receptors,&quot; said Dr. Gay Crooks of UCLA. The scientist also found that the T cells produced by the artificial thymus carried a diverse range of T cell receptors and worked similarly to the T cells produced by a normal thymus. Since they can work like human thymus, artificial thymus can supply a consistent amount of T cells to the body for the patients who are in need of treatments.

===Trachea===
The field of artificial tracheas went through a period of high interest and excitement with the work of Paolo Macchiarini at the Karolinska Institute and elsewhere from 2008 to around 2014, with front-page coverage in newspapers and on television. Concerns were raised about his work in 2014 and by 2016 he had been fired and high level management at Karolinska had been dismissed, including people involved in the Nobel Prize.

As of 2017 engineering a tracheaa hollow tube lined with cellshad proved more challenging than originally thought; challenges include the difficult clinical situation of people who present as clinical candidates, who generally have been through multiple procedures already; creating an implant that can become fully developed and integrate with host while withstanding respiratory forces, as well as the rotational and longitudinal movement the trachea undergoes.

==Enhancement==

It is also possible to construct and install an artificial organ to give its possessor abilities that are not naturally occurring. Research is proceeding in areas of vision, memory, and information processing. Some current research focuses on restoring short-term memory in accident victims and long-term memory in dementia patients.

One area of success was achieved when Kevin Warwick carried out a series of experiments extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand and the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.

This might also include the existing practice of implanting subcutaneous chips for identification and location purposes (ex. RFID tags).

== Microchips ==
Organ chips are devices containing hollow microvessels filled with cells simulating tissue and/or organs as a microfluidic system that can provide key chemical and electrical signal information. This is distinct from an alternative use of the term microchip, which refers to small, electronic chips that are commonly used as an identifier and can also contain a transponder.

This information can create various applications such as creating &quot;human in vitro models&quot; for both healthy and diseased organs, drug advancements in toxicity screening as well as replacing animal testing.

Using 3D cell culture techniques enables scientists to recreate the complex extracellular matrix, ECM, found in in vivo to mimic human response to drugs and human diseases.
Organs on chips are used to reduce the failure rate in new drug development; microengineering these allows for a microenvironment to be modeled as an organ.

<text>USS &quot;Michigan&quot; (BB-27), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the 26th state. She was the second member of her class, the first dreadnought battleships built for the US Navy. She was laid down in December 1906, launched in May 1908, and commissioned into the fleet 4 January 1910. &quot;Michigan&quot; and &quot;South Carolina&quot; were armed with a main battery of eight guns in superfiring twin gun turrets; they were the first dreadnoughts to feature this arrangement.

&quot;Michigan&quot; spent her career in the Atlantic Fleet. She frequently cruised the east coast of the United States and the Caribbean Sea, and in April 1914 took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Civil War. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Michigan&quot; was employed as a convoy escort and training ship for the rapidly expanding wartime navy. In January 1918, her forward cage mast collapsed in heavy seas, killing six men. In 1919, she ferried soldiers back from Europe. The ship conducted training cruises in 1920 and 1921, but her career was cut short by the Washington Naval Treaty signed in February 1922, which mandated the disposal of &quot;Michigan&quot; and &quot;South Carolina&quot;. &quot;Michigan&quot; was decommissioned in February 1923 and broken up for scrap the following year.

==Design==

&quot;Michigan&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft vertical triple-expansion engines rated at and twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She had a crew of 869 officers and men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of eight /45 caliber Mark 5 guns in four twin gun turrets on the centerline, which were placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of twenty-two /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. As was standard for capital ships of the period, she carried a pair of torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Michigan&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines, over the machinery spaces, and elsewhere. The armored deck was thick. The gun turrets had 12 inch thick faces, while the supporting barbettes had 10 inch thick armor plating. Ten inch thick armor also protected the casemate guns. The conning tower had 12 inch thick sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Michigan&quot; was laid down on 17 December 1906 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. Her completed hull was launched on 26 May 1908. Fitting out work was completed by 4 January 1910, when she was commissioned into the US Navy. After entering service, she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She then began a shakedown cruise down to the Caribbean Sea that lasted until 7 June. &quot;Michigan&quot; joined training maneuvers off New England beginning on 29 July. A training cruise to Europe followed; she departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 2 November and stops included Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg, France. She arrived in the latter port on 8 December and remained there until the 30th, when she left for the Caribbean. The ship reached Guantánamo Bay, Cuba on 10 January 1911 and continued on to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving four days later. During this period, future naval aviation pioneer John Henry Towers served aboard the ship as a spotter for the main guns. The long range of the guns, which could shoot further than the horizon, convinced Towers of the need for spotter aircraft.

The ship then cruised the east coast for most of the next two years. On 15 November 1912, she departed for a longer cruise to the Gulf of Mexico, with stops in Pensacola, Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Galveston, Texas, on the way. She then continued further south to Veracruz, Mexico, where she arrived on 12 December. &quot;Michigan&quot; remained there for two days before beginning the voyage home; she reached Hampton Roads on 20 December. Patrols off the east coast resumed for the first half of 1913. On 6 July, she steamed out of Quincy, Massachusetts, for another voyage to Mexican waters; this trip was prompted by the Mexican Civil War, which threatened American interests in the country. She arrived off Tampico on 15 July and thereafter cruised the Mexican coast until 13 January 1914, when she departed for New York City, arriving seven days later. She then transferred back to Norfolk.

On 14 February, she left the port for a short voyage to Guacanayabo Bay, Cuba, and was back in Hampton Roads by 19 March. &quot;Michigan&quot; began a third cruise to Mexico on 16 April to support the United States occupation of Veracruz. She reached the city on 22 April and landed a battalion of Marines as part of the occupation force. The ship then patrolled the coast before departing for the United States on 20 June. She reached the Delaware Capes six days later. The normal peacetime routine of cruises off the east coast continued for the next three years. In December 1914, the ship&#x27;s crew experimented with fire control directors to aid in gunlaying; the experimental directors produced significantly improved results in gunnery tests conducted in early 1915. In September 1916, &quot;Michigan&quot; conducted gunnery practice with the old monitor as a target, including night shooting drills on the 18th. On 21 September, during another round of shooting at &quot;Miantomomoh&quot;, the shell in the left gun in &quot;Michigan&quot;″s forward superfiring turret exploded. The gun was severed where it exited the turret and fragments from the shell damaged the forecastle deck and the superstructure. One man was injured by a piece of debris. &quot;Michigan&quot; returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs, arriving there two days later.

===World War I===

On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany over its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. Due to her slow speed, &quot;Michigan&quot; was assigned to Battleship Force 2 that day, and was tasked with training naval recruits and escorting convoys. As part of the training mission, she participated in fleet maneuvers and gunnery exercises. On 15 January 1918, &quot;Michigan&quot; was cruising off Cape Hatteras on a training exercise when a heavy gale and rough seas knocked over the forward cage mast. The ship had rolled to port in the heavy seas before rolling sharply back to starboard. The rapid change in direction caused the mast to snap at its narrowest point, which had been damaged in the 1916 barrel explosion and patched over. The accident killed six men and injured another thirteen. &quot;Michigan&quot; steamed to Norfolk, transferred the injured men to the hospital ship , and went to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs, arriving on 22 January.

By early April, &quot;Michigan&quot; was back in service; for the next several months, she primarily trained gunners in the Chesapeake Bay. While on a convoy escort that had left the United States on 30 September, the ship&#x27;s port screw fell off. She was forced to leave the convoy on 8 October and return to port for repairs, remaining out of service for the rest of the war. In November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe. &quot;Michigan&quot; was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force in late December 1918 to ferry American soldiers back from Europe. She made two round trips in 1919 during the operation, the first from 18 January to 3 March, and the second from 18 March to 16 April, bringing back 1,062 men in the two voyages.

===Post-war period===

In May, &quot;Michigan&quot; was sent to Philadelphia for an that lasted through June. She thereafter returned to her peacetime training routine. On 6 August, she was reduced to limited commission and stationed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 19 May 1920, she steamed to Annapolis to pick up a contingent of midshipmen for a major training cruise. After departing Annapolis, the ship steamed south and transited the Panama Canal before proceeding to Honolulu, Hawaii, where she arrived on 3 July. &quot;Michigan&quot; visited several naval bases on the west coast of the United States through the summer: Seattle, San Francisco, San Pedro, and San Diego, before returning to Annapolis on 2 September. Three days later, she was back in Philadelphia, where she was temporarily decommissioned.

&quot;Michigan&quot; was reactivated in 1921 for another cruise to the Caribbean, departing on 4 April. She returned to Philadelphia on 23 April; shortly thereafter, the ship became embroiled in a minor scandal. The ship&#x27;s commanding officer at the time, Clark Daniel Stearns, instituted a series of sailors&#x27; committees on 3 May to ease tensions between officers and the crew. The commanders of the Atlantic Fleet and &quot;Michigan&quot;″s squadron decided that the committees were a threat to discipline and evidence of Marxist influences. They contacted Edwin Denby, then the Secretary of the Navy, who relieved Stearns of command. On 28 May, she picked up another group of midshipmen for another training cruise. This voyage took the ship to Europe, with stops in a number of ports, including Christiana, Norway, Lisbon, Portugal, and Gibraltar. She returned to Hampton Roads via Guantánamo Bay on 22 August.

In the years immediately following the end of the Great War, the United States, Britain, and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs. All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill-advised, and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations, which produced the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922. Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, &quot;Michigan&quot; and her sister &quot;South Carolina&quot; were to be scrapped. &quot;Michigan&quot; put to sea for the last time on 31 August, bound for the breaker&#x27;s yard in Philadelphia. She arrived there on 1 September and was decommissioned on 11 February 1922. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 November 1923 and broken up for scrap the following year.

<text>The University of New England (UNE) is a public university in New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1938, it was the first Australian university to be established outside of a state capital. Its main campus is located in the regional city of Armidale mid-way between Sydney and Brisbane. As of 2021, the university had approximately 26,000 students.

In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, UNE recorded the sixth-highest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, and the highest student satisfaction rating out of all public universities in New South Wales, with an overall satisfaction rating of 83.2. The university ranks lower in research-based rankings of Australian universities.

==History==
===Establishment===
Calls for tertiary education to be extended outside of Sydney began in earnest after World War I. Local MP David Drummond led a delegation to the state government in the early 1920s lobbying for a university college in Armidale. A 1924 New South Wales royal commission, chaired by John Jacob Cohen, recommended that consideration be given to a rural university and the Armidale Teachers&#x27; College was established in 1928. An organised push to establish a university in New England began in the early 1930s, at the height of the New England statehood movement which sought separation of the region from New South Wales and its admission as a new Australian state. Prominent early advocates in addition to Drummond included Colin Sinclair, Earle Page, and Victor Thompson.

A provisional council to raise funds for a university in New England was established in 1934. The New England University College was established in Armidale in 1938 as a child of the University of Sydney, with Page the chairman of the inaugural advisory council. The college became fully independent as the University of New England in 1954, after the entry into force of the University of New England Act 1953 (NSW). The university established a faculty of education in 1967.

===Transition to a network university===
The university underwent a major restructuring in 1989 with the University of New England Act 1989 (NSW), transitioning into a network university with multiple locations. These consisted of a campus at Armidale, which incorporated the former University of New England and the Armidale College of Advanced Education; and a campus at Lismore, incorporating the former Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education.

In 1990, the Orange Agricultural College joined the university. The network also included the UNE-Coffs Harbour Centre, which provided courses from within academic departments of the Armidale and Lismore campuses.

===Return to campus format===
In November 1993, the University of New England was re-formed once again, with the passage of the University of New England Act 1993 (NSW) and the Southern Cross University Act 1993 (NSW) through the New South Wales Parliament. This legislation had the effect of dismantling the network university. The University of New England from 1994 has only one campus, at Armidale. A new university (Southern Cross University) was created with campuses in Lismore and Coffs Harbour; the Orange campus was amalgamated with the University of Sydney.

The amalgamation of the former Armidale College of Advanced Education was complete by the time of the new legislation. In the same year, a law school was established.

===2020s===
In 2020, the University of New England was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Early in the year, the university became a potential exposure site, and students and faculty underwent viral tests. In September of that year, a staff restructuring was announced, with the goal of saving $20 million annually in wage costs and preparing the university for future opportunities, at the expense of 100 positions.

==Campuses and buildings==
The University of New England is on several sites in Armidale. The northern campus is five kilometres to the northwest of the city centre, in a rural and bushland setting. Part of this campus includes the original property presented by T R Forster to the University of Sydney for the establishment of a University College. This property comprised the old homestead, &#x27;Booloominbah&#x27;, with several other buildings and 74 hectares of land. Since the original gift, other generous benefactors have presented properties to the university, whose Armidale site now comprises some 260 hectares.

Booloominbah and the vice-chancellor&#x27;s residence Trevenna were designed by architect John Horbury Hunt.

The Newling campus of the university includes the Newling Centre, home to the New England Conservatorium of Music, and other buildings associated with the former Armidale College of Advanced Education.

The university possesses rural properties close to the campus, providing facilities for teaching and research. In addition, there are the &#x27;Tullimba&#x27; rural research property at Kingstown and the Douglas McMaster Rural Research Station at Warialda.

The University of New England has one of the most extensive residential college systems in Australia. Around half of UNE&#x27;s on campus students live in one of the colleges.

The university has a vibrant metro campus, UNE Sydney, set in a strategic position at the hearth of Parramatta CBD. As stated on their website &quot;The campus is designed to meet the learning and support needs for our predominately online city-based students and on-campus international students in select courses&quot;.

In 2020, the university revealed plans to construct a campus in Tamworth by 2031. The university has a study centre in Tamworth and Taree called UNE Tamworth, and UNE Taree, as well as a network of regional study centres in north-west New South Wales and in the New England region.

=== Lecture series ===

==== Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture ====
The Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture Series is named in honour of Frank Archibald, aka &quot;Bubba&quot;, an Aboriginal man who was born in Oban, near Guyra, around 1885 and died on 18 October 1975, aged an estimated 106 years old. He was the eldest grandson of &quot;King Robert&quot; (aka &quot;King Bobby&quot;, &quot;King Malawangi&quot;, &quot;King Billy&quot; or Robert/Billy/Bobby King), whose photo hangs in the Armidale Museum.

As a revered Elder, Archibald could speak seven different Aboriginal languages and understand another two, as well as speaking English. His surname derives from his Scottish father. He was of the Gumbangeri people on his mother&#x27;s side, but was also initiated into his wife Sarah Morris&#x27;s people, the Dhungatti nation. A Catholic priest, Father Kelly, helped Archibald to build a house, completed in 1957, in which many relatives came to live. Archibald was revered by the Armidale Koori and community for his knowledge of so many Aboriginal issues, particularly in the education of his people and others.

The Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture was founded by Lynette Riley, with the inaugural lecture given in 1986 by Eric Willmot. Since then, speakers have included:

*Charles Perkins (1990)
*Mick Dodson (1994)
*Linda Burney (1996)
*Pat O&#x27;Shane (1998)
*Jackie Huggins (2001)
*Aden Ridgeway (2004)
*Lou Bennett (2018)
*Ken Wyatt (2019)
*Michelle Trudgett (2020)
*Peter Anderson (2022)
* Stan Grant (2024)

==Controversies==

According to a 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report based on optional surveys given to students, UNE had the highest reported rate of sexual assaults at universities in Australia, with 4% of respondents saying they had been sexually assaulted; the average rate across all universities was 1.6%. Under a previous 2016 freedom of information request UNE had reported there were 22 officially reported cases of sexual assaults on campus over the previous five years, resulting in two expulsions, no suspensions and seven warnings. In February 2017 vice-chancellor Annabelle Duncan said that past UNE policies dealing with sexual harassment did not allow management to handle some cases satisfactorily.

On 1 August 2022, the incumbent Vice-Chancellor, Professor Brigid Heywood, was charged with allegedly assaulting a teenage girl at a club in Armidale on 8 March. Heywood was issued with an attendance notice to appear at Armidale Local Court on 26 September. On 5 August, UNE accepted her resignation.

<doc id="197048" wikidata="Q623034" url="?curid=197048" title="Pheng Xat Lao">
<text>&quot;Pheng Xat Lao&quot; ( , &quot;Song of the Lao People&quot;) is the national anthem of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic. It was written and composed in 1941 by Thongdy Sounthonevichit. It was adopted as the national anthem of the Kingdom of Laos in 1945. The original lyrics were revised after the Communists triumphed in the Laotian Civil War and established the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic in 1975, with the new lyrics written by Sisana Sisane.

==History==

In 1893, Laos became a protectorate of France within its colonial empire. The French claimed their annexation was to protect Laos from &quot;hostile neighbors&quot; such as China and especially Siam, which had been militarily forced to cede Laos to the European colonial power. In reality, France simply ruled Laos as a colony, even bringing in many Vietnamese to work in its governing. The transferring of control from one master to another meant that nationalist sentiment did not develop as it did in formerly independent Vietnam. However, the outbreak of the Second World War soon saw the fall of France to Nazi Germany. The new right-wing government in Siam saw this as a possible opportunity to regain formerly Thai territory lost to France, especially the land located on the Thai side of the Mekong River. To counteract this, the French colonial government began promoting the re-emergence of Lao nationalism.

Because of this liberalization, many patriotic songs were now composed, each one emphasizing Lao &quot;uniqueness&quot;. &quot;Pheng Xat Lao&quot; was one of them, having been composed by Thongdy Sounthonevichit in 1941 with lyrics written by Maha Phoumi under the name &quot;Lao Hak Xat&quot; (the patriotic Laos). It was chosen as the national anthem in 1945, when the king was forced by the Japanese occupiers to declare Laos independent from French rule. This new freedom was short-lived, since France quickly regained control of French Indochina after Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945. In 1947, France granted limited autonomy to Laos within the French Union, and &quot;Pheng Xat Lao&quot; again became the national anthem.

When the Pathet Lao emerged victorious in the Laotian Civil War in 1975, thanks to major North Vietnamese assistance, the new Communist government abolished the monarchy and changed the lyrics to reflect the ideology of the Marxist government. As a result, the anthem became all-encompassing, mentioning all ethnic groups in Laos, instead of focusing on the Lao race and Buddhism. However, the melody was retained.

<doc id="197049" wikidata="Q2586486" url="?curid=197049" title="Global 200">
<text>The Global 200 is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the global conservation organization, as priorities for conservation. According to WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a &quot;relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species dynamics, and environmental conditions&quot;. For example, based on their levels of endemism, Madagascar gets multiple listings, ancient Lake Baikal gets one, and the North American Great Lakes get none. 

The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: critical or endangered; vulnerable; and relatively stable or intact. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered.
==Background==
The WWF has identified 867 terrestrial ecoregions across the Earth&#x27;s land surface, as well as freshwater and marine ecoregions. The goal of this classification system is to ensure that the full range of ecosystems will be represented in regional conservation and development strategies. Of these ecoregions, the WWF selected the Global 200 as the ecoregions most crucial to the conservation of global biodiversity. The Global 200 list actually contains 238 ecoregions, made up of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine ecoregions.

Conservationists interested in preserving biodiversity have generally focused on the preservation of tropical moist broadleaf forests (commonly known as tropical rainforests) because it is estimated that they harbor one half of Earth&#x27;s species. On the other hand, the WWF determined that a more comprehensive strategy for conserving global biodiversity should also consider the other half of species, as well as the ecosystems that support them.

Several habitats, such as Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome, were determined to be more threatened than tropical rain forests, and therefore require concerted conservation action. WWF maintains that &quot;although conservation action typically takes place at the country level, patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., migration) do not conform to political boundaries&quot;, which is why ecoregion-based conservation strategies are deemed essential.

===Classification===
Historically, zoologists and botanists have developed various classification systems that take into account the world&#x27;s plant and animal communities. Two of the worldwide classification systems most commonly used today were summarized by Miklos Udvardy in 1975.

The Earth&#x27;s land surface can be divided into eight biogeographic realms (formerly called kingdoms, and which the BBC calls ecozones) that represent the major terrestrial communities of animals and plants, and are a synthesis of previous systems of floristic provinces and faunal regions. The biome system classifies the world into ecosystem types (i.e. forests, grasslands, etc.) based on climate and vegetation. Each biogeographical realm contains multiple biomes, and biomes occur across several biogeographical realms. A system of biogeographical provinces was developed to identify specific geographic areas in each biogeographical realm that were of a consistent biome type, and shared distinct plant and animal communities. The WWF system represents a further refinement of the system of biomes (which the WWF calls &quot;major habitat types&quot;), biogeographical realms, and biogeographical provinces (the WWF scheme divides most biogeographical provinces into multiple smaller ecoregions).

===Selection process===
Based on a comprehensive list of ecoregions, The Global 200 includes all major habitat types (biomes), all ecosystem types, and species from every major habitat type. It focuses on each major habitat type of every continent (such as tropical forests or coral reefs). It uses ecoregions as the unit of scale for comparison. WWF say ecoregions could be considered as conservation units at regional scale because they meet similar biological communities.

Some ecoregions were selected over other ecoregions of the same major habitat type (biome) or realm. Selection of the Global 200 relied on extensive studies of 19 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine major habitat types. Selection of the ecoregions was based on analyses of species richness, species endemism, unique higher taxa, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity of major habitat type.

Global 200 ecoregion list is most helpful to conservation efforts at a regional scale: local deforestation, destruction of swamp habitats, degradation of soils, etc. However, certain phenomena, such as bird or whale migration, depend on more complex parameters not used to define the current database, such as atmospheric currents and dynamic pelagic ecosystems. These would require gathering more information, and co-ordination of efforts between multiple ecoregions. However, the Global 200 ecoregions can help these efforts by identifying habitat sites and resting sites for migratory animals. It may also help identify the origin of invasive species, and offer insights for slowing down or stopping their intrusion.

<text>Howard Melvin Fast (November 11, 1914 – March 12, 2003) was an American novelist and television writer. Fast also wrote under the pen names E.V. Cunningham and Walter Ericson.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Fast was born in New York City. His mother, Ida (née Miller), was a British Jewish immigrant, and his father, Barney Fast, was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant who shortened his name from Fastovsky upon arrival in America. When his mother died in 1923 and his father became unemployed, Howard&#x27;s youngest brother, Julius, went to live with relatives, while he and his older brother, Jerome, sold newspapers. Howard credited his early voracious reading to a part-time job in the New York Public Library.

Fast began writing at an early age. While hitchhiking and riding railroads around the country to find odd jobs, he wrote his first novel, &quot;Two Valleys&quot;, published in 1933 when he was 18. His first popular work was &quot;Citizen Tom Paine&quot;, a fictional account of the life of Thomas Paine. Always interested in American history, Fast also wrote &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (about the Cheyenne Indians&#x27; attempt to return to their native land, and which inspired the 1964 movie &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot;) and &quot;Freedom Road&quot; (about the lives of former slaves during Reconstruction).

The novel &quot;Freedom Road&quot; is based on a true story and was made into a miniseries of the same name starring Muhammad Ali, who, in a rare acting role, played Gideon Jackson, an ex-slave in 1870s South Carolina who is elected to the U.S. House and battles the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations to keep the land that they had tended all their lives.

===Contribution to constitutionalism===
Fast is the author of the prominent &quot;Why the Fifth Amendment?&quot; essay. This essay explains in detail the purpose of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. Fast effectively uses the context of the Red Scare to illustrate the purpose of the &quot;Fifth.&quot;

===Career===
Fast spent World War II working with the United States Office of War Information, writing for Voice of America. In 1943, he joined the Communist Party USA and in 1950, he was called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities; in his testimony, he refused to disclose the names of contributors to a fund for a home for orphans of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War (one of the contributors was Eleanor Roosevelt), and he was given a three-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress.

While he was at Mill Point Federal Prison, Fast began writing his most famous work, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, a novel about an uprising among Roman slaves. Blacklisted by major publishing houses following his release from prison, Fast was forced to publish the novel himself. It was a success, going through seven printings in the first four months of publication. (According to Fast in his memoir, 50,000 copies were printed, of which 48,000 were sold.)

He subsequently established the Blue Heron Press, which allowed him to continue publishing under his own name throughout the period of his blacklisting. Just as the production of the film version of &quot;Spartacus&quot; (released in 1960) is considered a milestone in the breaking of the Hollywood blacklist, the reissue of Fast&#x27;s novel by Crown Publishers in 1958 effectively ended his own blacklisting within the American publishing industry.

In 1952, Fast ran for Congress on the American Labor Party ticket. During the 1950s he also worked for the Communist newspaper, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. In 1953, he was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize. Later that decade, Fast broke with the Party over issues of conditions in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, particularly after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s report &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot; at a closed session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956, denouncing the personality cult and dictatorship of Joseph Stalin, and the Soviet military intervention to suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 in November. In his autobiographical work titled &quot;The Naked God: The Writer and the Communist Party&quot; published in 1957, he wrote: &quot;There was the evil in what we dreamed of as Communists: we took the noblest dreams and hopes of mankind as our credo; the evil we did was to accept the degradation of our own souls—and because we surrendered in ourselves, in our own party existence, all the best and most precious gains and liberties of mankind—because we did this, we betrayed mankind, and the Communist party became a thing of destruction.&quot;

In the mid-1950s, Fast moved with his family to Teaneck, New Jersey. In 1974, Fast and his family moved to California, where he wrote television scripts, including such television programs as &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. In 1977, he published &quot;The Immigrants&quot;, the first of a six-part series of novels.

In 1948, author Harry Barnard accused Fast of copyright infringement, charging he &quot;borrowed liberally&quot; from Barnard&#x27;s biography of John Peter Altgeld for his own book about Altgeld, &quot;The American&quot;. Fast settled for $7,500 ($93,725 in 2022 dollars). His publisher also agreed to republish Barnard&#x27;s book.

==Personal life and death==
Fast married his first wife, Bette Cohen, on June 6, 1937. Their children were Jonathan and Rachel. Bette died in 1994. During the marriage, Fast had a relationship in the 1950s with Isabel (Dowden) Johnson, former wife of Lester Cole and later wife to Alger Hiss. In 1999, he married Mercedes O&#x27;Connor, who survived him. Mercedes brought three sons to the marriage. 

Fast&#x27;s son Jonathan Fast, himself a novelist, was married to novelist Erica Jong; their daughter is the pundit Molly Jong-Fast. The writer Julius Fast was his younger brother.

Fast died in his home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut.

<text>German East Africa (GEA; ) was a German colony in the African Great Lakes region, which included present-day Burundi, Rwanda, the Tanzania mainland, and the Kionga Triangle, a small region later incorporated into Mozambique. GEA&#x27;s area was , which was nearly three times the area of present-day Germany and almost double the area of metropolitan Germany at the time.

The colony was organised when the German military was asked in the late 1880s to put down a revolt against the activities of the German East Africa Company. It ended with Imperial Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I. Ultimately the territory was divided amongst Britain, Belgium and Portugal, and was reorganised as a mandate of the League of Nations.

==History==
Like other colonial powers, the Germans expanded their empire in the Africa Great Lakes region, ostensibly to explore the region&#x27;s rich resources and its people. Unlike other imperial powers, however they never formally abolished either slavery or the slave trade and preferred instead to curtail the production of new &quot;recruits&quot;, regulating the existing business of slavery.

The colony began when Carl Peters, an adventurer and the founder of the Society for German Colonization, signed treaties with several native chieftains on the mainland which is opposite Zanzibar. On 3 March 1885, the German government announced that it had granted an imperial charter, which was signed by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck on 27 February 1885. The charter was granted to Peters&#x27; company and was intended to establish a protectorate in the African Great Lakes region. Peters then recruited specialists who began exploring south to the Rufiji River and north to Witu, near Lamu on the coast.

The Sultan of Zanzibar protested and claimed that he was the ruler of both Zanzibar and the mainland. Chancellor Bismarck sent five warships which arrived on 7 August 1885, training their guns on the Sultan&#x27;s palace. The Sultan was forced to accept the German claims on the mainland outside a 10-mile-strip along the coast. In November 1886 Germany and Britain reached an agreement declaring they would respect the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar over his islands and the 10-mile-strip along the coast. They otherwise agreed on their spheres of interest along what is now the Tanzanian–Kenyan border. The British and Germans agreed to divide the mainland between themselves, and the Sultan had no option but to agree.
German rule was established quickly over Bagamoyo, Dar es Salaam, and Kilwa. Oscar Baumann was sent to explore Masailand and Urundi. During his expedition he discovered the source of the Kagera river, the Alexandra Nile. The caravans of Tom von Prince, Wilhelm Langheld, Emin Pasha, and Charles Stokes were sent to dominate &quot;the Street of Caravans&quot;. The Abushiri Revolt of 1888 was put down with British help the following year. In 1890, London and Berlin concluded the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty, which gave Heligoland to Germany and decided the border between GEA and the East Africa Protectorate controlled by Britain, although the exact boundaries remained unsurveyed until 1910.

The stretch of border between Kenya and Tanganyika, running from the sea to Lake Victoria, was surveyed by two British brothers: Charles Stewart Smith (British Consul at Mombasa) and his younger brother George Edward Smith (an officer and later a general with the Royal Engineers). Stewart Smith had been appointed British Commissioner in 1892 for the delimitation of the Anglo-German Boundary in Africa, and in the same year they both surveyed the 180-mile line from the sea to Mount Kilimanjaro. Twelve years later George Edward Smith returned to complete the survey of the remaining 300 miles from Kilimanjaro to Lake Victoria.

The German expansion was undertaken by military groups such as the notorious Wissmann Truppe, armed with modern weaponry. The Wissmann Truppe consisted of african soldiers led by German commanders. Under their command the Wissmann Truppe committed widespread atrocities. Between 1891 and 1894, the Hehe people which were led by Chief Mkwawa resisted German expansion. They were defeated because rival tribes supported the Germans. After years of guerrilla warfare, Mkwawa was cornered and committed suicide in 1898.

The colonial expansion led by Carl Peters came with considerable violence against the local populations. Carl Peters was infamous for his brutality, which had earned him the nickname &quot;Mkono-wa-damu&quot;, or &quot;Man with the blood-stained hands&quot;. He was known for leaving a path of destruction in his wake during his conquests, leaving entire villages slaughtered. Peters was also known for keeping a &quot;harem&quot; of local women, who would be completely at the mercy of Peters. In one instance, he had a woman flogged daily on suspicion of having sexual relations with another native. The native in question was hanged. A German newspaper commented on the affair:
&quot;[Germany] has found its Menelik in a German—in a ‘truly Teutonic man,’ an enraged ‘Aryan,’ who wishes to destroy all Jews, but, for a lack of Jews over there in Africa, shoots Negroes dead like sparrows and hangs Negro girls for his own pleasure after they have satisfied his desires.&quot;

Other atrocities included rape, floggings and torture with iron rods. Flogging was so excessive that the German colonies were known by other European powers as the &quot;flogging colonies&quot;.

These widespread atrocities caused several uprisings in the German colonies. The Maji Maji Rebellion occurred in 1905 and was put down by Governor Gustav Adolf von Götzen, who ordered measures to create a famine to crush the resistance. It may have cost as many 300,000 lives. Scandal followed with allegations of corruption and brutality. In 1907, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow appointed Bernhard Dernburg to reform the colonial administration.

German colonial administrators relied heavily on native chiefs to keep order and collect taxes. By 1 January 1914, not including local police, the military garrisons of the &quot;Schutztruppen&quot; (protective troops) in Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Iringa, and Mahenge numbered 110 German officers (including 42 medical officers), 126 non-commissioned officers, and 2,472 Askari (native enlisted men).

==Economic development==

Germans promoted commerce and economic growth. Over were put under sisal cultivation which was the largest cash crop. Two million coffee trees were planted, rubber trees grew on , and there were large cotton plantations.

In the early years of the colony, hunting and gathering remained the basis of the export economy, and ivory and wild rubber were major exports. The African-owned plantations along the coast, on the other hand, suffered from the gradual abolition of slavery. The number of European-owned plantations rose steadily, but many of them proved unprofitable. Global markets for commodities like coffee and rubber were very unstable, and the soil and climate were not always favourable to the grower. It was only in sisal that the large plantations finally found a reliable source of income. Under the governorship of Albrecht von Rechenberg, from 1906 to 1912, the colonial administration began to place more emphasis on the economic potential of African small-holder agriculture, for which railway construction was an essential precondition. In his detailed study of the economic development of the colony, Rainer Tetzlaff came to the conclusion that &quot;German East Africa never achieved any real significance for the German Empire, neither as a colony for the settlement of emigrants, nor as a supplier of raw materials, nor as a market for exports.&quot;

One of the great impediments to the development of plantation agriculture was the labour problem. The plantations could not function without a large African workforce, but employment conditions were often poor, not to say life-threatening. Local German officials frequently colluded with European landowners in forcing Africans to work on the plantations, although the government in Berlin had banned any form of forced labour. The various labour ordinances promulgated in Dar es Salaam were largely ignored in the interior. The social and economic impacts of large-scale labour migration on &quot;labour reservoirs&quot; such as Unyamwezi and Usukuma were often devastating.

Beginning in 1888 the Usambara Railway was built from Tanga to Moshi to bring these agricultural products to market. The Central Railroad covered and linked Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Tabora, and Kigoma. The final link to the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika was completed in July 1914 and was cause for a huge and festive celebration in the capital with an agricultural fair and trade exhibition. Harbor facilities were built or improved with electrical cranes, with rail access and warehouses. Wharves were remodeled at Tanga, Bagamoyo, and Lindi. After 1891, the German colonial administration undertook efforts to overhaul the region&#x27;s caravan routes, which had existed before European colonisation, into all-weather highways, although most of these projects proved to be unsuccessful and ended in failure.

In 1912, Dar es Salaam and Tanga received 356 freighters and passenger steamers and over 1,000 coastal ships and local trading-vessels. Dar es Salaam became the showcase city of all of tropical Africa. By 1914, Dar es Salaam and the surrounding province had a population of 166,000, among them 1,000 (0.6%) Germans. In all of the GEA, there were 3,579 Germans.

Gold mining in Tanzania in modern times dates back to the German colonial period, beginning with gold discoveries near Lake Victoria in 1894. The Kironda-Goldminen-Gesellschaft established one of the first gold mines in the colony, the Sekenke Gold Mine, which began operation in 1909 after the finding of gold there in 1907.

==Slavery==

In German Tanganyika slavery was gradually phased out. New enslavement and commercial slave trade was banned in 1901, but private slave sales were not banned, and thousands of slaves, mostly women, were sold in 1911-1914; all slaves born after 1905 were born free; slaves who had been subjected to abuse were freed; slaves were permitted to ransom and buy their freedom, and thousand of slaves bought their freedom or left their enslavers when the Germans did not act to prevent them. 
In 1914 the Germans contemplated to ban slavery, but ultimately did not, since they did not consider it financially possible to compensate their owners.

==Education==
Germany developed an educational program for Africans that included elementary, secondary, and vocational schools. In 1924, ten years after the beginning of the First World War and six years into British rule, the visiting American Phelps-Stokes Commission reported, &quot;In regards to schools, the Germans have accomplished marvels. Some time must elapse before education attains the standard it had reached under the Germans. Instructor qualifications, curricula, textbooks, teaching materials, all met standards unmatched anywhere in tropical Africa.&quot;

The Swahili word for school, &quot;shule&quot;, is derived from the German word &quot;Schule&quot;.

==Population on the eve of World War I==
In the most populous colony of the German Empire, there were more than 7.5 million locals. About 30% were Muslim and the remainder belonged to various tribal beliefs or Christian converts, compared to around 10,000 Europeans, who resided mainly in coastal locations and official residences. In 1913, only 882 German farmers and planters lived in the colony. Approximately 70,000 Africans worked on the plantations of GEA.

==World War I==
General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck had served in German South West Africa and Kamerun. He led the German forces in GEA during World War I. His military force consisted of 3,500 Europeans and 12,000 native Askaris and porters. The war strategy was to harry the British army of 40,000, which was at times commanded by the former Second Boer War commander Jan Smuts. One of Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s greatest victories was at the Battle of Tanga (3–5 November 1914). In the battle, the German forces defeated a British force, which was more than eight times larger.

Lettow-Vorbeck&#x27;s guerrilla warfare compelled Britain to commit significant resources to a minor colonial theatre throughout the war and inflicted more than 10,000 casualties. Eventually, the weight of numbers, especially after forces coming from the Belgian Congo had attacked from the west (Battle of Tabora), and dwindling supplies forced Lettow-Vorbeck to abandon the colony. He withdrew south into Portuguese Mozambique and then into Northern Rhodesia, where he agreed to a ceasefire after he had received news of the armistice between the warring nations three days earlier.

After the war, Lettow-Vorbeck was acclaimed as one of Germany&#x27;s heroes. His &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; was celebrated as the only colonial German force during World War I that was not defeated in open combat, but it often retreated when it was outnumbered. The Askari colonial troops who had fought in the East African campaign were later given pension payments by the Weimar Republic and West Germany.

The SMS &quot;Königsberg&quot;, a German light cruiser, also fought off the coast of the African Great Lakes region. She was eventually scuttled in the Rufiji delta in July 1915 after running low on coal and spare parts and was subsequently blockaded and bombarded by the British. The surviving crew stripped out the remaining ship&#x27;s guns, mounted them on gun carriages, and joined the land forces, which added considerably to their effectiveness.
Another smaller campaign was conducted on the shores of southern Lake Tanganyika in 1914 and 1915. It involved a makeshift British and Belgian flotilla and the &quot;Reichsheer&quot; garrison at Bismarckburg (modern-day Kasanga).

==Break-up of the colony==
The Supreme Council of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference awarded all of German East Africa (GEA) to Britain on 7 May 1919, over the strenuous objections of Belgium. The British colonial secretary, Alfred Milner, and Belgium&#x27;s minister plenipotentiary to the conference, , then negotiated the Anglo-Belgian agreement of 30 May 1919 where Britain ceded the north-western GEA districts of Ruanda and Urundi to Belgium. The conference&#x27;s Commission on Mandates ratified this agreement on 16 July 1919. The Supreme Council accepted the agreement on 7 August 1919.

On 12 July 1919, the Commission on Mandates agreed that the small Kionga Triangle south of the Rovuma River would be given to Portugal; it eventually became part of independent Mozambique. The commission reasoned that Germany had virtually forced Portugal to cede the triangle in 1894.

The Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919, although the treaty did not take effect until 10 January 1920. On that date, the GEA was transferred officially to Britain, Belgium, and Portugal. Also on the same day, &quot;Tanganyika&quot; became the name of the British territory.

==German placenames==
Some names in German East Africa continued to bear German spellings of the local names for a while, such as &quot;Udjidji&quot; for Ujiji and &quot;Kilimandscharo&quot; for Mount Kilimanjaro, &quot;Kleinaruscha&quot; for Arusha-Chini and &quot;Neu-Moschi&quot; for the city now known as Moshi. (Kigoma was known for a time as &quot;Rutschugi&quot;.)

Many places were given African names or had their previous names reestablished:

*Alt Langenburg (Ikombe)

*Bismarckburg (Kasanga) on the south-eastern end of Lake Tanganyika
*Emmaberg (Ilembule)

==List of governors==

The Imperial High Commissioners () and Imperial Governors () of German East Africa:

===Reichskommissar (1885/88-1891)===
*1888–1891: Hermann Wissmann
** Carl Peters, as sometimes claimed, was never Reichskommissar for German East Africa, but administrator from 27 May 1885 to 8 February 1888. On 18 March 1891, Dr. Peters was named &quot;Reichskommissar for the Kilimanjaro Region&quot; in Moshi, however subordinate to governor Freiherr von Soden. In 1892, he was recalled and returned to Germany. After three investigations, in 1897, he was officially deprived of his commission with the loss of his title and his pension rights. However, in 1905 Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded him the title of &quot;retired Reichskommissar&quot; and from 1914 he also received an annual pension.

===Imperial Governors (1891-1918)===
*1891–1893: Julius von Soden
*1893–1895: Friedrich von Schele
*1895–1896: Hermann Wissmann
*1896–1901: Eduard von Liebert
*1901–1906: Gustav Adolf von Götzen
*1906–1912: Albrecht von Rechenberg
*1912–1918: Heinrich Schnee

== Archived records ==
The administration of German East Africa from 1884 to 1917 is documented in a set of records now held by the Tanzania National Archives. In 1997 these German records were inscribed by UNESCO in its Memory of the World International Register, recognising them as documents of global importance.

==Planned symbols for German East Africa==

In 1914, a series of drafts were made for proposed Coat of Arms and Flags for the German Colonies. However World War I broke out before the designs were finished and implemented and the symbols were never actually used. Following its defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies and the prepared coat of arms and flags as a result were never used.

<text>A cardigan is a type of knitted garment that has an open front, and is worn like a jacket.

==Description==
Commonly cardigans are open fronted, have buttons, and are often knitted or woven: garments that are tied are instead considered a robe.
Knit garments with zippers can also be referred to as a cardigan. A current fashion trend has the garment with no buttons or zipper and hangs open by design. By contrast, a pullover (or sweater) does not open in front but must be &quot;pulled over&quot; the head to be worn. It may be machine- or hand-knitted. Traditionally, cardigans were made of wool but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination thereof. In British English, a baby&#x27;s short cardigan is known as a matinee jacket.

==History==
The cardigan was named after James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan, a British Army major general who led the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. It is modelled after the knitted wool waistcoat that British officers supposedly wore during the war. The legend of the event and the fame that Lord Cardigan achieved after the war led to the rise of the garment&#x27;s popularity – supposedly, Brudenell invented the cardigan after noticing that the tails of his coat had accidentally been burnt off in a fireplace.

The term originally referred only to a knitted sleeveless vest, but expanded to other types of garment over time. Coco Chanel is credited with popularizing cardigans for women because &quot;she hated how tight-necked men&#x27;s sweaters messed up her hair when she pulled them over her head.&quot; The garment is mostly associated with the college culture of the Roaring Twenties and early 1930s, being also popular throughout the 1950s, 1970s, 1990s, 2000s and into the early 2010s.

==Usage==
Plain cardigans are often worn over shirts and inside suit jackets as a less formal version of the waistcoat or vest that restrains the necktie when the jacket has been removed. Its versatility means it can be worn in casual or formal settings and in any season, but it is most popular during cool weather.

Monochromatic cardigans, in sleeved or vest form, may be viewed as a conservative fashion staple. As an item of formal clothing for any gender, it is worn over a button-down dress shirt. A less formal style is wearing a T-shirt underneath.

Varsity letters for college and high school sports teams have been applied to cardigans and letterman jackets.

==In popular culture==
* Singer Perry Como wore cardigans on the television program &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;. The trademark sweaters complemented his easy-going style of singing.
* Fred Rogers, star of the long-running children&#x27;s program &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, donned a cardigan at the beginning of each episode. The cardigans were made by his mother and closed with a zipper instead of buttons.
* Steve McQueen popularised cardigans, wearing it in the 1968 action thriller film &quot;Bullitt&quot; and in his personal life.
* Kurt Cobain of the band Nirvana wore vintage cardigans. The sweater he wore during MTV&#x27;s &quot;Nirvana Unplugged&quot; concert sold at auction for $137,500 () in November 2015. It was reported to have a burn hole, a button missing, and discoloration around the pockets. In 2019 it was re auctioned for $334,000 ().
* Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift wrote a song called &quot;Cardigan&quot; and used cardigans as part of her merchandise accompanying the song and her eighth studio album, &quot;Folklore&quot; (2020).
* The Cardigans are a Swedish rock band formed in 1992, best known for the singles &quot;Lovefool&quot; and &quot;My Favourite Game&quot;.

<doc id="197055" wikidata="Q156296" url="?curid=197055" title="Catharsis">
<text>Catharsis is from the Ancient Greek word , , meaning &quot;purification&quot; or &quot;cleansing&quot;, commonly used to refer to the purification and purgation of thoughts and emotions by way of expressing them. The desired result is an emotional state of renewal and restoration.

In dramaturgy, the term usually refers to arousing negative emotion in an audience, who subsequently expels it, making them feel happier.

In Greek the term originally had only a physical meaning, describing purification practices. In medicine, it can still refer to the evacuation of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;monthlies&quot;, menstrual fluid). Similarly, a cathartic is a substance that accelerates the defecation of faeces.

The first recorded uses of the term in a mental sense were by Aristotle in the &quot;Politics&quot; and &quot;Poetics&quot;, comparing the effects of music and tragedy on the mind of a spectator to the effect of catharsis on the body.

The term is also used in Greek to refer to the spiritual purging process that occurs in the Catholic doctrine of purgatory. Greek Neoplatonists also used the term to refer to spiritual purification.

Catharism was used by outsiders to describe the thinking of a Christian movement, named because of its interest in purity.

In psychology, the term is associated with Freudian psychoanalysis where it relates to the expression of buried trauma (the cause of a neurosis), bringing it into consciousness and releasing it, increasing happiness.

== Purification ritual ==
The term &quot;kathairein&quot; and its relatives appear in the work of Homer, referring to purification rituals. The words &quot;kathairein&quot; and &quot;katharos&quot; became common in Greek. It is thought that they are derived from the Semitic word &quot;qatar&quot; (&quot;fumigate&quot;).

&quot;Aithiopis&quot;, a later epic set in the Trojan War cycle, narrates the purification of Achilles after his murder of Thersites.

Later, the Greeks took certain new measures to cleanse away blood-guilt—&quot;blood is purified through blood&quot;, a process in the development of Hellenistic culture in which the oracle of Delphi took a prominent role. The classic example—Orestes—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by Aeschylus is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood. The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a &quot;krater&quot; found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of Proetus from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.

To the question of whether the ritual obtains atonement for the subject, or just healing, Burkert answers: &quot;To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction&quot;.

==Platonism==

In Platonism, catharsis is part of the soul&#x27;s progressive ascent to knowledge. It is a means to go beyond the senses and embrace the pure world of the intelligible. Specifically for the Neoplatonists Plotinus and Porphyry, catharsis is the elimination of passions. This leads to a clear distinction in the virtues. In the second tractate of the first Ennead, Plotinus lays out the difference between the civic virtues and the cathartic virtues and explains that the civic, or political, virtues are inferior. They are a principle of order and beauty and concern material existence. (&quot;Enneads&quot;, I,2,2) Although they maintain a trace of the Absolute Good, they do not lead to the unification of the soul with the divinity. As Porphyry makes clear, their function is to moderate individual passions and allow for peaceful coexistence with others. (&quot;Sentences&quot;, XXXIX) The purificatory, or cathartic, virtues are a condition for assimilation to the divinity. They separate the soul from the sensible, from everything that is not its true self, enabling it to contemplate the Mind (&quot;Nous&quot;).

== Passive psychological ==
Catharsis is a term used in dramatic art that describes a particular effect of a performance on its audience.

The first recorded use of the term being used in the mental sense was by Aristotle in his work &quot;Politics&quot;, regarding the use of music&quot;:&quot;And since we accept the classification of melodies made by some philosophers, as ethical melodies, melodies of action, and passionate melodies, distributing the various harmonies among these classes as being in nature akin to one or the other, and as we say that music ought to be employed not for the purpose of one benefit that it confers but on account of several (for it serves the purpose both of education and of purgation [κάθαρσις]—the term purgation we use for the present without explanation, but we will return to discuss the meaning that we give to it more explicitly in our treatise on poetry—and thirdly it serves for amusement, serving to relax our tension and to give rest from it), it is clear that we should employ all the harmonies, yet not employ them all in the same way, but use the most ethical ones for education, and the active and passionate kinds for listening to when others are performing (for any experience that occurs violently in some souls is found in all, though with different degrees of intensity—for example pity and fear, and also religious excitement; for some persons are very liable to this form of emotion, and under the influence of sacred music we see these people, when they use tunes that violently arouse the soul, being thrown into a state as if they had received medicinal treatment and taken a purge [καθάρσεως]; the same experience then must come also to the compassionate and the timid and the other emotional people generally in such degree as befalls each individual of these classes, and all must undergo a purgation [κάθαρσις] and a pleasant feeling of relief; and similarly also the purgative [κάθαρσιν] melodies afford harmless delight to people). (As translated by Harris Rackham)In his treatise on poetry, &quot;Poetics&quot;, he describes the relief brought about by a staged tragedy:We must now treat of tragedy after first gathering up the definition of its nature which results from what we have said already. Tragedy is, then, a representation of an action that is heroic and complete and of a certain magnitude—by means of language enriched with all kinds of ornament, each used separately in the different parts of the play: it represents men in action and does not use narrative, and through pity and fear it effects relief [κάθαρσις] to these and similar emotions. (As translated by Harris Rackham)

=== Purgation or purification? ===
In his works prior to the &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle had usually used the term &quot;catharsis&quot; purely in its literal medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the &quot;katamenia&quot;—the menstrual fluid or other reproductive material) from the patient. 
F. L. Lucas opposes, therefore, the use of words like &quot;purification&quot; and &quot;cleansing&quot; to translate &quot;catharsis&quot;; he proposes that it should rather be rendered as &quot;purgation&quot;. &quot;It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions.&quot;

Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the &quot;purgation&quot; theory: 

Lessing (1729–1781) sidesteps the medical attribution. He interprets &quot;catharsis&quot; as a purification (),
an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: &quot;In real life&quot;, he explained, &quot;men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean.&quot;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

G. F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as &quot;purification&quot; or &quot;purgation&quot; have no basis in the text of the &quot;Poetics&quot;, but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts. For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle&#x27;s concept of anagnorisis.

Elizabeth Belfiore held an alternate view of catharsis as an allopathic process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, which she described in her book,&quot;Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.&quot;

=== Intellectual clarification? ===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis: a number of scholars contributed to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept. The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle&#x27;s argument in chapter 4 of the &quot;Poetics&quot; (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of mimesis is the intellectual pleasure of &quot;learning and inference&quot;.

It is generally understood that Aristotle&#x27;s theory of mimesis and catharsis represent responses to Plato&#x27;s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle&#x27;s concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato&#x27;s view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. Most scholars consider all of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification to represent a process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves.

D. W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the &quot;Poetics&quot;, comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to &quot;Pity, Fear, and Katharsis&quot;. Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of &quot;purification, purgation, and &#x27;intellectual clarification,&#x27;&quot; although his approach to these terms differs in some ways from that of other influential scholars. In particular, Lucas&#x27;s interpretation is based on &quot;the Greek doctrine of Humours,&quot; which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. The conception of catharsis in terms of purgation and purification remains in wide use today, as it has for centuries. However, since the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as &quot;intellectual clarification&quot; has gained recognition in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

=== Attempts to avoid passive catharsis ===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.

For example, Bertolt Brecht viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the bourgeois theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his agit-prop play &quot;The Measures Taken&quot;, and is mostly the source of his invention of an &quot;epic theatre&quot;, based on a distancing effect (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.

Brazilian dramatist Augusto Boal, inventor of the Theater of the Oppressed, which seeks to eliminate the distinction between spectator and actor, also considers this kind of catharsis &quot;something very harmful&quot;. “In me, too, and in everyone else, there is the power to change. I want to release and develop these skills. The bourgeois theater oppresses them.”

== Active and conversational psychological ==

=== Psychoanalysis ===
Jakob Bernays was a German philosopher who wrote books about Aristotle&#x27;s views of drama in 1857 and 1880. These prompted a lot of writing about catharsis in the German speaking world.

In this environment, Austrian psychiatrist Josef Breuer developed a cathartic method of treatment using hypnosis for persons who have intensive hysteria in the early 1890s. While under hypnosis, Breuer&#x27;s patients were able to recall traumatic experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten (and had formed neuroses), they were relieved of their neurotic hysteria symptoms. Breuer became a mentor to fellow Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (who was married to Bernays&#x27; niece). Breuer and Freud released the book &quot;Studies on Hysteria&quot; in 1895. This book explained the cathartic method to the world, and was the first published work about psychoanalysis.The injured person&#x27;s reaction to the trauma only exercises a completely &#x27;cathartic&#x27; effect if it is an &quot;adequate&quot; reaction as, for instance, revenge. But language serves as a substitute for action; by its help, an affect can be &#x27;abreacted&#x27; almost as effectively.As Freud developed psychoanalysis, catharsis remained a central part of it. After trying hypnotherapy and finding it wanting, Freud replaced it with free association. Catharsis has remained an important part of &quot;talking therapies&quot; ever since.

The term &quot;cathexis&quot; has also been adopted by modern psychotherapy, particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of experiencing the deep emotions associated with events in the individual&#x27;s past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

=== Psychodrama ===
Psychodrama involves people expressing themselves using spontaneous dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives. Psychodrama includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space that serves as a stage area, where props can be used.

The therapy was developed by American Jacob Moreno (a psychiatrist previously from Romania and Austria) and later also his wife Zerka Moreno (a psychologist previously from the Netherlands and the UK). Jacob was a contemporary of Freud, but rejected many of his ideas of psychoanalysis. He developed psychodrama in New York from 1925. In 1929, he founded an Impromptu Theater at Carnegie Hall. In 1936, he founded the Beacon Hill Sanitarium, and the adjacent Therapeutic Theater. The Morenos established the Psychodramatic Institute in New York in 1942.

A psychodrama therapy group, under the direction of a psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time. Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior, reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives.

Other forms of cathartic drama therapy have since been developed, including Theater of the Oppressed.

Playback Theatre is a form of improvisational theatre in which audience or group members tell stories from their lives and watch them enacted on the spot. This can have therapeutic uses.

There are additionally other forms of expressive therapies which make use of various kinds of art.

=== Primal therapy ===
Primal therapy is a trauma-based psychotherapy created by American psychologist Arthur Janov, who argues that neurosis is caused by the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argues that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness for resolution through re-experiencing specific incidents and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. Primal therapy was developed as a means of eliciting the repressed pain; the term &quot;Pain&quot; is capitalized in discussions of primal therapy when referring to any repressed emotional distress and its purported long-lasting psychological effects. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more basic parts of the central nervous system.

Primal therapy is used to re-experience childhood pain—i.e., felt rather than conceptual memories—in an attempt to resolve the pain through complete processing and integration, becoming real. An intended objective of the therapy is to lessen or eliminate the hold early trauma exerts on adult behaviour.

=== Social catharsis ===
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions.

Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance. Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.

If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process &quot;secondary social sharing&quot;. If this repeats, it is then called &quot;tertiary social sharing&quot;.

==== Stages ====
Émile Durkheim proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

==== Motives ====
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

A study by Christopher Langston found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Shelly Gable et al. confirmed Langston&#x27;s &quot;capitalization&quot; theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

Bernard Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.

==== Reactions to emotional events ====
When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others. According to Bernard Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and &quot;emotional overheating&quot;.

James Pennebaker and Kent Harber defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events:

# a state of &quot;emergency&quot; takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.
# the &quot;plateau&quot; occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

==== A critical perspective of collective catharsis ====
Frantz Fanon, in his book &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot;, provides a multi-dimensional and critical analysis of the manifestations and implications of colonial racism in early 1900 France, including a critical conceptualization of collective catharsis within the context of colonial states. Fanon’s perspective on collective catharsis highlights the psychological impact of cultural and social narratives on white as well as black individuals in European-colonized contexts, exploring how these narratives serve as a means of channeling collective aggression and establishing social norms and attitudes that perpetuate racial stereotypes and negative self-perceptions among black individuals.

Intertwining social psychology and psychoanalysis, Fanon conceptualizes collective catharsis as a release of aggressive impulses, “a channel, an outlet through which the forces accumulated in the form of aggression can be released,&quot; and analyzes how this aggressive release manifests for the white colonizers in the ‘civilized’ context. In an era where overtly cruel acts of racism such as lynching and slavery are frowned upon and no longer a commonplace reality, Fanon explores how the white population finds more subtle outlets for their aggressive impulses through acts of collective catharsis.  

“Did the little black child see his father beaten or lynched by a white man? Has there been a real traumatism? To all of this we have to answer no. Well, then?

If we want to answer correctly, we have to fall back on the idea of collective catharsis.”

Fanon highlights how popular entertainment, such as children&#x27;s magazines or comic books, often portrays &quot;Evil Spirits&quot; as black individuals and other racialized figures and thereby serves as a cathartic release for the collective aggression of the white colonizers. In these stories, the socially unacceptable racist desires of white individuals are sublimated through fiction and pop culture, allowing for the dehumanization and derogation of black individuals. And so too, in this way, are the establishment of social norms and attitudes that perpetuate racial stereotypes argued as acts of collective catharsis by the dominant white hegemony.

Fanon underscores that because the black individual is immersed in this white-centric hegemonic state, they are implicated in this collective catharsis as not only the target of the aggressive release but also as the perpetrators. In engagement with these derogatory fictions or channels of collective catharsis, the black individual identifies with the white hero and encourages their defeat of the ‘uncivilized’ black antagonists. This co-perpetration and identification with the white protagonists (of fiction and society) results in the black individual internalizing these oppressive narratives, thereby developing an incongruence between their actual and ideal selves that is inherently unbreachable.

=== Effects ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is &quot;interpersonal emotion regulation&quot;, in which listeners help to modify the affected individual&#x27;s affective state by using certain strategies. Expressive writing is another common mechanism for personal catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger. Some scholars believe that &quot;blowing off steam&quot; may reduce physiological stress in the short term, but this reduction may act as a reward mechanism, reinforcing the behavior and promoting future outbursts. However, other studies have suggested that using violent media may decrease hostility under periods of stress.

Legal scholars have linked personal &quot;catharsis&quot; to &quot;closure&quot; (an individual&#x27;s desire for a firm answer to a question and an aversion toward ambiguity) and &quot;satisfaction&quot; which can be applied to affective strategies as diverse as retribution, on one hand, and forgiveness on the other.

Some studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Catrin Finkenauer and colleagues found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Emmanuelle Zech and Bernard Rimé asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, David Sbarra and colleagues found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic &quot;therapy&quot;.

<text>Johann Carl Bodmer (11 February 1809 – 30 October 1893) was a Swiss-French printmaker, etcher, lithographer, zinc engraver, draughtsman, painter, illustrator, and hunter. Known as Karl Bodmer in literature and paintings, his name was recorded as Johann Karl Bodmer and Jean-Charles Bodmer, respectively. After 1843, likely as a result of the birth of his son Charles-Henry Barbizon, he began to sign his works &quot;K Bodmer&quot;.

Bodmer was well known in Germany for his watercolours, drawings, and aquatints of cities and landscapes of the Rhine, Mosel, and Lahn rivers. After he moved to France following his return from an expedition in the American West, he became a member of the Barbizon School, a French landscape painting group from the mid-19th century. He created many oil paintings with animal and landscape motifs, wood engravings, drawings, and book illustrations. For his work, Bodmer was made a Knight in the French Legion of Honour in 1877.

He is best known in the United States as a painter who captured the American frontier of the 19th century. He painted extremely accurate works of its inhabitants and landscape. He accompanied the German explorer Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied from 1832 through 1834 on his Missouri River expedition. Bodmer was hired as an artist by Maximilian in order to accompany his expedition and record images of cities, rivers, towns, and peoples they saw along the way, including the many tribes of Native Americans along the Missouri River and in that region. 

Bodmer had 81 aquatints made from his work to illustrate Prince Maximilian&#x27;s book, &quot;Maximilian Prince of Wied&#x27;s Travels in the Interior of North America&quot;, published in 1839 in German and in English in 1843.

==Early life==
Johann Carl Bodmer was born on 11 February 1809 in Zürich, Switzerland. When he was thirteen, his mother’s brother, Johann Jakob Meier, a prominent engraver, became Bodmer&#x27;s teacher. Meier was an artist, having studied under the well-known artists Heinrich Füssli and Gabriel Lory. Young Bodmer and his older brother, Rudolf, joined their uncle on artistic travels throughout their home country.

==Missouri River expedition==

By 1828, Bodmer had left his native Switzerland to work as a painter and engraver in the German city of Koblenz. It was there that he and his work came to the attention of Prinz Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied. This German aristocrat had successfully led a scientific expedition to Brazil in 1815–1817. He decided to embark on another such venture, this time to North America and especially the American West. He hired Bodmer to accompany his expedition and make a visual record of the places and peoples encountered, through painting, drawings, etc. The aristocrat was known popularly to naturalists then and now as Prince Max.

After delays, Bodmer, in the company of Prince Max and David Dreidoppel, a huntsman and taxidermist, sailed for North America on 17 May 1832. In a letter on that date, Prince Max wrote to his brother that Bodmer &quot;is a lively, very good man and companion, seems well educated, and is very pleasant and very suitable for me; I am glad I picked him. He makes no demands, and in diligence he is never lacking.&quot;

Arriving in Boston, Massachusetts, on 4 July, the three encountered hardships and delays caused largely by a cholera epidemic in the eastern states. It swept across the northern tier to Michigan via travelers on the waterways. The three men finally reached Pittsburgh, and started from there October 8 to travel west along the Ohio River. They arrived in Mt. Vernon, Indiana about midnight on 18 October. The next morning, the party made their way to New Harmony, Indiana.

Prince Max had planned to spend only a few days in New Harmony, but his stay &quot;was prolonged by serious indisposition, nearly resembling cholera, to a four months&#x27; winter residence.&quot; The Prince devotes a chapter of his book of the expedition to New Harmony and its environs. He featured the work and personalities of Thomas Say and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, two leading American naturalists. Lesueur was also a prolific artist.

Unlike the Prince and Dreidoppel, Bodmer escaped the illness. Alone, he left New Harmony at the end of December, and on 3 January 1833 caught a steamboat at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. He traveled down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, spending a week with Joseph Barrabino. This Italian-American naturalist was a friend of Say and Lesueur. (A fine pencil portrait of Barrabino, drawn by Lesueur, is preserved at the New Harmony Workingmen&#x27;s Institute.)

In April 1833, Prince Max, Bodmer and Dreidoppel set out from St. Louis on the 2,500-mile journey by steamboat and later keelboat up the Missouri River. They eventually traveled as far as Fort McKenzie (near present-day Fort Benton, Montana). After wintering at Fort Clark near the Mandan villages, they returned downriver the following spring, having spent more than a year on the Upper Missouri. Bodmer had extensively documented the journey with visual images, while Prince Max took copious notes for the book he intended to write.

After completing the expedition, Bodmer returned to Germany with Prince Maximilian, then traveled to France. In Paris he had many of his paintings from the expedition (81 in total) reproduced as aquatints. The Prince had these images incorporated into his book of the expedition, which was first published in German in Koblenz as &quot;Reise in das innere Nord-Amerika in den Jahren 1832 bis 1834&quot; in two volumes from 1839 to 1841. Its English translation, &quot;Maximilian Prince of Wied’s Travels in the Interior of North America, during the years 1832–1834,&quot; was published in London in 1843–1844.

Bodmer then moved to Barbizon, France, and later became a French citizen. Recorded as Jean-Charles Bodmer, he went by &quot;Charles Bodmer&quot;. He became a member of the Barbizon School, a group of painters who specialized in landscapes and works featuring animals. He worked in a variety of genres, including painting, etching, wood engraving, and illustration. Among his well-known works from this period was &quot;La Foret en Hiver&quot; (Interior of the forest in winter), exhibited at the Salon 1850 in Paris. It was painted at Fontainebleau forest. Bodmer also made an engraving of his painting, and reproductions were popular in the 1860s. Impressionist Claude Monet later painted the same trees, titling his painting &quot;The Bodmer Oak.&quot; This scene was the subject as well of numerous photographs in the 1870s.

His last years were difficult, as his illustrations became out of style, and he was affected by illness and poverty.

==Death==
Bodmer died in Paris, shortly after receiving his French citizenship. He is buried in Chailly-en-Bière, at the entrance of the Fontainebleau forest. His three sons, Charles, Rodolphe and Henri, were colorful characters of the community of artists and poachers in Barbizon.

==Legacy==
Although Bodmer is still relatively unknown in France, a first exhibition was dedicated to his works in September 2021 in Barbizon.

===Joslyn Art Museum===
The Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska is home to the largest of three known collections of Bodmer&#x27;s watercolors, drawings, and prints. Bodmer captured a challenging and dramatic landscape that was still unfamiliar to audiences in the eastern United States and Europe.

His portraits were the first accurate portrayal of western Indians in their homelands, and they are considered remarkable for their careful detail and sensitivity to the personalities of his sitters. To this day, Bodmer&#x27;s work remains one of the most perceptive and compelling visual accounts of the American interior. Bodmer&#x27;s work is recognised as among the most accurate painted images ever made of Native Americans, their culture and artifacts, and of the scenery of the pristine &quot;Old West&quot;.

<doc id="197068" wikidata="Q803756" url="?curid=197068" title="Billion Dollar Babies">
<text>Billion Dollar Babies is the sixth studio album by American rock band Alice Cooper, released on February 27, 1973 by Warner Bros. Records. The album became the best selling Alice Cooper record at the time of its release, hitting number one on the album charts in the United States and the United Kingdom, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. 

The album has been retrospectively praised by such critics as Robert Christgau, Greg Prato of AllMusic, and Jason Thompson of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, but &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) gave the album only two and a half stars.

Songs were recorded in both the state of Connecticut and London, England. Lyrics cover topics and themes such as necrophilia, dental fear, horror, and sexual harassment. At 40 minutes and 51 seconds, it is the longest studio album the band has ever released; this does not count any of Cooper&#x27;s solo albums.

== Recording and production ==
Drummer Neal Smith has said that the album can be traced back to the song &quot;Caught in a Dream&quot; from the album &quot;Love It to Death&quot; (1971). The first recording sessions for the album took place in Greenwich, Connecticut, in a mansion called the Galesi Estate. To achieve certain vocal sounds and echoes, microphones were run through rooms of various sizes and through a greenhouse. Other sessions were held at Morgan Studios in London, where singer Donovan contributed to the album by singing on its title track. The album was produced by Bob Ezrin with Gerry Lyon as assistant in New York, Connecticut and London.

Guitarists Glen Buxton and Michael Bruce both used Gibson SGs for the album. Three additional guitarists (including longtime band friend Mick Mashbir and New York-based session musicians Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter) were retained to cover for Buxton, who suffered from alcohol abuse-related pancreatitis throughout the sessions.

A quadraphonic mix of the album was released on both 8-track and reel-to-reel format, as well as vinyl. This features radically different mixes of all of the songs, including different vocal tracks (&quot;Raped and Freezin), unfaded endings (&quot;Generation Landslide&quot;), and editing (&quot;I Love the Dead&quot;). Alice&#x27;s lead vocals are more upfront in the quad mix than the stereo mix.
Rumors that this mix of the album can be found on the DVD-Audio release are untrue. The DVD-Audio release contains a newer 5.1 channel mix of the album, based on the original 2-channel tracks as opposed to the quad mix. In June of 2023 Rhino released a Blu-ray with the quadraphonic and stereo mixes

== Lyrical themes and subjects ==
The album&#x27;s title comes from the fact that the five members of Alice Cooper were surprised about their success. Cooper related: &quot;How could we, this band that two years ago was living in the Chambers Brothers&#x27; basement in Watts, be the Number One band in the world, with people throwing money at us?&quot; The title was also later used as the name of the group Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway, and Michael Bruce formed after Alice Cooper group had split up. Cooper said, &quot;The whole idea behind the &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; album was exploiting the idea that people do have sick perversions.&quot;

Alice Cooper, who wrote the majority of the album&#x27;s lyrics, cited Chuck Berry as a key influence on his writing. &quot;Hello Hooray&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track, was written by Canadian singer/songwriter Rolf Kempf and was previously recorded by Judy Collins. The band wanted their version of the song to sound like &quot;Alice Cooper meets Cabaret&quot;. The album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Elected&quot;, is a rewrite of the song &quot;Reflected&quot; from &quot;Pretties for You&quot; (1969). &quot;Raped and Freezin″ has been called a &quot;hilarious and gorgeously catchy&quot; take on the idea of sexual harassment by &quot;PopMatters&quot;″s Jason Thompson. &quot;Unfinished Sweet&quot; is about visiting a dentist with sound effects recorded by Gerry Lyon. The title track was co-written by Reggie Vinson (credited on original pressings of the album as &quot;R. Reggie&quot;, i.e., &quot;Rockin&#x27; Reggie Vinson&quot;), who had played guitar on and performed vocals for &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; (1972). Donovan described the song as a &quot;horror story song&quot;. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;I Love the Dead&quot;, is a tongue-in-cheek song about necrophilia.

==Touring==

After the album was released, the band embarked on a tour which broke the United States box office records previously held by the Rolling Stones and included a scheduled 64 concerts in 59 cities in 90 days. The gross revenue of the tour was anticipated to be close to $20 million, but only about $4 million was achieved.

Cooper hired magician James Randi to design effects for the show, and Randi traveled with the tour to supervise and coordinate the effects. Randi even played a role in the stage show as &quot;The Executioner&quot;.

The live performances featured Cooper wearing a costume with fake blood stains at the crotch, tearing apart baby dolls, attacking mannequins, and being decapitated by a guillotine. Cooper has said that the mutilation of the dolls symbolized child neglect. Between 40 and 50 people were employed and 26,000 pounds of equipment were used. In preparation for the tour, two semi-trailer trucks carried a wide variety of props including a dentists drill, four whips, a surgical table, six hatchets, 33,000 program books, 300 baby dolls, 22,000 sparklers, 58 mannequins, 280 spare light bulbs, 1,000 patches, 6,000 mirror parts, 14 bubble machines, 28 gallons of bubble juice, and 250,000 packages of bubble bath.

==Critical reception and influence==

&quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; was commercially more successful than Alice Cooper&#x27;s previous albums; it went to No. 1 in both the United Kingdom and United States. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Elected&quot;, &quot;Hello Hooray&quot;, &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;, and &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;, all became hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In March 1973 the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and in 1986, it went platinum.

In a contemporary review for &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, Robert Christgau said that &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; is Cooper&#x27;s &quot;most consistent album&quot;, even though it lacks a song as strong as &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato awarded the album four and a half out of five stars and called it &quot;one of Cooper&#x27;s very best; it remains one of rock&#x27;s all-time, quintessential classics&quot;. Jason Thompson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised the album, saying it was &quot;arguably the original Alice Cooper Group&#x27;s best album&quot;. However, the 2004 &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; was less positive about the album, giving it two and a half stars and criticizing songs like &quot;I Love the Dead&quot; for being &quot;predictable&quot;. Daniel Bukszpan, the author of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal&quot;, called it a &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;arguably the original band&#x27;s finest offering&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; was ranked number 283 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Treble&quot; named it in its list &quot;10 Essential Glam Rock Albums&quot;.

Chris Cornell of Soundgarden stated that it was one of his favorite records. In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 1989, he commented that: &quot;When I was in junior high, every Friday the teachers would let the kids play their favorite records. I brought in &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; [Alice Cooper, 1973] and they wouldn&#x27;t let me play it. They never vetoed anyone&#x27;s choice before. It was then I knew that rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll could scare the fuck out of certain people.&quot; The Norwegian band Turbonegro made a song called &quot;Zillion Dollar Sadist&quot; as a tribute to &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;. David Byrne of Talking Heads has said that the album inspired him to write the song, &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;. The Swiss extreme metal group Samael did a cover of the song &quot;I Love the Dead&quot; on their &quot;Rebellion&quot; EP. Italian heavy metal band Death SS covered the song &quot;I Love the Dead&quot; on their debut album, &quot;...in Death of Steve Sylvester&quot; (1988).

&quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; is the second most-represented album in Alice Cooper&#x27;s live sets, behind only &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot; (1975). The only song from the album that has never been played live in any form is the short &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, although &quot;Generation Landslide&quot; was not played until the tour eight years later following &quot;Special Forces&quot; (1981), on which it had been re-recorded.

<doc id="197073" wikidata="Q835555" url="?curid=197073" title="Dirt (Alice in Chains album)">
<text>Dirt is the second studio album by American rock band Alice in Chains, released on September 29, 1992 by Columbia Records. It was the band&#x27;s last album recorded with all four original members, as bassist Mike Starr was fired in January 1993 during the tour to support the album. The majority of the songs were written by guitarist Jerry Cantrell, but for the first time, vocalist Layne Staley wrote two songs by himself (&quot;Hate to Feel&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot;), both also featuring Staley on guitar. The track &quot;Iron Gland&quot; features Tom Araya from Slayer on vocals. The album&#x27;s lyrics explore depression, pain, anger, anti-social behavior, relationships, drug (primarily heroin) addiction, war, death, and other emotionally charged topics.

&quot;Dirt&quot; received critical acclaim upon release and peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It has since been certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making &quot;Dirt&quot; the band&#x27;s highest selling album to date. The album spawned five singles: &quot;Would?&quot;, &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, all with accompanying music videos. &quot;Dirt&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The music video for &quot;Would?&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film, as the song was featured on the soundtrack to Cameron Crowe&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Singles&quot;. It was voted &quot;&quot;Kerrang!&quot; Critic&#x27;s Choice Album of the Year&quot; and &quot;Guitar World&quot; named &quot;Dirt&quot; the best guitar album of 1992. It was included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; named it as one of the best metal albums of the 1990s, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 26 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; in 2017, as well as at No. 6 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; in 2019.

==Background and recording==
The recording of &quot;Dirt&quot; began in the spring of 1992. Producer Dave Jerden, who had previously worked with the band on their debut, &quot;Facelift&quot;, wanted to work with them again. He admired Layne Staley&#x27;s lyrics and voice, and Jerry Cantrell&#x27;s guitar riffs. The track &quot;Would?&quot; produced, engineered and mixed by Rick Parashar, was recorded before the album, and first appeared on the to the 1992 movie &quot;Singles&quot;. &quot;Dirt&quot; was recorded at Eldorado Recording Studios in Burbank, London Bridge Studio in Seattle, and One on One Studios in Los Angeles from April to July 1992.

&quot;Dirt&quot; was recorded during the Los Angeles riots that erupted following the acquittal of four LAPD officers caught on camera beating unarmed black motorist Rodney King. The riots started on the first day of recording. The band was watching TV when the verdict for the incident was announced. Jerry Cantrell was in a store buying some beer when a man came in and started looting the place. Cantrell also got stuck in traffic and saw people pulling each other out of their cars and beating them. The band tried to get out of the town without getting hurt while LA was protesting against police brutality. They took Slayer vocalist Tom Araya with them and went to the Joshua Tree desert for four or five days until things calmed down, then moved back into the studio and started recording the album.

When recording the album, Staley had previously checked out of rehab and quickly went back to using heroin. Staley later went cold-turkey on his own while reading &quot;The Bad Place&quot; by horror novelist Dean Koontz. Jerden later said that he was told Staley felt animosity toward him dating back to the &quot;Dirt&quot; sessions due to Jerden repeatedly recommending to Staley that he get sober at the time. Jerden said, &quot;Apparently he got all mad at me [during the &quot;Dirt&quot; sessions] ... And what&#x27;s my job as a producer? To produce a record. I&#x27;m not getting paid to be Layne&#x27;s friend.&quot;

Staley was not the only one who went through heavy drug use; drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr were also struggling with alcohol addiction.

Jerden got the album&#x27;s famous guitar tone by blending three different amps - a Bogner Fish preamp for the low end, a Bogner Ecstacy for the mid frequencies, and a Rockman Headphone amp for the high frequencies.

==Music and lyrics==
With songs written primarily on the road, the material is darker than &quot;Facelift&quot;. &quot;We did a lot of soul searching on this album. There&#x27;s a lot of intense feelings.&quot; Cantrell said, &quot;We deal with our daily demons through music. All of the poison that builds up during the day we cleanse when we play&quot;. Drug use was front and center as a lyrical theme on the album. Three tracks (&quot;Sickman&quot;, &quot;Junkhead&quot; and &quot;God Smack&quot;) specifically reference heroin use and its effects.

Staley revealed that the album is semi-conceptual and that there are two basic themes in it. The first theme is about &quot;dealing with kind of a personal anguish and turmoil, which turns into drugs to ease that pain, and being confident that that was the answer in a way. Then later on the songs start to slip down closer and closer to hell, and then he figures out that drugs were not, and are not, the way to ease that pain. Basically, it&#x27;s the whole story of the last three years of my life.&quot; Staley described the other theme as being about &quot;painful relationships and involvements with persons.&quot;

Staley later expressed regret about the lyrical content of some songs on &quot;Dirt&quot;, explaining, &quot;I wrote about drugs, and I didn&#x27;t think I was being unsafe or careless by writing about them ... I didn&#x27;t want my fans to think that heroin was cool. But then I&#x27;ve had fans come up to me and give me the thumbs up, telling me they&#x27;re high. That&#x27;s exactly what I didn&#x27;t want to happen.&quot;

Cantrell said in 2013: &quot;That darkness was always part of the band, but it wasn&#x27;t &quot;all&quot; about that. There was always an optimism, even in the darkest shit we wrote. With &quot;Dirt&quot;, it&#x27;s not like we were saying &#x27;Oh yeah, this is a good thing.&#x27; It was more of a warning than anything else, rather than &#x27;Hey, come and check this out, it&#x27;s great!&#x27; We were talking about what was going on at the time, but within that there was always a survivor element – a kind of triumph over the darker elements of being a human being. I still think we have all of that intact, but maybe the percentage has shifted.&quot;

Cantrell told &quot;RIP&quot; magazine in 1993 that not all of the lyrics have drug references:
In the liner notes of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set collection, Cantrell cited &quot;Junkhead&quot; and &quot;God Smack&quot; as &quot;the most openly honest&quot; songs about drug use.

Cantrell said he wrote &quot;Them Bones&quot; about &quot;mortality, that one of these days we&#x27;ll end up a pile of bones.&quot; He told RIP magazine in 1993: &quot;&#x27;Them Bones&#x27; is pretty cut and dried. It&#x27;s a little sarcastic, but it&#x27;s pretty much about dealing with your mortality and life. Everybody&#x27;s going to die someday. Instead of being afraid of it, that&#x27;s the way it is: so enjoy the time you&#x27;ve got. Live as much as you can, have as much fun as possible. Face your fear and live. I had family members die at a fairly early age; so I&#x27;ve always had kind of a phobia about it. Death freaks me out. I think it freaks a lot of people out. It&#x27;s the end of life, depending on your views. It&#x27;s a pretty scary thing. &quot;Them Bones&quot; is trying to put that thought to rest. Use what you have left, and use it well.&quot;

Cantrell was inspired to write &quot;Dam That River&quot; after a fight he had with Sean Kinney, in which Kinney broke a coffee table over his head. The lyrics to &quot;Rain When I Die&quot; were written by Cantrell and Staley about their respective girlfriends. &quot;Sickman&quot; came together after Staley asked Cantrell to &quot;write him the sickest tune, the sickest, darkest, most fucked up and heaviest thing [Cantrell] could write.&quot;

&quot;Rooster&quot; was written by Cantrell for his father, Jerry Cantrell Sr., who served in the Vietnam War and his childhood nickname was &quot;Rooster&quot;. Cantrell described the song as &quot;the start of the healing process between my Dad and I from all that damage that Vietnam caused.&quot;

Discussing the title track &quot;Dirt&quot;, Cantrell stated that &quot;the words Layne put to it were so heavy, I&#x27;ve never given him something and not thought it was gonna be the most bad-assed thing I was going to hear.&quot; Staley said he wrote the song &quot;to a certain person who basically buried my ass&quot;.

The 43-second &quot;Iron Gland&quot; was developed out of a guitar riff that Cantrell would play that annoyed the other band members, so he created the song (adding in a reference to Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot;) and promised to never play the guitar riff again. It features Tom Araya of thrash metal band Slayer on vocals, as well as Layne Staley. &quot;Hate to Feel&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; were both composed solely by Staley, who also played guitar on both tracks, and Cantrell has expressed his pride in seeing Staley grow as a songwriter and guitarist.

&quot;Down in a Hole&quot; was written by Cantrell to his long-time girlfriend, Courtney Clarke. Cantrell explained the song in the liner notes of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set: &quot;[&quot;Down in a Hole&quot;]&#x27;s in my top three, personally. It&#x27;s to my long-time love. It&#x27;s the reality of my life, the path I&#x27;ve chosen and in a weird way it kind of foretold where we are right now. It&#x27;s hard for us to both understand...that this life is not conducive to much success with long-term relationships.&quot;

The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Would?&quot;, was written by Cantrell as a tribute to his friend and late lead singer of Mother Love Bone, Andrew Wood, who died of a drug overdose in 1990. Cantrell said the song is also &quot;directed towards people who pass judgments.&quot;

==Packaging and title==
The album&#x27;s cover art features a nude woman half-buried in a cracked desert landscape. The cover was photographed by Rocky Schenck, who created the image along with the album&#x27;s art director, Mary Maurer. The cover was conceptualized by the band, with the woman being either dead or alive. The band discussed the type of woman they wanted and Schenck began casting shortly after. Schenck submitted a photo of model/actress Mariah O&#x27;Brien and the band chose her.

The cover shoot took place at Schenck&#x27;s Hollywood studio on June 14, 1992, with the supervision of drummer Sean Kinney. After the eight hour photo session, O&#x27;Brien went to the bathroom and left her wig embedded in the dirt. Schenck then snapped a few photos, which were later used for the 1999 box set &quot;Music Bank&quot;.

For many years, fans believed that the model on the cover was Staley&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Demri Parrott, but Schenck revealed to &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot; in 2011 that the girl was actually Mariah O&#x27;Brien, with whom he had previously worked on the cover of Spinal Tap&#x27;s single &quot;Bitch School&quot;. The magazine also published behind the scenes photos from the shoot featuring O&#x27;Brien. Schenck told &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot;:

In an interview with the Canadian magazine &quot;M.E.A.T.&quot; in December 1992, Layne Staley said about the cover:
The cover was referenced on the music video for Alice in Chains&#x27; 2009 single &quot;A Looking in View&quot;. At the 6:55 mark of the video, a woman (played by Sacha Senisch) is seen lying on a cracked desert floor similarly to &quot;Dirt&quot;&#x27;s cover. &quot;A Looking in View&quot; was featured on Alice in Chains&#x27; fourth studio album, &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot;, released exactly 17 years after &quot;Dirt&quot;, on September 29, 2009.

==Release and commercial performance==
Upon its release in September 1992, &quot;Dirt&quot; peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and charted for 102 weeks, ending at number 196 in the week of September 24, 1994. &quot;Dirt&quot; granted Alice in Chains international recognition, and the album was certified 5× platinum in the United States, platinum in Canada and gold in the UK. The album had sold 3,358,000 copies in the United States as of 2008. A remastered reissue of the album was released on vinyl on November 23, 2009.

The album returned to the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart at No. 9 following the release of its 30th anniversary reissue on September 23, 2022.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Dirt&quot; received critical acclaim, and is considered by many critics and fans alike as the group&#x27;s best album. In a retrospective review, Steve Huey of AllMusic said &quot;&quot;Dirt&quot; is Alice in Chains&#x27; major artistic statement and the closest they ever came to recording a flat-out masterpiece. It&#x27;s a primal, sickening howl from the depths of Layne Staley&#x27;s heroin addiction, and one of the most harrowing concept albums ever recorded. Not every song on &quot;Dirt&quot; is explicitly about heroin, but Jerry Cantrell&#x27;s solo-written contributions (nearly half the album) effectively maintain the thematic coherence—nearly every song is imbued with the morbidity, self-disgust, and/or resignation of a self-aware yet powerless addict.&quot;

Michael Christopher of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised the album saying &quot;the record wasn&#x27;t celebratory by any means – but you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a more brutally truthful work laid down – and that&#x27;s why it will always be one of the greatest records ever made.&quot; Chris Gill of &quot;Guitar World&quot; called &quot;Dirt&quot; &quot;huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate,&quot; and &quot;sublimely dark and brutally honest.&quot; Don Kaye of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described &quot;Dirt&quot; as &quot;an unflinching, brutally truthful and, yes, fiercely rocking testimonial to human endurance.&quot;

&quot;Dirt&quot; is often considered as one of the most influential albums to the sludge metal subgenre, which fuses doom metal with hardcore punk. It was voted &quot;&quot;Kerrang!&quot; Critic&#x27;s Choice Album of the Year&quot; for 1992.

&quot;Dirt&quot; included the top-30 singles &quot;Would?&quot;, &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, all of which had accompanying music videos. The album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for nearly two years.

At the 1993 Grammy Awards, &quot;Dirt&quot; received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band also contributed the song &quot;Would?&quot; to for the 1992 Cameron Crowe film &quot;Singles&quot;, whose video received an award for Best Video from a Film at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;Dirt&quot; was also included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;Dirt&quot; was ranked as the fifth best album released in the previous two decades by &quot;Close-Up&quot; magazine.

In 2011, Joe Robinson of Loudwire named &quot;Dirt&quot; as one of the best metal albums of the 1990s, alongside other albums such as Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; and Tool&#x27;s &quot;Ænima&quot;, writing &quot;In the battle between metal and grunge, Alice in Chains are a rare band that is embraced by fans of both genres. The most metal of the Seattle bands, they were marketed as metal for 1990&#x27;s &#x27;Facelift,&#x27; then touted as grunge for 1992&#x27;s &#x27;Dirt.&#x27; The band members themselves didn&#x27;t bother much with labels, they just churned out some of the finest alt-metal with classics like &#x27;Would?,&#x27; &#x27;Rooster&#x27; and &#x27;Them Bones&#x27; leading their charge all the way to the headlining spot on Lollapalooza &#x27;93.&quot;

In October 2011, the album was ranked number one on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992, with The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Ignition&quot; in second place and Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Generator&quot; in third place.

In June 2017, &quot;Dirt&quot; was ranked at No. 26 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In April 2019, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at No. 6 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot;.

==Tour==

Alice in Chains were added as openers to Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No More Tours&quot; tour. Days before the tour began, Staley broke his foot in an ATV accident, forcing him to use crutches on stage. During the tour, Starr was fired following the Hollywood Rock concert in Rio de Janeiro on January 22, 1993, and was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez.

During June–August 1993, Alice in Chains joined Primus, Tool, Rage Against the Machine and Babes in Toyland for the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza, which was the last major tour the band played with Staley.

==Track listing==
&quot;Sickman&quot;, &quot;Junkhead&quot;, &quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;God Smack&quot; are credited to Cantrell/Staley with no specification for lyrics or music. &quot;Rain When I Die&quot; is credited to Cantrell/Staley/Kinney/Starr, and it was later stated that Cantrell and Staley wrote the lyrics.

 I On early U.S. and Canadian pressings, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; appeared as track 12 placed between &quot;Angry Chair&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;. Current U.S. and Canadian editions of the CD and the Vinyl have &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; as the fourth track, located between &quot;Rain When I Die&quot; and &quot;Sickman&quot;, which was the track listing that the band originally intended before the record company changed the order.

 II Track 9 or 10, &quot;Iron Gland&quot;, appears without a title on the album. The title appeared on the compilations &quot;Nothing Safe&quot; and &quot;Music Bank&quot;. The iTunes Store lists it incorrectly as &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Before the name &quot;Iron Gland&quot; was revealed, it was labeled in some online databases as &quot;Intro (Dream Sequence)&quot;. On editions in which &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; is track 4, &quot;Iron Gland&quot; is track 10. The track is unlisted on some versions of the album, and some editions remove the track completely or merge it with &quot;Hate to Feel&quot;. On the back cover of the edition in which &quot;Iron Gland&quot; is track 9, &quot;Hate to Feel&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot; are listed from 9–12. However, when the CD is played, the songs are on tracks 10–13.

==Outtakes==
The songs &quot;Fear the Voices&quot; and &quot;Lying Season&quot; were featured on Alice in Chains&#x27; 1991 demo tape that featured songs from &quot;Sap&quot; and &quot;Dirt&quot;. Both of these songs were later included on the band&#x27;s 1999 box set, &quot;Music Bank&quot;. &quot;Fear the Voices&quot; was released as a single in 1999 to promote &quot;Music Bank&quot; and became a radio hit that same year. Regarding the two songs, Cantrell said that they came from a time when the band was still developing its sound.

<doc id="197077" wikidata="Q1087498" url="?curid=197077" title="At Fillmore East">
<text>At Fillmore East is the first live album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band, and their third release overall. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released on July 6, 1971 in the United States, by Capricorn Records. As the title indicates, the recording took place at the New York City music venue Fillmore East, which was run by concert promoter Bill Graham. It was recorded over the course of three nights in March 1971 (only two nights were used for the album) and features the band performing extended jam versions of songs such as &quot;Whipping Post&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; and &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot;. When first commercially released, it was issued as a double LP with just seven songs across four vinyl sides.

&quot;At Fillmore East&quot; was the band&#x27;s artistic and commercial breakthrough, rapidly escalating the band&#x27;s exposure and gaining them a new legion of loyal fans. &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; has since been widely regarded as one of the greatest live albums of all time and the start of the band&#x27;s association with the jam band school of music (although members of the band have repudiated the label, stating instead they are just &quot;a band that jams&quot;). It has also been ranked among the best overall albums by artists and continues to be a top seller in the band&#x27;s catalog, becoming their first album to go platinum. In 2004, the album was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress, deemed to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the National Recording Registry.

==Background==
Shortly after completing recording of their second album, &quot;Idlewild South&quot; (1970), band leader Duane Allman was contacted by guitarist Eric Clapton to contribute to his new project, Derek and the Dominos. Allman was a huge fan of his work with the band Cream, and likewise Clapton enjoyed Allman&#x27;s session work on Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;Hey Jude&quot; some years prior. They met after a show one night in Miami and had a jam session together until the next afternoon, with the two guitarists regarding one another as &quot;instant soulmates&quot;. Clapton invited Allman to join Derek and the Dominos, and according to band biographer Alan Paul he considered it; in the end, he declined and rejoined the Allman Brothers Band, returning after missing a string of several shows. The sessions were collected on the album &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;, issued that November.

In the interim, &quot;Idlewild South&quot; had yet to achieve strong commercial success, but the band&#x27;s popularity and reputation began to increase due to their live performances. The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road traveling in a Ford Econoline van and later, a Winnebago, nicknamed the Wind Bag. During this time, the group began struggling with drug addictions. Everyone in the group, with the exception of the brothers, was also struggling to make a living (vocalist Gregg Allman received more money from royalty payments and Duane more from session work). In one incident, tour manager Twiggs Lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band; he later claimed temporary insanity. Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, where the band&#x27;s average earnings doubled.

The Allman Brothers Band had first played Fillmore East in December 1969, opening for Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears for three nights. Promoter Bill Graham enjoyed the band and promised to have them back soon. In January 1970, the band opened for Buddy Guy and B.B. King at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore West, and one month later at Fillmore East supporting the Grateful Dead. According to biographer Alan Paul, &quot;these shows were crucial in establishing the band and exposing them to a wider, sympathetic audience on both coasts.&quot; Drummer Butch Trucks considered their performances at the Fillmore East to be the launching pad for their success. In 1970, Duane Allman told disc jockey Ed Shane, &quot;You know, we get kind of frustrated doing the [studio] records, and I think, consequently, our next album will be ... a live recording, to get some of that natural fire on it.&quot; &quot;We were not intentionally trying to buck the system, but keeping each song down to 3:14 just didn&#x27;t work for us,&quot; remembered Gregg Allman. &quot;And we realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn&#x27;t be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album.&quot;

==Recording and production==

&quot;At Fillmore East&quot; was recorded over two nights, playing two shows each night — March 12 and 13, 1971 — for which the band was paid $1,250 each show. Recordings from an earlier night&#x27;s shows were dropped, because they had horns which were deemed unhelpful. The shows were typical performances for the band, and regarded as slightly above average by drummer Jai Johanny Johanson. Ads for the shows read: &quot;Bill Graham Presents in New York — Johnny Winter And, Elvin Bishop Group, Extra Added Attraction: Allman Brothers.&quot; While Winter was billed as headliner, by the third night the Allman Brothers were closing the show.

Tom Dowd produced &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;; he had previously worked on their second studio album, &quot;Idlewild South&quot;. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film &quot;Soul to Soul&quot;, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. &quot;It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff who took care of business,&quot; recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, &quot;which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics.&quot; Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph &quot;Juicy&quot; Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding &quot;unofficial&quot; band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. &quot;I was just hoping we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable,&quot; said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.

Each night following the shows, the musicians and Dowd would &quot;grab some beers and sandwiches&quot; and head to Manhattan&#x27;s Atlantic Studios to go over the performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. &quot;We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn&#x27;t want to go back and overdub anything, because then it wouldn&#x27;t have been a real live album,&quot; said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette&#x27;s harmonica when it didn&#x27;t fit. &quot;That was our pinnacle,&quot; said Dickey Betts later. &quot;The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have. If you asked everybody in the band, they would probably say that.&quot;

On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and the band were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys initially refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and they were free to leave if they disagreed. This Allman Brothers&#x27; performance was used for the second disc of the 2006 expanded version of the follow-up album to &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;At Fillmore East&quot; showcases the band&#x27;s eclectic mixture of blues, rock, country, and jazz. &quot;Fusion is a term that came later, but if you wanted to look at a fusion album, it would be &quot;Fillmore East&quot;. Here was a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band playing blues in the jazz vernacular. And they tore the place up,&quot; said Dowd. Stage Manager Michael Ahern opens &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; with a simple introduction: &quot;Okay, the Allman Brothers Band.&quot; Duane Allman biographer Randy Poe describes it as &quot;the only low-key moment over the course of the [show].&quot; The cover of Blind Willie McTell&#x27;s &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; which opens the set showcases Duane Allman&#x27;s slide guitar work in open E tuning. &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; bears close resemblance to Taj Mahal&#x27;s 1968 rendition, which had inspired Duane to pick up slide guitar playing. &quot;Done Somebody Wrong&quot; follows, and is introduced by Duane as &quot;an old Elmore James song ... This is an old true story ...&quot; Thom Doucette takes a solo on blues harp, and by the end of the song, the band breaks out of the shuffle and &quot;builds up to a dual-lead guitar, triplet-based crescendo.&quot;
&quot;Stormy Monday&quot; echoes the band&#x27;s blues roots, and many guitar parts come from the version cut by Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland in the early 1960s. Allman and Betts trade solos, as does Gregg Allman on the organ as the tempo shifts into a &quot;swinging&quot; beat. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; kicks off the first of the jazz-inspired jams and features a solo from Duane Allman in which the entire group stops, leaving it just him and his guitar. The song&#x27;s conclusion quotes the Christian hymn &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. &quot;Hot &#x27;Lanta&quot; is an instrumental, which has elements in common with jazz rock and progressive rock, and is a showcase for Berry Oakley&#x27;s bass-playing. &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot;, with its harmonized melody, Latin feel, and burning drive invited comparisons with jazz saxophonist John Coltrane (especially Duane&#x27;s solo-ending pull-offs, a direct nod to the musician). The performance begins with a &quot;long, laconic intro&quot; by Betts employing volume swells, reminiscent of the &quot;dreamy trumpet&quot; used to open songs on Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (1959).
&quot;Whipping Post&quot; (opening in 11/8 time, unusual territory for a rock band) by this point had become one of the longest jams in the band&#x27;s set; the original album version runs five minutes, while the &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; version exceeds 23. Aside from the opening bassline and lyrics, the two versions are completely unalike. Again, Betts and Allman trade long guitar solos, with one of Betts&#x27; solos quoting what would later become the main theme for the song &quot;Les Brers in A Minor&quot;, as featured on the band&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;. The song includes a false ending which quotes the theme of the French nursery rhyme song &quot;Frère Jacques&quot;, and finally closes with &quot;long, sustained notes&quot; from Allman opposite Trucks&#x27; kettledrum. Applause concludes the album and the song fades out. During the fadeout, Trucks begins playing the tympani intro to &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; which would not be released in its entirety until its inclusion on &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;.

==Artwork==
The band devised the cover idea for &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; rather than leaving it in the hands of Atlantic executives (Duane Allman was particularly disgusted with the artwork for Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;,&quot; although that album&#x27;s artwork was created by Stax Records, which Atlantic had previously distributed). Initially, the album cover was to be shots of the band taken in front of the Fillmore East with their names on the marquee above them, but no one was satisfied with the results. The band&#x27;s main purpose for the cover was that it be as &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; as the band&#x27;s ethos and performing, and someone suggested the band make it a photograph of the band in an alley waiting with their gear to go onstage.
The image was shot by photographer Jim Marshall one morning in the band&#x27;s home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot (&quot;we figured it didn&#x27;t make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it,&quot; said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release &quot;The Fillmore Concerts&quot; shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title on one of the road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.
The back cover shows their road crew gathered in the same spot with 16 oz cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer provided by the photographer as a reward to the roadies for lugging out and stacking the band&#x27;s heavy equipment for the shoot. Among the crew on the back cover are Joseph &quot;Red Dog&quot; Campbell, Kim Payne, Mike Callahan, Joe Dan Petty and Willie Perkins (the last two the newest additions to the crew at the time). The idea to have the crew on the back cover was Duane Allman&#x27;s idea, as all involved viewed them the &quot;unsung heroes&quot; in the operation. A photo of Lyndon, then in jail awaiting his trial, was superimposed to the wall behind the crew.

==Release and critical reception==

&quot;At Fillmore East&quot; was released in July 1971 by Capricorn Records as a double album, but reduced to the cost of a single LP. Atlantic and Atco initially rejected the idea of issuing a double album, with Jerry Wexler feeling it &quot;ridiculous to preserve all these jams.&quot; Manager Phil Walden explained to executives that the band were less of a studio band and that live performances were most important to them. In all, the album featured seven songs spread over four vinyl sides. The album received strong initial sales. While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts (often near the bottom of the top 200), the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days. &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; peaked at number thirteen on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America that October. The album was later certified platinum on August 25, 1992.

In a contemporary review, George Kimball of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said that &quot;The Allman Brothers had many fine moments at the Fillmores, and this live double album (recorded March 12th and 13th of this year) must surely epitomize all of them.&quot; Kimball cited the band as &quot;the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years&quot; and said of comparisons to the Grateful Dead at the time, &quot;The range of their material and the more tenuous fact that they also use two drummers have led to what I suppose are inevitable comparisons to the Dead in its better days.&quot; In a less enthusiastic review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; a &quot;B−&quot; grade and said the songs &quot;sure do boogie&quot;, but ultimately found it musically aimless: &quot;even if Duane Allman plus Dickey Betts does equal Jerry Garcia, the Dead know roads are for getting somewhere. That is, Garcia (not to bring in John Coltrane) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. I guess the appeal here is the inevitability of it all.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album five out of five stars and stated, &quot;[it] remains the pinnacle of the Allmans and Southern rock at its most elastic, bluesy, and jazzy&quot;. Mark Kemp of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it five stars in a 2002 review and commented that &quot;these shows [...] remain the finest live rock performance ever committed to vinyl&quot;, and the album &quot;captures America&#x27;s best blues-rock band at its peak&quot;.

&quot;At Fillmore East&quot; was one of 50 recordings chosen in 2004 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it at number 49 in their 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, describing it as &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest live double LP&quot;, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revision, and slipping to number 105 in the 2020 reboot of the list. The album was also included in the books &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005) and &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; (2008). In the latter, author Tom Moon noted that, nearly forty years after its release, &quot;[the album] remains one of the best live albums in rock history. Ornery and loud, it&#x27;s perfect driving music for the road that goes on forever.&quot;

In 2020 &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper rated it the best live album of all time.

==Expanded editions==
Over the years several expanded editions of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; have been released.

===&quot;The Fillmore Concerts&quot;===
On October 10, 1992, &quot;The Fillmore Concerts&quot;, an expanded version of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;, was released as a two-disc CD. It includes all the songs from the original album, plus the live songs from &quot;Eat a Peach&quot; – &quot;One Way Out&quot;, &quot;Trouble No More&quot;, and &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; – and two additional tracks – &quot;Don&#x27;t Keep Me Wonderin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Drunken Hearted Boy&quot; – all of which were recorded at the same concerts. The album was remixed from the concert recordings, and a few of the songs are alternate takes, so the same songs sound somewhat different from those on the original album.

===&quot;At Fillmore East&quot; Deluxe Edition===
The Deluxe Edition was released as a two-disc CD on September 23, 2003. It contains the same songs, in a slightly different order, as &quot;The Fillmore Concerts&quot;, and one additional track from the same concerts, &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;. The Deluxe Edition is based on the master recordings for &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; and &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;, and so it sounds more similar to those albums than &quot;The Fillmore Concerts&quot; does.

===&quot;The 1971 Fillmore East Recordings&quot;===
&quot;The 1971 Fillmore East Recordings&quot; was released on July 29, 2014. This six-CD boxed set contains the four complete concerts—the early and late shows from March 12 and March 13, 1971—from which the songs included on &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; were selected, plus the Allman Brothers&#x27; performance at the Fillmore East closing show on June 27, 1971. A three Blu-ray edition was also released which contains a multi-channel mix.

<doc id="197081" wikidata="Q643264" url="?curid=197081" title="Homecoming (America album)">
<text>Homecoming is the second studio album by America, released on November 15, 1972, through Warner Bros. Records. Acoustic guitar-based, with a more pronounced electric guitar and keyboard section than their first album, their second effort helped continue the band&#x27;s success, and includes one of their best known hits, &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;.

&quot;Homecoming&quot; peaked at number 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA. It produced three hit singles: &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, which peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart and number 3 on the adult contemporary chart; &quot;Don&#x27;t Cross the River&quot;, which hit number 35 on &quot;Billboard&quot; and 23 on the AC chart; and &quot;Only in Your Heart&quot; peaked at number 62 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Pop singles chart. Several other songs received radio airplay on FM stations playing album tracks, including &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, &quot;California Revisited&quot;, and &quot;Cornwall Blank&quot;.

For this album and the next six throughout the next five years, the group traditionally chose titles beginning with the letter &quot;H&quot; (the self-titled debut album became unofficially included in this distinction when fans started referring to it as the &quot;Horse with No Name&quot; album when that track was added to later pressings).

==Reception==
In his AllMusic review music critic David Cleary called &quot;Homecoming&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s finest album&quot; and despite citing sometimes banal lyrics, wrote that &quot;each song here has something to recommend it. This top-flight album is a very rewarding listen.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; said of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cross the River&quot; that it was a &quot;more countrified cut [than &#x27;Ventura Highway&#x27;] complete with banjos and all.&quot;

<doc id="197082" wikidata="Q1946524" url="?curid=197082" title="Han nationalism">
<text>Han nationalism is a form of ethnic nationalism asserting ethnically Han Chinese as the exclusive constituents of the Chinese nation. It is often in dialogue with other conceptions of Chinese nationalism, often mutually-exclusive or otherwise contradictory ones. Han Chinese are the dominant ethnic group in both states claiming to represent the Chinese nation: the Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Han Chinese also constitute a sizable ethnic minority or plurality group in a number of other countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore. In the modern era, ethnicity&#x27;s role in the Chinese nation continue to color conceptions of Chinese culture, geopolitics, and history. Han nationalism is to contrasted with the opposing concept of local ethnic nationalism.

==History==
Unlike Chinese nationalism, Han Chinese nationalism has a historical root of being strongly stressed on the Han Chinese people, the dominant ethnic group of China that originates from Huaxia or Sinitic people. Han Chinese nationalism has often been used as a rallying force, stemming from the historical pride of the Han Chinese people in developing one of the world&#x27;s earliest civilizations.

Since the Han dynasty, ideas of Han Chinese superiority have been frequently used in attempts to expand China&#x27;s territory. Examples of this can be seen in previous Chinese invasions of Korea and Vietnam, and in historical conquests of Central Asia, Tibet, Xinjiang and Mongolia. This was later inherited by later dynasties of China, notably the Tang dynasty and the Ming dynasty. The Tang dynasty exerted control beyond the border of old Huaxia, allowing the later Ming dynasty to become a major naval power. Han Chinese ideas of superiority were complex, with contrasting Confucian narratives of Han superiority and ones of diversity in the army and the Empire.

Han Chinese nationalism also played a key part in rallying against non-Han control of China. The Han Chinese nationalist movement led by Ming dynasty&#x27;s Hongwu Emperor played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. Han Chinese nationalism was also integral to the rebellion against the Manchu Qing dynasty and became increasingly institutionalized following the Century of Humiliation. These rebellions were often led by Han Chinese nationalists, including Sun Yat-sen, who considered the Manchu Qing dynasty corrupt and immoral, and took an aggressive stance against Western imperialism. The Boxer Rebellion in late 19th century had been seen as another specific part of Han Chinese nationalism juxtaposed against Western imperialism in China, where Han Chinese nationalists were against Western and modern ideas and sought to revive old Chinese traditions.

Following the fall of the Qing dynasty, Sun Yat-sen attempted to build a more multi-ethnic form of Chinese nationalism. He had some noteworthy successes, such as the rise of Nationalist China and the five-colored flag. Han Chinese nationalism remains prominent in China today. Chinese leaders have employed Han nationalist sentiments, including the ongoing Han domination of China, and promotion of nationalism, as witnessed in the Republic&#x27;s domestic and foreign relations.

===Han chauvinism===

Han chauvinism is described as a more radical form of Han nationalism by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP chairman Mao Zedong coined the term in order to describe the chauvinism of the Han Chinese, first on 16 March 1953, in order to criticize the ethnocentrism that existed among the Han Chinese in China. In a party directive which was drafted for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party titled &quot;Criticize Han Chauvinism,&quot; Mao said, &quot;In some places, the relations between nationalities are far from normal. For Communists, this is an intolerable situation. We must go to the root and criticize the Han chauvinist ideas which exist to a serious degree among many Party members and cadres ...&quot;

It appeared again in a 1956 speech, titled &quot;Ten Major Relations&quot;, Mao stated that &quot;on the relationship between the Han ethnicity and minority ethnicities ... we put the emphasis on opposing Han chauvinism&quot;. This anti-chauvinistic idea is part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s &quot;zhonghua minzu&quot; conception of China as a multi-ethnic nation, both historically and in the present, which includes not only the Han but also 55 ethnic minorities. This is expressed in the constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which states that China is a &quot;unitary [multiethnic] state created jointly by the people of all its ethnicities&quot; and &quot;it is necessary to combat big [ethnic group] chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and combat local [ethnic] national[ist] chauvinism&quot;.

The PRC&#x27;s notions of Han chauvinism and China as a multicultural state have been subjected to criticism, mainly by the western media. One critical view is that the Han Chinese &quot;are less homogeneous than official policy recognizes&quot;. &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; has been criticized as an invention of the 20th century, and was adopted by the Communist Party only to criticize the failures of the rival Kuomintang (KMT), which officially promoted &quot;zhonghua minzu&quot; as part of its nationalist ideology. Many policies have been made to give privilege to minority ethnicities, leading to grudges from some of the Han Chinese. Despite this, authorities in China have also denied the existence of racism or racial discrimination in China.

In post-Mao China, Han chauvinism has been recognized as a threat by successive generations of its leadership, including the administration of CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping. However, Xi Jinping&#x27;s concept of a Chinese Dream is believed to have distinctly Han dimensions, and it is also believed to support Han chauvinism even if it is unwittingly doing so. The fusion of traditional Han chauvinism with Chinese nationalism as practiced by the modern Chinese state has been described as Han-centrism.

==Relations with Chinese nationalism==

Although Han Chinese nationalism and Chinese nationalism are different in terms of ideology, with the latter often emphasizing a more multi-ethnic form of nationalism, both forms of nationalism have frequently been connected and espoused together, due to historical and current control of China by the ethnic Han Chinese majority. The concept was first debated in the early 20th century; one of those who debated it was Zhang Taiyan, who strongly opposed the development of a multi-ethnic form of nationalism which was proposed by Yang Du and Liang Qichao, stressed the existence of the Han ethnic bloodline as evidence of the greatness of China and rejected the notion of a multiethnic China, being skeptical of non-Han ethnic groups like Manchus, Mongols, Tibetans and Turkic Muslims. Zhang Taiyan strongly criticized non-Han ethnic groups, notably the Manchus, he considered the Manchus and other non-Han Chinese oppressors and believed that they could not be assimilated because they had no understanding of Han Chinese culture and customs. There were, however, significant proponents of a multi-ethnic form of Chinese nationalism as well, and Tibet remained independent during the rule of the Republic of China.

The multifaceted image of Han Chinese nationalism continued to develop during the formation of the modern Chinese state. Han Chinese nationalists had a low opinion of ethnic Uyghurs and Tibetans, viewing them as threats to the Chinese state due to their different cultures and their lack of sympathy for ethnic Han Chinese — resulting in several conflicts during the 1930s and 1940s. Han Chinese nationalism also played a role during World War II, a war which was waged in conjunction with the Second Sino-Japanese War as a part of World War II, a war in which the Han Chinese people frequently suffered, and fought, against the Japanese.

==In ethnic relations==

Although the current Chinese government has largely attempted to promote the idea of a multiethnic nationalism with Han Chinese is the main people instead of a singular ethnic nationalism, scholars and analysts have pointed about the lack of an agreed-upon definition of Chinese nationalism may have impacted on China&#x27;s political decision with regard to other non-Han Chinese people or nations.
===Tibetans===
Since the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1950, Han Chinese nationalists, with support from the PRC government, have been distributing historical documents which portray Tibetan culture as barbaric in order to justify Chinese control of the territory of Tibet; as such, many members of Chinese society have a negative view of Tibet. Han Chinese continue to maintain the view that Tibet was historically a feudal society which practiced serfdom/slavery and that this only changed due to Chinese influence in the region in order to liberate the Tibetans from its own backwardness and China&#x27;s duty is to bring civilization to Tibetans. Furthermore, Han nationalists openly endorse Princess Wencheng, an ancient Chinese princess who purportedly married king Songsten Gampo of Tibet and introduced Buddhism to Tibet. Further, Han Chinese extremists believe that Tibetans [and Mongols, Uyghurs] are actually part of the wider Han Chinese family with different genetics.

===Uyghurs===
Since being conquered in 1758, Uyghurs from Xinjiang have had issues with the Manchurian and later Chinese governments. Han migration dating back to the Qing dynasty led to the increasing sinicization of the region, which the policy further extended to ethnic relations. Han and Hui people often live closer to Uighurs and many developed a negative stereotype of them.

===Mongols===

Inner Mongolia has been largely pacified since the 20th century, thanks to massive Han migration and intermarriage; Mongols have been perceived to be better integrated into the society than that of Uyghurs and Tibetans. However, this is also where the infamous Inner Mongolia incident happened, leading to deaths of 16,000 to 27,000 Mongols. Further policies deemed to be anti-Mongol by the Han Chinese government had led to 2011 Inner Mongolia unrest and was followed by another wave of unrest in 2015 against the exploitation and misuse of Mongol lands, as well as perceived bias in favor of ethnic Han Chinese.

==Han Taiwanese nationalism==

In Taiwan, Han-centric Taiwanese nationalism is distinct from Han-centric Chinese nationalism. Han Taiwanese nationalist focuses on non-mainlanders and non-Austronesians, including Hokkien and Hakka. However, not all Taiwanese nationalists are Han nationalists. Zheng Chenggong, who founded the Kingdom of Tungning, was a representative early Han nationalist in Taiwan. In 2004, then-Taiwanese Vice President and pro-Taiwan independence activist Annette Lu caused controversy by making Han-centric racist comments about Taiwanese indigenous peoples.

<text>Soyuz 3 (, &quot;Union 3&quot;) was a spaceflight mission launched by the Soviet Union on 26 October 1968. Flown by Georgy Beregovoy, the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft completed 81 orbits over four days. The 47-year-old Beregovoy was a decorated World War II flying ace and the oldest person to go into orbit up to that time. The mission achieved the first Russian space rendezvous with the uncrewed Soyuz 2, but failed to achieve a planned docking of the two craft.

== Mission parameters ==
*Mass: 
*Perigee: 
*Apogee: 
*Inclination: 51.66°
*Period: 88.87 minutes

== Background ==
The Soviet space program had experienced great success in its early years, but by the mid-1960s the pace of success had slowed. While the Voskhod programme achieved the first multi-crewed spaceflight and first extravehicular activity (EVA), problems encountered led to its termination after only two flights, allowing the United States to surpass the Soviet achievements with the Project Gemini. The Soyuz programme was intended to rejuvenate the program by developing space rendezvous and docking capability, and practical extravehicular activity without tiring the cosmonaut, as had been demonstrated by the United States Gemini. These capabilities would be required for the Soviet manned Lunar landing program and the Salyut programme (space station). Soyuz 1 had been launched with the goal of docking with the crewed Soyuz 2 craft, but even before the second craft was launched, problems with Soyuz 1 made it clear that Soyuz 2 had to be cancelled before the landing of Soyuz 1. This saved the lives of the three-man Soyuz 2 crew; Soyuz 1 ended with the death of cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on 23 April 1967, due to a faulty parachute system. Soyuz 2 would have flown with the same defective system as Soyuz 1. As a result, the Soyuz spacecraft was revised for Soyuz 2 and Soyuz 3 in 1968.

== Spaceflight ==
Soyuz 2 (capsule number 7K-OK-P No. 11) was launched on 25 October 1968 as an uncrewed target vehicle for Soyuz 3 (capsule number 7K-OK-P No. 10), which was launched the following day. The launch of Soyuz 2 was not reported by the government, although other nations were aware through their own monitors. It was not until Soyuz 3 was safely aloft that an official announcement was made.

The more conservative mission used Beregovoy as the single pilot, with Vladimir Shatalov designated as his backup, and Boris Volynov in reserve. Entering orbit and near Soyuz 2 a half-hour after launch, Beregovoy gradually guided his craft within docking range () of his target.

However, Beregovoy failed to achieve docking. He failed to notice that Soyuz 2 was turned upside-down in relation to his craft, and used up too much of his maneuvering fuel in the attempt.

He made a second rendezvous and docking attempt the next day, but again failed. Hours later, Soyuz 2 was sent back to Earth and landed by 07:51 GMT the next day. Beregovoy continued to orbit, making topographical and meteorological observations for the next two days. Beregovoy also treated television viewers to a &quot;live&quot; tour of the spacecraft interior. In addition, the Soviets published a photo of Soyuz 3&#x27;s launch vehicle on the pad at Baikonur, marking the first time that the R-7 was shown to the outside world.

== Return ==
Beregovoy and Soyuz 3 came back to Earth on 30 October 1968, after completing 81 full orbits of the Earth. The descent module landed near the city of Karaganda in Kazakhstan, cushioned by a blizzard&#x27;s snowfall. Despite subzero temperatures, Beregovoy&#x27;s landing was so easy he said later that he hardly felt the impact at all. 
The Soviets hailed Soyuz 3 as a complete success. Beregovoy was promoted to Major general and named director of the national Center for Cosmonaut Training at Star City.

== Soviet disingenuousness ==
The Soviet government concealed the fact that docking had been unsuccessfully attempted. Contemporary Western news reports described the orbital mission of Soyuz 3 in the same manner as the Soviet press, referring to a &quot;successful rendezvous&quot; with Soyuz 2, but characterizing it as a test with no actual ship-to-ship docking planned. This interpretation was largely accepted for years afterward. The intended docking was disclosed only after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

== Legacy ==
The flight of Soyuz 3 had numerous effects on future space exploration both short- and long-term. The flawless recovery of Soyuz 3 left the spacecraft designers with the impression that re-entry and landing systems had been perfected: the crash-landing of the Zond 6 satellite just one month later had been partly attributed to this mistaken sense of security. The value of the outer space survey of Earth was a defining step in the development of the Soyuz program&#x27;s grand strategy: the later evolution of space-based research platforms have roots in Beregovoy&#x27;s lengthy and meticulous data-collection. Even the failure of the space docking proved an experiential benefit to the Soviet space program: after the demoralizing catastrophe of Soyuz 1, the credible achievements and safe return of Soyuz 3 breathed new life into the faltering program. New flights continued apace, and they put the knowledge gained from Soyuz 3 towards missions of increasing audacity and success.

<doc id="197087" wikidata="Q426128" url="?curid=197087" title="...I Care Because You Do">
<text>...I Care Because You Do is the third studio album by the British electronic music artist and producer Richard D. James under the alias of Aphex Twin. It was released on 24 April 1995 through Warp Records and contains material recorded between 1990 and 1994. It marked James&#x27;s return to a beat-driven sound following the mostly ambient album &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; (1994), and combines abrasive rhythms with symphonic and ambient elements. The cover artwork is a self-portrait of James.

&quot;I Care Because You Do&quot; entered the &#x27;s Dance Albums Chart at number4 and the Albums Chart at number24. It was supported by the single and Extended Play (EP) release of the track &quot;Ventolin&quot;. The album received positive reviews. It garnered comparisons to the work of composer Philip Glass, who later created an orchestral version of the track &quot;Icct Hedral&quot;, and John Cage. The reviewers for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; preferred it to his two previous albums. In 2017 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;I Care Because You Do&quot; the 13th best IDM album of all time.

==Composition==
Each track on &quot;I Care Because You Do&quot; is annotated with a date; the tracks were created between 1990 and 1994. It was James&#x27; final album to be recorded with mostly analogue technology before he began using digital production methods.

According to AllMusic, the album finds James &quot;pairing his hardcore experimentalism with more symphonic ambient material, aligned with the work of many post-classical composers&quot; such as Philip Glass. Writer Dave Thompson described the album as &quot;pulling together calm, serene moments then launching into battering and bruising beat-heavy tracks&quot;, and said the rhythms shift &quot;from trancey to hip-hoppish&quot;. Thompson also noted the influence of modern composers such as Glass. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated the music has &quot;little to do with techno in any of its more popular guises&quot;, and compared it to the work of Glass and John Cage, and said the album draws &quot;most strongly from hip-hop ... James&#x27; trademark is to put rhythm and percussion above all else; his beautiful, haunting melodies are relegated to the back of the mix.&quot;

According to &quot;Exclaim!&quot;, &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; has been described as &quot;occupying a middle-ground between Philip Glass and the Wu-Tang Clan&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; wrote the album &quot;showed up trip-hop laziness&quot;, while &quot;Dummy Mag&quot; said James was taking trip hop and &quot;refashioning [the] voguish genre in his own image&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;By adding layers of soft, warm synthesizer chords over skull-grinding electronic percussion, James creates sounds that are simultaneously comforting and scary&quot;. In 2003 &quot;NME&quot; summarized the album as &quot;a shotgun wedding of analogue rave and ambient porridge.&quot; In 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated the increasingly active drum backing on the album was inspired by the presence of drum and bass music in the United Kingdom.

==Release==
&quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; was released on 24 April 1995 on vinyl record, compact disc, and cassette. It entered the &#x27;s Dance Albums Chart at number4 and the Albums Chart at number24, remaining on the latter for two weeks. The label 1972 re-released &quot;I Care Because You Do&quot; on vinyl on 18 September 2012. Warp also re-issued the album in vinyl with a download card on 8 October 2012. In 2017, the album was re-released in digital format with eight bonus tracks.

The album&#x27;s cover artwork is a self-portrait painted by James. It was the first of several Aphex Twin releases to feature an image of James&#x27; grinning face on the cover.

Following the album&#x27;s release, composer Philip Glass contributed an orchestral arrangement to &quot;Icct Hedral&quot; that was included on the 1995 EP &quot;Donkey Rhubarb&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Select&quot; ranked &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; at 42 on its 2022 &quot;Top 50 Albums of the Year&quot; list, saying the album is &quot;Leftfield, sound-pop brilliance&quot; and James&#x27; &quot;most coherent work to date&quot;. Another review in &quot;Select&quot; stated James had the ability to &quot;make the avant-garde sound pop&quot; and that he &quot;delivers complex contemporary systems music in the most deliciously simple forms&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave the album a positive review, stating: &quot;As ever, [James&#x27;] palette of sound is astonishing, his arrangements effective and deliberate&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;classical music for a generation raised on samplers&quot;, stating James was &quot;making some of the most engaging and important music of our time&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; and called it superior work to &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot;, writing it &quot;reintroduces tension, more beats per minute, and sonic grime into his music&quot;, and that it &quot;creates sounds that are simultaneously comforting and scary – a fitting metaphor for the contemporary clash of technology and the humans befuddled by it&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; also stated that album is superior to &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; because &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; &quot;cut the middle of [techno]&#x27;s kitchen-sink aesthetic without sacrificing melody coherence or rhythm&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; also described it as &quot;a real album with its own gestalt&quot;, in which capacity it betters the &quot;truly great&quot; Aphex Twin albums &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot; (1992) and &quot;Classics&quot; (1995).

In a retrospective of James&#x27; work in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Sasha Frere-Jones said the album&#x27;s more-recent tracks were its best ones. Justin Boreta from the group The Glitch Mob reviewed the album in 2015, praising it for &quot;the juxtaposition between heavy darkness and gentle depth&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Kyle Fowle described &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot; as &quot;a perfect bridge between James&#x27; implementation of experimental techno and glossy ambient&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it the 13th-best intelligent dance music (IDM) album of all time.

<text>I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You is the tenth studio album by American singer Aretha Franklin, released on March 10, 1967, by Atlantic Records. It was Franklin&#x27;s first release under her contract with the label, following her departure from Columbia Records after nine unsuccessful jazz standard albums, and marked a commercial breakthrough for her, becoming her first top 10 album in the United States, reaching number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Two singles were released to promote the album: &quot;Respect&quot; (an Otis Redding cover) and &quot;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&quot;. The former topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while latter reached the top 10.

Although initially released to a mixed critical response, the album was eventually widely reappraised and is now regarded as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time, being included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list, in which it was ranked at number 13 in the 2020 iteration, as well as in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s cover of &quot;Respect&quot; became her signature song and was ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the greatest song of all time in 2021.

==Background==
&quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot; is Aretha&#x27;s first album with Atlantic Records. The title track was recorded at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. After an altercation broke out between Franklin&#x27;s then husband, Ted White, trumpeter Ken Laxton and FAME studios owner/producer Rick Hall, producer Jerry Wexler arranged to continue recording the LP at Atlantic Studios, New York. The B-side, &quot;Do Right Woman, Do Right Man&quot;, was unfinished at FAME studios as the session ended abruptly. Members of the Muscle Shoals rhythm section were flown to New York to complete &quot;Do Right Woman&quot; and a number of other tracks (including &quot;Respect&quot;). There was a discrepancy in the tape-recording speeds of the two studios. The foundation track of &quot;Do Right Woman&quot; recorded at Muscle Shoals and the later tracks added at Atlantic&#x27;s New York studio are slightly out of tune with each other: Producer Chips Moman regretted that the piano was faintly sharp.

The record spent several weeks at number 2 on the main &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and 14 weeks at number 1 in the magazine&#x27;s Top R&amp;B Albums chart. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1967, eventually selling nearly two million. It was voted number 352 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). It received a number 83 ranking on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 84 in a 2012 revised list and 13 in the 2020 edition. The album was also included in both the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2005) and &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; (2008). When &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the &quot;Women in Rock: 50 Essential Albums&quot; in 2002 and again 2012, the album was named at number one. The album included two top-10 singles: &quot;Respect&quot; was a number-1 single on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 Pop singles chart, and &quot;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&quot; peaked at number 9. The album was rated the 10th best album of the 1960s by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

==Reception==
In 1967, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; chided the album for &quot;the lack of versatility on the part of the sidemen. The drums weren&#x27;t hard enough, the guitar was weak, and the production lacked polish.&quot; In 2002, though, they placed the album at number 1 on their &quot;Women in Rock: 50 Essential Albums&quot; list. In 2003, the album was ranked number 83 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Music Critic Robert Christgau, gave the album an A, stating that &quot;Not all of the tracks sound inspired&quot; but also that it was the best album she had made up until that point. &quot;Q&quot; included the album on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; also gave the album 4 stars and said &quot;[the album] came out in May 1967 and was number 2 in America within weeks ... now it stands untainted by time. She seemed so much a force of nature it&#x27;s strange to recall that this was actually her tenth album ...&quot;

In the obituary for Aretha Franklin, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; made this comment about &quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot;: &quot;It puts the emphasis not just on the great songs, or the amazing music, but on the person speaking them, her world, her story and whatever journey she&#x27;s on in life. It rings out like revealed truth happening in real time, a declaration of independence.&quot;

<text>Lady Soul is the twelfth studio album by American singer Aretha Franklin released in early 1968 by Atlantic Records. The album stayed at #1 for sixteen weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album chart, and it hit number 2 on the pop album chart (underneath Paul Mauriat) during a year-long run.

==Background==
&quot;Lady Soul&quot; was Franklin&#x27;s third R&amp;B chart-topper and reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, tying with &quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot; for her highest-charting album on the pop chart. The album also included some of her biggest hit singles: &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; (number 2 Pop), and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; (number 8 Pop), and &quot;(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; (number 5 Pop). It sold more than a million copies in the United States. The album was reissued on Rhino Records in a deluxe edition in 1995.

Gospel/R&amp;B singer Cissy Houston (mother of Whitney Houston) and her group the Sweet Inspirations are credited as background vocals on several tracks, along with Aretha&#x27;s sisters Carolyn Franklin and Erma Franklin. Eric Clapton, at the time a member of the band Cream, is credited as the guitarist on the track &quot;Good to Me as I Am to You&quot;.

&quot;Lady Soul&quot; peaked at number 1, number 2 and number 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Black Albums, Pop Albums and Jazz Albums charts respectively. The single &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot; – B-Side of &quot;(Sweet, Sweet, Baby) Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; – peaked at number 9 on the Black Singles chart and number 16 on the Pop Singles chart.

==Legacy==
The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2003, the TV network VH1 named &quot;Lady Soul&quot; the 41st greatest album of all time. In 2003 and 2012, it ranked at number 85 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It rose to number 75 in a 2020 reboot of the list.

<text>Nicolas, Count Luckner (; 12 January 1722, Cham – 4 January 1794, Paris) was a German officer in French service who rose to become a Marshal of France.

Luckner grew up in Kötzting, in eastern Bavaria and received his early education from the Jesuits in Passau. Before entering the French service, Luckner spent time in the Bavarian, Dutch and Hanoverian armies. He fought as a commander of hussars during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) in the Hanoverian Army against the French. Luckner joined the French army in 1763 with the rank of lieutenant general. In 1784 he became a Danish count.

He supported the French Revolution, and the year 1791 saw Luckner become a Marshal of France. In 1791–92 Luckner served as the first commander of the Army of the Rhine. In April 1792, Rouget de Lisle dedicated to him the &quot;Chant de Guerre pour l&#x27;Armée du Rhin&quot; (War Song of the Army of the Rhine), which was to become better known as the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;.

As commander of the Army of the North in 1792 he captured the Flemish cities of Menen and Kortrijk, but then had to retreat towards Lille. After the flight of Lafayette (August 1792) he was made generalissimo with orders to build a Reserve Army near Châlons-sur-Marne. However, the National Convention was not satisfied with his progress and Choderlos de Laclos was ordered to support or replace him. Luckner, now over 70 years of age, then asked for dismissal (granted in January 1793) and went to Paris.

He was arrested by the Revolutionary Tribunal and sentenced to death. He died by the guillotine in Paris in 1794.

The carillon of the town hall in the Bavarian town of Cham rings the Marseillaise every day at 12.05 p.m. to commemorate the city&#x27;s most famous son, &quot;Nikolaus Graf Luckner&quot;.

He was the great-grandfather of Count Felix von Luckner (1881–1966), a German naval officer who commanded the famed merchant raider SMS &quot;Seeadler&quot; (1916–1917) during World War I .

Luckner owned Krummbek Manor in Holstein.

<text>Young, Gifted and Black is the eighteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Aretha Franklin, released in early 1972, by Atlantic Records. The album climbed to number 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B albums survey and peaked at Number 11 on the main album chart. It was quickly certified Gold by the RIAA. Its title was cut from &quot;To Be Young, Gifted and Black&quot;, recorded and released by Nina Simone in 1969.

Franklin won a 1972 Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

In 2003, the television network VH1 named it the 76th greatest album of all time. In 2020, it was ranked number 388 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Songs==
&quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot; contains original songs written and performed by Franklin, such as &quot;Day Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. It also features cover versions of songs by other artists, including &quot;To Be Young, Gifted and Black&quot; by Nina Simone, as well as &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Loving You Too Long&quot; by Otis Redding, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; by the Beatles, and &quot;Border Song (Holy Moses)&quot; by Elton John.

==Critical reception==
Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic wrote that &quot;&quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot; certainly ranks highly among [Franklin&#x27;s] studio efforts, with many arguing that it may be her greatest. [...] If you really want to go song by song, you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find any throwaways here -- this is quite honestly an album that merits play from beginning to end.&quot;

In 2003, the television network VH1 named &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot; the 76th greatest album of all time. In 2020, the album was ranked number 388 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In 2018, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Rob Sheffield praised Franklin&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; from the album as &quot;the greatest of all Beatle covers — the one that improves most on the original and defines everything the song is about&quot;.

<text>Soyuz 4 (, &quot;Union 4&quot;) was launched on 14 January 1969, carrying cosmonaut Vladimir Shatalov on his first flight. The aim of the mission was to dock with Soyuz 5, transfer two crew members from that spacecraft, and return to Earth. The previous Soyuz flight (Soyuz 3) was also a docking attempt but failed for various reasons.

The radio call sign of the crew was , while Soyuz 5 was . This referred to the trans-Siberian railway project called the Baikal-Amur Mainline, which was in development at the time.

== Preparations and planning ==
After the docking failure of Soyuz 2 and Soyuz 3 in October 1968, efforts were made to revise and improve docking procedures for Soyuz 4 and 5, including their being performed in daylight and over Soviet territory where communication with the ground was possible. The launch dates were tentatively scheduled for January 12-13, 1969. The Soyuz spacecraft for the mission were shipped to the Baikonur launch center during the fall months of 1968.

Mid-winter in Kazakhstan brought about frigid conditions despite the moderate latitude of 45N and personnel accommodations at the launch center were poorly heated and insulated. Temperatures dropped to as low as -25C (-13F) and cases of influenza and frostbite were not infrequent. Several military servicemen, including four officers, died of hypothermia during a hunting trip. However, the cosmodrome was busy this January. Aside from Soyuz 4-5, two Venera probes were launched to Venus and one Zenit reconnaissance satellite during the month, an unsuccessful Proton launch of a Zond spacecraft, and preparations for the first N-1 moon rocket were under way.

As soon as Venera 6 launched successfully from LC-1 on January 10, Soyuz 4&#x27;s booster was rolled out to the pad. On January 13, the cosmonaut was strapped inside Soyuz 4 and readied for launch. During the countdown, ground crews discovered that the booster had a non-functional roll rate gyro. The launch was called off and the cosmonauts got out and had to wait for the problem to be fixed--it had been only two years since the disastrous on-pad explosion of a Soyuz booster from a gyroscope issue and the memory of that was still fresh. The exact problem with the gyroscope was unclear and could not be reproduced during ground tests, but may have been due to ice formation on a pad umbilical inhibiting electrical contact. However, just to be safe it was decided to replace the entire gyroscope package. Investigation of the gyroscope issue concluded that it was probably a malfunction of the ground support equipment at the cosmodrome, most of which had been in use since the Vostok program began nine years ago and was badly worn and in need of replacement.

There was momentary concern that the launch escape system would not function properly due to the extreme cold as its solid rocket motor was certified to work down to -15C (5F). However, the escape tower had an insulating blanket placed over it and this would probably keep it warm enough. The motor was estimated to lose about 5% of its thrust from the low temperatures but this was still in an acceptable margin should a launch abort be necessary.

On January 14, Soyuz 4 launched at 10:30 AM local time and everything worked perfectly during ascent.

== Mission highlights ==
The Soyuz 4 and 5 spacecraft docked on 16 January 1969, the first time two crewed spacecraft had docked (Apollo 9 would do the same in March of the same year). The two craft possessed only a primitive probe (Soyuz 4) and drogue (Soyuz 5) docking assembly. A connecting tunnel for the docking mechanism had not yet been developed, which prevented a simple internal transfer between the craft. This required the two transferring cosmonauts to spacewalk from one vehicle to the other. Aboard Soyuz 5, Yevgeny Khrunov and Aleksei Yeliseyev immediately began preparing for their extravehicular activity (EVA). Boris Volynov, who would remain aboard Soyuz 5, filmed them donning their Yastreb space suits.

On their 35th revolution of Earth, the two cosmonauts exited the spacecraft for the second Soviet spacewalk. One of Khrunov&#x27;s lines became tangled and he accidentally closed the tumbler of his suit ventilator. This distracted Yeliseyev who did not set up the movie camera on the orbital module before exiting the spacecraft. As such, there is no film of the historic EVA, only a poor video transmission. One hour later, the two were greeted by Shatalov after the repressurisation of the Soyuz 4 orbital module, which also acted as an airlock. Soyuz 4 and 5 separated after 4 hours and 35 minutes docked together. Soyuz 4 re-entered the atmosphere and landed at at the southwest of Karaganda, in Kazakhstan, on 17 January 1969.

The mission proved it was possible to perform the activities that would be needed on a Soviet lunar landing. The Soviet plan called for a lone cosmonaut to land on the Moon, return to lunar orbit, then make a spacewalk back from the landing craft to the orbiting spacecraft after docking. This was because there was no internal tunnel between the two craft as found on the American Apollo CSM and LM.

The crew were to meet Leonid Brezhnev during a lavish ceremony at the Kremlin, but this was prevented by an attempted assassination of the Soviet leader. A man shot eight times at the motorcade but aimed at the car containing Georgy Beregovoy, Alexei Leonov, Andriyan Nikolayev, and Valentina Tereshkova. They were unharmed but Brezhnev&#x27;s car was forced to speed away past the waiting Soyuz 4/5 crews on the podium.

=== EVA details ===
The docking mission had EVA objectives similar to those planned for Apollo 9. Soyuz 4 launched first, and was the active vehicle in the docking with Soyuz 5. The news agency TASS stated that: &quot;there was a mutual mechanical coupling of the ships... and their electrical circuits were connected. Thus, the world&#x27;s first experimental cosmic station with four compartments for the
crew was assembled and began functioning&quot;. The mission rehearsed elements of the Soviet piloted lunar mission plan. Moscow TV carried the cosmonauts&#x27; EVA preparations live. Khrunov and Yeliseyev put on their Yastreb (&quot;hawk&quot;) suits in the Soyuz 5 orbital module with aid from commander Boris Volynov.

Yastreb suit design commenced in 1965, shortly after Alexei Leonov&#x27;s difficult EVA. Leonov served as a consultant for the design process, which was completed during 1966. Suit fabrication and testing occurred in 1967, but the fatal Soyuz 1 accident in April of that year and docking difficulties on the joint Soyuz 2-Soyuz 3 mission delayed its use in space until Soyuz 4-Soyuz 5.

To prevent the suit ballooning, the Yastreb suit featured a pulley-and-cable articulation system. Wide metal rings around the gray nylon canvas undersuit&#x27;s upper arms served as anchors for the upper body articulation system. The Yastreb had a regenerative life support system in a rectangular white metal box placed on the chest and abdomen to facilitate movement through the Soyuz&#x27;s hatchways.

Volynov checked out Khrunov and Yeliseyev&#x27;s life support and communications systems before returning to the descent module, sealing the hatch, and depressurizing the orbital module. Khrunov went out first, transferring to the Soyuz 4 orbital module while the docked spacecraft were over South America, out of radio contact with the Soviet Union. Yeliseyev transferred while the spacecraft were over the Soviet Union. They closed the Soyuz 4 orbital module hatch behind them, then Soyuz 4 Commander Vladimir Shatalov repressurised the orbital module and entered to help Khrunov and Yeliseyev get out of their suits. The spacewalkers delivered newspapers, letters, and telegrams printed after Shatalov lifted off to help prove that the transfer took place.

<doc id="197099" wikidata="Q1490701" url="?curid=197099" title="3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of...">
<text>3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of... is the debut album by American hip hop group Arrested Development, released on March 24, 1992. The album&#x27;s chart success ignited the popularization of Southern hip hop. Named after the length of time it took the group to get a record contract, &quot;3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of...&quot; starkly contrasted the gangsta rap that ruled the hip hop charts in 1992 (such as Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot;), focusing on spirituality, peace and love.

Upon release, the album received praise by critics. It is included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of...&quot; was released to widespread critical acclaim and was later voted as the best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&#x27;s&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; James Bernard gave the album an &quot;A+&quot; and praised it as a &quot;fresh-sounding debut&quot;, referring to the group as &quot;the anti-gangsta&quot; and &quot;perhaps rap&#x27;s most self-reflective act.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that the group &quot;displays unusual worldliness, wisdom and awareness on its debut, immediately establishing itself as a major new voice in hip-hop&quot;, noting Speech&#x27;s social themes and rejection of &quot;macho boasting and gangster posing&quot;. In a negative assessment, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; assigned the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating and wrote that the album was &quot;not horrible by any means&quot; but &quot;too often the beats shambled and the raps meandered&quot;, though he would later revise his rating to single out &quot;Tennessee&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;.

Retrospectively, Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that the rise of gangsta rap abruptly ended what seemed to be a &quot;shining new era in alternative rap&quot; heralded by &quot;3 Years&quot; and that the album, while not &quot;quite as revolutionary as it first seemed&quot;, was nonetheless &quot;a fine record that often crosses the line into excellence&quot;, further crediting it as &quot;a major influence on a new breed of alternative Southern hip-hop, including Goodie Mob, Outkast, and Nappy Roots&quot;.

&quot;The Wire&quot; named the album its record of the year, the first time the magazine had expanded its year-end critics&#x27; poll to include albums in non-jazz genres. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="197102" wikidata="Q1069886" url="?curid=197102" title="Great Learning">
<text>The Great Learning or Daxue was one of the &quot;Four Books&quot; in Confucianism attributed to one of Confucius&#x27; disciples, Zengzi. The &quot;Great Learning&quot; had come from a chapter in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; which formed one of the Five Classics. It consists of a short main text of the teachings of Confucius transcribed by Zengzi and then ten commentary chapters supposedly written by Zengzi. The ideals of the book were attributed to Confucius, but the text was written by Zengzi after his death.

The &quot;Four Books&quot; were selected by the neo-Confucian Zhu Xi during the Song dynasty as a foundational introduction to Confucianism. Examinations for the state civil service in China came to follow his lead.

==Writing and influence==
Confucius, who incorporated ideas from earlier philosophers, compiled or edited the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot; and the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, two of the Five Classics. Confucius&#x27; student Zengzi wrote the introduction and exposition of the &quot;Great Learning&quot;. Zengzi lived from 505 to 436 BCE. Confucius taught 100 pupils, 72 of whom mastered his teachings . It is still unclear how much his students wrote and edited.

The &quot;Great Learning&quot; developed from many authors adapting to the needs and beliefs of the community at the time. The Cheng brothers, Yi (1033–1107) and Hao (1032–1085) both utilized the &quot;Great Learning&#x27;s&quot; philosophies. Their ideas met with strong official opposition, but were reconstituted by Zhu Xi. Cheng&#x27;s idea of &quot;yi&quot; was that it was identical with nature, which he believed was essentially good. Cheng&#x27;s &quot;yi&quot; emphasized the necessity of acquiring knowledge.

During the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi rearranged the &quot;Great Learning&quot; and included it in the Four Books, along with the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius and the &quot;Mencius&quot;. Zhu Xi separated the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, which was originally a chapter in the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot;. Zhu Xi organized the book as Jing followed by ten expositions. Zhu Xi was a student of Li Tong. Zhu Xi developed the Chengs&#x27; Confucian ideas and drew from Chan Buddhism and Daoism. He adapted some ideas from these competing religions into his form of Confucianism.

Li Ao, a scholar, poet, and official, used and brought attention to the &quot;Great Learning&quot;. After the Song and Yuan Dynasties, The &quot;Great Learning&quot; became a required textbook in schools and a required reading for imperial examinations. During the Warring States Xunzi and Mengzi were influenced by the &quot;Great Learning&quot;. The &quot;Great Learning&quot; also greatly influenced countries like Japan and Korea.

Such critics such as Lu Xiangshan and Wang Yangming later disliked the &quot;Great Learning&quot; because of the stress on scholarship rather than action. Wang Yangming rejected Zhu Xi&#x27;s changes and returned the text to the original, from the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot;. During the Han dynasty the &quot;Great Learning&quot; rose to prominence, and the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot; had to be re-organized by Dai De and Dai Sheng. They divided the book into five sections. This included the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Evolution of Rites, the &quot;Yili&quot;, and the &quot;Etiquette and Rites&quot;.

Han Yu and Li Ao both used The &quot;Great Learning&quot;. Li Ao incorporated a lot of Buddhist and Taoist ideas into his work. Zi SiConfucius&#x27;s grandsonis said to have taught Mencius and written the Doctrine of the Mean. He may also have written the beginning of the &quot;Great Learning&quot;. Ma Rong edited the &quot;Great Learning&quot; in the Han dynasty, giving his views of the general meaning.

==Principal teachings==

*Achieving a state of &quot;rest in the highest excellence&quot; and refining one&#x27;s moral self to &quot;illustrious virtue&quot; that will be an example for all people of the realm.
*The &quot;point of rest being known&quot;, the &quot;goal of action can be determined&quot;, and &quot;deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end.&quot; 大學之道，在明明德，在親民，在止於至善。知止而后有定，定而后能靜，靜而后能安，安而后能慮，慮而后能得。物有本末，事有終始，知所先後，則近道矣。 What the Great Learning teaches, is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest excellence. The point where to rest being known, the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. In that repose there may be careful deliberation, and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end. Things have their root and their branches. Affairs have their end and their beginning. To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.
*Ample rest and reflection such that one achieves peace of mind. When one is calm and reflected, the Way will be revealed to them.
*Setting priorities and knowing what is important is essential in one&#x27;s quest for moral refinement, for it allows one to focus on that which is of the greatest importance and that which is in line with the Way as outlined in Confucian teachings.
*One must bring his affairs and relationships into order and harmony. If one hopes to attain order in the state, he must first bring his own family and personal life into order through self-cultivation and the expansion of one&#x27;s knowledge and the &quot;investigation of things.&quot;
*Each and every man is capable of learning and self-cultivation regardless of social, economic or political status. This, in turn, means that success in learning is the result of the effort of the individual as opposed to an inability to learn.
*One must treat education as an intricate and interrelated system where one must strive for balance. No one aspect of learning is isolated from the other and failure to cultivate a single aspect of one&#x27;s learning will lead to the failure of learning as a whole.

==Meaning of &quot;Investigation of Things&quot;==
The text sets up a number of controversies that have underlain Chinese philosophy and political thinking. For example, one major controversy has been to define exactly the investigation of things. What things are to be investigated and how has been one of the crucial issues of Chinese philosophy.

One of the first steps to understanding The &quot;Great Learning&quot; is to understand how to &quot;investigate things&quot;. This did not consist of scientific inquiry and experimentation, but introspection, building on what is already &quot;known&quot; of &quot;principle&quot;. True introspection was supposed to allow the mind to become all knowing with regards to morality, relationships, civic duty and nature.

==The &quot;Great Learning&quot; and education in China==
The &quot;Great Learning&quot; as we know it today is the result of multiple revisions and commentaries by a number of Confucian and Neo-Confucian scholars. The &quot;Great Learning&quot;, along with the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; had their beginnings as chapters within the &quot;Book of Rites&quot;. Both were removed from the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; and designated as separate, and equally significant, works by Zhu Xi. In the winter of 1190 CE Zhu Xi published the Four Masters, a collection of the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, the &quot;Mencius&quot; and the &quot;Analects&quot;. These four texts soon became the initial basis of study in the Chinese imperial examination system. Zhu Xi was prompted to refine the &quot;Great Learning&quot; and incorporate it into the curriculum as he felt that the previously utilized Classics were lengthy and too difficult to comprehend by the common individual to be used as an educational foundation for Confucian thought. Utilizing the much shorter and more comprehensible Four Books would allow Zhu to reach a much greater audience. To aid in comprehension of the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, he spent much of his life studying the book and published a series of commentaries explaining the principal teachings of the text. The &quot;Daxue&quot; itself gets its name from , referring to the education of adults. Unlike many scholars before him, Zhu Xi presents the &quot;Great Learning&quot; as the way of self cultivation and governance that is to be studied by all people, not only those in, or seeking, political office.
==Impact on education in China==
Although the Imperial Examination System is no longer used as a means of determining one&#x27;s place in the social hierarchy, education and the teachings of the &quot;Great Learning&quot; remain an integral part of modern educational and political culture in China. In fact, a number of scholars believe that all education in mainland China is based on Confucianism to some degree although many individuals, students and teachers alike, are unaware of the Confucian influence on their education. &quot;The Great Learning&quot; was written and later published as its own book, to serve as an introduction and foundational guide for the further study of Confucian texts. &quot;The Great Learning&quot; provides a step-by-step illustration of how all aspects of society, ranging from the refinement of the self to the order within one&#x27;s household or state is ultimately dependent upon the expansion of one&#x27;s knowledge.

===Effects on education in Modern China===
* A Valued Education: China is characterized by a great appreciation for education as it is still viewed as a means of securing a rewarding career, thus elevating an individual in terms of social status. The modern schooling system relates directly to the teachings of the &quot;Great Learning&quot; as educational institutions represent the primary sites for the expansion of knowledge and the investigation of &quot;things.&quot; It is quite common in China for great sums of money to be spent to secure the best possible education. Due to the high value of a quality education, illiteracy and drop-out rates throughout China are very low.
* Memorization: Due to the service examination system which involved the memorization and recitation of Confucian Texts, including &quot;The Great Learning&quot;, memorization remains a key element in Chinese learning. Throughout much of China, it is still held that one should memorize as much knowledge as they possibly can, as one is incapable of the creation of intelligent thought without first obtaining enough basic knowledge. The focus on exams and the recitation of knowledge is, however, often attributed to &quot;surface learning,&quot; but one should note that memorization is not used in isolation, but represents only one aspect of a student&#x27;s quest for knowledge and self-cultivation. This focus on memorization can be seen in the consistency in which Chinese students excel in mathematics and sciences.
* Working Collaboratively: Due to the Confucian values of harmony, relationship and moral cultivation as presented in the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, students in China were traditionally taught the value of collaborative learning. To this day, group learning remains the most popular learning method throughout the bulk of China.
* Hard Work: &quot;The Great Learning&quot; states that all people are to expand their knowledge and cultivate themselves. This, in turn, is often interpreted to mean that all people are capable of learning, and that failure is not a result of a lack of ability, but a lack of effort. As a result of this philosophy, Chinese students are known worldwide as being very hardworking, putting a great deal of effort into everything they do.
* A Respectful Learning Atmosphere: Due largely to the high value of a quality education and the Confucian teaching of respect for one&#x27;s elders, educators in Chinese culture are treated with the utmost respect. In fact, teachers are customarily granted the same level of respect given to a parent. As a result of this level of respect for educators and the institution as a whole, students are not quick to interrupt or otherwise challenge the authority of those delivering the knowledge required for a successful future.

==Impact on Chinese politics==
&quot;The Great Learning&quot; played a major role in Chinese politics as it comprised one of the texts incorporated into the Imperial service examination system. Students would be tested on their knowledge of the Five Classics and Four Books as a qualification for an occupation in political office. If a student possessed adequate knowledge of the texts, they would be awarded a prestigious place in government. These exams allow anyone of sufficient knowledge and skill to obtain a place in office, as exams were based solely on one&#x27;s ability. One&#x27;s social or financial status did not play a role in the exam system. The text of &quot;The Great Learning&quot; provides an educational basis for those aspiring to obtain a leadership role. In addition to self-cultivation and the expansion of one&#x27;s knowledge, the &quot;Great Learning&quot; goes into significant step-by-step detail with respect to the qualities of a proper ruler. The text then goes on to describe the projected quality and stability of the state if its ruler follows the guidelines described therein. One such passage states that a person should &quot;cultivate himself, then regulate the family, then govern the state, and finally lead the world into peace&quot; There are two common interpretations of this passage. One common interpretation of this passage is that before one can hope to successfully lead the people, he/she must first cultivate himself (herself) by bringing order to. One may also interpret this passage to be stating that once one has reached a sufficient level of cultivation, he/she should seek a position in office with which to lead the people of the state in accordance with the values and practices outlined in the Great Learning and other such Confucian and Neo-Confucian texts.

A term used in the text, &quot;qin-min&quot; (親民) which James Legge, following Zhu Xi, amended to &quot;xin-min&quot; (新民) and translated &quot;renovating the people&quot; instead of &quot;loving the people&quot;, became the name of the People First Party (Republic of China), one of the minor parties in Taiwan.

There are several works that were written to give commentaries on Great Learning, such as Zhen Dexiu&#x27;s &quot;Expanded Meaning of the Great Learning&quot; (&quot;Daxue Yanyi&quot;) and Qiu Jun&#x27;s &quot;Complement to the Expanded Meaning of the Great Learning&quot; (&quot;Daxue Yanyibu&quot;).

==Textual significance==

&quot;The Great Learning&quot; is significant because it expresses many themes of Chinese philosophy and political thinking, and has therefore been extremely influential both in classical and modern Chinese thought. The &quot;Great Learning&quot; represented a key aspect of the Chinese curriculum and can be found in virtually all aspects of Chinese culture. &quot;The Great Learning&quot; within the Chinese curriculum acted as a &quot;springboard&quot; for further learning, &quot;self cultivation and investigation of things.&quot; Through self-cultivation one can bring order and harmony to one&#x27;s mind, personal life, family, state and the world as a whole. By defining the path of learning (Dao) in governmental and social terms, the &quot;Great Learning&quot; links the spiritual realm with daily life, thus creating a vision of the Way (Dao) that is radically different from that of non-action as presented by Daoism. &quot;The Great Learning&quot;, on the other hand, requires action on the part of the individual towards the ultimate goal of self-cultivation through the &quot;expansion of knowledge and the investigation of things.&quot; &quot;The Great Learning&quot; presents Confucianism as being this-worldly rather than other-worldly. As opposed to basing its authority on an external deity, the &quot;Great Learning&quot; bases its authority on the practices of ancient kings.

<doc id="197103" wikidata="Q1615467" url="?curid=197103" title="List of counts and dukes of Montpensier">
<text>The French lordship of Montpensier (named after the village of Montpensier, département of Puy-de-Dôme), located in historical Auvergne, became a countship in the 14th century. 

It changed hands from the House of Thiern, to the House of Beaujeau, to the House of Drieux, to the House of Beaujeau again, and finally to the House of Ventadour, before it was sold in 1384 by Bernard and Robert de Ventadour to John, Duke of Berry, whose sons Charles and John were the first two to hold the title of &quot;Count of Montpensier&quot;. 

After their deaths without issue, their younger sister Marie brought the countship to her third husband, John I, Duke of Bourbon (1381–1434). The countship was subsequently held by Louis de Bourbon, the younger son of John and Marie, and by his descendants up to Charles de Bourbon-Montpensier, the famous constable, who became duke of Bourbon by his marriage with his cousin, Suzanne de Bourbon, in 1505.

In 1384–1434 and 1505–27, Montpensier followed the succession in Duchy of Auvergne, and from 1434 onwards that of Dauphinate of Auvergne.

Confiscated by King Francis I, the countship was restored in 1538 to Louise de Bourbon, sister of the Constable of France, and widow of the prince de La Roche-sur-Yon, and to her son Louis, and was erected into a duchy in the peerage of France (&quot;duché-pairie&quot;) in 1539. Marie, daughter and heiress of Henry, Duke of Montpensier, brought the duchy to her husband Gaston, Duke of Orléans, brother of Louis XIII, whom she married in 1626, and their daughter and heiress, known as &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot; was duchess of Montpensier. 

When Mademoiselle Anne died childless, her heir (but an ancestress&#x27; Huguenot marriage after being a nun may have been regarded invalid) was Elisabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine, the then wife of Duke of Orléans. The title subsequently remained in the Orléans family, and was borne in particular by Antoine Philippe (1775–1807), son of Philippe Egalité, and by Antoine Marie Philippe Louis (1824–1890), son of King Louis-Philippe and father-in-law of King Alphonso XII of Spain. Mademoiselle de Montpensier was a title conferred upon some women of the royal family, namely during the years previous to the French Revolution.

<doc id="197105" wikidata="Q2343395" url="?curid=197105" title="The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)">
<text>The Crazy World of Arthur Brown is the debut studio album by the English rock band the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Released in the United Kingdom in June 1968 by Track Records and in the United States in September 1968 through Atlantic, the album was an international success, propelled by the transatlantic hit single &quot;Fire&quot;. It was the only album released during the Crazy World&#x27;s original incarnation.

A psychedelic soul album, its style is defined by frontman Arthur Brown&#x27;s wide-ranging theatrical vocals and mystical lyrics, with the first side of the original LP comprising a conceptual song cycle known as &quot;the Fire Suite&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound and Brown&#x27;s stage act influenced subsequent musicians such as David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Alice Cooper, Marilyn Manson and George Clinton.

==Recording==
The Crazy World of Arthur Brown had recorded a single called &quot;Devil&#x27;s Grip&quot;, which had failed to chart. However, Atlantic Records was interested in recording an album of the band&#x27;s music, and the band went to work on &quot;The Fire Suite&quot;, a concept album built around their song &quot;Fire&quot;, which was popular in their live act. The album was produced by the Who&#x27;s manager Kit Lambert for his own label, Track Records, with associate production by Pete Townshend. The band line-up consisted of Arthur Brown (vocals), Vincent Crane (organ, piano and vibes), and Drachen Theaker (drums). Bass guitar, where used, was provided by Nick Greenwood; session drummer John Marshall replaced Theaker on two selections. The album was recorded on four-track reels with instrumentation consisting of bass, drums, keyboard, and Brown&#x27;s vocals. The drumming was recorded on the same tape as the keyboards. On Ronnie Wood&#x27;s radio show on 14 November 2011, both Wood and Alice Cooper claim that Wood played bass guitar on the single &quot;Fire&quot;, but Polly Marshall&#x27;s biography of Arthur Brown states that &quot;[Wood] must have confused it with the BBC session [on 8 April 1968].&quot; There is no bass guitar on &quot;Fire&quot;, only bass pedals.

After recording the album, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown embarked on their first American tour, supporting the Doors, Frank Zappa and MC5. After Lambert delivered the album to Atlantic, the label told Lambert that they enjoyed the album but thought that Theaker couldn&#x27;t keep time in his drumming, and wanted the drum track re-recorded, an impossibility with the drums and keyboards having been recorded on the same reel. Lambert suggested to Brown that horns and strings be overdubbed to mask the perceived deficiencies. Brown agreed, and Crane wrote the brass arrangements. The overdub sessions took two weeks to record. Brown later said that they were mixing the album for &quot;probably fourteen hours a day&quot;. After the remix was done, Lambert&#x27;s business partner, Chris Stamp, played the acetate for the band during one stop that occurred on their American tour. Brown alleged that approximately four minutes into the acetate, Theaker &quot;leapt across the room, took it off the turntable, smashed it on the wall&quot;, claiming that his drumming had been &quot;buried&quot; in the mix. Brown defended the overdubs, saying that they added to the album&#x27;s overall presentation, replacing visuals and costume changes he would have employed in live performance to achieve dramatic effect.

==Composition==
&quot;The Crazy World of Arthur Brown&quot; has a psychedelic soul sound that encompasses British rhythm and blues, psychedelia and pop. Mike Knoop, writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, said that Brown&#x27;s singing style recalls &quot;Eric Burdon, Bob Calvert, Ian Gillan, Tim Curry, Brian Connolly, and a smidgen of King Diamond all coming out of one person.&quot; Brian Carr, another &quot;Classic Rock&quot; writer, compared the album&#x27;s music to that of Alice Cooper and Frank Zappa. Gary Claydon, also for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, opined that the album&#x27;s music was not rock and roll, due to the presence of organ playing instead of guitars.

The album was originally conceived by Brown as &quot;The Fire Suite&quot;, a rock opera which would have focused on the horrors of Hell. Lambert dissauded him against the uncommercial original concept. As a compromise, side A of the vinyl record featured a suite of songs written as part of the album&#x27;s original concept, while side B featured unrelated songs, including covers of Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27; &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; and James Brown&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Money&quot;, which had been a part of the band&#x27;s stage act. The two covers have been called &quot;fine examples of British R&amp;B&quot;. The original song &quot;Rest Cure&quot; has been described as &quot;basic pop&quot;, while &quot;Spontaneous Apple Creation&quot; was described as the album&#x27;s most psychedelic recording, due to its high amount of sound effects. &quot;Fire&quot; has been cited as an example of psychedelic rock.

==Release and reception==

The album was released in June 1968 on Track in the UK, and by Atlantic in the United States that September. The album peaked at No. 7 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums chart, No. 2 on the UK charts, and No. 6 in Canada. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Fire,&quot; was a global success, reaching No. 1 in the UK in August 1968, No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US in October 1968, No. 1 in Canada also in October, and No. 19 in Australia again in October. &quot;Fire&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It was sampled by the band Marilyn Manson, who were influenced by Arthur Brown, on their 1995 single &quot;Lunchbox&quot;. Other artists influenced by the album&#x27;s sound and Brown&#x27;s stage performance included David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Alice Cooper and George Clinton. Due to the album&#x27;s international success, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown received a £650,000 advance to record a follow-up album. However, the band subsequently broke up after the recording, and their second album, &quot;Strangelands&quot;, was not released until 1988, almost 20 years after it had been recorded.

Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic, called the album &quot;an exhilaratingly reckless slice of psychedelia&quot; in a retrospective review. Of the less favorable retrospective reviews, the staff of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; gave the album a score of 5.65 out of 10 (rounded to 2.5/5), based on 99 votes from staff writers, and &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the album 1 star, deeming it to be &quot;English eccentricity at its most daft.&quot;

<doc id="197107" wikidata="Q1415363" url="?curid=197107" title="1977 (Ash album)">
<text>1977 is the debut studio album by Northern Irish rock band Ash. It was released on 6 May 1996 by Home Grown and Infectious Records, with whom the band had signed following the release of several demo tapes. Ash released the mini-album &quot;Trailer&quot; in 1994, and followed it with three singles &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Girl from Mars&quot;, and &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot;, all of which would reappear on &quot;1977&quot;. Ash recorded their debut album with producer Owen Morris at Rockfield Studios in Wales in early 1996. Described as a Britpop, power pop and garage rock album, &quot;1977&quot; drew comparisons to the Buzzcocks, Dinosaur Jr., and Sonic Youth.

Preceded by the album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in April 1996, the band embarked on tours of the United Kingdom and Europe. &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; was released as the fifth single in June 1996, followed by tours of the United States, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Ash ended the year with another US tour, as well as a US support slot for Weezer. They toured Europe and the UK, before their appearance at Glastonbury Festival.

&quot;1977&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the album&#x27;s &quot;catchy&quot; nature. The album peaked at number one in the UK, as well as reaching the top 40 in Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland. &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Girl from Mars&quot;, &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; all charted on the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;Goldfinger&quot; reaching the highest position at number five. &quot;1977&quot; appeared on several UK publications&#x27; best-of-the-year album lists, by the likes of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, among others. The album would later be certified platinum in the UK.

==Background==
In December 1989, schoolfriends Tim Wheeler and Mark Hamilton received instruments for Christmas, and decided to form a metal act they called Vietnam. The rest of the line-up consisted of vocalist Gareth Hutchinson, guitarist Malcolm King, and drummer Andy McLean, who would all leave by early 1992 citing a lack of interest in the band. After seeing a show by a local act, Lazer Gun Nun, Wheeler and Hamilton decided to move their sound away from metal and into Nirvana-leaning territory. Around this time, Wheeler was discovering the likes of ABBA and Paul McCartney and Wings. Vietnam ultimately disbanded, and Wheeler and Hamilton decided to form a punk band. Wheeler handled vocals and guitar, Hamilton the bass. They spent two weeks amassing original material in Wheeler&#x27;s bedroom. Drummer Rick McMurray joined the pair in June 1992; Wheeler had approached him during a school play, and invited him to his house for a jam session.

With the line-up finalised, they christened themselves Ash after spotting the word in a dictionary. Over the course of a year, the band recorded four demos tapes: &quot;Solar Happy&quot; in June 1992, &quot;Shed&quot; in September, &quot;Home Demo&quot; in November, and &quot;Garage Girl&quot; in February 1993. A friend of the band had sent one of the demos to Paddy Davis of the public relations company, Bad Moon. He played it for four months, before passing it to Steve Tavener, who had plans to start a record label. Tavener and Davis subsequently went to Belfast to watch the band perform. Ash released their debut single, &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot;, through Tavener&#x27;s La La Land Records in February 1994, by which point he had become their manager.

In April 1994, the band travelled to London to promote it. Several major labels approached them, before they signed with Infectious Records with an advance of £12,000 and a 50–50 share of the profits with the label. Ash set up the imprint Home Grown as part of Infectious with which they would put out their future releases. As Hamilton and Wheeler were 17 years old, their parents had to sign the contract on their behalf, as well as permission from their school headmaster Jack Ferris. Two more singles, &quot;Petrol&quot; and &quot;Uncle Pat&quot;, preceded the release of the band&#x27;s mini-album &quot;Trailer&quot; in October 1994. During this period, two-thirds of the band were focusing on their A-Levels, touring with Babes in Toyland and Elastica during their half-term holidays. In February 1995, Wheeler and McMurray flew to the United States to meet with potential labels, including Reprise and Interscope Records. They signed to the former, who was experiencing success with the stylistically similar Green Day.

==Recording and production==
In preparation for their debut album, the band met with a few producers, such as Phil Vinall, who had produced the Auteurs, while Wheeler wanted Marc Waterman to produce it, having known him for his work on &quot;Nowhere&quot; (1990) by Ride. Producer Owen Morris was working on &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; (1995) with the Verve at the end of 1994; Ash&#x27;s manager and Infectious founder Korda Marshall suggested they record a few songs with him. Wheeler said they wanted a &quot;cool, young&quot; producer and selected him upon learning that Morris was influenced by acts they liked, such as David Bowie, T. Rex and Thin Lizzy. The band opted to record one song with him to see how their working relationship would unfold. They recorded &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and an unfinished version of &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; over Christmas 1994 at Loco Studios in Usk Valley, Wales. &quot;Girl from Mars&quot; was recorded in Easter 1995 at Rockfield Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales.

Ash had to record some B-sides with Phil Thornalley in London, but as they were not working effectively, Thornalley walked out and Morris, who happened to be in the city, was drafted in; they then finished working on &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot;. The band worked on pre-production with Morris in December 1995, with him visiting the band at their rehearsal space, running through all of the song ideas they had. After playing him everything they thought was worthwhile, including portions of &quot;Lose Control&quot; and &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, he inquired if they had anything else, they showed him &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Wheeler considered it a B-side, until Morris exclaimed, &quot;you idiot, that&#x27;s a single!&quot;. The band and Morris began recording their debut album on New Year&#x27;s Day 1996, commencing with &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. The rest of the material that would appear on the album was recorded at Rockfield Studios at a cost of £800 per day, with Morris and the band co-producing the album.

Though the process was planned to take only six weeks, it ended up lasting three months. Because they had toured incessantly since leaving school, the band did not have enough time to accumulate material for an album. Wheeler wrote nearly half of what would end up on the finished album in the studio. As Rockfield was a residential studio, according to Wheeler, the members became &quot;very nocturnal and very crazy&quot;. He attributed this to Morris &quot;gradually introducing us to drugs, so we were off our heads a lot of the time&quot;. Nick Brine, Sorrel Merchant and Neil Kiely acted as studio assistants. Morris later mixed the recordings at Orinoco in London, except for &quot;Girl from Mars&quot; (Thornalley) and &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; (Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent). Thornalley mixed &quot;Girl on Mars&quot; as the band&#x27;s label and manager felt the track was incomplete, much to the annoyance of Morris.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Music and themes===
Musically, the sound of &quot;1977&quot; has been described as Britpop, power pop, garage rock, pop-punk, and pop rock, with elements of glam rock and grunge, drawing comparisons to the work of Buzzcocks and Sonic Youth, as well as the albums &quot;Bug&quot; (1988) by Dinosaur Jr., and &quot;Bandwagonesque&quot; (1991) by Teenage Fanclub. In a 2020 interview, Wheeler thought that the Britpop tag &quot;felt a bit weird&quot;, as he explained that they were influenced more by American music than British music. He attributed the range of styles to the band&#x27;s American label, Reprise Records, having sent him several CDs from their back catalogue. They had spent two months coming up with random titles: &quot;Ash – The Album&quot;, &quot;Child Abuse&quot;, &quot;A Tribute to Apache Indian&quot;, &quot;Owen&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Tim, Mark and the Other&quot; and &quot;Corporate Record Company Bullshit Wank&quot;. When Morris eventually asked what it was going to be called, the band replied &quot;1977&quot;.

&quot;1977&quot; refers to the release year of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and the year Wheeler and Hamilton were born. Though some commenters said it alluded to the year punk rock and Sex Pistols achieved mainstream popularity, author Charlie Porter in his biography on the band &quot;Ash: 77–97&quot; (1997) dismissed this. He said the genre&#x27;s &quot;vigour was extinguished by bitterness and internal cat-fights&quot;, de-evolving into a brand, &quot;[s]o punk is not the reason this CD [...] is called 1977&quot;. He considered the name as &quot;rather a blank name, a title that sounds sassy, but which means nothing. It leaves the music to be judge on its own merit&quot;.

Wheeler is credited with writing all of the album&#x27;s tracks, except for &quot;Lose Control&quot; (which he co-wrote with Hamilton), &quot;Innocent Smile&quot; (written by Hamilton) and &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; (co-written with McMurray). Wheeler estimated that Hamilton had written half of &quot;Lose Control&quot;, while McMurray had helped him with the lyrics to &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot;. When working on material, Wheeler wrote the music first, taking inspiration from other peoples&#x27; songs he heard.

Nick Ingman, Morris and Wheeler came up with string arrangements, which were done with a 30-piece orchestra; Ingman had worked on &quot;History&quot; (1995) from &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; (1991) by Massive Attack. Wheeler referred to some of his lyrics as &quot;a little too sickly sweet&quot;, explaining that he took inspiration from the work of the Beach Boys and Phil Spector-produced tracks. The album features a sample of a TIE fighter from &quot;Star Wars&quot;; Wheeler was unsure if the band got permission for it, but theorised the label was fine with it as they were owned by 20th Century Fox which had made &quot;Star Wars&quot;. A science fiction theme can be heard throughout the album, which Wheeler attributed to his sister having a David Bowie poster with the phrase &quot;Life on Mars&quot; written across it, coupled with &quot;Trompe le Monde&quot; (1991) by Pixies.

===Songs===
The opening track &quot;Lose Control&quot; is a punk rock song that utilises a quiet-and-loud dynamic, recalling the work of Therapy? with its guitar solo. Wheeler&#x27;s guitar riff consists of tremolo-enhanced octave picking in an ascending order, while the solo is affected by a wah-wah pedal and includes multiple bends. The song&#x27;s protagonist pleads for a girl to cheat on her boyfriend. &quot;Goldfinger&quot; channels the sound of Teenage Fanclub. When they began writing it, the band borrowed an instrumental break section from what they believed was &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964) sung by Shirley Bassey, but turned out to be a song by John Barrie. Subsequent sections of the song were written around the world while touring to support &quot;Trailer&quot;. Wheeler said they kept the name &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as &quot;it has a lot of mystery&quot;, while the lyrics detail a man wanting to buy drugs.

The opening ten bars of &quot;Girl from Mars&quot; are played acoustically, before erupting into a wall of guitars, reminiscent of Dinosaur Jr. member J Mascis. A family holiday in France, where Wheeler smoked and drank with some people on a beach, influenced the track&#x27;s chorus section. The song was written around the time of &quot;Trailer&quot; but not included on it as their manager and label thought it would not be good for the band to have a hit single while still attending school. &quot;I&#x27;d Give You Anything&quot; is a harder, Stooges-esque track, which cribs from &quot;N.I.B.&quot; (1970) by Black Sabbath. Author Dave Thompson wrote in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000) that this was a throwback to Hamilton and Wheeler&#x27;s time as Vietnam. It was the last track Wheeler had written while living at his parents&#x27; home. Initially uptempo, Morris suggested the band slow it down. Porter said the confident vocals and breezy guitarwork earned it a comparison to the sound of Oasis.

Ash made two versions of &quot;Gone the Dream&quot;: The final version ended up as an indie rock song that featured a string section and reminiscent of the Boo Radleys, while the other version was a Beatles-esque track made at Morris&#x27; insistence. &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is a tribute to Jackie Chan in the vein of the Ramones. Wheeler wrote it at home in three minutes before leaving to record with Morris in late 1994. Wheeler claimed that he binge-listened to the Ramones over the Christmas period, while discovering the words &quot;kung fu&quot;, &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, and &quot;fu manchu&quot;, and watching a series of movies featuring Chan.

&quot;Oh Yeah&quot; is a nostalgic track about teenage romance, and features extra vocals by Lisa Moorish. Wheeler wrote it when he was 18 about his first romance at 15, when he experienced those emotions for the first time. &quot;Let It Flow&quot; was written in the studio, and originally featured an intro before the chorus section, which was later dropped. The song&#x27;s original lyrics were scrapped, and re-written by Wheeler while the rest of the band were at a pub. Wheeler attributed its sound to the work of Teenage Fanclub and the Lemonheads. The lyrics describe how love can affect a person to the point they are unable to see their partner&#x27;s influence over them.

Kayley Kravitz of &quot;Vanyaland&quot; said &quot;Innocent Smile&quot; was the &quot;bratty younger sibling&quot; of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as &quot;an atmospheric, lo-fi epic (by Ash standards) about criminal teenage kicks&quot;. it is indebted to &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; (1988)-era Sonic Youth with its slow build-up. &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; is a mix of punk rock and doo-wop. Wheeler said he was &quot;notoriously bad at finishing lyrics&quot;, which prompted Morris to tell him and McMurray to leave the studio to finish writing it. It discusses sex and sees Wheeler pondering as to when he will see his girlfriend again, despite seeing her a day prior. The title is an alludes to the jet girl characters from the &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; TV series, while the chorus references astronaut Yuri Gagarin and the Apollo space missions. Wheeler considered it a pseudo-sequel to &quot;Girl from Mars&quot;. At the end of the recording, McMurray can be heard yelling &quot;Whooo! Yeah, we&#x27;ve got it!&quot;, while he was on his first ecstasy trip.

&quot;Lost in You&quot; was by influenced by the Beach Boys, and written at the end of the recording process. Wheeler explained the band was stressed from pushing themselves, which he said came across in the song&#x27;s performance. He wrote &quot;Darkside Lightside&quot; from the perspective of someone who had sex with another person&#x27;s girlfriend; it opened with Iron Maiden-like riffs, and ended with guitar work reminiscent of Pink Floyd. minutes after &quot;Darkside Lightside&quot; ends the hidden track &quot;Sick Party&quot; plays, consisting of Hamilton and guitar tech Leif Bodnarchuk vomiting. It was planned initially to be part of the outtake &quot;The Scream&quot;, which according to Wheeler was &quot;built up [from] 48 tracks that started out like a murmur up to full on screaming&quot;. When it came time to mix the song, they were &quot;too scared&quot;. Because the band felt &quot;Sick Party&quot; &quot;turned out to be so funny&quot;, it became a standalone track.

==Release==
&quot;Kung Fu&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;1977&quot; on 20 March 1995, with &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot; and &quot;Luther Ingo&#x27;s Star Cruiser&quot; as the B-sides. While Wheeler was studying the last six months of his A-Levels, he would be interrupted by having to do multiple interviews. &quot;Girl from Mars&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on 31 July 1995, with &quot;Astral Conversations with Toulouse Lautrec&quot; and a cover of &quot;Cantina Band&quot; by John Williams as the B-sides. The music video for &quot;Girl from Mars&quot;, which was directed Peter Christopherson of Throbbing Gristle, was shot on the beach at Camber Sands following the band&#x27;s debut tour in mainland Europe. The band promoted the song with an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Around this, the band had finished school, which then allowed them to tour more and do promotional events, gigging until the end of the year. &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; followed as the third single on 9 October 1995, with &quot;5 a.m. Eternal&quot; and a cover of &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; (1971) by John Lennon as the B-sides. The following month, the band went on a short US tour with China Drum. Coinciding with this, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; was released as a single to modern rock radio stations in the US.

&quot;Goldfinger&quot; was released as the fourth single from &quot;1977&quot; on 15 April 1996, with &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;, &quot;Sneaker&quot;, and a cover of the Smokey Robinson track &quot;Get Ready&quot; as the B-sides. &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was sent to US modern rock radio stations the following month. Ash went on a United Kingdom tour with 60ft Dolls, Bis, and Jocasta. Infectious and Home Grown released &quot;1977&quot; in the UK on 6 May, while the US release by Reprise appeared on 11 June 1996. The first 50,000 copies of the UK version included &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Know&quot; as hidden tracks. Morris, who had taken an interest in various bands&#x27; artwork, suggested Ash collaborate with Brian Cannon of design company Microdot. Ed van der Elsken took the photograph that would appear on the front cover of &quot;1977&quot;; Cannon said clearing the rights for the image nearly delayed the album&#x27;s release as he had died, and the band were unable to contact his widow. The cassette edition was sold by the label at 1977 prices, £4.99.

Following the album&#x27;s release, Ash embarked on a European tour, and appeared on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;. &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth single on 24 June 1996, with &quot;T. Rex&quot;, &quot;Everywhere Is All Around&quot;, and the ABBA cover &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; as the B-sides. The &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; music video sees Hamilton making out with an actress, interspersed with footage of the band performing at a carnival. In July and August 1996, the band toured the US with Muzzle, and performed at the Reading Festival in the UK. Around this time, their label discussed releasing &quot;Lost in You&quot; as a single; however, the band felt they had released enough tracks from it by this point. In September and October 1996, Ash toured Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, before returning to the US with Stabbing Westward, I Mother Earth and Drill in October and November.

During the US leg of the tour, Ash met with the head programmer at MTV, to discuss getting coverage on the channel, however, Wheeler turned up late and drunk. The following day, the band had an interview on the channel; Wheeler arrived late again and vomited during it. The band&#x27;s label was angry with them, and Wheeler later theorised that these incidents cost the band any major success in the US. One show of this leg, namely in Boulder, Colorado, had low ticket sales; as an incentive, Ash opted to perform &quot;1977&quot; in its entirety. They then supported Weezer on their US headlining tour through to December, before returning to Ireland for a one-off show to close the year.

Ash released their first live album, &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;, in February 1997. Recorded in Australia, it was sold in the UK and mainland Europe. Some European copies of &quot;1977&quot; were then packaged with &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; as a second disc in collaboration between Home Grown, Infectious, Death Star, and Facedown Records. In the same month, the band embarked on a European tour with 60 ft Dolls and Seesaw, leading up to five consecutive shows at the London Astoria. Fan club members attending the Astoria shows were given a free 7&quot; vinyl, which consisted of &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Haircut&quot;, and a live version of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. In June 1997, the band played a handful of UK shows with Silver Sun, before appearing at Glastonbury Festival.

===Reissues and related releases===
&quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Girl from Mars&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; and &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s three compilation albums, &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot; (2003), &quot;The Best of Ash&quot; (2011), and &quot;Teenage Wildlife: 25 Years of Ash&quot; (2020), and released on 7&quot; vinyl as part of &quot;94–&#x27;04 The 7&quot; Singles Box Set&quot; (2014). In 2008, a three-disc deluxe edition of &quot;1977&quot; was released, featuring &quot;Trailer&quot;, &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;, B-sides, unreleased demos and live recordings. BMG bought the band&#x27;s back catalogue and reissued the album on CD in 2018 and vinyl in 2022; for the latter, Wheeler was sent various mixes and had to point out the correct versions to the label. The band have played the album in its entirety on several tours throughout 2008, 2013 and 2016, as well as a one-off livestream in 2021. Recordings from the Astoria shows were later compiled, and released as the live album &quot;Live on Mars – London Astoria 1997&quot; (2016).

==Critical reception==

&quot;1977&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that, by &quot;sticking to the rigid rules of American punk-pop&quot;, Ash opted for a &quot;cinematic approach to their songs&quot;, resulting in &quot;1977&quot; being a &quot;melting pot of pop styles&quot;. He added their use of &quot;loud guitars&quot; offers a &quot;distinctive, melodic, and energetic sound that&#x27;s equal parts heavy grunge and light pop&quot;. &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; Joachim Hiller wrote that if the listener was &quot;looking for the missing link between Oasis and Elastica, [they] should find it here,&quot; adding that the band&#x27;s &quot;mixture of girl seductive sugar pop and evil grater guitars with seventies rock quotes&quot; is everywhere, and is &quot;very catchy and somehow as tasty as French fries&quot;. Porter said that while it was not a &quot;perfect album, by any means, [... it was] more intelligent, more alive than the slightly condescending tone of the reviews suggest&quot;.

Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that if he were to &quot;judge only from the guitar squall&quot; opening the album, it would appear that &quot;the band prefers noise to melody&quot; as previously shown on &quot;Trailer&quot;; however, he felt the &quot;balance has shifted on this disc&quot;, with it showcasing &quot;classic tunefulness over raw aggression&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; reviewer Andrew Collins said the album &quot;benefits from having its raw power harnessed&quot; by Morris and was &quot;pulled off with 100 per cent enthusiasm; hey, these boys make pointless distorted introductions [to some songs] sound like fun.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; Johnny Cigarettes wrote that with &quot;a single listen&quot;, he was certain the band had &quot;cured themselves&quot; of becoming generic, as he had noted with their early singles. He added that &quot;[w]hat invariably saves them from mature-rock-band hell, just as it has saved them from generic-indie-band hell are those simple, honest, priceless standbys - top-hole tunes&quot;.

Tim Hulsizer of &quot;Consumable Online&quot; wrote that &quot;1977&quot; was &quot;every bit as fun and catchy&quot; as &quot;Trailer&quot;, going on to call it a &quot;very cohesive, fluid album&quot;. MTV writer Michael Krugman said that the album saw the band &quot;teetering on the brink of maturity--only they&#x27;re plainly fighting it by throwing their weight in the other direction&quot;. He mentions the album &quot;occasionally trips over its own giant steps&quot;, noting a couple of generic and underdeveloped tracks, before citing the album&#x27;s &quot;real flaw...lies in the hands of someone who should have known better&quot;, criticising Morris&#x27; &quot;excessively noisy and often quite murky&quot; production, stating the &quot;punk rock gets muddied, while experimental bits...are strangely obscured&quot;. Victoria Segal of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was dismissive of the album, stating that it &quot;never aspires to be anything beyond My Guy indie, boys-next-door making music for girls-next-door&quot;.

&quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; reviewer Joss Albert called &quot;1977&quot; an &quot;album by the young for the young&quot;. He said that while it was not &quot;perfect or complete, the severe hooks of the best of the Brut smothered tunes will always get 1977&#x27;s name mentioned&quot;. &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot; contributor John L. Murphy noted that in spite of the &quot;clear influences and the passage of time, &quot;1977&quot; still sounds fresh&quot;, with &quot;fast pop dominat[ing]&quot; after the initial listen. Only &quot;repeated airings reveal craft in softer songs&quot;, their &quot;cinematic&quot; scope, and &quot;sentimental&quot; lyrics. BBC Music&#x27;s Mike Diver wrote that the album was likely &quot;remembered by those who shared in its sentiments – written by a trio of teenagers, for an audience of the same, it preoccupied itself with chugging alcohol, chasing after girls and messing about with martial arts&quot;. Thompson praised the band for &quot;pull[ing] their disparate styles together by gluing the joins with a coat of indie rock – which amazingly does the trick.&quot;

&quot;The Irish Times&quot; writer Brian Boyd said the band &quot;come racing out of the traps with a giddy pop sound&quot;, though he was &quot;not sure why the band feel the need to release [a triple disc edition] ... as this will surely only appeal to their fanbase. But maybe&#x27;s that the point.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; reviewer Emmy Watts described the album as a &quot;grungy slice of Britpop&quot; that &quot;has not aged well&quot;. She noted that at the time, the &quot;rough spontaneity&quot; of Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;flat vocals&quot; and McMurray&#x27;s &quot;muffled drumming&quot; aided their inexperience, however, &quot;the original format just highlights the recording&#x27;s poor quality&quot;. &quot;Sick Party&quot; was included on &quot;Pitchfork&quot; 2010 list of &quot;ten unusual CD-era gimmicks&quot;.

<doc id="197108" wikidata="Q753542" url="?curid=197108" title="Soyuz 6">
<text>Soyuz 6 (, &quot;Union 6&quot;) was part of a joint October, 1969, mission with Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 8 that saw the three Soyuz spacecraft in orbit together at the same time, carrying a total of seven cosmonauts. The crew of Georgy Shonin and Valeri Kubasov were meant to take high-quality movie photography of the Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 8 docking, but the rendezvous systems on all three spacecraft failed.

It is still not known exactly what the actual problem was, but it is often quoted as being a helium pressurisation integrity test. The version of Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft used for the missions carried a torus-shaped docking electronics equipment housing surrounding the motor assembly on the back of the service module, which is thought to have been pressurised with helium to provide an inert environment for the electronics. It was then jettisoned after docking to lower the mass of the spacecraft for reentry. Due to unstable temperature, disparity between the frequencies of the transmitters and receivers, which were stabilised by special quartz resonators, occurred. The piezocrystals were supposed to be in thermostats at a strictly constant temperature.

The crew was made up of Shonin and Kubasov, who carried out experiments in space welding. They tested three methods: using an electron beam, a low-pressure plasma arc and a consumable electrode. While welding, Kubasov almost burned through the hull of the vehicle&#x27;s Living Compartment, which in the absence of spacesuits could have resulted in a catastrophic situation. The apparatus was designed at the Paton Institute of Electric Welding, Kyiv, Ukraine. The weld quality was said to be in no way inferior to that of Earth-based welds.

After eighty orbits of the Earth, they landed on 16 October 1969, northwest of Karaganda, Kazakhstan.

The radio call sign of the spacecraft was , referring to the Greek hero &quot;Antaeus&quot;, but at the time of the flight, however, it was also the name of the largest practicable aircraft, the Soviet Antonov An-22, made in Ukraine. But unlike the call signs of Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 8, it was not the name of a squadron in Soviet military training, of uncertain role, for the one that begins with the letter &#x27;a&#x27; is , meaning &quot;active&quot;.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Reserve crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
* Mass: 
* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 51.68°
* Period: 88.67 minutes

== Mission ==
The mission objectives included:
* checkout and flight test of spaceborne systems and the modified structure of the Soyuz craft,
* further improvement of the control, orientation, and orbital stabilisation systems and navigation aids,
* debugging the piloting systems by orbital maneuvering of the spaceships in relation to one another,
* testing of a system for control of the simultaneous flight of three spacecraft,
* scientific observations and photographing of geological-geographical subjects and exploration of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere,
* studying circumterrestrial space,
* conducting experiments of engineering research and biomedical engineering importance.

== Return ==
Stable two-way radio communications was maintained between the spaceships and the ground stations, and TV coverage was broadcast from the ships during flight. The most significant objective was testing alternate methods for welding using remote handling equipment in the high vacuum and weightless conditions of outer space. In Soyuz 6, the welding unit had the name Vulcan and was controlled remotely by electric cable. Of the three types of welding tried (low pressure compressed arc, electron beam, and arc with a consumable electrode), electron beam was the most successful. Soyuz 6 also performed group flight with Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 8, but it did not dock with either spacecraft.

<doc id="197109" wikidata="Q726862" url="?curid=197109" title="Asia (Asia album)">
<text>Asia is the debut studio album by English rock supergroup Asia, released in 1982. According to both &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cashbox&quot;, it was the #1 album in the United States for the year 1982. It contains their biggest hit &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, which reached #4 in the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

==Recording==

Asia included keyboardist Geoffrey Downes and guitarist Steve Howe from Yes; King Crimson singer-bassist John Wetton, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer drummer Carl Palmer.

&quot;The production was a bit Journey-esque,&quot; Howe noted. &quot;That was down to Mike Stone, who&#x27;d co-produced &quot;Escape&quot;, which was a huge album for Journey. But &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; was the last song we recorded for the Asia album. By then we&#x27;d already done stuff like &quot;Time Again&quot; and &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, which were very progressive. There was also this sweetness in &quot;[Only] Time Will Tell&quot;. But as soon as I stacked up the guitar and John started singing, we knew we had something special in &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;.&quot;

&quot;People said, &#x27;No, that&#x27;s not going to work. It&#x27;s all keyboards now. It&#x27;s all synthesizers.&#x27; I think A Flock of Seagulls was No. 1,&quot; Wetton commented. &quot;Actually, what we did was make a sound that blew synthesizers out of the water. Everyone said, &#x27;Oh, no, no, no. A prog-guitar band ain&#x27;t gonna work.&#x27; But it did.&quot;

The album&#x27;s concluding track, &quot;Here Comes the Feeling&quot; (credited to Wetton and Howe) was a reworking of a song written by Wetton and recorded with French progressive rock band Atoll in 1979: the original version was released as a bonus track on Atoll&#x27;s 1993 reissue of their 1979 album &quot;Rock Puzzle&quot;.

==Artwork==
Asia&#x27;s logo and cover artwork were created by Roger Dean, known for his work with Yes (of which guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Geoff Downes were previous members) and Uriah Heep (of which bassist/vocalist John Wetton had previously been a member). The debut album&#x27;s art depicts a sea serpent gazing into a crystal orb.

There was a concern that having Dean do the cover would produce something that looked too much like his famed artwork for Yes, but Howe and Downes pushed for his involvement. Geffen&#x27;s John Kalodner did not initially like Dean&#x27;s logo for the band.

==Critical reception==
Robert Christgau blasted the album, and particularly its lyrics. He stated that it had been a rare occasion that &quot;a big new group is bad enough to sink your teeth into any more&quot; and called the album &quot;pompous – schlock in the grand manner&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s Adam Sweeting similarly lambasted the band: &quot;Designed by computer, hand-built by robots...Completely calculated, thoroughly contemptible, Asia is every bit as hollow, shallow and nasty as anyone had a right to expect.&quot; On the other side, in a &quot;Billboard&quot; review, it was favourably noted that &quot;the caliber of the [band&#x27;s] playing is superb and the music sounds fresh and perfect fare for AOR&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tom Demalon awarded &quot;Asia&quot; four-and-a-half out of five, saying that &quot;there&#x27;s no denying the epic grandeur of the music, which provided some much-needed muscle to radio at the time, and did so with style&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
Upon its release in March 1982, &quot;Asia&quot; reached #1 in the US and spent nine weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. &quot;Asia&quot; was certified 4x-platinum in the US by the RIAA on 10 February 1995. It was the best-selling album of 1982 in the US.

In the band&#x27;s native UK, &quot;Asia&quot; did not perform as well as in the US, peaking only at #11 and spent a total of 38 weeks in the UK Albums Chart. The record received a gold status in Britain on 18 October 1982. &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; climbed to No. 46.

&quot;Asia&quot;&#x27;s total worldwide sales are estimated at over ten million copies.

==2010 Audio Fidelity remastered edition==
In 2010, Audio Fidelity released a 24 Karat Gold CD (AFZ 068) remaster of the album, mastered by Kevin Gray.

<doc id="197110" wikidata="Q2895096" url="?curid=197110" title="USS Indiana (BB-58)">
<text>USS &quot;Indiana&quot; (BB-58) was the second of four fast battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1930s. The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to guns, but refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of . A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships, a problem that was exacerbated as wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries significantly increased their crews.

&quot;Indiana&quot; entered service in April 1942, by which time the United States was engaged in World War II, and the ship was immediately pressed into action in the Pacific War against Japan. Her first combat came in late 1942 when she supported marines fighting during the Guadalcanal campaign. Over the next three years, she was occupied with two primary roles: naval gunfire support for amphibious assaults across the Pacific and anti-aircraft defense for the fast carrier task force. She shelled Japanese positions during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943 and the Battle of Kwajalein in February 1944. During the latter operation, she collided with the battleship and was forced to withdraw for repairs.

After returning to the fleet in April 1944, she took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, bombarding Saipan and helping to defend the fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Engine problems prevented her from participating in the Battle of Peleliu in September, but she was present for the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. In the latter action, she shot down a number of kamikazes. Following the Japanese surrender in August, she contributed men to the occupation force before returning to the United States in September. After a final refit, she was placed in reserve and remained inactive in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1962 when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap the following year.

==Design==

The was ordered in the context of global naval rearmament during the breakdown of the Washington treaty system that had controlled battleships construction during the 1920s and early 1930s. Under the Washington and London treaties, so-called treaty battleships were limited to a standard displacement of and a main battery of guns. In 1936, following Japan&#x27;s decision to abandon the treaty system, the United States Navy decided to invoke the &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the Second London treaty that allowed displacements to rise to and armament to increase to guns. Congressional objections to increasing the size of the new ships forced the design staff to keep displacement as close to 35,000 LT as possible while incorporating the larger guns and armor sufficient to defeat guns of the same caliber.

&quot;Indiana&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried three Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her peace time crew numbered 1,793 officers and enlisted men, but during the war the crew swelled to 2,500 officers and enlisted.

The ship was armed with a main battery of nine 16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 guns guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The secondary battery consisted of twenty 5-inch /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on either side. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of twelve guns and twelve .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns, but she was completed with a battery of seven quadruple Bofors guns in place of the 1.1 in guns and thirty-five Oerlikon autocannon instead of the .50-cal. guns.

The main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and they were mounted atop barbettes that were thick. The conning tower had thick sides.

===Modifications===
&quot;Indiana&quot; received a series of modifications through her wartime career, consisting primarily of additions to anti-aircraft battery and various types of radar sets. The first addition was the installation of SC air search radar in 1941, fitted in the foremast, which was later replaced with an SK type set. At the same time, an SG surface search radar was installed on the forward superstructure; a second SG set was added to the main mast after experiences during the Guadalcanal campaign in 1942. In 1943, she received a Mark 3 fire-control radar, mounted on her conning tower to assist in the direction of her main battery guns. The Mark 3 was quickly replaced with more modern Mark 8 fire-control radar, and Mark 4 radars for the secondary battery guns. She later received Mark 12/22 sets in place of the Mark 4s. &quot;Indiana&quot; also received a TDY jammer. In 1945, her traditional spotting scopes were replaced with Mark 27 microwave radar sets.

The ship&#x27;s light anti-aircraft battery was gradually expanded. Three more 40 mm quad mounts were added in late 1942. By January 1943, she had another eighteen 20 mm guns installed, bringing the total to fifty-three of the guns. Two more 40 mm quadruple mounts were added in February, and another seven 20 mm guns were added later that year for a total battery of sixty barrels. By July 1944, &quot;Indiana&quot; had had five of the 20 mm guns removed; three more had been removed by the end of the war in mid-1945.

==Service history==
===Construction===
The new battleship was authorized on 27 March 1934 by the Vinson-Trammell Act, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved the name &quot;Indiana&quot; on 21 September 1938. The keel for &quot;Indiana&quot; was laid down on 20 November 1939 at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. The completed hull was launched on 21 November 1941, with the christening performed by Margaret Robbins, the daughter of the Governor of Indiana, Henry F. Schricker. &quot;Indiana&quot; was completed by April 1942 and was commissioned into the fleet on the 30th. Then-Captain Aaron S. Merrill was the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. During the elaborate commissioning ceremony, which was attended by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, the ship flew the flag from the old battleship that had been used during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba in 1898.

Fitting-out work continued at Newport News through 20 May, and the following day &quot;Indiana&quot; departed on sea trials. Initial trials were conducted in Chesapeake Bay from 26 to 29 May; on the 31st, she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Speed trials followed on 1 June, during which she was escorted by the destroyers , , , and . Trials, gunnery training, and various exercises continued into September, and on the 29th she departed for Casco Bay in Maine for more gunnery training. The ship was declared fit for combat service on 9 November, and she departed for the Panama Canal that day. By this time, the United States had been at war with Germany and Japan for nearly a year, and was in the midst of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific; &quot;Indiana&quot; was ordered to join the forces engaged there.

===Pacific Theater operations===
====Battles of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, and Kwajalein====
On 14 November, &quot;Indiana&quot; was assigned as the flagship for Task Group (TG) 2.6, which included the light cruiser and the destroyers and . The four ships then proceeded to Tonga, arriving on the afternoon of 28 November. After refueling, &quot;Indiana&quot; transferred to TG 66.6 two days later and continued on to Nouméa, arriving on 2 December. There, she took part in exercises with ships from Task Force (TF) 64. The ship served as a replacement for her sister , which had been badly damaged during the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal; while operating off Guadalcanal, &quot;Indiana&quot; provided gunfire support to American forces ashore.

By January 1943, the ship had been joined by the fast battleships and ; the three battleships were grouped together as TF 64 under Rear Admiral Willis Lee, and they covered convoys to support the fighting in the Solomons into the next year. These operations included covering a group of seven transports carrying elements of the 25th Infantry Division to Guadalcanal from 1 to 4 January 1943. During another of these convoy operations later that month, the battleships were too far south to come to aid of the American cruiser force during the Battle of Rennell Island at the end of the month. During the invasion of New Georgia, the battleship force, which now included &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and , was assigned to cover the invasion fleet against possible Japanese attacks. &quot;Indiana&quot; supported the carrier task force that raided Marcus Island on 31 August – 1 September. She took part in the invasion of Tarawa on 20–23 November and provided part of the anti-aircraft screen for the aircraft carriers of Task Group 50.2 off Makin Atoll, including , , and . During operations in the area, &quot;Indiana&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners claimed their first Japanese aircraft. On 8 December, &quot;Indiana&quot;, four other battleships, and twelve destroyers bombarded Japanese positions on Nauru. Between the five battleships, a total of 810 sixteen-inch shells were fired at the island.

On 1 January 1944, &quot;Indiana&quot; was assigned to TG 37.2, and on 16 January she took part in gunnery practice with &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the destroyers , , and . The five ships, joined by &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, and three more destroyers, then got underway on 18 January for the next major amphibious operation the Pacific, the Marshall Islands campaign. While en route, the ships conducted training with their anti-aircraft batteries. They rendezvoused with the carriers and &quot;Monterey&quot; at sea, and after arriving in Funafuti on 20 January the unit was redesignated as TG 58.1. By this time, the group had grown to include the carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, and several more cruisers and destroyers. Further training took place from 25 to 28 January, including more anti-aircraft practice; &quot;Indiana&quot; also served as a target for simulated air attacks from the carrier aircraft. During the operation, &quot;Indiana&quot; served as the flagship of Battleship Division 8 (BatDiv), commanded by Rear Admiral Glenn B. Davis.

In late January, &quot;Indiana&quot; took part in operations to prepare for the invasion of Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. On 29 January, the ship attacked Maloelap Atoll, along with &quot;Washington&quot; and the aircraft carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot; and , and the following day the ships began bombarding Kwajalein to soften Japanese defenses. On 30 January, &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, and &quot;Washington&quot;, escorted by four destroyers, were detached to shell Kwajalein as part of the invasion bombardment. They reached their firing positions early the next morning and &quot;Indiana&quot; opened fire at 09:56; she and the other ships sank a submarine chaser and five guard ships that were moored in the atoll. Japanese artillery batteries engaged the American ships, but &quot;Indiana&quot; was not hit. She continued to bombard Japanese positions around the island until 14:48 before departing at 17:15 to return to the carriers. She had fired some 306 shells from her main battery and 2,385 rounds from her 5-inch guns.

&quot;Indiana&quot; thereafter withdrew to escort the carrier task force overnight. While operating off the islands in the early hours of 1 February, &quot;Indiana&quot; collided with &quot;Washington&quot;. The ships were blacked out to prevent Japanese observers from spotting them, and in the darkness, &quot;Indiana&quot; turned in front of &quot;Washington&quot;. &quot;Indiana&quot; was badly damaged, with the starboard propeller shaft destroyed and significant damaged inflicted on the belt armor and torpedo defense system. The ship had some of armor plating torn from her hull, and &quot;Washington&quot; had a section of her bow ripped away and lodged into &quot;Indiana&quot;″s side. The accident killed three men and injured another six aboard &quot;Indiana&quot;, one of whom later died. A subsequent inquiry into the accident placed the blame on &quot;Indiana&quot;, faulting her crew for failing to inform the other ships in the unit about her course changes.

Davis transferred his flag to another vessel and on 2 February, &quot;Indiana&quot; departed for Majuro for temporary repairs before proceeding on to Pearl Harbor on 7 February in company with the escorting destroyer and the destroyer escort . Four days later, two more destroyers joined the group, which reached Pearl Harbor on 13 February. &quot;Indiana&quot; was dry-docked the next day for repairs that lasted until 7 April. She then conducted sea trials and test fired her main battery to ensure there were no remaining structural issues from the collision. She spent the next two weeks training her gun crews before departing in late April to rejoin the fleet for the next operation in the central Pacific.

====Marianas campaign====
&quot;Indiana&quot; arrived in Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island on 26 April and Davis came back aboard his flagship two days later. That same day, she got underway in company with &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and four destroyers to join TF 58 for Operation Hailstone, the major attack on Truk Atoll conducted over the course of 29–30 April. On 1 May, &quot;Indiana&quot; took part in an attack on Pohnpei in the Senyavin Islands, shelling the island for about an hour before disengaging after having difficulty in locating suitable targets. Three days later the American fleet arrived in Majuro, where it began preparations for the invasion of several islands in the Marianas. The fleet sortied on 6 June to embark on the first stage of the campaign, the invasion of Saipan. &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, and four escorting destroyers were designated as Task Unit (TU) 58.7.3, the Western Bombardment Unit; over the course of the pre-invasion bombardment that began on 13 June and continued for two days, &quot;Indiana&quot; fired 584 shells from her main battery. Late in the day on 15 June, after the ground forces had gone ashore, Japanese air strikes targeted the invasion fleet. &quot;Indiana&quot; began evasive maneuvers to avoid the attacks, including a torpedo bomber that launched a torpedo at the ship at around 19:10 that failed to explode. Her anti-aircraft gunners shot the aircraft down, along with another bomber three minutes later. The ship was not damaged in the attacks and remained on station.

A more significant Japanese counterattack came in the form of the 1st Mobile Fleet, the main carrier strike force. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea from 19 to 20 June, &quot;Indiana&quot; provided anti-aircraft support to the American carrier fleet. She and &quot;South Dakota&quot; reported the initial wave of Japanese aircraft early on 19 June, and at 10:48 her anti-aircraft gunners opened fire, quickly shooting down one Japanese aircraft. The ship was forced to take evasive maneuvers at around 11:50, when a torpedo bomber attacked her; the torpedo exploded harmlessly in the ship&#x27;s wake. As a Japanese fighter approached to strafe &quot;Indiana&quot;, her guns shot away the plane&#x27;s tail at 12:13, sending it crashing into the sea. The ship&#x27;s luck ran out shortly thereafter, as a burning Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bomber crashed into her starboard side, hurling burning debris over the deck. The ship was not damaged in the crash and &quot;Indiana&quot; remained on station. In the course of the battle, she had fired 416 shells from her secondary guns, 4,832 rounds of 40 mm ammunition and around 9,000 rounds from her 20 mm guns; she suffered five casualties, all men injured by shell fragments from other ships&#x27; anti-aircraft guns.

On 4 July, one of &quot;Indiana&quot;″s Kingfishers picked up two men from the carrier after their aircraft had gone down. &quot;Indiana&quot; remained off the Marianas until early August when she was detached to Eniwetok to replenish ammunition and supplies. She got underway on 30 August with TF 34 and met TG 38 on 3 September, which was scheduled to attack the Palau Islands later that month. &quot;Indiana&quot; developed engine problems, however, and she was sent to Seeadler Harbor for repairs that lasted from 21 September to 4 October. During this period, Davis shifted his flag to &quot;Massachusetts&quot;. &quot;Indiana&quot; then joined the battleship and the cruisers and for the voyage to Pearl Harbor. They arrived there on 14 October, and two days later &quot;Indiana&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot;, escorted by two destroyers, left for Puget Sound Navy Yard for a thorough overhaul that was completed on 30 November. Following another round of sea trials, &quot;Indiana&quot; left on 6 December, bound for Pearl Harbor, where she conducted training exercises and additional repairs that lasted through the end of the year.

====Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa====
Rear Admiral Oscar C. Badger II, the commander of TU 12.5.2, hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 8 January 1945, and she departed Pearl Harbor two days later in company with the destroyer and the destroyer minelayer . The ships cruised to Eniwetok, and from there, continued on to Saipan where she joined the rest of her unit on 20 January. The unit sortied on 22 January, headed for Iwo Jima and arrived there two days later. On arrival, &quot;Indiana&quot;, three heavy cruisers, seven destroyers, and &quot;Gwin&quot; shelled the island in preparation for the invasion of the island a month later. At 13:17, a Nakajima B6N torpedo bomber attacked the ships but was driven off by heavy anti-aircraft fire. &quot;Indiana&quot; fired a total of 200 shells from her main battery before poor visibility forced her to cease fire at 15:55. She left the area the next morning and steamed to Ulithi, arriving on 26 January. Badger then transferred to the battleship and &quot;Indiana&quot; occupied herself with anti-aircraft training for the rest of the month.

The ship got underway again on 10 February as part of TG 58.1 for a raid on Tokyo, Japan; a group of carriers launched air strikes on targets in the area on 16 February, followed by a series of strikes on various targets in the Bonin Islands (including Iwo Jima), after which they conducted a second strike on the Tokyo area on 25 February. In addition to providing anti-aircraft defense for the carriers, &quot;Indiana&quot; also frequently used her Kingfishers to pick up downed aircrews, and on 1 March one of her aircraft picked up the crews of two such aircraft. The fleet returned to Ulithi on 3 March for replenishment. On 14 March, &quot;Indiana&quot; sortied with &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and &quot;Washington&quot;, now designated TU 58.1.3, to support another round of strikes on Japan that were conducted three days later. She shot down a Japanese aircraft in the early hours of 19 March before the carriers attacked various points on the island of Kyushu. Later that day, the fleet steamed to strike the Kure Naval Arsenal. The carriers and were badly damaged by Japanese air attacks and were forced to withdraw.
On 23 March, &quot;Indiana&quot; steamed to Okinawa to join the preparatory bombardment of the island. She fired 180 main battery shells the next day and then rejoined the fleet. She resumed her air defense role for the next several days while the carriers launched raids on the island. For much of April, &quot;Indiana&quot; and the rest of TG 58.1 provided support to the marines and soldiers fighting in the Battle of Okinawa. On 7 April, the Japanese launched a major counter-attack on the Allied naval forces, including large-scale kamikaze strikes and Operation Ten-Go with the battleship , but they were repelled with heavy losses. The kamikaze raids continued throughout the month, and on 12 April two fighters—a Mitsubishi A6M Zero and a Nakajima Ki-43—attempted to crash into &quot;Indiana&quot;, but her heavy anti-aircraft fire shot both down before they could strike her, though a fragment from one of the kamikazes struck a marine aboard the ship. Two days later, she shot down three more Ki-43s. She accidentally opened fire on a pair of American Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters on 15 April, but did not damage them. Later that day, she met with replenishment oilers to refuel.

The ships of BatDiv 8 left Okinawa at the end of the month and returned to Ulithi, where they remained from 1 to 9 May. &quot;Indiana&quot; then got underway again to escort aircraft carriers for another series of strikes on Kyushu that began on 12 May. Two days later, she shot down an A6M kamikaze and assisted in the recovery of an F6F pilot who had been shot down by Japanese fire. On 27 May, Third Fleet relieved Fifth Fleet as the operational command, and all of the fleet&#x27;s task forces and subordinate units were renumbered back to 30-series designations, returning &quot;Indiana&quot; to TG 38.1. In early June, a powerful cyclone formed in the Philippine Sea and moved north toward Okinawa; it struck Third Fleet on 5 June south of the island. &quot;Indiana&quot; recorded winds as high as , which tore one of her Kingfishers from its catapult and hurled it into the sea. The winds also blew seawater into the ventilation intakes for the engine room, shorting out her switchboard and disabling her steering controls for about forty minutes. Thirty-six ships of the fleet were damaged by the storm, though &quot;Indiana&quot; only superficially so.

The fleet resumed its normal operations in support of the Okinawa fight on 7 June, including air strikes on Japanese airfields on Kyushu the next day that &quot;Indiana&quot; supported. With an escort of five destroyers on 9 June, &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; steamed to shell Japanese facilities on the island of Minami Daito Jima; they repeated the attack the next day. &quot;Indiana&quot; was thereafter detached to replenish ammunition and other supplies in San Pedro Bay in the Philippines, arriving there on 11 June.

====Operations off Japan====
&quot;Indiana&quot; got underway again in early July and returned to TF 38. She supported carrier strikes on the Tokyo area on 10 July and took part in the first bombardment of the Japanese home islands by capital ships during the war. For the attack, which took place on 14 July, &quot;Indiana&quot; was assigned to TU 34.8.1, which included &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot;, the heavy cruisers and , and nine destroyers. The primary target was an industrial complex in Kamaishi that included the Japan Iron Co. and the Kamaishi Steel Works. &quot;Indiana&quot; fired 271 shells from her 16-inch guns, but smoke hindered the efforts of her spotter aircraft from observing the effects of the shooting, though a destroyer returned the next day and reported that fires were still burning. &quot;Indiana&quot; then resumed her anti-aircraft support duties with the fast carrier task force until being detached for another bombardment operation with TU 34.8.1 on 29 July. This attack, made in concert with the British TF 37—centered on the battleship —targeted industrial facilities at Hamamatsu. &quot;Indiana&quot; fired 270 shells during the bombardment.

On 1 August, BatDiv 8 was detached to form Support Unit 38.1.2; the ships continued their attacks on coastal cities in company with TF 37. One of &quot;Indiana&quot;″s Kingfishers accidentally crashed in the sea on 7 August, killing its crew. The ships of BatDiv 8 conducted a second attack on Kamaishi on 9 August, with &quot;Indiana&quot; firing a total of 270 shells between 12:46 and 14:45. Poor visibility again hampered the observers, though this proved to be the ship&#x27;s last offensive operation. Japan agreed to surrender unconditionally on 15 August while &quot;Indiana&quot; was en route to the coast to support another wave of carrier strikes. Instead of munitions, food and medical supplies were loaded onto the carriers&#x27; aircraft to be dropped on prisoner of war (POW) camps. &quot;Indiana&quot; contributed a landing party to be sent ashore on 30 August, which was part of the initial occupation forces.

After the formal surrender on 2 September, &quot;Indiana&quot; steamed into Tokyo Bay on the 5th. Over the course of the next week, &quot;Indiana&quot; was moored in the harbor and used to process POWs, including 54 USN personnel, 28 marines, 64 civilians, and a number of US Army and Canadian soldiers. On 15 September, she got underway in company with the destroyer , bound for California. She was forced to steam at a speed of since her number 3 shaft had locked up and could not be used. On the way, her crew conducted a variety of shooting drills. The two ships reached Pearl Harbor on 22 September before &quot;Indiana&quot; continued on the next day for San Francisco, which she reached on 29 September. There, she disembarked 1,013 passengers.

===Postwar===

&quot;Indiana&quot; immediately went into drydock at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for repairs lasting until 31 October. From there, she transferred to Puget Sound, where her ammunition and other flammable material was unloaded. She then went into drydock on 15 November to be prepared for deactivation. On 29 March 1946, the Navy announced Postwar Plan Number Two, which detailed the reductions in force necessary to bring the fleet back to a peacetime footing; &quot;Indiana&quot; was to be transferred to the Pacific Reserve Fleet along with &quot;Alabama&quot;.

Plans were drawn up during the period she was in reserve to modernize &quot;Indiana&quot; and the other ships of her class should they be needed for future active service. In March 1954, a program to equip the four ships with secondary batteries consisting of ten twin guns were proposed, but the plan came to nothing. Another plan to convert the ship into a guided missile battleship arose in 1956–1957, but the cost of the conversion proved to be prohibitive. She would have had all three main battery turrets removed and replaced with a twin RIM-8 Talos missile launcher forward, two RIM-24 Tartar launchers aft, anti-submarine weapons, and equipment to handle helicopters. The cost of the project amounted to $120 million.

The ships remained laid up in Bremerton, Washington, into the early 1960s; on 27 June 1961, Admiral Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, designated the four &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships as eligible for disposal, and on 1 May 1962, Fred Korth, the Secretary of the Navy, recommended she be stricken from the Naval Vessel Register effective on 1 June. She was thereafter sold for scrap on 6 September 1963 and broken up.

Several parts of the ship have been preserved in her namesake state, including one of her anchors, which is on display at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana; her bell is at the Heslar Naval Armory in Indianapolis, Indiana; her wheel is at Shortridge High School, also in Indianapolis; and her main mast, prow, and a pair of anti-aircraft guns stand on display at Memorial Stadium of Indiana University. The mast and guns had been donated by the Navy in 1966, but her bow section had been kept in California until 2013 when it was moved to Indiana University. Twenty members of the ship&#x27;s crew attended the dedication ceremony in September 2013. Some of the low-background steel that made up &quot;Indiana&quot;&#x27;s hull was recycled to create the low background counting chamber at the in Vivo Radioassay and Research Facility (IVRRF) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

<text>A bumblebee (or bumble bee, bumble-bee, or humble-bee) is any of over 250 species in the genus Bombus, part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., &quot;Calyptapis&quot;) are known from fossils. They are found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America, where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals.

Most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests or form colonies; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers. Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus, but are now usually treated as members of &quot;Bombus&quot;.

Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long branched setae) called &#x27;pile&#x27;, making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have aposematic (warning) coloration, often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective Müllerian mimicry. Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in Batesian mimicry, and may be confused with them. Nest-making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy cuckoo bumblebees by the form of the female hind leg. In nesting bumblebees, it is modified to form a pollen basket, a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen, whereas in cuckoo bumblebees, the hind leg is hairy all round, and they never carry pollen.

Like their relatives the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees steal nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.

==Etymology and common names==

The word &quot;bumblebee&quot; is a compound of &quot;bumble&quot; and &quot;bee&quot;—&#x27;bumble&#x27; meaning to hum, buzz, drone, or move ineptly or flounderingly. The generic name &quot;Bombus&quot;, assigned by Pierre André Latreille in 1802, is derived from the Latin word for a buzzing or humming sound, borrowed from Ancient Greek ().

According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the term &quot;bumblebee&quot; was first recorded as having been used in the English language in the 1530 work &quot;Lesclarcissement&quot; by John Palsgrave, &quot;I bomme, as a bombyll bee dothe.&quot; However the OED also states that the term &quot;humblebee&quot; predates it, having first been used in 1450 in &quot;Fysshynge wyth Angle&quot;, &quot;In Juyll the greshop &amp; the humbylbee in the medow.&quot; The latter term was used in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; () by William Shakespeare, &quot;The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees.&quot; Similar terms are used in other Germanic languages, such as the German (Old High German ), Dutch or Swedish .

An old provincial name, &quot;dumbledor&quot;, also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or cockchafer, &quot;dumble&quot; probably imitating the sound of these insects, while &quot;dor&quot; meant &quot;beetle&quot;.

In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), Charles Darwin speculated about &quot;humble-bees&quot; and their interactions with other species:

However, &quot;bumblebee&quot; remained in use, for example in &quot;The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse&quot; (1910) by Beatrix Potter, &quot;Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--&quot;Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!&quot; said the bumble bee.&quot; Since World War II &quot;humblebee&quot; has fallen into near-total disuse.

==Phylogeny==
The bumblebee tribe Bombini is one of four groups of corbiculate bees (those with pollen baskets) in the Apidae, the others being the Apini (honey bees), Euglossini (orchid bees), and Meliponini (stingless bees). The corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group. Advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in the group, giving rise to controversy, now largely settled, as to the phylogenetic origins of the four tribes; it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once, requiring the Apini to be close to the Meliponini, which they do not resemble. It is now thought that the Apini (with advanced societies) and Euglossini are closely related, while the primitively eusocial Bombini are close to the Meliponini, which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour. Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth comment that &quot;While remarkable, a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior.&quot; Their analysis, combining molecular, morphological and behavioural data, gives the following cladogram:


On this hypothesis, the molecular data suggest that the Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old, while the Meliponini (and thus the clade that includes the Bombini and Meliponini) are 81 to 96 million years old, about the same age as the corbiculate group.

However, a more recent phylogeny using transcriptome data from 3,647 genes of ten corbiculate bee species supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis in the corbiculate bees. They find that Bombini is in fact sister to Meliponini, corroborating that previous finding from Sophie Cardinal and Bryan Danforth (2011). However, Romiguier et al. (2015) shows that Bombini, Meliponini, and Apini form a monophyletic group, where Apini shares a most recent common ancestor with the Bombini and Meliponini clade, while Euglossini is most distantly related to all three, since it does not share the same most recent common ancestor as Bombini, Meliponini, and Apini. Thus, their analysis supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis within the corbiculate bees, where eusociality evolved in the common ancestor of Bombini, Apini, and Meliponini.

The fossil record for bees is limited, with around 14 species that might possibly be Bombini having been described by 2019. The only &quot;Bombus&quot; relatives in Bombini are the late Eocene &quot;Calyptapis florissantensis&quot; from the Florissant Formation, USA, and &quot;Oligobombus cuspidatus&quot; from the Bembridge Marls of the Isle of Wight. Two species of &quot;Bombus&quot; have been described from the Oligocene of Beşkonak, Bucak Turkey: &quot;Bombus (Mendacibombus) beskonakensis&quot; and &quot;Bombus (Paraelectrobombus) patriciae&quot;. Both species were originally placed in genera considered at the time of description as outside of &quot;Bombus&quot;, being initially named &quot;Oligoapis beskonakensis&quot; and &quot;Paraelectrobombus patriciae&quot; respectively, however reexaminiation of the fore-wings lead to both being considered as &quot;Bombus&quot; species In 2012 a fossil bumblebee from the Miocene was found in Germany&#x27;s Randeck Maar and classified as &quot;Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis&quot;. In 2014, another species, &quot;Bombus cerdanyensis&quot;, was described from Late Miocene lacustrine beds of La Cerdanya, Spain, but not initially placed into any subgenus, The species &quot;Bombus trophonius&quot; was described in October 2017 and placed in &quot;Bombus&quot; subgenus &quot;Cullumanobombus&quot;. A redescription of the Bombini fossil record by Dehon &quot;et al&quot; (2019) resulted in the synonymization of the genus &quot;Oligoapis&quot; with &quot;Bombus&quot; subgenus &quot;Mendacibombus&quot;, and the placement of genus &quot;Paraelectrobombus&quot; as &quot;Bombus&quot; subgenus &quot;Paraelectrobombus&quot;, rather than as a genus in Electrobombini. The subgenus &quot;Cullumanobombus&quot; was expanded to include not only &quot;Bombus trophonius&quot; but also &quot;Bombus randeckensis&quot; which was moved from subgenus &quot;Bombus&quot; and &quot;Bombus pristinus&quot;, first described by Unger (1867). Within the subgenus &quot;Melanobombus&quot; only &quot;Bombus cerdanyensis&quot; is present from the fossil record. An additional three species, &quot;&quot;Bombus&quot; luianus&quot;, &quot;&quot;Bombus&quot; anacolus&quot; and &quot;&quot;Bombus&quot; dilectus&quot; have been attributed to &quot;Bombus&quot; from the Middle Miocene Shanwang formation of China by Zhang, (1990) and Zhang &quot;et al&quot; (1994). Due to not being able to study Zhang&#x27;s type specimens, but only illustrations of the fossils, Dehon &quot;et al&quot; did not place the three species within any specific subgenera, and considered all three as &quot;species inquirenda&quot;, needing fuller re-examination. Two other species were not examined at all by Dehon &quot;et al&quot;, &quot;Bombus? crassipes&quot; of the Late Miocene Krottensee deposits in the Czech Republic, and &quot;Bombus proavus&quot; from the Middle Miocene Latah Formation, USA.

The genus &quot;Bombus&quot;, the only one extant genus in the tribe Bombini, comprises over 250 species; for an overview of the differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps, see characteristics of common wasps and bees. The genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera, a degree of complexity criticised by Williams (2008). The cuckoo bumblebees &quot;Psithyrus&quot; have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of &quot;Bombus&quot;, in one or more subgenera.

Examples of &quot;Bombus&quot; species include &quot;Bombus pauloensis&quot;, &quot;Bombus dahlbomii&quot;, &quot;Bombus fervidus&quot;, &quot;Bombus lapidarius&quot;, &quot;Bombus ruderatus&quot;, and &quot;Bombus rupestris.&quot;

==General description==
Bumblebees vary in appearance, but are generally plump and densely furry. They are larger, broader and stouter-bodied than honeybees, and their abdomen tip is more rounded. Many species have broad bands of colour, the patterns helping to distinguish different species. Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers, some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube. Bumblebees have fewer stripes (or none), and usually have part of the body covered in black fur, while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen. Sizes are very variable even within species; the largest British species, &quot;B. terrestris&quot;, has queens up to long, males up to long, and workers between long. The largest bumblebee species in the world is &quot;B. dahlbomii&quot; of Chile, up to about long, and described as &quot;flying mice&quot; and &quot;a monstrous fluffy ginger beast&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

Bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates, and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees, although a few lowland tropical species exist. A few species (&quot;B. polaris&quot; and &quot;B. alpinus&quot;) range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; &quot;B. polaris&quot; occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, along with another bumblebee &quot;B. hyperboreus&quot;, which parasitises its nest. This is the northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect. One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of &quot;shivering&quot; (called heterothermy), and countercurrent exchange to retain heat. Other bees have similar physiology, but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees. They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude. Bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from Australia (apart from Tasmania where they have been introduced) and are found in Africa only north of the Sahara. More than a hundred years ago they were also introduced to New Zealand, where they play an important role as efficient pollinators.

==Biology==
===Feeding===
The bumblebee tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy structure that extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The primary action of the tongue is lapping, that is, repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid. 
The tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn from experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like &quot;Bombus bifarius&quot;, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, &quot;B. bifarius&quot; workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, which resulted in a small reward.

===Wax production===
The exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.

===Coloration===

The brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, given that females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran flies in the families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies, such as &quot;Bombylius major&quot;) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.

Many species of &quot;Bombus&quot;, including the group sometimes called &quot;Psithyrus&quot; (cuckoo bumblebees), have evolved Müllerian mimicry, where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other, so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once. For example, in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including &quot;B. californicus&quot;, &quot;B. caliginosus&quot;, &quot;B. vandykei&quot;, &quot;B. vosnesenskii&quot;, &quot;B. insularis&quot; and &quot;B. fernaldae&quot;. Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow. In each case, Müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage. In addition, parasitic (cuckoo) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance, at least in areas like Europe where parasite-host co-speciation is common; but this too may be explained as Müllerian mimicry, rather than requiring the parasite&#x27;s coloration to deceive the host (aggressive mimicry).

===Temperature control===
Bumblebees are active under conditions during which honeybees and other smaller bees stay at home, and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine. The thick pile created by long setae (bristles) acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather; species from cold climates have longer setae (and thus thicker insulation) than those from the tropics. The temperature of the flight muscles, which occupy much of the thorax, needs to be at least before flight can take place. The muscle temperature can be raised by shivering. It takes about five minutes for the muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of .

==== Chill-coma temperature ====
The chill-coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated. Compared to honey bees and carpenter bees, bumblebees have the lowest chill-coma temperature. Of the bumblebees &quot;Bombus bimaculatus&quot; has the lowest at . However, bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures. This discrepancy is likely because the chill-coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting. However, bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold.

===Communication and social learning===
Bumblebees do not have ears, and it is not known whether or how well they can hear. However, they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials.

Bumblebees do not exhibit the &quot;bee dances&quot; used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging. Another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony. Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots, and when little is left or when high-quality food is added, they are more likely to go out to forage.

Bumblebees have been observed to partake in social learning. In a 2017 study involving &quot;Bombus terrestris&quot;, bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees who first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees who observed the same action performed by a magnet, indicating the importance of social information. The bees did not copy one another exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate one another&#x27;s goals.

===Reproduction and nesting===

Nest size depends on species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been documented as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.

In the early spring, the queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is among the first to emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. &quot;Bombus pensylvanicus&quot; is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.


In fertilised queens, the ovaries only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina where there is a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.

To develop, the larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.
After the emergence of the first or second group of offspring, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens.
Bumblebee workers can lay unfertilised haploid eggs (with only a single set of chromosomes) that develop into viable male bumblebees. Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs (one set of chromosomes from a drone, one from the queen) that mature into workers and new queens.

In a young colony, the queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg-laying through physical aggression and pheromones. Worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten. Thus, the queen is usually the mother of all of the first males laid. Workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in the season when the queen&#x27;s ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes. Because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen, bumblebees are considered &quot;primitively eusocial&quot;.

Although a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select &quot;Bombus&quot; species (such as &quot;Bombus pauloensis&quot;) will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny).

===Foraging behaviour===

Bumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1–2 km from their colony. They tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day, as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there, a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy. While foraging, bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to .

Bumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn which flowers to forage from. They can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers, which occur due to atmospheric electricity, and take a while to leak away into the ground. They use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee. Bumblebees can detect the temperature of flowers, as well as which parts of the flower are hotter or cooler and use this information to recognise flowers. After arriving at a flower, they extract nectar using their long tongues (&quot;glossae&quot;) and store it in their crops. Many species of bumblebees also exhibit &quot;nectar robbing&quot;: instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way, these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar, avoiding pollen transfer.

Pollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee&#x27;s body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.

In at least some species, once a bumblebee has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and may be able to identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.

Once they have collected nectar and pollen, female workers return to the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days&#x27; worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.

===Asynchronous flight muscles===

Bees beat their wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and are found in the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees can reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 °C (86 °F) using this method.

===Cuckoo bumblebees===


Bumblebees of the subgenus &quot;Psithyrus&quot; (known as &#x27;cuckoo bumblebees&#x27;, and formerly considered a separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, in the colonies of other bumblebees, and have lost the ability to collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a &quot;Psithyrus&quot; female, such as that of the &quot;Psithyrus&quot; species of &quot;B. sylvestris&quot;, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the &quot;Psithyrus&quot; female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as &quot;B. bohemicus&quot;, actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.

The female &quot;Psithyrus&quot; has a number of morphological adaptations for combat, such as larger mandibles, a tough cuticle and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest. Upon emerging from their cocoons, the &quot;Psithyrus&quot; males and females disperse and mate. The males do not survive the winter but, like nonparasitic bumblebee queens, &quot;Psithyrus&quot; females find suitable locations to spend the winter and enter diapause after mating. They usually emerge from hibernation later than their host species. Each species of cuckoo bumblebee has a specific host species, which it may physically resemble. In the case of the parasitism of &quot;B. terrestris&quot; by &quot;B. (Psithyrus) vestalis&quot;, genetic analysis of individuals captured in the wild showed that about 42% of the host species&#x27; nests at a single location had &quot;[lost] their fight against their parasite&quot;.

===Sting===
Queen and worker bumblebees can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee&#x27;s stinger lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without leaving the stinger in the wound and thereby injuring itself. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.

The sting is painful to humans, but not medically significant in most cases, although it may trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals.

==Predators, parasites, and pathogens==

Bumblebees, despite their ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, including any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.
The great grey shrike is able to detect flying bumblebees up to away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.

Bumblebees are parasitised by tracheal mites, &quot;Locustacarus buchneri&quot;; protozoans including &quot;Crithidia bombi&quot; and &quot;Apicystis bombi&quot;; and microsporidians including &quot;Nosema bombi&quot; and &quot;Nosema ceranae&quot;. The tree bumblebee &quot;B. hypnorum&quot; has spread into the United Kingdom despite hosting high levels of a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees&#x27; attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus has been found to affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.

Female bee moths (&quot;Aphomia sociella&quot;) prefer to lay their eggs in bumblebee nests. The &quot;A. sociella&quot; larvae will then feed on the eggs, larvae, and pupae left unprotected by the bumblebees, sometimes destroying large parts of the nest.

==Relationship to humans==
===Agricultural use===
Bumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, they do not stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.

Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When red clover was introduced as a crop to New Zealand in the nineteenth century, it was found to have no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886, the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees began colonising Tasmania, away, after being introduced there in 1992 under unclear circumstances.

Some concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass-produced bumblebee colonies. Evidence from Japan and South America indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments, causing damage to native pollinators. Greater use of native pollinators, such as &quot;Bombus ignitus&quot; in China and Japan, has occurred as a result. In addition, mounting evidence indicates mass-produced bumblebees may also carry diseases, harmful to wild bumblebees and honeybees.

In Canada and Sweden, it has been shown that growing a mosaic of different crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape, despite the fact that the bees were attracted to the crop.

===Population decline===
Bumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia due to a number of factors, including land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus &quot;Bombus&quot;. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the genus &quot;Bombus&quot;. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species &quot;Bombus hortorum&quot; in particular has been found to be affected by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively affects colony development and size.

Bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) presented a high risk for bees. While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on &quot;B. terrestris&quot; showed that &quot;field-realistic&quot; levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a &quot;considerable negative effect&quot; on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world. Another study on &quot;B. terrestris&quot; had results suggesting that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate. Foragers from bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide took longer to learn to manipulate flowers and visited flowers with less nutritious pollen.
In another study, chronic exposure in a laboratory setting to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam did not affect colony weight gain or the number or mass of sexuals produced. Low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce the number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55%, and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees&#x27; brains. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function &quot;particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks.&quot; 

Of 19 species of native nestmaking bumblebees and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain, three have been extirpated, eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread. Similar declines have been reported in Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable to extinction. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.

Some bumblebees native to North America are also vanishing, such as &quot;Bombus balteatus&quot;, &quot;Bombus terricola&quot;, &quot;Bombus affinis&quot;, and &quot;Bombus occidentalis&quot;; one, &quot;Bombus franklini&quot;, may be extinct. In South America, &quot;Bombus bellicosus&quot; was extirpated in the northern limit of its distribution range, probably due to intense land use and climate change effects.

===Conservation efforts===
In 2006, the bumblebee researcher Dave Goulson founded a registered charity, the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, to prevent the extinction &quot;of any of the UK&#x27;s bumblebees.&quot; In 2009 and 2010, the Trust attempted to reintroduce the short-haired bumblebee, &quot;Bombus subterraneus&quot;, which had become extinct in Britain, from the British-derived populations surviving in New Zealand from their introduction there a century earlier. From 2011, the Trust, in partnership with Natural England, Hymettus and the RSPB, has reintroduced short-haired bumblebee queens from Skåne in southern Sweden to restored flower-rich meadows at Dungeness in Kent. The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five &quot;Schedule 41 priority&quot; species: the ruderal bumblebee, &quot;Bombus ruderatus&quot;; the red-shanked carder bee, &quot;Bombus ruderarius&quot;; the shrill carder bee, &quot;Bombus sylvarum&quot;; the brown-banded carder bee, &quot;Bombus humilis&quot; and the moss carder bee, &quot;Bombus muscorum&quot;.

The world&#x27;s first bumblebee sanctuary was established at Vane Farm in the Loch Leven National Nature Reserve in Scotland in 2008. In 2011, London&#x27;s Natural History Museum led the establishment of an International Union for Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria.

Bumblebee conservation is in its infancy in many parts of the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.

===Misconception about flight===


According to 20th-century folklore, the laws of aerodynamics prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight, as it does not have the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.

The origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. 

In later years, McMasters backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book &quot;&quot; by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible, but &quot;One shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the results of the calculations don&#x27;t square with reality&quot;. The following passage appears in the introduction to &quot;Le Vol des Insectes&quot;:

Magnan refers to his assistant André Sainte-Laguë. 

Some credit physicist Ludwig Prandtl (1875–1953) of the University of Göttingen in Germany with popularizing the idea. Others say Swiss gas dynamicist Jakob Ackeret (1898–1981) did the calculations.

The calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.

Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics, has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.

===In music and literature===
The orchestral interlude &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; was composed (c. 1900) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;, although the music may reflect the flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee. The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical &quot;Fantasia&quot; and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of the theater. This early attempt at &quot;surround sound&quot; was excluded from the film in later showings.

In 1599, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, someone, possibly Tailboys Dymoke, published &quot;Caltha Poetarum: Or The Bumble Bee&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;T. Cutwode&quot;. This was one of nine books censored under the Bishops&#x27; Ban issued by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft.
Emily Dickinson made a bumblebee the subject of her parody of Isaac Watts&#x27;s well-known poem about honeybees, &quot;How Doth the Little Busy Bee&quot; (1715). Where Watts wrote &quot;How skilfully she builds her cell! How neat she spreads the wax!&quot;, Dickinson&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Bumble-Bee&#x27;s Religion&quot; (1881), begins &quot;His little Hearse-like Figure / Unto itself a Dirge / To a delusive Lilac / The vanity divulge / Of Industry and Morals / And every righteous thing / For the divine Perdition / of Idleness and Spring.&quot; The letter was said to have enclosed a dead bee.

In 1847, Ralph Waldo Emerson published his poem &quot;&quot;.

The entomologist Otto Plath wrote &quot;Bumblebees and Their Ways&quot; in 1934. His daughter, the poet Sylvia Plath, wrote a group of poems about bees late in 1962, within four months of her suicide, transforming her father&#x27;s interest into her poetry.
The scientist and illustrator Moses Harris (1731–1785) painted accurate watercolour drawings of bumblebees in his &quot;An Exposition of English Insects Including the Several Classes of Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, &amp; Diptera, or Bees, Flies, &amp; Libellulae (1776–80)&quot;.

Bumblebees appear as characters, often eponymously, in children&#x27;s books. The surname Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) is an old name for bumblebee. J. K. Rowling said the name &quot;seemed to suit the headmaster, because one of his passions is music and I imagined him walking around humming to himself&quot;. J. R. R. Tolkien, in his poem &quot;Errantry&quot;, also used the name Dumbledor, but for a large bee-like creature.

Among the many books for younger children are &quot;Bumble the Bee&quot; by Yvon Douran and Tony Neal (2014); &quot;Bertie Bumble Bee&quot; by K. I. Al-Ghani (2012); &quot;Ben the Bumble Bee: How do bees make honey?&quot; by Romessa Awadalla (2015); &quot;Bumble Bee Bob Has a Big Butt&quot; by Papa Campbell (2012); &quot;Buzz, Buzz, Buzz! Went Bumble-bee&quot; by Colin West (1997); &quot;Bumble Bee&quot; by Margaret Wise Brown (2000); &quot;How the Bumble Came to Bee&quot; by Paul and Ella Quarry (2012); &quot;The Adventures of Professor Bumble and the Bumble Bees&quot; by Stephen Brailovsky (2010). Among Beatrix Potter&#x27;s &quot;little books&quot;, Babbity Bumble and other members of her nest appear in &quot;The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse&quot; (1910).
