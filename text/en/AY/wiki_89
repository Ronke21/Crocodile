<text>The Haijby scandal (&quot;Haijbyaffären&quot;) was a political affair in Sweden in the 1950s, involving the conviction and imprisonment of restaurateur Kurt Haijby for the supposed blackmail of King Gustaf V. Haijby claimed that he had a secret homosexual relationship with the King in the 1930s.

== Background ==
Kurt Haijby was born in Stockholm in 1897 as Kurt Johansson, and died there in 1965. His father was a wine merchant and a fishmonger by appointment to the Royal Court. In 1912, while selling &quot;majblomma&quot; charity pins, Kurt and another boy scout were granted an audience with King Gustaf V of Sweden.

Johansson later worked as a waiter, clerk, actor, and illusionist. He was convicted to hard labour six times for several cases of theft and fraud between 1915 and 1925. While trying to escape prison in 1923 he fatally shot a police officer, being convicted of manslaughter after successfully convincing the court he was about to commit suicide and hit the policeman by accident. Once released, Johansson changed his name to Haijby and spent a nomadic life in France and the United States.

In 1931, Haijby opened a restaurant with his second wife Anna, a widow ten years his senior. Being a convicted criminal, he could not acquire a license needed to sell wine and liquor, which severely set back his business. He applied to the King - an archaic possibility stemming from now-defunct royal absolutism, but a legal possibility of last appeal (akin to an appeal to the privy council in the Commonwealth) - and was granted an audience in 1933 to put forward his case. During this royal audience, King Gustav V, a 75-year-old widower, allegedly seduced Haijby.

Haijby&#x27;s wife, on learning about the recurrent meetings in 1936, filed for divorce, citing her husband&#x27;s homosexual relationship with the King as cause for divorce. Fearing the allegations would become public knowledge, officials of the Royal Court convinced the couple to settle for an amicable no-fault divorce and separation by paying Anna Haijby 15,000 kronor. Despite their legal separation, the couple continued to live together until her death. According to a report, the King said to his Court Superintendent: &quot;There must not be a scandal, but do it with as little money as possible&quot;.

Haijby was given 1,500 kronor by the Royal Court lawyers and encouraged to emigrate to the United States, where he was promised an additional 3,000 kronor to start a new life. Haijby claimed that, upon arrival in the US, there was no money for him. He eventually returned to Sweden where he once again asked for support from the Royal Court.

For several years, money from the Court financed a number of Haijby&#x27;s failed enterprises, including a coffee store and a boarding house at the Trystorp estate. There is no evidence of outright blackmail on Haijby&#x27;s part, but it can be argued that the Court was attempting to buy his silence. In all, Haijby received 170,000 Swedish kronor (equivalent to kronor in 2009) from the Court and perhaps much more from the King&#x27;s private funds.

Haijby would ultimately claim that he was King Gustaf&#x27;s lover in the years between 1936 and 1947.

In 1938 Haijby was arrested for child sexual abuse of an 11-year old and a 13-year-old boy and put in custody at the asylum of Beckomberga. This was the result of political pressure from the Governor of Stockholm, Torsten Nothin. The psychiatrist in charge of the asylum did not believe that Haijby was in need of psychiatric care and he was eventually discharged. The child abuse case was never brought to a criminal court.

In 1939, a new deal was arranged in which Haijby was forced to emigrate to Germany, then under rule by the Nazis, who engaged in intense suppression of homosexual conduct. After a short while in Berlin, he was put in prison by the Gestapo, probably by request of the Swedish Court, officially after molesting a hotel bellboy. Unlike most Gestapo prisoners, Haijby was not tortured and, most of the time, kept in decent conditions. Charges were then brought against him for sexual relations with two young boys under Paragraph 175, and he was sentenced to prison and banished to Sweden in 1940, having served his sentence.

Once reunited with his ex-wife, who gave him a grant using a police officer as a middleman, Haijby was made to believe that the money came from the Court. Haijby was, allegedly because of pressure from the court, committed to an asylum in 1941.

In the meantime, another scandal, the Kejne affair, had broken in the press where celebrity author and journalist Vilhelm Moberg wrote lengthy articles about homosexual conspiracies among Swedish officials. 

In 1947, Haijby used his own money to publish a roman à clef, detailing his ostensible relationship with the King. Half of the first printing of 1,000 copies was bought by the Chief Constable, funded by the Royal Court. Haijby&#x27;s ex-wife Anna bought the remainder.

== The scandal ==

Haijby reported his forced detention in the asylum at Beckomberga to the Attorney General of Sweden. These papers were immediately classified but were smuggled out of the Attorney General&#x27;s office by Vilhelm Moberg, and the whole affair thus came to public attention. The actions of officials to suppress the claims caused acrimonious debate in parliament and the media. As a consequence, the criminal court charged Haijby for acts of blackmail.

In 1952, after a dubiously held trial, Haijby was sentenced to eight years of hard labour for blackmail under aggravated circumstances, which in 1953 was reduced to six years by the Svea Court of Appeal.

After the death of King Gustav V in 1950, the confiscated roman à clef was re-distributed in 1952 and was reprinted in 1979.

Haijby had reported the treatment he had received to the Swedish Chancellor of Justice. The results of the investigations, the bulk of which were classified until 2002, effectively acquitted the monarchy. There is nothing to support the claim that Haijby was seduced by the King as a 14-year-old boy, but most commentators believe that he had a sexual relationship with the King in the 1930s. Haijby committed suicide in 1965, one year after the death of Anna Haijby.

However, the fact that the Swedish Court was prepared to pay Haijby such large sums to suppress his accusations has by some been taken as evidence that they were true. Later, several servants at the Royal Court, among them a male servant and chauffeurs, claimed that they were given money to keep quiet concerning their own intimate contacts with the King.

<text>: &quot;For the film formats associated with the &quot;Instamatic&quot; and &quot;Pocket Instamatic&quot; camera ranges, see 126 film and 110 film respectively.&quot;

The Instamatic is a series of inexpensive, easy-to-load 126 and 110 cameras made by Kodak beginning in 1963. The Instamatic was immensely successful, introducing a generation to low-cost photography and spawning numerous imitators.

During its heyday, the range was so ubiquitous that the Instamatic name is still frequently used as a generic trademark to refer to any inexpensive point-and-shoot camera. It is also frequently used incorrectly to describe Kodak&#x27;s &quot;Kodamatic&quot; line of instant-picture cameras.

Kodak also used the Instamatic name on some Super 8-based home-cine cameras.

==History==
Market research which showed that most consumers would be happier with more automated film loading and exposure settings led Kodak to develop the Instamatic cameras starting in the early 1950s under project &quot;Easy Load&quot;, later updated to &quot;Project 13&quot;. A. D. Johnson, manager of advertising, is credited with coining the name Instamatic. In a 1993 article speculating about the potential details of what would eventually be released as the Advanced Photo System, Herbert Keppler noted that &quot;many snapshooters didn&#x27;t buy cameras or take pictures because they simply couldn&#x27;t load rollfilm or 35mm cameras. [...] Kodak&#x27;s Kodapak 126 35mm cartridge, introduced in 1963, solved the problems of film loading, film advance, and rewinding. [...] It was a sensational success among snapshooters.&quot;

===Early Instamatics===

The lead designer for the Instamatic program was Dean M. Peterson (original design by Alexander Gow), also later known for most of the innovations in the point-and-shoot camera revolution of the 1980s. They were the first cameras to use Kodak&#x27;s new 126 format. The easy-load film cartridge made the cameras very inexpensive to produce, as it provided the film backing plate and exposure counter itself and thus saved considerable design complexity and manufacturing cost for the cameras. Kodak sold various print and slide films in the 126 format.

The first Instamatic to be released was the Instamatic 50, which appeared in the UK in February 1963. The first model released in the US was the basic Instamatic 100, approximately one month later, which included a built-in flashgun for single-use AG-1 &quot;peanut&quot; bulbs, a feature lacking in the 50. With non-adjustable aperture, focus, and shutter speed ( sec.), it continued in the tradition of Kodak&#x27;s earlier Brownie cameras, providing a simple snapshot camera anyone could use, with the added convenience of drop-in loading using &quot;Kodapak&quot; cartridges. These were offered initially with one of four preloaded films: Verichrome Pan, Kodachrome-X, Kodacolor-X, and Ektacolor-X.

The first Instamatics went on sale for $16 in early 1963 and were soon followed by the 300 (which had a light meter), the 400 (which had a light meter and a spring driven film advance), and the 700 (which had a light meter and adjustable focus and shutter speeds). Early fixed-focus Instamatics used either a 43 mm plastic lens or a 41 mm &quot;Kodar&quot; glass lens; the 700 was equipped with a marginally wider and much faster 38 mm &quot;Ektar&quot;/&quot;Ektanar&quot; lens. The final digit in the model designation (e.g., 100 or 104) refers to the type of flash used: models ending in 0 had a built-in flashgun, while those ending in 4 (introduced in 1965) used flashcubes.
The lineup was soon expanded to include a variety of models from the basic but popular 100/104 to the automatic exposure 800/804, which featured an aluminum chassis, rangefinder, selenium light meter, and clockwork spring wind. The best model made in the USA was the 814, which had a four-element lens and a coupled range-finder. The top-of-the-line model was the Instamatic Reflex (1969), a single-lens reflex camera which was made in Germany and could accept a variety of Retina S-mount lenses. Some German-built Instamatic cameras such as the 250 and 500 included fixed lenses made by Rodenstock and Schneider Kreuznach.

===Commercial success===

The Instamatic was an instant success; more than 50 million Instamatic cameras were produced between 1963 and 1970. Kodak even gave away a considerable number in a joint promotion with Scott paper towels in the early 1970s to generate many new photographers and stimulate lasting demand for its film business.

Many other manufacturers attempted to capitalize on the popularity of the Instamatic with their own 126 cameras, including Canon, Olympus, Minolta, Ricoh, Zeiss Ikon, and even Rollei. Some of these models were far more sophisticated and expensive than the majority of the Kodak cameras: the Rollei SL26, for instance, featured interchangeable lenses (28mm, 40mm, and 80mm), TTL metering, and a rangefinder, and retailed for $300.

A new series of Instamatics was introduced in 1970 to take advantage of the new Magicube flash technology. Magicubes used mechanically triggered pyrotechnic detonators for each bulb, eliminating the need to carry batteries. Instamatics with Magicube sockets were denoted by an &quot;X&quot; in the model number (e.g. X-15 or 55X).

===Pocket Instamatic (110 format) ===

In 1972, Kodak introduced the Pocket Instamatic series for its new 110 format. The 110 cartridge had the same easy-load cartridge design with an integral take-up spool as the 126 format, but was much smaller, allowing the cameras to be very compact (hence the &quot;Pocket&quot; designation). Many cameras carry a four-character date code inside the film compartment or on the door.

At launch in the United States, there were five models: in ascending order of sophistication, the Pocket Instamatic 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60. The top-of-the-line model was the Pocket Instamatic 60, which featured a stainless steel body, rangefinder, and automatic exposure with a four-element 26 mm &quot;Ektar&quot; lens. Programmed autoexposure selected an appropriate combination of aperture, with shutter speeds ranging from to 10 seconds. The 50 shared the same lens and autoexposure system, but dropped the rangefinder for scale focusing. The 40 had a much slower 25 mm three-element lens and two-position focusing, and the 30 had an even slower 25 mm fixed-focus lens; both carried a similar programmed autoexposure system. The 20 shared the same 25 mm fixed-focus lens as the 30 and offered a single shutter speed of second, which automatically changed to when a flashcube was inserted. An entry-level Pocket Instamatic 10 was launched by 1973, with a fixed-focus 25 mm lens and operation similar to the 20.
By 1977, the initial lineup had been replaced by the &quot;Trimlite Instamatic&quot; and &quot;Tele-Instamatic&quot; lines for the United States. The Trimlite Instamatic 48 was a rebadged Pocket Instamatic 60, carrying the same features as the previous top-line model, and other Trimlites included the 38 (similar to the Pocket 40), 28 (Pocket 30), and 18 (Pocket 10). The Tele-Instamatics featured a sliding teleconverter switch. That line included the 708, which offered a new &quot;multi-element&quot; (three-element 25 mm or four-element 43 mm) lens with scale focusing and programmed autoexposure, similar to the prior Pocket 50, and the 608, which switched the single-element lens from 25 mm to 43 mm, both , with a fixed shutter speed similar to the prior Pocket 20; engaging the teleconverter also would switch the viewfinder.

Kodak introduced a mass-produced aspheric lens for still photography in October 1978 with the &quot;Ektramax&quot; 110 camera. The lens is a four-element, 25 mm design with scale focusing. Three of the elements, including the aspheric one, are molded plastic.

Over 25 million Pocket Instamatics were produced in under three years, and the 110 format remained popular into the 1990s. However, the small negative size (13×17 mm) limited quality when using the film emulsion of the period; in practice, most prints were small, so the poor quality was not apparent unless the prints were enlarged beyond postcard size.

===Mid-1970s to late 1980s===

In 1976, the Instamatic X line was updated for use with the new Flipflash system. These cameras were designated by the addition of the suffix &quot;F&quot; to the model number of the corresponding Magicube model. The basic X-15F was the last Instamatic sold in the United States, remaining on sale until 1988.

===Contemporary influence===

In 1984, &quot;Photo Session&quot;, a group of four bronze statues created by J. Seward Johnson, Jr., was installed in Queen Elizabeth Park of Vancouver, British Columbia. The statues depict three people posing in front of a mountainous backdrop, with a fourth photographing the group using an Instamatic X-35. One of the three statues posing for the photograph was stolen in June 2008; it was recovered without damage two months later.

Hipstamatic, an automated photograph post-processing application for mobile devices released in 2009, used an interface inspired by the Instamatic to produce similar toy camera-like images and was meant to evoke &quot;a simpler-is-better past, an age where cheap, mass-produced plastic cameras were built to last&quot;. It was named as one of the top iPhone application &quot;award winners&quot; by Apple in 2010. A few years later, the Instagram social media network included filters &quot;designed to make digital photographs look like snapshots taken with the toy cameras of yesteryear: the Kodak Brownie, the Instamatic, the Polaroid&quot;. The simple, geometric physical Instamatic camera design and square image format captured on 126 film directly inspired the updated Instagram logo and aesthetic. Like Hipstamatic, Instagram was named the &quot;iPhone App Of The Year&quot; by Apple in 2011. The two services were combined by &quot;Slate&quot; in 2012 as the inadvertently circular portmanteau Instamatic.

<text>Jharkhand (; ; ) is a state in eastern India. The state shares its border with the states of West Bengal to the east, Chhattisgarh to the west, Uttar Pradesh to the northwest, Bihar to the north and Odisha to the south. It is the 15th largest state by area, and the 14th largest by population. Hindi is the official language of the state. The city of Ranchi is its capital and Dumka its sub-capital. The state is known for its waterfalls, hills and holy places; Baidyanath Dham, Parasnath, Dewri and Rajrappa are major religious sites. Jharkhand is primarily rural, with about 24% of its population living in cities as of 2011.

Jharkhand suffers from what is sometimes termed a resource curse: it accounts for more than 40% of India&#x27;s mineral production but 39.1% of its population is below the poverty line and 19.6% of children under five years of age are malnourished.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot;Jhar&quot; means &#x27;forest&#x27; and &quot;&quot;Khand&quot; means &#x27;land&#x27; in various Indo-Aryan languages. Thus &quot;Jharkhand&quot; means &quot;forest land&quot;.

In the ancient period, in the Mahabharata, the region was referred as Kark Khand due to location near Kark Rekha, that is, Tropic of Cancer. During the Medieval period, the region was known as &quot;Jharkhand&quot;. According to Bhavishya Purana (1200 CE), Jharkhand was one of the seven Pundra desa. The name is first found on a 13th-century copper plate in Kendrapada, Odisha region from the reign of Narasimha Deva II of Eastern Ganga dynasty. Forest land from Baidhnath dham to Puri was known as Jharkhand. In Akbarnama, from Panchet in the east to Ratanpur to west, Rohtasgarh to the north and the frontier of Odisha to the south was known as Jharkhand.

==History==
===Ancient period===
The region has been inhabited since the Mesolithic-Chalcolithic period, as shown by several ancient cave paintings. 
Stone tools have been discovered from Chota Nagpur Plateau region which are from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district which are from Meso-chalcolithic period (9000–5000 BCE). During 2nd millennium BCE the use of Copper tools spread in Chota Nagpur Plateau and these find complexes are known as the Copper Hoard Culture. In the Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of the Son and North Koel rivers in Palamu district various antiquities and art objects have been found which are from the Neolithic to the medieval period and pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to the late medieval period. Several iron slags, microliths, and potsherds have been discovered from Singhbhum district that are from 1400 BCE according to carbon dating age. The region was ruled by many empires and dynasties including Nanda, Maurya and Gupta during ancient period.

In the Mahabharata, the region was referred as Kark Khand due to its location near Tropic of Cancer. During the age of Mahajanpadas around 500 BCE, Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha and Anga. In the Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states were subdued and were forced to accept the hegemony of the Maurya empire during Ashoka&#x27;s reign (c. 232 BCE). In the ancient site of Saridkel, burnt brick houses, red ware pottery, copper tools, coins and iron tools have been found which belong to the early centuries CE. Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Khunti district which are from the 3rd century BCE. Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chotanagpur region (North and South), directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley.

===Medieval period===
In the 7th century, the Chinese traveller Xuanzang passed through the region. He described the kingdom as Karnasuvarna, with Shashanka as its ruler. To the north of Karn-Suberna was Magadha, Champa was in the east, Mahendra in the west, and Orissa in the south.

During the medieval period, the region was governed by Nagvanshi, Pala, Khayaravala, Ramgarh Raj and Chero rulers. A Buddhist monastery has been found in Hazaribagh which was built during the Pala period in the 10th century. Bhim Karn was a Nagvanshi king during medieval period. He defeated the Raksel dynasty of Surguja when they invaded the region with cavalry.
===Modern period===
Mughal influence reached Palamu during the reign of Emperor Akbar when it was conquered by Rajput Raja Mansingh in 1574. Several invasions took place during Mughal rule. During the reign of the Nagvanshi King Madhu Singh, Akbar&#x27;s general invaded Khukhra. Also there was an invasion during the reign of Durjan Shah.

King Ram Shah ruled Navratangarh from 1640 to 1663. He built the Kapilnath Temple in 1643. He was succeeded by his son Raghunath Shah. Thakur Ani Nath Shahdeo built the Jagannath temple of Ranchi in 1691. The King Medini Ray ruled from 1658 to 1674 in Palamu. His rule extended to areas in South Gaya and Hazaribagh. He attacked Navratangarh and defeated the Nagvanshi Maharaja of Chhotanagpur. Chero rule in the Palamu region lasted until the 19th century until internal conflict between various factions weakened the Cheros and they were defeated by the East India Company. Later Palamu estates were sold by the British.

During the 18th century, regions under the Kings of the Chero dynasty, Nagvanshi dynasty, Ramgarh and Kharagdiha became parts of territories of East India Company. Ramgarh Raj along with estates of other chiefs in the regions were permanently settled as Zamindari estates. The Kharagdiha Rajas were settled as Rajas of Raj Dhanwar in 1809, and the Kharagdiha gadis were separately settled as zamindari estates. Some of the notable Kharagdiha Zamindari estates were Koderma, Gadi Palganj and Ledo Gadi. The princely states in the Chota Nagpur Plateau came within the sphere of influence of the Maratha Empire, but they became tributary states of British East India Company as a result of the Anglo-Maratha Wars and became known as Chota Nagpur Tributary States.

Subjugation, colonisation and imposition of taxes by the British East India Company resulted in spontaneous resistance from the local people. Chuar Rebellion, the first revolt against the British East India Company led by Jagannath Singh Patar in 1767 with the Bhumij tribals. The Bhumijes again revolted in 1769–71, led by their Sardar Ghatwals in Dhalbhum. In 1769, Raghunath Mahato also revolted against the British East India Company (EIC).

In 1771, the revolt against the landlords and the British government was led by Tilka Majhi, a Paharia leader in Rajmahal Hills. Soon after in 1779, the Bhumij tribes again rose in arms against the British rule in Manbhum, called the Chuar Rebellion. In 1807, the Oraons in Barway murdered their landlord from Srinagar. The Munda tribe rose in revolt in 1811 and 1813. Bakhtar Say and Mundal Singh, two landowners, fought against the British East India Company in 1812.

The Hos in Singhbhum revolted in 1820 and a Kol revolt occurred in 1832. Also in 1832 the Bhumijs revolted again against the British, this time under the leadership of Ganga Narayan Singh, known as the Bhumij Rebellion. During the 19th century, large numbers of santals from Manbhum, Hazaribagh, Midnapore were settled by British in Damin-i-koh to cultivate the land and generate revenue. But the Santal revolted against tax imposition.
The Santhal rebellion broke out in 1855 under the leadership of two brothers Sidhu and Kanhu. Later the British renamed it as Santal Pargana.
Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and Pandey Ganpat Rai rebelled against the British East India Company in the 1857 rebellion. In the Battle of Chatra, conflict took place between the rebels and the East India company. Tikait Umrao Singh, Sheikh Bhikhari, Nadir Ali and Jai Mangal Singh played pivotal role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The brothers Nilambar and Pitambar were chiefs of Bhogta clan of the Kharwar tribe who held ancestral jagirs with many Chero Jagirdars and led revolt against the British East India company.

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria, who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India. The Cheros and Kharwars again rebelled against the British in 1882 but the attack was repulsed. Then Birsa Munda revolt, broke out in 1895 and lasted until 1900. The revolt though mainly concentrated in the Munda belt of Khunti, Tamar, Sarwada and Bandgaon.

In October 1905, the exercise of British influence over the predominantly Hindi-speaking states of Chang Bhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surguja, and Udaipur was transferred from the Bengal government to that of the Central Provinces, while the two Oriya-speaking states of Gangpur and Bonai were attached to the Orissa Tributary States, leaving only Kharsawan and Saraikela answerable to the Bengal governor.

In 1936, all nine states were transferred to the Eastern States Agency, the officials of which came under the direct authority of the Governor-General of India, rather than under that of any provinces.

In March 1940, the INC 53rd Session occurred under the presidency of Maulana Azad at Jhanda Chowk, Ramgarh, which is now Ramgarh Cantonment. Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Acharya J.B. Kripalani, Industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj and other great leaders of the Indian freedom movement attended the Ramgarh Session. Mahatma Gandhi also opened the Khadi and Village Industries Exhibition at Ramgarh.

At that time, under the leadership of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose a conference against Samjhauta was also completed. In Ramgarh, Subhas Chandra Bose was seen as president of the All India Forward Block and M. N. Roy was seen as leader of the Radical democratic party.
===Post Independence===
After Indian independence in 1947, the rulers of many states chose to accede to the Dominion of India. Changbhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surguja and Udaipur after that became part of the state of Madhya Pradesh, but Gangpur and Bonai became part of the state of Orissa and Kharsawan and Saraikela became part of the state of Bihar. In 1928, a separate state was demanded by &quot;Unnati Samaj&quot;, the political wing of the Christian Tribals Association, which submitted a memorandum to the Simon Commission to constitute a tribal state in eastern India. Prominent leaders like Jaipal Singh Munda and Ram Narayan Singh also demanded a separate state. In 1955, the Jharkhand Party, led by Jaipal Singh Munda, submitted a memorandum to the States Reorganization Commission for a separate Jharkhand state comprising the tribal area of South Bihar, but it was rejected because there were many languages, no link language in the region, tribals were in the minority, Hindustani was the majority language, and it risked adverse effect on the economy of Bihar.

Later the Sadan people, the native various caste/non-tribal groups, also joined the movement for a separate state. In 1972, Binod Bihari Mahato, Shibu Soren and A. K. Roy founded Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Nirmal Mahto founded the All Jharkhand Students Union. They led the movement for a separate state of Jharkhand. The Jharkhand coordination committee (JCC), consisting of Ram Dayal Munda, B. P. Keshri, Binod Bihari Mahato, Santosh Rana and Suraj Singh Besra started a new initiative and tried to coordinate between different parties. Keshri sent a memorandum to form Jharkhand state in 1988. The Jharkhand co-ordination committee was then led by Congress General Secretary Ram Ratan Ram, who urged Rajiv Gandhi to pay attention to the issue at hand. 

In July 1988, the Bharatiya Janata party led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi decided to demand a separate state, Vanachal, comprising the forest region of South Bihar in Jamshedpur. Inder Singh Namdhari, Samresh Singh, and Rudra Pratap Sarangi were the leaders of the Vanachal movement. They organised several rallies to form a separate state.

The central government formed a committee on the Jharkhand matter in 1989. It stressed the need for greater allocation of development funds for the area. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of Assam. Other tribal areas were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and Santal Pargana development boards were constituted under the chairmanship of the then chief minister of Bihar under the provision of the fifth schedule in 1972. This failed to achieve the desired result. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha wanted more representation and the All Jharkhand Students Union was against it. Due to differences these parties broke away from each other. The All Jharkhand Students Union introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for a boycott of election while Jharkhand Mukti Morcha opposed this. The Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council bill passed in Bihar&#x27;s legislative assembly in December 1994. The Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council were given responsibility for forty areas including agriculture, rural health, public work, public health and minerals. The council has power to recommend legislation to the Assembly through the state government and to frame bylaws and regulations.

In 1998, when the separate state movement was falling apart, Justice Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo was leading the movement. In 1998, the Union government decided to send the bill concerning the formation of the state of Jharkhand to the Bihar Legislative Assembly to which Lalu Prasad Yadav had said that the state would be divided over his dead body. A total of 16 political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the All Jharkhand Students Union, and the Congress came in one platform and formed the &#x27;All Party Separate State Formation Committee&#x27; to start the movement. Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee. Voting on the Jharkhand Act was to be done on 21 September 1998 in the Bihar legislature. On that day the committee, under the leadership of Shahdeo called for Jharkhand Bandh and organised a protest march. Thousands of supporters of a separate state took to the streets led by Shahdeo. He was arrested and detained in a police station for hours along with many supporters.

In 1999 the Bharatiya Janata party promised to form a separate Vanachal state if they won the state election with a majority of votes. After the last Assembly election in the state resulted in a hung assembly, RJD&#x27;s dependence on the Congress extended support on the precondition that RJD would not pose a hurdle to the passage of the Bihar reorganisation Bill. Finally, with the support from both RJD and Congress, the ruling coalition at the Centre led by the Bharatiya Janata Party which had made statehood its main poll plank in the region in successive polls earlier, cleared the Bihar reorganisation Bill in the monsoon session of the Parliament on 2 and 11 August in Loksabha and Rajyasabha. This paved the way for the creation of a separate Vanachal state comprising the Chota Nagpur Division and Santhal Pargana Division of South Bihar. NDA formed the government with Babulal Marandi as chief minister. Later the name of the state was changed from Vanachal to Jharkhand. Babulal Marandi took the oath of chief minister on 15 November 2000 on the anniversary of the birth of tribal leader Birsa Munda.

===Jharkhand statehood===
The dynamics of resources and the politics of development still influence the socio-economic structures in Jharkhand, which was carved out of the relatively underdeveloped southern part of Bihar. According to the 1991 census, the state has a population of over 20 million out of which 28% is tribal while 12% of the people belong to scheduled castes. Jharkhand has 24 districts, 260 blocks, and 32,620 villages out of which only 45% have access to electricity while only 8,484 are connected by roads. Jharkhand is the leading producer of mineral wealth in the country after Chhattisgarh state, endowed as it is with a vast variety of minerals like iron ore, coal, copper ore, mica, bauxite, graphite, limestone, and uranium. Jharkhand is also known for its vast forest resources.

===Naxal insurgency===

Jharkhand has been at the centre of the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency. Since the uprising of the Naxalites in 1967, 6,000 people have been killed in fighting between the Naxalites and counter-insurgency operations by the police, and its paramilitary groups such as the Salwa Judum.

Despite having a presence in almost 7.80% of India&#x27;s geographical area (home to 5.50% of India&#x27;s population), the state of Jharkhand is part of the &quot;Red Corridor&quot; comprising 92,000 square kilometres, where the highest concentration of the groups estimated 20,000 combatants fight. Part of this is due to the fact that the state harbours an abundance of natural resources, while its people live in abject poverty and destitution. The impoverished state provides ample recruits for communist insurgents, who argue that they are fighting on behalf of the landless poor and tribals that see few benefits from the resource extractions. As the federal government holds a monopoly on sub-surface resources in the state, the tribal population is prevented from staking any claim on the resources extracted from their land. In response, the insurgents have recently begun a campaign of targeting infrastructure related to the extraction of resources vital for Indian energy needs, such as coal.

On 5 March 2007, Sunil Mahato, a member of the national parliament, was shot dead by Naxalite rebels near Kishanpur while watching a football match on the Hindu festival of Holi. His widow, Suman Mahato, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha candidate, won the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha by-election in September 2007 and served in parliament until 2009.

European Mental Hospital was established along with Indian Mental Hospital. Today they are called Central Institute of Psychiatry and Ranchi Institute of Neuro-psychiatry and Allied Sciences respectively.
In certain areas of Jharkhand, poverty and consequent malnutrition have given rise to diseases like tuberculosis (TB). In fact, TB has assumed epidemic proportions in certain areas of the state. For management and treatment of such TB, Itki TB Sanatorium, Ranchi, established in 1928 has been doing work as a premier institute for clinical and programmatic management of TB. The Itki TB Sanatorium is well equipped and accredited by the Indian government for quality assurance and Culture and Drug Sensitivity Testing for M.TB. It provides free of cost treatment for TB as well as drug-resistant TB. Likewise, in the field of treatment of cancer, Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur, is rendering pioneering work. In the same way, Bokaro General Hospital equipped with modern facilities for the treatment of cancer and heart-related problems with the capacity of 1100 beds one of the largest in eastern India.

Fluoride in groundwater presents a public health problem in Jharkhand. A recent survey led by the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi in collaboration with UNICEF in the northwest districts of Palamau and Garhwa found fluoride levels above the drinking WHO drinking water guidelines. Excessive amounts of fluoride in drinking water can lead to dental fluorosis, prevalent bone fractures, and skeletal fluorosis, an irreversible disabling condition. Some work has focused on combating fluorosis through increased calcium intake by consuming local plants. Researchers at Princeton University and the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi are currently investigating defluoridation options, while performing an epidemiological survey to assess the extent of fluoride linked health problems and the impact of future interventions.

Almost 80% of Jharkhand&#x27;s people are farmers, although it contains 40% of India&#x27;s mineral reserves it has some of India&#x27;s poorest people, in Summer 2009 the state was threatened by drought, with people criticising the government for not providing food aid or assistance.

<text>The Kejne affair was a political affair in Sweden in the 1950s.

In 1948, Karl-Erik Kejne (1913–60), a Swedish Lutheran pastor, publicly accused groups of gay men of threatening him and making attempts on his life. This occurred after he had tried to put an end to gay prostitution in Stockholm, Sweden. In March 1950, Kejne published a sensationalist article in the newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; claiming that the prostitution of underage boys was rampant in the working class districts of Stockholm, being patronised by wealthy and well connected gay men whom the police did not dare arrest. 

This theme was quickly picked up by several evening papers, and reached the proportions of a witch-hunt. There was widespread belief in Kejne&#x27;s conspiracy theory about a &quot;homosexual mafia&quot;, supposedly controlling several criminal gangs of gay men. When a commission was appointed to examine Kejne&#x27;s allegations, he accused the commission of being infiltrated by the same &quot;homosexual mafia&quot;, leading to a new commission, presumably made of straight men, to investigate the first commission.    

Kejne accused the attorney of corruption, specifically by order of Cabinet minister Nils Quensel. Kejne claimed that Quensel was involved in the groups himself. Kejne also claimed that Quensel ordered the police to send infiltrators posing as gay men to his house, in order to prove that Kejne was himself gay. Homosexuality had been decriminalized in Sweden in 1944.

A commission was formed to address these issues. In 1951, when they could not clear Quensel of all charges, he chose to resign as a Cabinet minister.

The author Vilhelm Moberg wrote at length about the Kejne affair, and also brought the Haijby affair to public knowledge.

<doc id="197227" wikidata="Q335449" url="?curid=197227" title="James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan">
<text>Lieutenant-General James Thomas Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan (16 October 1797 – 28 March 1868), styled as Lord Cardigan, was an officer in the British Army who commanded the Light Brigade during the Crimean War, leading its charge at the Battle of Balaclava.

Throughout his life in politics and his long military career, Brudenell characterised the arrogant and extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but also by generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As a member of the landed gentry, he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain but, in the last year of his life, he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.
==Biography==
===Early life===

James Brudenell was born in what was, by the standards of the Brudenell family, a modest manor house at Hambleden, Buckinghamshire to Robert Brudenell and his wife Penelope Brudenell, Countess of Cardigan. In February 1811 his father inherited the Cardigan earldom, along with the immense estates and revenues that went with it, and the family seat of Deene Park, Northamptonshire. James accordingly became &quot;Lord Brudenell&quot;, and took up residence in one of the grandest of households, at the age of fourteen.

He was educated at Harrow where, notwithstanding the fears of his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fistfight, his father removed him from the school (fistfights were tolerated at Harrow; it was the fact of Brudenell&#x27;s receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon which had annoyed the earl). He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This has been seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.

Brudenell was a fine rider and, inspired by the decisive role of cavalry at the battle of Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, would not allow this. Instead in November 1815, he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.

===Parliamentary career===
In February 1818, during his last term at Oxford, and again following his father&#x27;s wishes, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough, a pocket borough owned by his cousin Charles, Marquess of Ailesbury. The intention was to give Brudenell a grounding in parliamentary affairs before, eventually, he would take his place in the House of Lords.

Brudenell&#x27;s first action on leaving Oxford was not to take his parliamentary seat but, as was traditional for wealthy young men of the time, to take the Grand Tour. His itinerary, with Russia and Sweden included, was more extensive than the traditional destinations of France and Italy. The trip allowed Brudenell to enjoy the full pleasures of both cultural and social opportunities afforded by the countries he visited.

On his return, Brudenell took his seat in the House of Commons, on the ruling, Tory, side of the House. His contribution to government was minimal: he served with parliamentarians, such as Canning, Peel and Castlereagh, of great commitment and intellect and he could offer nothing to compete. On one issue, however, he made a stand. In 1829 his party introduced a bill allowing limited Catholic emancipation but his patron, cousin Ailesbury, instructed him to oppose it. In three crucial votes Brudenell abstained, because of his admiration for Wellington, the bill&#x27;s sponsor, and in consequence Ailesbury required him to give up the seat.

His return to parliament in 1830 cost him dearly. After his earlier disobedience, he could not expect to be handed a pocket borough so, instead, he had to buy his own. He was elected member for Fowey, Cornwall, at a cost of at least £5,000 (). The money, however, was not well spent. Only two years later the seat was one of those abolished in the Reform Act 1832, designed to do away with such malpractices. He sought instead the newly created constituency of Northamptonshire North, local to the family seat of Deene Park but, despite holding the advantage that many of the electors were dependent on the family&#x27;s patronage and goodwill, the campaign did not go smoothly. On 12 September in Wellingborough he was beaten up and &quot;considerabl[y]&quot; injured while campaigning. As a precaution he distributed about £20,000 () among the electorate and the seat was won, albeit as &quot;junior member&quot; to his Whig rival.

He was serving with his regiment in India in 1837 and did not seek re-election at the general election that year; a few days after it took place he inherited the earldom from his father, together with the extensive family estates, including Deene Park.

===Marriages===
Early in the 1820s, Brudenell met Mrs. Elizabeth Tollemache Johnstone (8 December 1797 – 15 July 1858). Her husband, Lt.-Col. Christian Johnstone, had been a friend of Cardigan&#x27;s since childhood, but, according to the account of Johnstone&#x27;s mother, the wooing of his friend&#x27;s new wife started soon after the wedding. In March 1824 Brudenell challenged Elizabeth&#x27;s second cousin Gilbert John Heathcote to a duel, but this was unconnected to the dalliance: Heathcote had just broken off an engagement to Brudenell&#x27;s sister, Emma. Only &quot;primitive&quot; and inaccurate pistols were used and neither participant was hurt. Johnstone started divorce proceedings in June 1824 and the suit was finalised early in 1826. Johnstone, who had received damages of £1,000 from Brudenell, was apparently happy to be rid of his wife, calling her &quot;the most damned bad-tempered and extravagant bitch in the kingdom&quot;. She and Cardigan married on 19 June 1826. It was not a happy marriage; they had no children, and by 1837 they had separated. After the death of his first wife in July 1858, he married for a second time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, achieving still greater notoriety as he had been conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages (there was a difference of 27 years) and Cardigan&#x27;s disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society for the rest of her days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Cardigan spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Cardigan&#x27;s principal mistress Maria, Marchioness of Ailesbury and tolerated his other affairs.

===Early military career===

Beyond all other interests, which included politics and the preservation of the ancient privileges of the aristocracy against the reformist climate of the period, Brudenell committed himself to a career in the army. At the age of 22, as a captain in the Northamptonshire Yeomanry cavalry, he formed his own troop of horse, armed from official stocks, to guard against possible reformist demonstrations in Northamptonshire. On 6 May 1824, at the age of 27, he joined the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars. Making extensive use of the purchase of commissions system then in use, he became a lieutenant in January 1825, a captain in June 1826, a major in August 1830 and a lieutenant-colonel, albeit on half-pay, only three months later, on 3 December 1830. He obtained command of the 15th The King&#x27;s Hussars—at a reported premium of £35,000 ()—on 16 March 1832.

Parliamentary business, in the form of the hotly contested Reform Bill campaign, delayed his taking command until May. His lack of age and experience, compared with that of the battle-tested officers whom he led (some were veterans of the Battle of Waterloo) drew his naturally punctilious nature to manifest itself in petty-minded bullying. In 1833 he was publicly censured for &quot;reprehensible ... conduct&quot; in a court martial held to determine charges he had laid against Captain Augustus Wathen, a subordinate. Brudenell was dismissed, by personal order of King William (who concurred with the &quot;righteous judgement&quot; of Army commander-in-chief Lord Hill), early in 1834. He had, however, influence at court and he asked his sister Harriet, married to Queen Adelaide&#x27;s chamberlain, Lord Howe, to get the decision reversed. He pestered senior officers and politicians until in March 1836 he was allowed command of the 11th Light Dragoons, notwithstanding the view of Lord Hill that he was &quot;constitutionally unfit for command&quot;. After a leisurely passage with his wife, he joined his new command in India in October of the following year, just in time to enjoy some tiger-shooting before seeing the regiment off for Britain at the end of its long posting. He travelled separately in a hired vessel, disdaining to share the discomforts of the warship carrying his troops. Of the two years following his appointment, only four weeks were spent with his regiment. It was in India that Brudenell received word that, consequent on the death of his father on 14 August 1837, he had inherited the title of Earl of Cardigan.

To lead a smart and efficient unit, Cardigan set about using his fortune to improve his regiment&#x27;s reputation and performance. In this he was successful, as in October 1839 the 11th Light Dragoons was the regiment selected to escort Prince Albert from Dover to London for his marriage to Queen Victoria. The regiment consequently became the 11th, Prince Albert&#x27;s Own, Hussars, with redesigned, elaborate and expensive new uniforms. George Ryan, a writer otherwise highly critical of Cardigan, estimated that he spent about £10,000 () a year towards remounts and distinctive uniform for his troops. In purchasing brilliant new uniforms for his men, Cardigan caused resentment among his professional officers; they had to match the men&#x27;s attire with even more costly uniforms (a Hussar officer&#x27;s jacket, for example, cost £40—) and officers had to buy their own. He wished his officers to be as aristocratic, flamboyant and stylish as he was himself and as a consequence, he had no time for those men—&quot;Indian officers&quot;—who had learnt their profession over many years of service with the 11th during its long posting to India. This attitude was particularly in evidence in the mess: Cardigan had forbidden the serving of porter, a popular beverage among the professional officers, and when at a formal mess dinner a visitor had requested Moselle wine, which was served in a &quot;black bottle&quot; similar to that of porter, he decided that the &quot;Indian&quot; Captain John Williams Reynolds, who had ordered it for the guest, was defying him. Reynolds was arrested and in due course received a strongly worded reprimand from Lord Hill, who although privately believing that his misgivings about Cardigan had been well founded, felt that, in the interests of good order and discipline, a public demonstration of support was necessary.

Reynolds&#x27;s guardian sent the details of the case to all the London papers and for many months thereafter Cardigan, his regiment and the commander-in-chief were subject to ridicule, hissing and cat-calls of &quot;black bottle&quot; whenever they appeared in public. A more serious punishment was administered to Richard Reynolds, cousin to John Reynolds and another long-serving captain, who was court-martialled for sending Cardigan an &quot;insubordinate&quot; letter in response to being barred from his commanding officer&#x27;s quarters. Hill drafted a strong memorandum urging Cardigan to employ &quot;temper and discretion&quot; in dealings with his officers, but Reynolds was cashiered. Not all of the &quot;Indian&quot; officers of the 11th found themselves the object of Cardigan&#x27;s disfavour: when, in October 1840, Major Jenkins, a long-serving veteran, fell seriously ill, Cardigan attended his bedside for two nights and, when he died, made a substantial payment to the family and, at a personal cost of £400 (), secured a scholarship for his younger son. George Ryan acknowledged his generosity towards his officers and men when in hardship and noted him to be a regular, anonymous subscriber to many civic charities.

===Duel with Captain Tuckett===
Cardigan challenged to a duel Captain Harvey Tuckett, a retired officer of the regiment and a long-serving professional soldier, for writing a letter to the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; criticising his treatment of Captain Reynolds in the &quot;black bottle&quot; affair. The exchange of fire, on 12 September 1840, was witnessed by a police constable and Cardigan was prosecuted. He was acquitted on a legal technicality, notwithstanding his boast on arrest that &quot;I have hit my man&quot;. The prosecution had demonstrated that Cardigan – on this occasion using a sophisticated duelling pistol with concealed rifling and a hair trigger (supplied by the Mayfair gunsmiths Manton and Hudson) which was thought unsporting according to the usages of duelling – had fired upon Captain Harvey Tuckett. The indictment, however, was that the victim had been &quot;Harvey Garnet Phipps Tuckett&quot;. Evidence was received from an army agent paying Tuckett&#x27;s army pension that this was indeed the full name of Captain Tuckett of the 11th Hussars, yet the discrepancy in the wording of the charge allowed the jury of his peers, 120 in number, unanimously to acquit him; as a nobleman the law of the time allowed him to be tried for a capital crime before the House of Lords sitting as a jury, with Lord Denman (acting as Lord High Steward) as judge. This added to his unpopularity, with &quot;The Times&quot; alleging that there was deliberate, high-level complicity to leave the loop-hole in the prosecution&#x27;s case and reporting the view that &quot;in England there is one law for the rich and another for the poor&quot; and &quot;The Examiner&quot; describing the verdict as &quot;a defeat of justice&quot;. Even his obituary described this evasion of justice as &quot;an absurd technical deficiency&quot;.

===Crimean War===
Promoted to Major-General on 20 June 1854, his most notorious exploit took place during the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade reaching the Russian guns before returning unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command who took part in the charge (although others may have died of wounds later on). The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan&#x27;s sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan&#x27;s first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.

A staff officer to army commander Lord Raglan, Colonel the Hon. Somerset John Gough Calthorpe, alleged in his book &quot;Letters from a Staff Officer in the Crimea&quot; that Cardigan had survived only because he had fled the scene before the charge made contact with the enemy. In his first edition, Calthorpe allowed that Cardigan&#x27;s horse may have bolted, but later editions pointedly stated the earl was too fine a horseman for this to be a satisfactory explanation. The horse, &quot;Ronald&quot;, was of distinctive appearance and easily identified, with both nearside legs white. The charger survived the war and returned safely to England. After some preliminary legal skirmishing, Cardigan sought an indictment for criminal libel in 1863, but his action failed, although the bench made plain that it was only his competence, and not his courage, that was in doubt. They found that he had led his men onto the enemy&#x27;s guns with &quot;valour ... conspicuously displayed&quot; but thereafter &quot;his conduct as a General was open to criticism&quot;. This conclusion is shared by historian Alexander Kinglake, who concludes that although Cardigan displayed a &quot;want ... of competence&quot; after the charge, he had lost contact with his men only through his brave persistence in galloping too far ahead of them.

There is no doubt that Cardigan had reached and overrun the enemy battery: he was recognised beyond the guns by , an enemy officer with whom he was acquainted before the war; Radziwiłł issued instructions that Cardigan was to be taken prisoner and not killed. Cardigan, considering his duty then done and disdaining, as he later explained, to &quot;fight the enemy among private soldiers&quot;, turned about and made his way steadily—he himself said that his return was at the walk to avoid any unseemly appearance of haste—for his own lines. Lord Lucan recalled things differently, later giving evidence that Cardigan had been galloping back, only slowing to walk when he realised he was being watched. This hurried retreat was also noticed by General Liprandi, Russian commander, who made enquiries to identify the English officer whom he saw galloping away after the attack. Officers and men of the second and third lines—men for whom as brigade commander Cardigan remained responsible—were still advancing at the charge when they saw their commander riding in retreat. Lord George Paget of the 4th Hussars later declared that Cardigan alone could issue the required orders when the time came to break off the engagement and some needless fighting, hand-to-hand and intense against great odds, could thus have been avoided. Other officers too had noticed his absence: one, Lord William Paulet on Lucan&#x27;s staff, had noticed Cardigan &quot;riding like a madman&quot; towards the rear. When Colonel Paget, one of the last to return, encountered a &quot;composed&quot; Cardigan, he challenged him to account for himself. Unsatisfied with the response, Paget wrote an official complaint to the new Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Cambridge forwarded the letter to Cardigan for comment and Cardigan&#x27;s reply in turn complained that Paget had not in fact taken the part he claimed during the attack that day. Inconclusive claim and counter-claim followed, until Cardigan&#x27;s attentions were diverted to the allegations made public when Calthorpe&#x27;s book &quot;Letters&quot; went on sale.

In the week following the battle of Balaclava, the remnants of the Light Brigade were posted inland, to high ground overlooking the British lines surrounding Inkerman. Cardigan, who had spent most nights of the campaign aboard his luxury sailing yacht &quot;Dryad&quot; in Balaclava harbour, found this move a great inconvenience and his leadership of the brigade suffered as a result. He missed the Battle of Inkerman (4 and 5 November 1854), casually asking journalist William Russell (who was returning from the conflict) &quot;What are they doing, what was the firing for...?&quot; as he rode up from the harbour at noon on the first day. The decisive stages of the battle were on the second day and again Cardigan was absent, although he managed to arrive at a more creditable 10:15 am. The part played by the brigade was not great and, to avoid embarrassing the earl, it was not mentioned in the official account of the battle forwarded to London.

Whatever Cardigan&#x27;s faults, he had always tried to ensure that the troops under his command were well-equipped. However, as the Crimean winter fell over the Light Brigade&#x27;s exposed position, food, fodder, clothing and shelter were all in short supply. Beyond writing letters pointing out the deficiencies, Cardigan did nothing. Food and fodder were available at the coast, but he refused to release any men and horses to carry up stores, as his officers pleaded, in case of a surprise attack by the enemy and because &quot;I had no orders to do so&quot;. Colonel Alexander Tulloch, who gave evidence to a board of enquiry into the failure, noted that in fact Cardigan had more horses than he had needed: indeed more horses than men to ride them, and wrote privately after his evidence was excluded from the final report: &quot;Because Lord Cardigan might have had some difficulty in carrying up all the barley to which his corps was entitled he [resolved himself] therefore justified in bringing up none.&quot; There was great hardship and many horses died.

On 8 December 1854, citing ill health, Cardigan set off for England. In these circumstances, the word of an officer regarding his fitness to serve would normally be accepted, but Raglan permitted his departure only after a medical board had confirmed his claimed disability. Conveyed on the gunboat to Scutari, where he visited the military hospital, he embarked for Marseilles on the P&amp;O steamer on 26 December 1854, continuing by train, via Paris, to Boulogne.

===Reception===

Newspaper accounts of the gallant charge had been given wide circulation in England by the time Cardigan&#x27;s ship berthed at the port of Folkestone on 13 January 1855 and the town offered him a rapturous welcome. In London he was mobbed by an enthusiastic crowd and on 16 January at Queen Victoria&#x27;s invitation he was received at Windsor to explain to her and Prince Albert the details of the battle. Victoria noted how &quot;modestly&quot; he presented his story, but this reticence was absent in his public appearances: on 5 February, he gave a highly exaggerated account of his participation in the charge at a banquet held in his honour at the Mansion House, London. On 8 February, at a speech in his home town of Northampton, he went even further, describing how he had shared the privations of his men by living the &quot;whole time in a common tent&quot; and how, after the charge, he had rallied his troops and pursued the fleeing enemy artillerymen as far as the Tchernaya river. As his biographer Saul David points out, &quot;a more misleading account of his own exploits could hardly have been given&quot;.

Cardigan was able to enjoy many months of adulation before doubts about his conduct emerged: the government recommended him for the Order of the Garter, although the Queen denied him this honour because of the previous unseemly incidents in his private life. On 1 February 1855 he was made Inspector-General of Cavalry and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (along with Commissary-General William Filder, General James Airey and Lord Lucan) on 7 July 1855. He was also made Commander of the French Legion of Honour on 2 August 1856 and Knight (second class) of the Turkish Order of Medjidie on 2 March 1858.

Merchants, eager to profit from his fame, sold pictures depicting his role in the charge and written chronicles, based on his own accounts, were rushed into print. The &quot;cardigan&quot;, a knitted waistcoat supposedly worn by the earl on the campaign, became fashionable and many were sold.

Cardigan&#x27;s commanding officer and brother-in-law, Lord Lucan, had been recalled in disgrace—largely brought about by the determination of the commander-in-chief, Lord Raglan, to displace blame from himself—and arrived in England only two weeks after his subordinate but, as the officer who had &quot;looked on&quot; (a pun on his name much exploited by Cardigan) while the charge had taken place, little regard was given to his version of events. (Lucan had earned the unfortunate nickname of &quot;Lord Look-on&quot; when Lord Raglan ordered him to withdraw, and remain in reserve, during a skirmish at the Bulganek River before the earlier Battle of Alma.) In July 1855, &quot;The Times&quot; hinted that the public had been misled over &quot;the real nature of [Cardigan&#x27;s] services in the East&quot;, but, in the absence of anything definitive, his popularity remained. However, officers who had taken command in the aftermath of the charge, the role that Cardigan was claiming for himself, had heard of his reception in England and were anxious to put the record straight. The writer George Ryan, who had rushed out a hasty pamphlet praising Cardigan, retracted his words (&quot;I have now corrected the sham.&quot;) and was the first to report Cardigan&#x27;s fellow officers&#x27; reservations about the earl&#x27;s conduct on the day. As the soldiers themselves began to return to England, the doubts hardened. Not until the following year, however, with the official enquiries of Colonel Tulloch and the publication of Calthorpe&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot;, was there proof that Cardigan had not been telling the truth. Nonetheless, he continued, with characteristic arrogance and self-delusion, as if nothing was amiss and he remained in his cavalry post for the next five years. &quot;Eight months on active service, or, A diary of a general officer of cavalry, in 1854&quot;, published in 1855, was Cardigan&#x27;s own account of his time in the Crimea.

Cardigan&#x27;s overwhelming enthusiasm for the army remained and the meticulous standards of dress and parade that he had required of his earlier commands he now applied to the whole cavalry. He was made Colonel of the Regiment of the 5th Dragoon Guards in 1859, but he derived more satisfaction when, after his formal retirement in 1860, and its accompanying promotion to Lieutenant-General in 1861, he became colonel of his favourite regiment, the 11th Hussars, which he had first commanded in 1836. He remained in royal favour and early in 1861 he was selected to accompany the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, to inspect Prussian cavalry manoeuvres. He was possibly an unwise choice as his arrogant behaviour towards his hosts, themselves no strangers to high self-esteem among military officers, resulted in numerous challenges to duel; he was quickly sent home. The Queen, however, blocked his colonelcy of one of the Household regiments because of his dalliance with Adeline while still married to Elizabeth. His last military function was a mounted review of the 11th Hussars before their embarkation for India in May 1866. He was joined by Colonel John Reynolds, who had been Cardigan&#x27;s adversary in the &quot;black bottle affair&quot;, but the men had at last settled their differences in the previous year.

===Retirement===

After his retirement in 1866, he lived happily at Deene, passing his time in luxury with horse racing, hunting and shooting. He remained a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and was Commodore of the Royal Southern Yacht Club.

His parliamentary life continued, with the occasional foray to London to speak in the House of Lords on military matters and to continue to press for further official recognition of his inglorious career. In 1866 he was, with Thomas Carlyle, one of the organisers of public demonstrations of support for Edward Eyre, controversial Governor of Jamaica, against allegations that he had dealt too harshly with the Morant Bay rebellion of the previous October. He surprised some commentators when, in 1867, he spoke in favour of the second Reform Bill. In acknowledging his change of heart he said that the time for trying to stem the tide of reform, an endeavour in which he had long strived, had passed and given &quot;good luck&quot; the extension of the vote would &quot;confer ... a great benefit upon every class of the community&quot;. In 1868 he presented to the House a petition calling for additional recognition of the late General Henry Shrapnel, inventor of the explosive artillery shell, in recognition of its effectiveness at Waterloo.

He died on 28 March 1868 from injuries sustained the previous day, caused by a fall from a dangerous horse &quot;he would not have permitted any friend to ride&quot;, possibly following a stroke, and was buried in a specially built tomb in the family chapel at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Deene. He was succeeded in his title by his second cousin, George William Brudenell-Bruce, who died childless in 1878.

After the death of his widow in 1915, Deene Park reverted to the descendants of George William&#x27;s younger brother, Ernest Augustus Charles.

==Assessments==
Assessments of Lord Cardigan have varied significantly over time. The 9th edition (1889) of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; noted that his actions at Balaclava had become &quot;the subject of much controversy, some critics having an eye only to the splendid daring and unquestioning obedience to orders, and others seeing only a foolhardy and unjustifiable throwing away of valuable lives&quot;, while the 11th edition (1910–11) rephrased the passage to read that &quot;Cardigan and his men alike have been credited by the bitterest critics of the charge with splendid daring and unquestioning obedience to orders&quot;.

In her sweeping condemnation of the Victorian class system, &quot;The Reason Why&quot; (1953), Cecil Woodham-Smith used the Earl as a prism on the ills of British society of the time (but conceded that in the Charge itself Cardigan conducted himself with unwavering courage and discipline). Donald Thomas&#x27;s 1974 biography &quot;Cardigan: The Hero of Balaclava&quot; provided a more sympathetic portrayal. Saul David&#x27;s 1997 hostile assessment, on the other hand, was entitled simply &quot;The Homicidal Earl&quot;. Terry Brighton&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; provides a more recent critical account of Cardigan as a brigade commander but finds him in no way to blame for the charge.

==Cultural depictions==
&quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, a 1968 film based on Woodham-Smith&#x27;s research, made Cardigan (played by Trevor Howard) its primary antagonist. The movie depicts Cardigan as a harsh disciplinarian, womaniser and military incompetent. It shows the &quot;black bottle&quot; affair, though it incorrectly makes Louis Nolan Cardigan&#x27;s antagonist, and heavily features his rivalry with Lord Lucan. It also fictitiously shows Cardigan pursuing an affair with Fanny Duberly.

George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s &quot;The Flashman Papers&quot; novels feature Cardigan as a recurring villain. In the first instalment he commands Flashman in the 11th Hussars and transfers him to India after he marries Elspeth, on the grounds that she is the daughter of a tradesman. Cardigan reappears in &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot;, where Flashman catches Cardigan trying to seduce Elspeth. Flashman later reluctantly joins Cardigan for the Charge of the Light Brigade. He appears briefly in &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot;, where Cardigan demands Flashman defend Cardigan&#x27;s reputation against hostile journalists. Flashman not only refuses but pointedly insults Cardigan. His last mention comes in &quot;Flashman and the Angel of the Lord&quot;, where Flashman observes Cardigan&#x27;s liaison with Fanny Paget.

Cardigan appears as an antagonist in the 2015 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate&quot; by Ubisoft, set in 1868. A member of the Templar Order, Cardigan is tasked with assassinating Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to prevent the passing of the Corrupt Practices Act. He is assassinated inside the Palace of Westminster by protagonist Jacob Frye.

<text>Jeff VanderMeer (born July 7, 1968) is an American author, editor, and literary critic. Initially associated with the New Weird literary genre, VanderMeer crossed over into mainstream success with his bestselling Southern Reach Series. The series&#x27; first novel, &quot;Annihilation&quot;, won the Nebula and Shirley Jackson Awards, and was adapted into a Hollywood film by director Alex Garland. Among VanderMeer&#x27;s other novels are &quot;&quot; and &quot;Borne&quot;. He has also edited with his wife Ann VanderMeer such influential and award-winning anthologies as &quot;The New Weird&quot;, &quot;The Weird&quot;, and &quot;The Big Book of Science Fiction&quot;.

VanderMeer has been called &quot;one of the most remarkable practitioners of the literary fantastic in America today,&quot; with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; naming him the &quot;King of Weird Fiction&quot;. VanderMeer&#x27;s fiction is noted for eluding genre classifications even as his works bring in themes and elements from genres such as postmodernism, ecofiction, the New Weird and post-apocalyptic fiction.

VanderMeer&#x27;s writing has been described as &quot;evocative&quot; and containing &quot;intellectual observations both profound and disturbing,&quot; and has been compared with the works of Jorge Luis Borges, Franz Kafka, and Henry David Thoreau.

==Early life and education==
VanderMeer was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania in 1968, and spent much of his childhood in the Fiji Islands, where his parents worked for the Peace Corps. After returning to the United States, he spent time in Ithaca, New York, and Gainesville, Florida. He attended the University of Florida for three years and, in 1992, took part in the Clarion Writers Workshop.

When VanderMeer was 20, he read Angela Carter&#x27;s novel &quot;The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman&quot;, which he has said &quot;blew the back of my head off, rewired my brain: I had never encountered prose like that before, never such passion and boldness on the page.&quot; Carter&#x27;s fiction inspired VanderMeer to both improve and be fearless with his own writing.

== Career ==

=== Writing ===

VanderMeer began writing in the late 1980s while still in high school and quickly became a prolific contributor to small-press magazines. During this time VanderMeer wrote a number of horror and fantasy short stories, some of which were collected in his 1989 self-published book &quot;The Book of Frog&quot; and in the 1996 collection &quot;The Book of Lost Places&quot;. He also wrote poetry—his poem &quot;Flight Is for Those Who Have Not Yet Crossed Over&quot; was a co-winner of the 1994 Rhysling Award—and edited two issues of the self-published zine &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;.

One of VanderMeer&#x27;s early successes was his 2001 short-story collection &quot;City of Saints and Madmen,&quot; set in the imaginary city of Ambergris. Several of VanderMeer&#x27;s novels were subsequently set in the same place, including &quot;&quot; (2006) and &quot;Finch&quot; (2009), the latter of which was a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Novel. In 2000, his novella &quot;The Transformation of Martin Lake&quot; won the World Fantasy Award.

VanderMeer has also worked in other media, including on a movie based on his novel &quot;Shriek&quot; that featured an original soundtrack by rock band The Church. The band Murder By Death likewise recorded a soundtrack for &quot;Finch&quot;, which was released alongside a limited edition of the book. VanderMeer also wrote a &quot;Predator&quot; tie-in novel for &quot;Dark Horse Comics&quot; called &quot;Predator: South China Seas&quot; and worked with animator Joel Veitch on a Play Station Europe animation of his story &quot;A New Face in Hell&quot;.

==== The Southern Reach Series ====
In 2014, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published VanderMeer&#x27;s Southern Reach Series, consisting of the novels &quot;Annihilation, Authority,&quot; and &quot;Acceptance&quot;. The story focuses on a secret agency that manages expeditions into a location known as Area X. The area is an uninhabited and abandoned part of the United States that nature has begun to reclaim after a mysterious world-changing event.

VanderMeer has said that the main inspiration for Area X and the series was his hike through St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge. &quot;The Other Side of the Mountain&quot; by Michel Bernanos is among the books VanderMeer has cited as also having had an influence.

The original trilogy was released in quick succession over an 8-month period, in what has been called an innovative &quot;Netflix-inspired strategy.&quot; The strategy helped the second and third books reach the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller list, and established VanderMeer as &quot;one of the most forward-thinking authors of the decade.&quot;

The series ended up being highly honored, with &quot;Annihilation&quot; winning the Nebula and Shirley Jackson Awards for Best Novel. The entire original trilogy was also named a finalist for the 2015 World Fantasy Award and the 2016 Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis. &quot;Annihilation&quot; was also adapted into a film of the same name by writer-director Alex Garland. The film stars Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Oscar Isaac.

==== Later writing ====

In 2017 VanderMeer released &quot;Borne,&quot; a &quot;biotech apocalypse&quot; novel about a scavenger named Rachel trying to survive both a city &quot;plunged into a primordial realm of myth, fable, and fairy tale&quot; and a five-story-tall flying bear named Mord. As with the Southern Reach trilogy, the novel was highly praised, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; saying, &quot;VanderMeer’s recent work has been Ovidian in its underpinnings, exploring the radical transformation of life forms and the seams between them.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said the novel reads &quot;like a dispatch from a world lodged somewhere between science fiction, myth, and a video game&quot; and that with &quot;Borne&quot; Vandermeer has essentially invented a new literary genre, &quot;weird literature.&quot;

Paramount Pictures has optioned the film rights to &quot;Borne&quot;.

In August 2017 VanderMeer released the novella &quot;The Strange Bird: A Borne Story&quot;. The stand-alone story is set in the same world as &quot;Borne&quot; but featuring different characters.

&quot;Dead Astronauts&quot;, a stand-alone short novel set in the Borne universe, was released on December 3, 2019. A stand-alone novel, Hummingbird Salamander, was published on April 6, 2021. 

=== Literary criticism and editing ===
VanderMeer is a frequent writer of critical literary reviews and essays, which have appeared in numerous publications including &quot;The Atlantic, The Washington Post&quot; Book World, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and other places. For a number of years he was a regular columnist for the Amazon book-culture blog and has served as a judge for the Eisner Awards, among others. He has been a guest speaker at such diverse events as the Brisbane Writers Festival, Finncon in Helsinki, and the American Library Association annual conference.

In 2019, VanderMeer was a judge for the National Book Award for Fiction.

VanderMeer has also edited a number of anthologies. He won a 2003 World Fantasy Award for &quot;Leviathan, Volume Three&quot;, a collection of genre-bending stories he edited with Forrest Aguirre. He and Mark Roberts were also finalists for the same award the next year for the anthology &quot;The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric &amp; Discredited Diseases&quot;.

Most of his recent anthologies have been collaborations with his wife, Ann VanderMeer, the Hugo-award-winning former editor of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. These anthologies include &quot;The New Weird&quot;, a collection of stories from New Weird authors; &quot;Last Drink Bird Head&quot;, a charity anthology benefiting literacy; &quot;The Weird&quot;, a World Fantasy Award winning collection of weird fiction; &quot;Time Traveler&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, an anthology of time-travel fiction; &quot;Fast Ships, Black Sails&quot;, a pirate fiction anthology; and the Locus Award winning &quot;The Big Book of Science Fiction&quot;.

VanderMeer is the founding editor and publisher of the &quot;Ministry of Whimsy Press&quot;, which he set up in the late 1980s while still in high school. The press is currently an imprint of Wyrm Publishing. One of the &quot;Ministry&quot;&#x27;s publications, &quot;The Troika&quot; by Stepan Chapman, won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1997.

=== Teaching ===
VanderMeer has been involved in teaching creative writing. One of the projects he is involved with is Shared Worlds, an annual two-week program that aims to teach creative writing to teenagers. VanderMeer has also taught at the Clarion Workshop and at Trinity Prep School. In addition to his teaching, VanderMeer has also written guides to creative writing such as &quot;Wonderbook&quot;, which won a BSFA Award, a Locus Award, and was nominated for a Hugo and World Fantasy Award.

=== Critical reputation ===
VanderMeer has been called &quot;one of the most remarkable practitioners of the literary fantastic in America today,&quot; with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; naming him the &quot;King of Weird Fiction.&quot; VanderMeer&#x27;s fiction is noted for eluding genre classifications even as his works bring in themes and elements from genres such as postmodernism, ecofiction, the New Weird and post-apocalyptic fiction.

VanderMeer&#x27;s fiction has been described as &quot;evocative (with) intellectual observations both profound and disturbing&quot; and &quot;lyrical and harrowing,&quot; with his mixing of genres producing &quot;something unique and unsettling.&quot;

VanderMeer&#x27;s writing has been compared with the works of Jorge Luis Borges, Kafka, and Thoreau.

== Personal life ==
In 2003, VanderMeer married Ann Kennedy, then editor for the small Buzzcity Press and &quot;Silver Web&quot; magazine. They have two cats. One is named Neo.

== Awards ==

VanderMeer has been nominated for the World Fantasy Award 14 times. He has also won an NEA-funded Florida Individual Writers&#x27; Fellowship, and, the Le Cafard Cosmique award in France and the Tähtifantasia Award in Finland, both for &quot;City of Saints&quot;. He has also been a finalist for the Hugo Award, Bram Stoker Award, International Horror Guild Award, Philip K. Dick Award, and many others. Novels such as &quot;Veniss Underground&quot; and &quot;&quot; have made the year&#x27;s best lists of Amazon.com, &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, among others.

<text>George Canning (; 11 April 17708 August 1827) was a British Tory statesman. He held various senior cabinet positions under numerous prime ministers, including two important terms as foreign secretary, finally becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for the last 119 days of his life, from April to August 1827.

The son of an actress and a failed businessman and lawyer, Canning was supported financially by his uncle, Stratford Canning, which allowed him to attend Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. Canning entered politics in 1793 and rose rapidly. He was Paymaster of the Forces (1800–1801) and Treasurer of the Navy (1804–1806) under William Pitt the Younger. Canning was foreign secretary (1807–1809) under the Duke of Portland. Canning was the dominant figure in the cabinet and directed the Battle of Copenhagen, the seizure of the Danish fleet in 1807 to assure Britain&#x27;s naval supremacy over Napoleon. In 1809, he was wounded in a duel with his rival Lord Castlereagh and was shortly thereafter passed over as a successor to the Duke of Portland in favour of Spencer Perceval. He rejected overtures to serve as foreign secretary again because of Castlereagh&#x27;s presence in Perceval&#x27;s Cabinet and he remained out of high office until after Perceval was assassinated in 1812.

Canning served under the new prime minister the Earl of Liverpool as British Ambassador to Portugal (1814–1816), President of the Board of Control (1816–1821) and foreign secretary and Leader of the House of Commons (1822–1827). King George IV disliked Canning and there were efforts to frustrate his foreign policies. Canning gained much public support for his policies. The historian Paul Hayes argues that he achieved several diplomatic coups in relations with Spain and Portugal, by helping to guarantee the independence of the American colonies of Portugal and Spain. His policies ensured a major trading advantage for British merchants and supported the American Monroe Doctrine. The historian G. M. Trevelyan wrote

When Lord Liverpool resigned in April 1827, Canning was chosen to succeed him as prime minister, ahead of the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel. Both of them declined to serve under Canning and the Tories split between Peel and Wellington&#x27;s Ultra-Tories and the Canningites. Canning then invited several Whigs to join his cabinet. His health collapsed, and he died of pneumonia at Chiswick House on 8 August 1827, whilst still in office. His tenure of 119 days in office made him the shortest-serving prime minister in history, a title he held for 195 years until Liz Truss&#x27; premiership in 2022, which lasted 49 days.

==Early life==
Canning was born into an Anglo-Irish family at his parents&#x27; home in Queen Anne Street, Marylebone, London. Canning described himself as &quot;an Irishman born in London&quot;. His father, George Canning of Garvagh, County Londonderry, in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, was a gentleman of limited means, a failed wine merchant and lawyer, who renounced his right to inherit the family estate in exchange for payment of his substantial debts. George Sr. eventually abandoned the family and died in poverty on 11 April 1771, his son&#x27;s first birthday, in London. Canning&#x27;s mother, Mary Ann Costello, who was also Irish, took work as a stage actress, a profession not considered respectable at the time. Indeed, when in 1827 it looked as if Canning would become prime minister, Lord Grey remarked that &quot;the son of an actress is, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, disqualified from becoming Prime Minister&quot;.

Because Canning showed unusual intelligence and promise at an early age, family friends persuaded his uncle, London merchant Stratford Canning (father of the diplomat Stratford Canning), to become his nephew&#x27;s guardian. George Canning grew up with his cousins at the home of his uncle, who provided him with an income and an education. Stratford Canning&#x27;s financial support allowed the young Canning to study at Hyde Abbey School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. Canning came out top of the school at Eton and left at the age of seventeen. His time at Eton has been described as &quot;a triumph almost without parallel. He proved a brilliant classicist, came top of the school, and excelled at public orations&quot;.

Canning struck up friendships with the future Lord Liverpool as well as with Granville Leveson-Gower and John Hookham Frere. In 1789 he won a prize for his Latin poem &quot;The Pilgrimage to Mecca&quot; which he recited in Oxford Theatre. Canning began practising law after receiving his BA from Oxford in the summer of 1791, but he wished to enter politics.

==Entry into politics==
Stratford Canning was a Whig and would introduce his nephew in the 1780s to prominent Whigs such as Charles James Fox, Edmund Burke, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. George Canning&#x27;s friendship with Sheridan would last for the remainder of Sheridan&#x27;s life.

George Canning&#x27;s impoverished background and limited financial resources, however, made unlikely a bright political future in a Whig party whose political ranks were led mostly by members of the wealthy landed aristocracy in league with the newly rich industrialist classes. Regardless, along with Whigs such as Burke, Canning himself would become considerably more conservative in the early 1790s after witnessing the excessive radicalism of the French Revolution. &quot;The political reaction which then followed swept the young man to the opposite extreme; and his vehemence for monarchy and the Tories gave point to a Whig sarcasm,—that men had often turned their coats, but this was the first time a boy had turned his jacket.&quot;

So when Canning decided to enter politics, he sought and received the patronage of the leader of the &quot;Tory&quot; group, William Pitt the Younger. In 1793, thanks to the help of Pitt, Canning became a member of parliament for Newtown on the Isle of Wight, a rotten borough. In 1796, he changed seats to a different rotten borough, Wendover in Buckinghamshire. He was elected to represent several constituencies during his parliamentary career.

Canning rose quickly in British politics as an effective orator and writer. His speeches in Parliament as well as his essays gave the followers of Pitt a rhetorical power they had previously lacked. Canning&#x27;s skills saw him gain leverage within the Pittite faction that allowed him influence over its policies along with repeated promotions in the Cabinet. Over time, Canning became a prominent public speaker as well, and was one of the first politicians to campaign heavily in the country.

As a result of his charisma and promise, Canning early on drew to himself a circle of supporters who would become known as the Canningites. Conversely though, Canning had a reputation as a divisive man who alienated many.

He was a dominant personality and often risked losing political allies for personal reasons. He once reduced Lord Liverpool to tears with a long satirical poem mocking Liverpool&#x27;s attachment to his time as a colonel in the militia.

==Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs==
On 2 November 1795, Canning received his first ministerial post: Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In this post he proved a strong supporter of Pitt, often taking his side in disputes with the foreign secretary, Lord Grenville. At the end of 1798 Canning responded to a resolution by George Tierney MP for peace negotiations with France:

I for my part still conceive it to be the paramount duty of a British member of parliament to consider what is good for Great Britain ... I do not envy that man&#x27;s feelings, who can behold the sufferings of Switzerland, and who derives from that sight no idea of what is meant by the deliverance of Europe. I do not envy the feelings of that man, who can look without emotion at Italy – plundered, insulted, trampled upon, exhausted, covered with ridicule, and horror, and devastation – who can look at all this, and be at a loss to guess what is meant by the deliverance of Europe? As little do I envy the feelings of that man, who can view the peoples of the Netherlands driven into insurrection, and struggling for their freedom against the heavy hand of a merciless tyranny, without entertaining any suspicion of what may be the sense of the word deliverance. Does such a man contemplate Holland groaning under arbitrary oppressions and exactions? Does he turn his eyes to Spain trembling at the nod of a foreign master? And does the word deliverance still sound unintelligibly in his ear? Has he heard of the rescue and salvation of Naples, by the appearance and the triumphs of the British fleet? Does he know that the monarchy of Naples maintains its existence at the sword&#x27;s point? And is his understanding, and his heart, still impenetrable to the sense and meaning of the deliverance of Europe?

Pitt called this speech &quot;one of the best ever heard on any occasion&quot;.

He resigned his position at the Foreign Office on 1 April 1799.

===&quot;The Anti-Jacobin&quot;===
Canning was involved in the founding of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;, a newspaper which was published every Monday from 20 November 1797 to 9 July 1798. Its purpose was to support the government and condemn revolutionary doctrines through news and poetry, much of it written by Canning. Canning&#x27;s poetry satirised and ridiculed Jacobin poetry. Before the appearance of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot; all the eloquence (except for Burke&#x27;s) and all the wit and ridicule had been on the side of Fox and Sheridan. Canning and his friends changed this. A young Whig, William Lamb (the future Lord Melbourne, Prime Minister) wrote an &#x27;Epistle to the Editors of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;&#x27;, which attacked Canning:

===Subsequent offices===
In 1799 Canning became a commissioner of the Board of Control for India. Canning wrote on 16 April: &quot;Here I am immersed in papers, of which I do not yet comprehend three words in succession; but I shall get at their meaning by degrees and at my leisure. No such hard work here as at my former office. No attendance but when I like it, when there are interesting letters received from India (as is now the case) or to be sent out there&quot;.

Canning was appointed Paymaster of the Forces (and therefore to the Privy Council as well) in 1800. In February 1801, Pitt resigned as prime minister due to George III&#x27;s opposition to Catholic Emancipation. Canning, despite Pitt&#x27;s advice to stay in office, loyally followed him into opposition. The following day, Canning wrote to Lady Malmesbury: &quot;I resign &quot;because Pitt&quot; resigns. And that is all&quot;.

==Backbenches==
Canning disliked being out of office, and wrote on to John Hookham Frere in summer 1801: &quot;But the thought will obtrude itself now and then that I am not where I should be – &quot;non-hoc pollicitus&quot;.&quot; He also claimed that Pitt had done &quot;scrupulously and magnanimously &quot;right&quot; by everyone &quot;but&quot; me&quot;. At the end of September 1801 Canning wrote to Frere, saying of Pitt: &quot;I do love him, and reverence him as I should a Father – but a Father should not sacrifice me, with my good will. Most heartily I forgive him, But he has to answer to himself, and to the country for much mischief that he has done and much that is still to do.&quot; Pitt wished for Canning to enter Henry Addington&#x27;s government, a move which Canning looked on as a horrible dilemma but in the end, he turned the offer down.

Canning opposed the preliminaries of the Peace of Amiens signed on 1 October. He did not vote against it due to his personal devotion to Pitt. He wrote on 22 November: &quot;I would risk my life to be assured of being able to act always &quot;with P&quot; in a manner satisfactory to my own feelings and sense of what is right, rather than have to seek that object in separation from him.&quot; On 27 May 1802 in the Commons Canning requested that all grants of land in Trinidad (captured by Britain from Spain) should be rejected until Parliament had decided what to do with the island. The threat that it could be populated by slaves like other West Indian islands was real. Canning instead wanted it to have a military post and that it should be settled with ex-soldiers, free blacks and creoles, with the Native American population protected and helped. He also asserted that the island should be used to test the theory that better methods of cultivation in land would lessen the need for slaves. Addington acceded to Canning&#x27;s demands and the Reverend William Leigh believed Canning had saved 750,000 lives.

At a dinner to celebrate Pitt&#x27;s birthday in 1802, Canning wrote the song &quot;The Pilot that Weathered the Storm&quot;, performed by a tenor from Drury Lane, Charles Dignum:

In November Canning spoke out openly in support of Pitt in the Commons. One observer thought that Canning made incomparably the best speech and that his defence of Pitt&#x27;s administration &quot;one of the best things, either argumentatively as to matter, or critically and to manner and style&quot; that he could ever remember. On 8 December Sheridan spoke out in defence of Addington and denied that Pitt was the only man who could save the country. Canning replied by criticising the Addington government&#x27;s foreign policy and claimed that the House should recognise the greatness of the country and Pitt, who ought to be its leader. He argued against those, such as William Wilberforce, who held that Britain could safely maintain a policy of isolation: &quot;Let us consider the state of the world as it is, not as we fancy it ought to be. Let us not seek to hide from our own eyes ... the real, imminent and awful danger which threatens us.&quot; Also, he objected to the notion that Britain could choose between greatness and happiness: &quot;The choice is not in our power. We have ... no refuge in littleness. We must maintain ourselves what we are, or cease to have a political existence worth preserving.&quot; Furthermore, he openly declared for Pitt and said: &quot;Away with the cant of &#x27;measures, not men., the idle supposition that it is the harness and not the horses that draw the chariot along.&quot; Kingdoms rise and fall due to what degree they are upheld &quot;not by well-meaning endeavours ... but by commanding, over-awing talents ... retreat and withdraw as much as he will, he must not hope to efface the memory of his past services from the gratitude of his country; he cannot withdraw himself from the following of a nation; he must endure the attachment of a people whom he has saved.&quot; In private Canning was fearful that if Pitt did not return to power, Fox would: &quot;Sooner or later he &quot;must&quot; act or the country is gone.&quot;

Canning approved of the declaration of war against France on 18 May 1803. Canning was angered by Pitt&#x27;s desire not to proactively work to turn out the ministry but support the ministry when it adopted sound policies. However, in 1804, to Canning&#x27;s delight, Pitt began to work against the Addington government. After Pitt delivered a stinging attack on the government&#x27;s defence measures on 25 April, Canning launched his own attack on Addington, which made Addington furious. On 30 April Lord Eldon, the Lord Chancellor, asked Pitt to submit a new administration to the King.

==Treasurer of the Navy==
Canning returned to office in 1804 with Pitt, becoming Treasurer of the Navy. In 1805 he offered Pitt his resignation after Addington was given a seat in the Cabinet. He wrote to Lady Hester to say he felt humiliated that Addington was a minister &quot;and I am – nothing. I cannot help it, I cannot face the House of Commons or walk the streets in this state of things, as I am&quot;. After reading this letter Pitt summoned Canning to London for a meeting, where he told him that if he resigned it would open a permanent breach between the two of them as it would cast a slur on his conduct. He offered Canning the office of Chief Secretary for Ireland but he refused on the grounds that this would look like he was being got out of the way. Canning eventually decided not to resign and wrote that &quot;I am resolved to &#x27;sink or swim&#x27; with Pitt, though he has tied himself to such sinking company. God forgive him&quot;. Canning left office with the death of Pitt; he was not offered a place in Lord Grenville&#x27;s administration.

==Foreign secretary==

Canning was appointed foreign secretary in the new government of the Duke of Portland in 1807. Given key responsibilities for the country&#x27;s diplomacy in the Napoleonic Wars, he was responsible for planning the attack on Copenhagen in September 1807, much of which he undertook at his country estate, South Hill Park at Easthampstead in Berkshire.

After the defeat of Prussia by the French, the neutrality of Denmark looked increasingly fragile. Canning was worried that Denmark might, under French pressure, become hostile to Britain. On the night of 21/22 July 1807 Canning received intelligence directly from Tilsit (where Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I of Russia were negotiating a treaty) which appeared &quot;to rest on good authority&quot; that Napoleon had proposed to the Tsar a great naval combination against Britain, of which Denmark and Portugal would be members.

On 30 July a military force 25,000 strong set sail for Denmark, with Francis Jackson travelling the day after. Canning instructed Jackson that his overriding aim was to secure the possession of the Danish navy by offering the Danes a treaty of alliance and mutual defence whereby they would be given back their fleet at the end of the war. On 31 July Canning wrote to his wife: &quot;The anxious interval between this day and the hearing the result of his [Jackson&#x27;s] expedition will be long and painful indeed. Long, I mean, in &quot;feeling&quot;. In fact, it will be about a fortnight or three weeks ... I think we have made success almost certain. But the measure is a bold one and if it fails – why we must be impeached I suppose – and dearest dear will have a box at the trial&quot;. The day after he wrote that he had received a letter the previous night which provided an &quot;account of the French being &quot;actually&quot; about to do that act of hostility, the possibility of which formed the groundwork of my Baltic plan. My fear was that the French might &quot;not&quot; be the aggressors – and then ours would have appeared a strong measure, fully justifiable I think and absolutely necessary, but without apparent necessity or justification. Now the aggression will justify us fully ... I am therefore quite easy as to the morality and political wisdom of our plan&quot;. Napoleon had on 31 July instructed his foreign minister, Talleyrand, to inform the Danes that if they did not wish for Holstein to be invaded and occupied by Jean Bernadotte they must prepare for war against Britain. Canning wrote to his wife on 1 August: &quot;Now for the execution and I confess to my own love, I wake an hour or two earlier than I ought to, thinking of this execution. I could not sleep after asses&#x27; milk today, thought I was not in bed till 1/2 p. 2&quot;. On 25 August he wrote to Granville Leveson-Gower: &quot;The suspense is, as you may well imagine, agitating and painful in the extreme; but I have an undiminished confidence as to the result, either by force or by treaty. The latter however is so infinitely preferable to the former that the doubt whether it has been successful is of itself almost as anxious as if the whole depended on it alone&quot;.

On 2 September, after Jackson&#x27;s negotiations proved unsuccessful, the British fleet began bombarding Copenhagen until when at 7 pm on 5 September the Danes requested a truce. On 7 September the Danes agreed to hand over their navy (18 ships of the line, 15 frigates and 31 smaller ships) and naval stores and the British agreed to evacuate Zealand within six weeks. On 16 September Canning received the news with relief and excitement: &quot;Did I not tell you we would save Plumstead from bombardment?&quot; he wrote to the Reverend William Leigh. On 24 September he wrote to George Rose: &quot;Nothing was ever more brilliant, more salutary or more effectual than the success [at Copenhagen]&quot;. On 30 September he wrote Lord Boringdon that he hoped Copenhagen would &quot;&quot;stun&quot; Russia into her sense again&quot;. Canning wrote to Gower on 2 October 1807: &quot;We &quot;are&quot; hated throughout Europe and that hate must be cured by fear&quot;. After the news of Russia&#x27;s declaration of war against Britain reached London on 2 December, Canning wrote to Lord Boringdon two days later: &quot;The Peace of Tilsit you see is come out. We did not want any more &quot;case&quot; for Copenhagen; but if we had, this gives it us&quot;.

On 3 February 1808, the opposition leader George Ponsonby requested the publication of all information on the strength and battle-worthiness of the Danish fleet sent by the British envoy at Copenhagen. Canning replied with a speech nearly three hours long, described by Lord Palmerston as &quot;so powerful that it gave a decisive turn to the debate&quot;. Lord Grey said his speech was &quot;eloquent and powerful&quot; but that he had never heard such &quot;audacious misrepresentation&quot; and &quot;positive falsehood&quot;. On 2 March the opposition moved a vote of censure over Copenhagen, defeated by 224 votes to 64 after Canning gave a speech, in the words of Lord Glenbervie, so &quot;very witty, very eloquent and very able&quot;.

In November 1807, Canning oversaw the Portuguese royal family&#x27;s flight from Portugal to Brazil.

===Duel with Castlereagh===
In 1809 Canning entered into a series of disputes within the government that were to become famous. He argued with the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Lord Castlereagh, over the deployment of troops that Canning had promised would be sent to Portugal but which Castlereagh sent to the Netherlands. The government became increasingly paralysed in disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh were removed and replaced by Lord Wellesley. Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it would be possible.

Castlereagh discovered the deal in September 1809 and challenged Canning to a duel. Canning accepted the challenge and the Castlereagh–Canning duel was fought on 21 September 1809 on Putney Heath. Canning, who had never before fired a pistol, widely missed his mark. Castlereagh, who was regarded as one of the best shots of his day, wounded his opponent in the thigh. There was much outrage that two cabinet ministers had resorted to such a method. Shortly afterwards the ailing Portland resigned as prime minister, and Canning offered himself to George III as a potential successor. The King appointed Spencer Perceval instead and Canning left office once more. He took consolation in the fact that Castlereagh also stood down.

Upon the Assassination of Spencer Perceval in 1812, the new prime minister, Lord Liverpool, offered Canning the position of foreign secretary once more. Canning refused, as he also wished to be Leader of the House of Commons and was reluctant to serve in any government with Castlereagh. Castlereagh was appointed foreign secretary by Liverpool, replacing Wellesley who had resigned. Castlereagh remained in the post until his suicide in 1822, overseeing British participation in the final years of the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna which redrew the map of Europe.

===Move to Burbage===
In April 1811, George moved the family from Castle Hill House in Hinckley to the nearby village of Burbage, where he took up residence in a house along Church Street, which in later years the house would become ‘Burbage Constitutional Club’.

===Ambassador to Lisbon===
In 1814 Canning became the British Ambassador to Portugal, recently liberated from the French by Wellington&#x27;s forces. He returned to Britain the following year. He received several further offers of office from Liverpool.

==President of the Board of Control==
In 1816 he became President of the Board of Control.

Canning resigned from office once more in 1820, in opposition to the treatment of Queen Caroline, estranged wife of the new King George IV. Public opinion strongly supported the Queen and thereby Canning was strengthened.

On 16 March 1821 Canning spoke in favour of William Plunket&#x27;s Catholic Emancipation Bill. Liverpool wished to have Canning back in the Cabinet but the King was strongly hostile to him due to his actions over the Caroline affair. The King would only allow Canning back into the Cabinet if he did not have to deal personally with him. This required the office of Governor-General of India. After deliberating on whether to accept, Canning initially declined the offer but then accepted it. On 25 April he spoke in the Commons against Lord John Russell&#x27;s motion for parliamentary reform and a few days later Canning moved for leave to introduce a measure of Catholic Emancipation (for lifting the exclusion of Catholics from the House of Lords). This passed the Commons but was rejected by the Lords.

==Foreign secretary and Leader of the House==

In August 1822, Castlereagh committed suicide. Instead of going to India, Canning succeeded him as both foreign secretary and Leader of the House of Commons. He gave support to the growing campaign for the abolition of slavery. Canning continued many of Castlereagh&#x27;s foreign policies, such as the view that the powers of Europe (Russia, France, etc.) should not be allowed to meddle in the affairs of other states. This policy enhanced public opinion of Canning as a liberal. He also prevented the United States from opening trade with the British West Indies.

===Southeast Asia===

Canning signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 which resolved outstanding matters from the previous treaty intended to redistribute colonies formerly administered by the Dutch East India Company in the East Indies, which had been seized during the Napoleonic Wars by the British East India Company owing to Britain&#x27;s position in the wake of the Napoleonic conquest of the Netherlands of recognising its holdings as hostile territory; the most violent conquest resulting from this policy was the 1811 invasion of Java led by Stamford Raffles. After the war, Raffles&#x27; extra-legal establishment of a trading post in Singapore, a vassal of the Dutch-backed Johor Sultanate, formed the flashpoint for the 1824 renegotiation.

This treaty&#x27;s impact has lasted until the present day, with the established borders essentially being those between the modern nation-states of Malaysia and Indonesia; Singapore also was ruled directly by the EIC from that point on, with the former arrangement of equal control between Sultan Hussein Shah, Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Resident of Singapore William Farquhar declared null and void in its aftermath.

===Latin America===
During his first period in the Foreign Office (1807–1809), Canning became deeply involved in the affairs of Spain, Portugal and Latin America. In his second term of office, he sought to prevent South America from coming into the French sphere of influence, and in this he was successful. He helped guarantee the independence of Brazil and the Spanish colonies, thereby acting in support of the Monroe Doctrine and aiding British merchants to open new markets across South and Central America.

Britain had a strong interest in ensuring the demise of Spanish colonialism, and opening the newly independent Latin American colonies to its trade. The Latin Americans received a certain amount of unofficial aid – arms and volunteers – from outside, but no outside official help at any stage from Britain or any other power. Britain refused to aid Spain and opposed any outside intervention on behalf of Spain by other powers. Royal Navy veterans were a decisive factor in the struggle for independence of certain Latin American countries.

In 1825 Mexico, Argentina and Colombia were recognised by means of the ratification of commercial treaties with Britain. In November 1825 the first minister from a Latin American state, Colombia, was officially received in London. &quot;Spanish America is free,&quot; Canning declared, &quot;and if we do not mismanage our affairs she is English ... the New World established and if we do not throw it away, ours.&quot; Also in 1825, Portugal recognised Brazil (thanks to Canning&#x27;s efforts, and in return for a preferential commercial treaty), less than three years after Brazil&#x27;s declaration of independence.

On 12 December 1826, in the House of Commons, Canning was given an opportunity to defend the policies he had adopted towards France, Spain and Spanish America, and declared: &quot;I resolved that if France had Spain it should not be Spain with the Indies. I called the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old.&quot;

By granting recognition to Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil he brought these new states into the European system of trade and diplomacy, while blocking further colonization. Recognition was greeted with enthusiasm throughout Latin America. Canning was the first British foreign secretary to devote a large proportion of his time and energies to the affairs of Latin America (as well as to those of Spain and Portugal) and to foresee the important political and economic role the Latin American states would one day play in the world.

At the Pan-American Centennial Conference of 1926 which took place in Panama City and celebrated the centenary of the South American movement to Independence, it was declared that:

In 1826 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Prime minister==


In 1827, Liverpool was forced to stand down as prime minister after suffering a severe stroke. He died the following year. Canning, as Liverpool&#x27;s right-hand man, was chosen by George IV to succeed him, in preference to the Duke of Wellington or Sir Robert Peel. Neither man agreed to serve under Canning, and they were followed by five other members of Liverpool&#x27;s Cabinet and 40 junior members of the government. The Tory party was now heavily split between the &quot;High Tories&quot; (or &quot;Ultras&quot;, nicknamed after the contemporary party in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called &quot;Canningites&quot;. Consequently Canning found it difficult to form a government, and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including Lord Lansdowne. The government agreed not to discuss the difficult question of parliamentary reform, which Canning opposed but the Whigs supported.

However, Canning&#x27;s health by this time was in steep decline: at the funeral of Frederick, Duke of York, which was held during a January night at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, he became so ill that it was thought he might not recover. He died from tuberculosis later that year, on 8 August 1827, in the room where Charles James Fox had died 21 years earlier. Canning&#x27;s total period in office was 119 days, the shortest of any prime minister of the United Kingdom who had formed a government until Liz Truss, who was forced to resign after 49 days in 2022. His last words were &quot;Spain and Portugal.&quot; Canning is buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Legacy==

Canning has come to be regarded as a &quot;lost leader&quot;, with much speculation about what his legacy could have been had he lived. His government of Tories and Whigs continued for a few months under Lord Goderich but fell apart in early 1828. It was succeeded by a government under the Duke of Wellington, which initially included some Canningites but soon became mostly &quot;High Tory&quot; when many of the Canningites drifted over to the Whigs. Wellington&#x27;s administration was soon defeated. Some historians have seen the revival of the Tories from the 1830s onwards, in the form of the Conservative Party, as the overcoming of the divisions of 1827. What would have been the course of events had Canning lived is highly speculative.

Rory Muir has described Canning as &quot;the most brilliant and colourful minister, and certainly the greatest orator in the government at a time when oratory was still politically important. He was a man of biting wit and invective, with immense confidence in his own ability, who often inspired either great friendship or deep dislike and distrust ... he was a passionate, active, committed man who poured his energy into whatever he undertook. This was his strength and also his weakness ... the government&#x27;s ablest minister&quot;. Greville recorded of Canning on the day after his death:

He wrote very fast, but not fast enough for his mind, composing much quicker than he could commit his ideas to paper. He could not bear to dictate, because nobody could write fast enough for him; but on one occasion, when he had gout in his hand and could not write, he stood by the fire and dictated at the same time a despatch on Greek affairs to George Bentinck and one on South American politics to Howard de Walden, each writing as fast as he could, while he turned from one to the other without hesitation or embarrassment.

Canning was the arch-enemy of the Concert of Europe system set up by the conservative powers at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Hayes says that in terms of foreign affairs:

Temperley summarises his policies, which formed the basis of British foreign policy for decades:

The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, negotiated by himself and Charles Williams-Wynn, is responsible for the borders of the modern nation-states of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

===Places named after Canning===
====Britain====
* The Canning Club, a gentlemen&#x27;s club in central London. Founded in 1911 as the Argentine Club for expatriate businessmen, it was renamed in 1948 as the club extended its remit to the rest of Latin America, in honour of Canning&#x27;s strong ties to the region. The club currently shares the premises of the Naval and Military Club in St. James&#x27;s Square.
* Canning House in Belgravia is the seat of the Hispanic and Luso Brazilian Council. It houses a research library and is used for a range of cultural and educational events.
* There are pubs (public houses) named after him. One in Brixton, on the corner of Effra Road and Brixton Water Lane, bore his name until it became the Hobgoblin in the late 1990s and the Hootenanny in 2008. Another in Camberwell, on Grove Lane near Denmark Hill station, is still called the George Canning.
* Canning Circus is an area at the top of Zion Hill in Nottingham. Canning Terrace was erected as almshouses and a gatehouse to the adjacent cemetery.

* Elsewhere in Australia, there is a street in Carlton North named after him.

====Canada====
* The village of Canning in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia

<text>The Battle of Scheveningen was the final naval battle of the First Anglo-Dutch War. It took place on July 31st 1653 between the fleets of the Commonwealth of England and the Dutch Republic. The Dutch fleet suffered heavy losses.

==Background==
After their victory at the Battle of the Gabbard in June 1653, the English fleet of 120 ships under General at Sea George Monck on his flagship &quot;Resolution&quot; blockaded the Dutch coast, capturing many merchant vessels. The Dutch economy began to collapse, with mass unemployment and a severe economic downturn affecting it. On 24 July, Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp put to sea in &quot;Brederode&quot; with a fleet of 100 ships, to lift the blockade at the island of Texel, where Vice-Admiral Witte de With&#x27;s 27 ships were blockaded by the English. Five days later, the English sighted Tromp and pursued to the south, sinking two Dutch ships before dark but allowing De With to slip out and rendezvous the next day with Tromp off Scheveningen, right next to the small village of Ter Heijde, after Tromp had positioned himself by some brilliant maneuvering to the north of the English fleet.

==Battle==
The winds were fierce on 30 July and overnight, giving both fleets pause. Around 7:00 a.m. on 31 July, the Dutch gained an advantage from the weather and attacked, led by &quot;Brederode&quot;. The fleets moved through each other four times. Tromp was killed early in the fight by a sharpshooter in the rigging of Sir William Penn&#x27;s ship. His death was kept secret to keep up the morale of the Dutch but by late afternoon, twelve of their ships had either been sunk or captured and many were too damaged to continue the fight. In the end, morale broke and a large group of vessels under the command of merchant captains fled to the north. De With tried to halt their flight but had to limit himself to covering the retreat to the island of Texel. The English fleet was also badly damaged and with many wounded in urgent need of treatment, returned to port to refit and were unable to maintain the blockade.

==Aftermath==
Both sides claimed a victory: the English because of their tactical superiority, the Dutch because the strategic goal of their attack, the lifting of the blockade, had been achieved. However, Tromp&#x27;s death was a severe blow to the Dutch – few now expected to beat the English; the Orangist faction lost political influence and Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt was willing to give formal treaty assurances to Cromwell that the infant William III of Orange would never become stadtholder, thus turning the Netherlands into a base for a Stuart restoration. Peace negotiations began in earnest, leading to the 1654 Treaty of Westminster.

The damage done to the Dutch fleet effectively ended the first war.

<doc id="197233" wikidata="Q319196" url="?curid=197233" title="China Miéville">
<text>China Tom Miéville ( , born 6 September 1972) is a British speculative fiction writer and literary critic. He often describes his work as &quot;weird fiction&quot;, and is allied to the loosely associated movement of writers called New Weird.

Miéville has won multiple awards for his fiction, including the Arthur C. Clarke Award, British Fantasy Award, BSFA Award, Hugo Award, Locus Award, and World Fantasy Awards. He holds the record for the most Arthur C. Clarke Award wins (three). His novel &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; was ranked by &quot;Locus&quot; as the 6th best fantasy novel published in the 20th century. During 2012–13, he was writer-in-residence at Roosevelt University in Chicago. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2015.

Miéville is active in left politics in the UK and has previously been a member of the International Socialist Organization (US) and the short-lived International Socialist Network (UK). He was formerly a member of the Socialist Workers Party, and in 2013 became a founding member of Left Unity. He stood for Regent&#x27;s Park and Kensington North for the Socialist Alliance in the 2001 United Kingdom general election, gaining 1.2% of votes cast.

== Early life and education==
Miéville was born in Norwich and brought up in Willesden, and has lived in London since early childhood. Miéville&#x27;s parents separated soon after his birth, and he has said that he &quot;never really knew&quot; his father. He grew up with his sister Jemima and mother Claudia. His mother was a translator, writer and teacher, and the daughter of Leo Claude Vaux Miéville, whose wife Youla (née Harrison) was granddaughter of Edward Littleton, 4th Baron Hatherton. His parents chose his first name, China, from a dictionary, looking for a beautiful name. By virtue of his mother&#x27;s nationality, Miéville holds US citizenship in addition to British citizenship. In 1982 his mother married Paul Lightfoot, a maternal descendant of George Charles Mostyn, 6th Baron Vaux of Harrowden; they divorced in 1992.

Miéville boarded at Oakham School, a co-educational independent school in Oakham, Rutland, for two years. He subsequently attended University College School. At the age of eighteen, in 1990, he taught English for a year in Egypt, where he developed an interest in Arab culture and in Middle Eastern politics. Miéville studied for a BA degree in social anthropology at Clare College, Cambridge, graduating in 1994, and gained both a master&#x27;s degree and PhD in international law from the London School of Economics in 2001. Miéville has also held a Frank Knox fellowship at Harvard University. After becoming dissatisfied with the ability of post-modern theories to explain history and political events, he became a Marxist at university. A book version of his PhD thesis, entitled &quot;Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law&quot;, was published in the UK in 2005 by Brill in their &quot;Historical Materialism&quot; series, and in the United States in 2006 by Haymarket Books.

== Literary influences ==
Miéville&#x27;s works all describe fantastical or supernatural worlds or scenarios. Miéville has said he plans to write a novel in every genre. To this end, he has &quot;constructed an oeuvre&quot; that ranges from classic American Western (in &quot;Iron Council&quot;) to sea-quest (in &quot;The Scar&quot; and &quot;Railsea&quot;) to detective noir (in &quot;The City &amp; the City&quot;). His work has been described as new weird fiction.

Miéville has listed M. John Harrison, Michael de Larrabeiti, Michael Moorcock, Thomas M. Disch, Charles Williams, Tim Powers, and J. G. Ballard as literary &quot;heroes&quot;; he has also frequently discussed as influences H. P. Lovecraft, Mervyn Peake, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Gene Wolfe. He has said that he would like his novels &quot;to be read for [his imagined city] New Crobuzon as Iain Sinclair does for London&quot;. Miéville has admitted that his books contain some allusions to Russian writers, including Andrei Platonov, Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and .

Miéville played a great deal of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and similar roleplaying games (RPGs) in his youth. He has attributed his tendency to systematisation of magic and theology to this influence. In his novel &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot;, he refers to characters interested &quot;only in gold and experience&quot;. The February 2007 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine interpreted the world presented in his books according to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. The &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for the fifth edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons cited his novel &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; as a source of inspiration for the game&#x27;s designers.

In 2010, Miéville made his first foray into writing for RPGs with a contribution to the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot; supplement &quot;Guide to the River Kingdoms&quot;.

Miéville once described Tolkien as &quot;the wen on the arse of fantasy literature&quot;. Miéville is also indebted to Moorcock, having cited his essay &quot;Epic Pooh&quot; as the source upon which he is &quot;riffing&quot; or even simply &quot;cheerleading&quot; in his critique of Tolkien-imitative fantasy. Despite his criticisms, Miéville has praised Tolkien for his contributions to fantasy, especially in a 2009 blog post where he gave five reasons why Tolkien was praiseworthy.

He has cited Michael de Larrabeiti&#x27;s &quot;Borrible Trilogy&quot; as one of his biggest influences, and he wrote an introduction for the trilogy&#x27;s 2002 reissue (the introduction was eventually left out of the book, but appears on de Larrabeiti&#x27;s website).

== Politics ==
Miéville has previously been a member of the International Socialist Organization (US) and, until 13 March 2013, was also a member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP, UK). He stood unsuccessfully for the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in the 2001 general election as a candidate for the Socialist Alliance, gaining 459 votes, equivalent to 1.2%, in Regent&#x27;s Park and Kensington North, a Labour constituency.

In January 2013, he emerged as a critic of the SWP&#x27;s leadership and in March resigned over the leadership&#x27;s handling of rape allegations against a leading SWP member.

In August 2013, Miéville was one of nine signatories (along with veteran film-maker and socialist Ken Loach, academic Gilbert Achcar, General Secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson, fellow novelist Michael Rosen, and actor Roger Lloyd Pack) of an open letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; announcing the foundation of a &quot;new party of the left&quot;, to be called Left Unity. The letter, which claimed that Labour policies on austerity and the breaking of ties with trades unions amounted to a &quot;final betrayal of the working-class people it was founded to represent&quot;, stated that Left Unity would be launched at a &quot;founding conference&quot; in London on 30 November 2013 and would provide, as an &quot;alternative&quot; to Labour, &quot;a party that is socialist, environmentalist, feminist and opposed to all forms of discrimination&quot;.

In 2014, together with Richard Seymour and others, Miéville quit the International Socialist Network, a Left Unity faction, over a dispute concerning the acceptability of sexual &quot;race play&quot; that was prompted by discussion of a controversial art piece owned by Dasha Zhukova.

In 2015, he was announced as one of the founding editors of a &quot;bi-annual journal of revolutionary arts and letters&quot;, &quot;Salvage&quot;. He has been the director of Salvage Publications since 2014.

&quot;October&quot;, published in 2017, documents the dramatic events of the Russian revolution. Jonathan Steele reviewed it for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Steele considers it an ideological though nuanced retelling: &quot;Known as a left-wing activist, [...] Miéville writes with the brio and excitement of an enthusiast who would have wanted the revolution to succeed. But he is primarily interested in the dramatic narrative – the weird facts – of the most turbulent year in Russia&#x27;s history&quot;.

In a letter to Joybrato Mukherjee on 22 April 2024, Miéville rejected his nomination for a DAAD fellowship, citing Mukherjee&#x27;s role in the cancelling of Jewish-American political theorist Nancy Fraser&#x27;s Albertus Magnus Professorship at the University of Cologne because Fraser signed a pro-Palestine letter during the Hamas-Israel war, and his lack of &quot;faith that the institution will stand against such a shameful program of repression and anti-Palestinian racism.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In the early 2000s, Miéville lived in London with his partner Emma Bircham. They were both cast as extras in the 1999 film &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, which he jokingly described as a dystopian alternate history of an ethnically cleansed city.

In 2013, Miéville denied allegations of emotional abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. He acknowledged having had a brief affair with the woman, but stated that her account of it was untrue. According to Miéville, he was in a non-monogamous relationship at the time, about which she was aware.

Since 2018, he has taken steps to defend his privacy, following what he described as a campaign of harassment and online defamation.

Miéville is married to artist Season Butler.

* American artist Mariam Ghani&#x27;s &quot;The City &amp; The City&quot; (2015), is a loose adaptation of the novel &quot;The City &amp; the City&quot; as a video artwork which &quot;maps the conceptual framework of that novel onto the cityscape of St. Louis, melding some of the fictions of the novel&#x27;s world with elements drawn from past and present histories of the city.&quot;
* The short story &quot;Estate&quot; (collected in &quot;Three Moments of an Explosion: Stories&quot; ) was adapted into a 25-minute movie, released on August 14, 2020, that was described by a review in SciFiNow as &quot;a 25 minute blast of striking imagery, earnest performances and intriguing themes.&quot;

<doc id="197236" wikidata="Q19070" url="?curid=197236" title="Cynara">
<text>Cynara is a genus of thistle-like perennial plants in the family Asteraceae. They are native to the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, northwestern Africa, and the Canary Islands. The genus name comes from the Greek &quot;kynara&quot;, which means &quot;artichoke&quot;.

Among the better known species in this genus include:

* &quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot; is the cardoon, artichoke thistle, or wild artichoke. The stems of cultivated varieties are used as food around the Mediterranean. It is also the source of a coagulant used as an alternative to rennet in the manufacture of cheese, with the advantage that the cheese is then fully suitable for vegetarians; many southern European cheeses are traditionally made in this way. The more commonly eaten globe artichoke is usually considered to be an ancient cultigen of this plant. Cardoon is an invasive species in United States, Argentina, and Australia.
* &quot;Cynara humilis&quot; is a wild thistle of southern Europe and north Africa which can be used in cheesemaking like &quot;C. cardunculus&quot;.
* &quot;Cynara scolymus&quot; (syn. &quot;C. cardunculus&quot; var. &quot;scolymus&quot;) is the common edible globe artichoke. It differs from &quot;C. cardunculus&quot; in that the leaf lobes and inner bracts of involucre are less spiny.
* &quot;Cynara cornigera&quot; leaves and flowers are eaten raw or cooked in Crete.

&quot;Cynara&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of many lepidopterans, such as the artichoke plume moth (&quot;Platyptilia carduidactyla&quot;), a pest of artichoke crops.

&quot;C. cardunculus &quot;is being developed as a new bioenergy crop in the Mediterranean because of its high biomass and seed oil yields even under harsh conditions.

<text>A career is an individual&#x27;s metaphorical &quot;journey&quot; through learning, work and other aspects of life. There are a number of ways to define career and the term is used in a variety of ways.

==Definitions ==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;career&quot; as a person&#x27;s &quot;course or progress through life (or a distinct portion of life)&quot;. This definition relates &quot;career&quot; to a range of aspects of an individual&#x27;s life, learning, and work. &quot;Career&quot; is also frequently understood to relate to the working aspects of an individual&#x27;s life - as in &quot;career woman&quot;, for example. A third way in which the term &quot;career&quot; is used describes an occupation or a profession that usually involves specific training and/or formal education, considered to be a person&#x27;s lifework. In this case &quot;a career&quot; is seen as a sequence of related jobs, usually pursued within a single industry or sector: one can speak for example of &quot;a career in education&quot;, of &quot;a criminal career&quot; or of &quot;a career in the building trade&quot;. A career has been defined by organizational behavior researchers as &quot;an individual&#x27;s work-related and other relevant experiences, both inside and outside of organizations, that form a unique pattern over the individual&#x27;s life span.&quot;

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;career&quot; ultimately derives from Latin &quot;carrus&quot;, referring to a chariot.

The Online Etymology Dictionary claims the semantic extension whereby &quot;career&quot; came to mean &quot;course of one&#x27;s public or professional life&quot; appears from 1803. It is used in dozens of books published in the year 1800, in reference to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;literary career,&quot; other biographical figures&#x27; &quot;business career&quot; and &quot;professional career,&quot; so the phrase likely was in regular use by the year 1800.

==Historic changes in careers==
For a pre-modernist notion of &quot;career&quot;, compare cursus honorum.

By the late 20th century, a wide range of variations (especially in the range of potential professions) and more widespread education had allowed it to become possible to plan (or design) a career: In this respect the careers of the career counselor and of the career advisor have grown up. It is also not uncommon for adults in the late 20th/early 21st centuries to have dual or multiple careers, either sequentially or concurrently. Thus, professional identities have become hyphenated or hybridized to reflect this shift in work ethic. Economist Richard Florida notes this trend generally and more specifically among the &quot;creative class&quot;.

==Career management==
Career management or career development describes the active and purposeful management of a career by an individual. Ideas of what comprise &quot;career management skills&quot; are described by the Blueprint model (in the United States, Canada, Australia, Scotland, and England) and the Seven C&#x27;s of Digital Career Literacy (specifically relating to the Internet skills).

Key skills include the ability to reflect on one&#x27;s current career, research the labour market, determine whether education is necessary, find openings, and make career changes.

===Career choice===

According to Behling and others, an individual&#x27;s decision to join a firm may depend on any of the three factors viz. objective factor, subjective factor and critical contact.

* Objective factor theory assumes that the applicants are rational. The choice, therefore, is exercised after an objective assessment of the tangible benefits of the job. Factors may include the salary, other benefits, location, opportunities for career advancement, etc.
* Subjective factor theory suggests that decision making is dominated by social and psychological factors. The status of the job, reputation of the organization, and other similar factors plays an important role.
* Critical contact theory advances the idea that a candidate&#x27;s observations while interacting with the organization plays a vital role in decision making. For example, how the recruiter keeps in touch with the candidate, the promptness of response and similar factors are important. This theory is more valid with experienced professionals.

These theories assume that candidates have a free choice of employers and careers. In reality, the scarcity of jobs and strong competition for desirable jobs severely skews the decision-making process. In many markets, employees work particular careers simply because they were forced to accept whatever work was available to them. Additionally, Ott-Holland and colleagues found that culture can have a major influence on career choice, depending on the type of culture.

When choosing a career that&#x27;s best for you, according to US News, there are multiple things to consider. Some of those include: natural talents, work style, social interaction, work–life balance, whether or not you are looking to give back, whether you are comfortable in the public eye, dealing with stress or not, and finally, how much money you want to make. If choosing a career feels like too much pressure, here&#x27;s another option: pick a path that feels right today by making the best decision you can, and know that you can change your mind in the future. In today&#x27;s workplace, choosing a career doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you have to stick with that line of work for your entire life. Make a smart decision, and plan to re-evaluate down the line based on your long-term objectives.

===Career (occupation) changing===
Changing occupation is an important aspect of career and career management. Over a lifetime, both the individual and the labour market will change; it is to be expected that many people will change occupations during their lives. Data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics through the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in 1979 showed that individuals between the ages of 18 and 38 will hold more than 10 jobs.

There are various reasons why people might want to change their careers. Sometimes career change can come as the result of a long-anticipated layoff, while other times it can occur unexpectedly and without warning.

A survey conducted by Right Management suggests the following reasons for career changing.
*The downsizing or the restructuring of an organization (54%).
*New challenges or opportunities that arise (30%).
*Poor or ineffective leadership (25%).
*Having a poor relationship with a manager(s) (22%).
*For the improvement of work/life balance (21%).
*Contributions are not being recognized (21%).
*For better compensation and benefits (18%),
*For better alignment with personal and organizational values (17%).
*Personal strengths and capabilities are not a good fit with an organization (16%).
*The financial instability of an organization (13%).
*An organization relocated (12%).

According to an article on Time.com, one out of three people currently employed (as of 2008) spends about an hour per day searching for another position.

== Career success ==
Career success is a term used frequently in academic and popular writing about career. It refers to the extent and ways in which an individual can be described as successful in his or her working life so far.

During the 1950s and 1960s, individuals typically worked for one or two firms during their career and success was defined by the organization and measured by promotions, increases in salary, and/or status. Such traditional careers were exemplified by Donald Super&#x27;s career stage model. Super&#x27;s linear career stage model suggested that careers take place within the context of stable, organizational structures. Individuals moved up the organization&#x27;s hierarchy seeking greater extrinsic rewards.

Early career success may breed disappointment later, especially when a person&#x27;s self-worth is tied up in their career or achievements. Professional success tends to come early in some fields, such as scientific research, and later in other fields, such as teaching.

Earnings can be expressed either in absolute terms (e.g. the amount a person earns) or in relative terms (e.g. the amount a person earns compared with their starting salary). Earnings and status are examples of objective criteria of success, where &quot;objective&quot; means that they can be factually verified, and are not purely a matter of opinion.

Many observers argue that careers are less predictable than they once were, due to the fast pace of economic and technological change. This means that career management is more obviously the responsibility of the individual rather than his or her employing organisation, because a &quot;job for life&quot; is a thing of the past. This has put more emphasis on subjective criteria of career success. These include job satisfaction, career satisfaction, work-life balance, a sense of personal achievement, and attaining work that is consistent with one&#x27;s personal values. A person&#x27;s assessment of his or her career success is likely to be influenced by social comparisons, such as how well family members, friends, or contemporaries at school or college have done.

The amount and type of career success a person achieves is affected by several forms of career capital. These include social capital (the extent and depth of personal contacts a person can draw upon), human capital (demonstrable abilities, experiences and qualifications), economic capital (money and other material resources which permit access to career-related resources), and cultural capital (having skills, attitudes or general know-how to operate effectively in a particular social context).

==Career support==
There are a range of different educational, counseling, and human resource management interventions that can support individuals to develop and manage their careers. Career support is commonly offered while people are in education, when they are transitioning to the labour market, when they are changing career, during periods of unemployment, and during transition to retirement. Support may be offered by career professionals, other professionals or by non-professionals such as family and friends. Professional career support is sometimes known as &quot;career guidance&quot; as in the OECD definition of career guidance:

However this use of the term &quot;career guidance&quot; can be confusing as the term is also commonly used to describe the activities of career counselors.

===Provision of career support===
Career support is offered by a range of different mechanisms. Much career support is informal and provided through personal networks or existing relationships such as management. There is a market for private career support however the bulk of career support that exists as a professionalised activity is provided by the public sector.

===Types of career support===
Key types of career support include: 
*Career information describes information that supports career and learning choices. An important sub-set of career information is labour market information (LMI), such as salaries of various professions, employment rate in various professions, available training programs, and current job openings.
*Career assessments are tests that come in a variety of forms and rely on both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Career assessments can help individuals identify and better articulate their unique interests, personality, values, and skills to determine how well they may match with a certain career. Some skills that career assessments could help determine are job-specific skills, transferable skills, and self-management skills. Career assessments can also provide a window of potential opportunities by helping individuals discover the tasks, experience, education and training that is needed for a career they would want to pursue. Career counselors, executive coaches, educational institutions, career development centers, and outplacement companies often administer career assessments to help individuals focus their search on careers that closely match their unique personal profile.
*Career counseling assesses people&#x27;s interests, personality, values and skills, and helps them to explore career options and research graduate and professional schools. Career counseling provides one-on-one or group professional assistance in exploration and decision making tasks related to choosing a major/occupation, transitioning into the world of work or further professional training.
*Career education describes a process by which individuals come to learn about themselves, their careers and the world of work. There is a strong tradition of career education in schools, however career education can also occur in a wider range of other contexts including further and higher education and the workplace. A commonly used framework for careers education is DOTS which stands for decision learning (D), opportunity awareness (O), transition learning (T), and self-awareness (S). Oftentimes, higher education is thought of as being too narrow or too researched based and lacking of a deeper understanding of the material to develop the skills necessary for a certain career.

Some research shows adding one year of schooling beyond high school creates an increase of wages 17.8% per worker. However, additional years of schooling, beyond 9 or 10 years, have little effect on worker&#x27;s wages. In summary, better educated, bigger benefits. In 2010, 90% of the U.S. Workforce had a high school diploma, 64% had some college, and 34% had at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The common problem that people may encounter when trying to achieve an education for a career is the cost. The career that comes with the education must pay well enough to be able to pay off the schooling. The benefits of schooling can differ greatly depending on the degree (or certification) obtained, the programs the school may offer, and the ranking of the school. Sometimes, colleges provide students more with just education to prepare for careers. It is not uncommon for colleges to provide pathways and support straight into the workforce the students may desire.

Much career support is delivered face-to-face, but an increasing amount of career support is delivered online.

<doc id="197248" wikidata="Q1133962" url="?curid=197248" title="Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier">
<text>Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier (6 October 161017 November 1690), was a French soldier and, from 1668 to 1680, the governor of the dauphin, the eldest son and heir of Louis XIV, King of France.

==Biography==
Charles was born on 6 October 1610, the second son of Léon de Sainte-Maure, Baron of Montausier. His parents were Huguenots, and he was educated at the Protestant Academy of Sedan under Pierre Du Moulin. He served brilliantly at the siege of Casale in 1629. Becoming baron de Montausier at the death of his elder brother in 1635, he was the recognised aspirant for the hand of Julie d&#x27;Angennes, the eldest daughter of the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet. Having served under Bernard of Saxe-Weimar in Germany in 1634, he returned to the French service in 1636, and fought in the Rhenish campaigns of the following years. He was taken prisoner on 25 November 1643 after the defeat of the French forces under the command of Josias von Rantzau in the Battle of Tuttlingen. He remained for ten months in captivity until payment of his ransom was made. 

On his return to France, he became a lieutenant-general. On 15 July 1645, he married Julie d&#x27;Angennes, &quot;the incomparable Julie&quot;, thus terminating a 14-year courtship famous in the annals of French literature because of the &quot;Guirlande de Julie&quot;, a garland of 61 madrigals by 19 poets, among them Montausier, Claude de Malleville, Georges de Scudéry, possibly Pierre Corneille (if Octave Uzanne is correct in the attribution of three of the six poems signed M.C.), Philippe Habert, Simon Arnauld de Pomponne, Jean Desmarets de Saint Sorlin, Antoine Gombaud (&quot;Le nain de la Princesse Julie&quot;) and others. It was copied by the famous calligraphist Nicolas Jarry in a magnificent manuscript, on each page of which was a flower painted by Nicolas Robert, and was presented to Julie on her &quot;fête&quot; day in 1641.

Montausier was named governor of Saintonge and Angoumois after the death of his uncle, the comte de Brassac, and became a Roman Catholic before his marriage. During the Fronde, he remained faithful to the Crown in spite of personal grievances against Mazarin. On the conclusion of peace in 1653, the marquis, who had been severely wounded in 1652, obtained high favour at court in spite of the roughness of his manners and the general austerity which made the Parisian public recognize him as the original of &quot;Alceste&quot; in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Misanthrope&quot;.

Montausier received from Louis XIV the Order of the Saint Esprit and the government of Normandy. In 1664, the marquisate of Montausier was erected into a &quot;duché-pairie&quot;). In 1668, Montausier became the governor of the dauphin, a post he kept until 1680. He initiated the series of classics &quot;ad usum Delphini&quot;, directed by the learned Huet, and gave the closest attention to the education of his charge, who was moved by his iron discipline only to a hatred of learning. Montausier died on 17 November 1690.

Court gossip assigned part of Montausier&#x27;s favour to the complaisance of his wife, who had been named &quot;gouvernante des enfants de France&quot; in 1661, at the time of the dauphin&#x27;s birth, until 1664, when she was appointed lady-in-waiting to the queen, a position she used to facilitate Louis XIV&#x27;s passion for Louise de la Vallière, and subsequently to protect Madame de Montespan, who found refuge from her husband with her.

<doc id="197250" wikidata="Q1278441" url="?curid=197250" title="Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse">
<text>Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse is situated on South East Point, Wilsons Promontory, Victoria, Australia. From its point on the peninsula, it commands almost 360° views of Bass Strait. The Wilson&#x27;s Promontory lighthouse is the southernmost lighthouse on mainland Australia, and is approximately from the nearest town, Tidal River. Dormitory-style accommodation is available in the lighthouse.

The lighthouse protects shipping travelling through Bass Strait. The Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse is the main part of the Wilsons Promontory Lightstation.

==History==
The lighthouse was constructed with the use of convict labour over a period of approximately seven years starting in 1853 through to completion in 1859. The lighthouse stands tall and along with the keeper&#x27;s cottage is constructed from local granite. From 1869 to 1878 the lighthouse keeper was Captain Thomas Musgrave.

<text>Esprit Fléchier (10 June 163216 February 1710) was a French preacher and author, Bishop of Nîmes from 1687 to 1710.

==Biography==
Fléchier was born at Pernes-les-Fontaines, in today&#x27;s &quot;département&quot; of Vaucluse, in the then Comtat Venaissin, the son of Pierre-Michel Fléchier and Marguerite Audifret. He was baptized on 19 June 1632. He first went to school in Pernes and later to the &quot;Collège&quot; of Tarascon, which was run by the Congrégation des Doctrinaires, of which his uncle Hercule Audiffret was the superior.

Fléchier then entered the Congrégation des Doctrinaires as a &quot;novice&quot; on 25 August 1647 in Avignon, and pronounced his vows on 30 August 1648. At the age of 17, he went to teach humanities during four years in Tarascon and in Draguignan. He then moved to Narbonne, where he taught and stayed for six years until mid-1659.

Fléchier then went to Paris to meet his dying uncle Hercule Audiffret, but arrived after his death (16 April 1659). He left the order around the end of 1959, shortly after the death of his uncle, owing to the strictness of its rules. In Paris, he devoted himself to writing poetry. His French poems met with little success, but a description in Latin verse of a tournament (, ), given by Louis XIV around 1662, brought him a great reputation.

Fléchier subsequently became tutor to Louis Urbain Lefebvre de Caumartin, afterwards intendant of finances and counsellor of state, whom he accompanied to Clermont-Ferrand, where the king had ordered the &quot;Grands Jours&quot; to be held (1665), and where Caumartin was sent as representative of the sovereign. There, Fléchier wrote his curious &quot;Mémoires sur les Grand jours tenus à Clermont&quot;, in which he relates, in a half romantic, half historical form, the proceedings of this extraordinary court of justice.

In 1668, the duke of Montausier procured for him the post of &quot;lecteur&quot; to the Dauphin. The sermons of Fléchier increased his reputation, which was afterwards raised to the highest pitch by his funeral orations. The most important are those on the duchesse de Montausier (1672), which gained him the membership of the Académie française, the duchesse d&#x27;Aiguillon (1675), and, above all, Marshal Turenne (1676). He was now firmly established in the favour of the king, who gave him successively the abbacy of Saint-Séverin, in the diocese of Poitiers, the office of almoner to the Dauphine, and in 1685 the bishopric of Lavaur, from which he was in 1687 promoted to that of Nîmes. The edict of Nantes had been repealed two years before; but the Calvinists were still very numerous at Nîmes. Fléchier, by his leniency and tact, succeeded in bringing over some of them to his views, and even gained the esteem of those who declined to change their faith.

During the troubles in the Cévennes he softened to the utmost of his power the rigour of the edicts, and showed himself so indulgent even to what he regarded as error, that his memory was long held in veneration amongst the Protestants of that district. It is right to add, however, that some authorities consider the accounts of his leniency to have been greatly exaggerated, and even charge him with going beyond what the edicts permitted. He died at Montpellier.

==Académie Française==
Esprit Fléchier was elected at the &quot;Académie française&quot; on 5 December 1672, as a successor of Antoine Godeau. He entered the &quot;Académie&quot; on 12 January 1673, the same day as Jean Racine and Jean Gallois.

==Literary style==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, pulpit eloquence is the branch of &quot;belles-lettres&quot; in which Fléchier excelled. He is indeed far below Bossuet, whose robust and sublime genius had no rival in that age; he does not equal Bourdaloue in earnestness of thought and vigour of expression; nor can he rival the philosophical depth or the insinuating and impressive eloquence of Jean-Baptiste Massillon. But he is always ingenious, often witty, and nobody has carried farther than he the harmony of diction, sometimes marred by an affectation of symmetry and an excessive use of antithesis. His two historical works, the histories of Theodosius I and of Ximenes, are more remarkable for elegance of style than for accuracy and comprehensive insight.

<doc id="197253" wikidata="Q1468211" url="?curid=197253" title="Borůvka's algorithm">
<text>Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm is a greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph,
or a minimum spanning forest in the case of a graph that is not connected.

It was first published in 1926 by Otakar Borůvka as a method of constructing an efficient electricity network for Moravia.
The algorithm was rediscovered by Choquet in 1938; again by Florek, Łukasiewicz, Perkal, Steinhaus, and Zubrzycki in 1951; and again by Georges Sollin in 1965. This algorithm is frequently called Sollin&#x27;s algorithm, especially in the parallel computing literature.

The algorithm begins by finding the minimum-weight edge incident to each vertex of the graph, and adding all of those edges to the forest.
Then, it repeats a similar process of finding the minimum-weight edge from each tree constructed so far to a different tree, and adding all of those edges to the forest.
Each repetition of this process reduces the number of trees, within each connected component of the graph, to at most half of this former value,
so after logarithmically many repetitions the process finishes. When it does, the set of edges it has added forms the minimum spanning forest.

== Pseudocode ==

The following pseudocode illustrates a basic implementation of Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm.
In the conditional clauses, every edge &quot;uv&quot; is considered cheaper than &quot;None&quot;. The purpose of the &quot;completed&quot; variable is to determine whether the forest &quot;F&quot; is yet a spanning forest.

If edges do not have distinct weights, then a consistent tie-breaking rule must be used, e.g. based on some total order on vertices or edges.
This can be achieved by representing vertices as integers and comparing them directly; comparing their memory addresses; etc.
A tie-breaking rule is necessary to ensure that the created graph is indeed a forest, that is, it does not contain cycles. For example, consider a triangle graph with nodes {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;} and all edges of weight 1. Then a cycle could be created if we select &quot;ab&quot; as the minimal weight edge for {&quot;a&quot;}, &quot;bc&quot; for {&quot;b&quot;}, and &quot;ca&quot; for {&quot;c&quot;}.
A tie-breaking rule which orders edges first by source, then by destination, will prevent creation of a cycle, resulting in the minimal spanning tree {&quot;ab&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;}.

 algorithm Borůvka is

As an optimization, one could remove from &quot;G&quot; each edge that is found to connect two vertices in the same component, so that it does not contribute to the time for searching for cheapest edges in later components.

== Complexity ==

Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm can be shown to take iterations of the outer loop until it terminates, and therefore to run in time , where is the number of edges, and is the number of vertices in (assuming ). In planar graphs, and more generally in families of graphs closed under graph minor operations, it can be made to run in linear time, by removing all but the cheapest edge between each pair of components after each stage of the algorithm.

== Example ==

== Other algorithms ==

Other algorithms for this problem include Prim&#x27;s algorithm and Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm. Fast parallel algorithms can be obtained by combining Prim&#x27;s algorithm with Borůvka&#x27;s.

A faster randomized minimum spanning tree algorithm based in part on Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm due to Karger, Klein, and Tarjan runs in expected time. The best known (deterministic) minimum spanning tree algorithm by Bernard Chazelle is also based in part on Borůvka&#x27;s and runs in time, where α is the inverse Ackermann function. These randomized and deterministic algorithms combine steps of Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm, reducing the number of components that remain to be connected, with steps of a different type that reduce the number of edges between pairs of components.

<text>Brian Walton (160029 November 1661) was an English Anglican priest, divine and scholar. He is mostly remembered for his polyglot Bible.

==Life==
Walton was born at Seymour, in the district of Cleveland, Yorkshire. His early education was at the Newcastle Royal Free Grammar School. He went up to Cambridge as a sizar of Magdalene College in 1616, migrated to Peterhouse in 1618, was bachelor in 1619 and Master of Arts in 1623. After holding a school mastership at Suffolk and two curacies (the second as curate of All-hallows, Bread Street), he was made rector of St Martin&#x27;s Ongar in London, and of Sandon, in Essex, in 1626. At St Martin&#x27;s Ongar he took a leading part in the contest between the London clergy and the citizens about the city tithes, and compiled a treatise on the subject, which is printed in Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Collectanea&quot; (1752). His conduct in this matter displayed his ability, but his zeal for the exaction of ecclesiastical dues was remembered in 1641 in the articles brought against him in parliament, which appear to have led to the sequestration of his very considerable preferments. He was also charged with Popish practices, but on frivolous grounds, and with aspersing the members of parliament for the city. His arms were: &quot;Three geese passant close&quot;.

He was buried in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, but the grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. His name appears on a modern monument in the crypt, listing important graves lost in the fire.

==&quot;Polyglot Bible&quot;==

The proposals for the &quot;Polyglot&quot; appeared in 1652. The book itself came out in six great folios. The first volume appeared in September 1654; the second in July 1655; the third in July 1656; and the last three in 1657. Nine languages are used: Hebrew, Aramaic, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Ethiopic, Greek and Latin. Among his collaborators were James Ussher, John Lightfoot and Edward Pococke, Edmund Castell, Abraham Wheelocke and Patrick Young, Thomas Hyde and Thomas Greaves. The great undertaking was the first in England supported by subscription - £50 each. Walton&#x27;s political opinions did not deprive him of the help of the Commonwealth; the paper used was freed from duty, and the interest of Cromwell in the work was acknowledged in the original preface, part of which was afterwards cancelled to make way for more loyal expressions towards that restored monarchy under which Oriental studies in England immediately began to languish. Two versions of the work, one dedicated to Cromwell, and the other known as the &quot;Loyal&quot; one. To Walton himself, however, the Restoration brought no disappointment: he was elected Bishop of Chester on 19 October 1660, confirmed to that See 22 November, and consecrated a bishop on 2 December 1660. In the following spring he was one of the commissioners at the Savoy Conference, but took little part in the business. In the autumn of 1661 he paid a short visit to his diocese, and returning to London he died.

According to an assessment in Chisholm (1911):

<text>Edmund Castell (1606–1686) was an English orientalist.

He was born at Tadlow, in Cambridgeshire. At the age of fifteen he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, gaining his BA in 1624-5 and his MA in 1628. Appointed Professor of Arabic in 1666, with the full title &#x27;Sir Thomas Adams Professor of Arabic&#x27;. He moved to St John&#x27;s in 1671, because of the valuable library there. His great work, the &quot;Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum&quot; (1669), took him eighteen years to complete, working (according to his own account) from sixteen to eighteen hours a day. He employed fourteen assistants on the project, and spent £12,000, ruining himself in the process as there was little demand for his finished lexicon.

By 1667, he found himself in prison because he was unable to discharge his brother&#x27;s debts, for which he had made himself liable. However, a volume of poems dedicated to the king brought him preferment. He was made prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral and professor of Arabic at Cambridge. Before undertaking the &quot;Lexicon Heptaglotton&quot;, Castell had helped Dr Brian Walton in the preparation of his &quot;Polyglott Bible&quot;. He died at Higham Gobion, Bedfordshire, where he was rector, and is buried there. He bequeathed his manuscripts to the University of Cambridge.

The Syriac section of the &quot;Lexicon&quot; was issued separately at Göttingen in 1788 by J.D. Michaelis, who made a tribute to Castell&#x27;s learning and industry. Johann Friedrich Ludolf Trier published the Hebrew section in 1790–1792.

<text>John Lightfoot (29 March 1602 – 6 December 1675) was an English churchman, rabbinical scholar, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge and Master of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

== Life ==

He was born in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Thomas Lightfoot, vicar of Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. He was educated at Morton Green near Congleton, Cheshire, and at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was regarded as the best orator among the undergraduates. After taking his degree he became assistant master at Repton School in Derbyshire; after taking orders, he was appointed curate of &quot;Norton-under-Hales&quot; (i.e. Norton in Hales) in Shropshire. There he attracted the notice of Sir Rowland Cotton, an amateur Hebraist, who made him his domestic chaplain at Bellaport. Shortly after the removal of Sir Rowland to London, Lightfoot, abandoning an intention to go abroad, accepted a charge at Stone, Staffordshire, where he continued for about two years. From Stone he removed to Hornsey, near London, for the sake of reading in the library of Sion College.

In September 1630 he was presented by Cotton to the rectory of Ashley, Staffordshire, where he remained until June 1642. He then went to London, probably to supervise the publication of his work, &quot;A Few and New Observations upon the Book of Genesis: the most of them certain; the rest, probable; all, harmless, strange and rarely heard of before&quot;. Soon after his arrival in London he became minister of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, near the Exchange.

Lightfoot was one of the original members of the Westminster Assembly; his &quot;Journal of the Proceedings of the Assembly of Divines from January 1, 1643 to December 31, 1644&quot; is a valuable historical source for the brief period to which it relates. He was assiduous in his attendance, and, though frequently standing alone, especially in the Erastian controversy, he exercised considerable influence on the outcome of the discussions of the Assembly.

He was made Master of Catharine Hall (renamed St Catharine&#x27;s College) by the parliamentary visitors of Cambridge in 1643, and also, on the recommendation of the Assembly, was promoted to the rectory of Much Munden, Hertfordshire; he kept both appointments until his death.

In 1654 Lightfoot had been chosen vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, but continued to live at Munden, in the rectory of which, as well as in the mastership of Catharine Hall, he was confirmed at the Restoration.

While travelling from Cambridge to Ely, where he had been collated in 1668 by Sir Orlando Bridgeman to a prebendal stall, he caught a severe cold, and died at Ely. Lightfoot bequeathed his library of Old Testament books and documents to Harvard University. It was destroyed in a fire at Harvard in 1764.

==Works==

His first published work, entitled &quot;Erubhin&quot;, or &quot;Miscellanies, Christian and Judaical&quot;, written in his spare time and dedicated to Cotton, appeared in London in 1629.

In 1643 Lightfoot published &quot;A Handful of Gleanings out of the Book of Exodus&quot;. Also in 1643 he was appointed to preach the sermon before the House of Commons on occasion of the public fast of 29 March. It was published under the title of &quot;Elias Redivivus&quot;, the text being ; in it a parallel is drawn between the John the Baptist&#x27;s ministry and the work of reformation which in the preacher&#x27;s judgment was incumbent on the Parliament of his own day.

In 1644 the first instalment of an unfinished work was published in London. The full title was &quot;The Harmony of the Four Evangelists among themselves, and with the Old Testament, with an explanation of the chiefest difficulties both in Language and Sense: Part I. From the beginning of the Gospels to the Baptism of our Saviour&quot;. The second part, &quot;From the Baptism of our Saviour to the first Passover after&quot;, followed in 1647, and the third, &quot;From the first Passover after our Saviour&#x27;s Baptism to the second&quot;, in 1650. On 26 August 1645 he again preached before the House of Commons on the day of their monthly fast. His text was .

In these books he dated Creation to 3929 BC (see Ussher chronology). Understanding of Lightfoot&#x27;s precise meaning has been complicated by an 1896 misquotation of him cited by Andrew Dickson White.

Rejecting the doctrine of the millenarian sects, Lightfoot had various practical suggestions for the repression of current &quot;blasphemies&quot;, for a thorough revision of the Authorized Version of the Scriptures (&quot;On a fresh revision of the English New Testament&quot;), for the encouragement of a learned ministry, and for a speedy settlement of the church. &quot;A Commentary upon the Acts of the Apostles, ironic and critical; the Difficulties of the text explained, and the times of the Story cast into annals. From the beginning of the Book to the end of the Twelfth Chapter. With a brief survey of the contemporary Story of the Jews and Romans (down to the third year of Claudius)&quot; was published later that year. In 1647 came &quot;The Harmony, Chronicle, and Order of the Old Testament&quot;, followed in 1655 by &quot;The Harmony, Chronicle, and Order of the New Testament&quot;, inscribed to Oliver Cromwell.

He helped Brian Walton with the &quot;Polyglot Bible&quot; (1657). His own best-known work was the &quot;Horae Hebraicae et Talmudicae&quot;, in which the volume relating to the Gospel of Matthew appeared in 1658, that relating to the Gospel of Mark in 1663, and those relating to 1 Corinthians, John, and Luke, in 1664, 1671, and 1674 respectively.

The &quot;Horae Hebraicae et Talmudicae impensae in Acta Apostolorum et in Ep. S. Pauli ad Romanos&quot; were published posthumously.

==Editions==

The &quot;Works of Lightfoot&quot; were first edited, in 2 vols. fol., by George Bright and John Strype in 1684.

The &quot;Opera Omnia, cura Joh. Texelii&quot;, appeared at Rotterdam in 1686 (2 vols. fol.), and again, edited by Johann Leusden, at Franeker in 1699 (3 vols. 101.). A volume of &quot;Remains&quot; was published at London in 1700.

The &quot;Hor. Hebr. et Talm.&quot; were also edited in Latin by Johann Benedict Carpzov (Leipzig, 1675–1679), and again, in English, by Robert Gandell (Oxford, 1859).

The most complete edition is that of the &quot;Whole Works&quot;, in 13 vols. 8vo. edited, with a life, by John Rogers Pitman (London, 1822–1825). It includes, besides the works already noticed, numerous sermons, letters and miscellaneous writings; and also &quot;The Temple, especially as it stood in the Days of our Saviour&quot; (London, 1650).

<text>Duncan James Corrowr Grant (21 January 1885 – 8 May 1978) was a Scottish painter and designer of textiles, pottery, theatre sets, and costumes. He was a member of the Bloomsbury Group.

His father was Bartle Grant, a &quot;poverty-stricken&quot; major in the army, and much of his early childhood was spent in India and Burma. He was a grandson of Sir John Peter Grant, 12th Laird of Rothiemurchus, KCB, GCMG, and sometime Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
Grant was born on 21 January 1885, to Major Bartle Grant and Ethel Isabel McNeil in Rothiemurchus, Aviemore, Scotland. Between 1887 and 1894, the family lived in India and Burma, returning to Scotland every two years. During this period, Grant was educated by his governess, Alice Bates. Along with Rupert Brooke, Grant attended Hillbrow School, Rugby, 1894–99, where he received lessons from an art teacher and became interested in Japanese prints. During this period, Grant spent his school holidays at Hogarth&#x27;s House, Chiswick, with his grandmother, Lady Grant. He attended St Paul&#x27;s School, London (as a boarder for two terms), 1899–1901, where he was awarded several art prizes.

=== Art education and European influence ===

From about 1899/1900 to 1906, Grant lived with his aunt and uncle, Sir Richard and Lady Strachey and their children. When Grant was younger, he accompanied Lady Strachey to &quot;picture Sunday&quot; which gave him the opportunity to meet with eminent painters. Lady Strachey was able to persuade Grant&#x27;s parents that he should be allowed to pursue an education in art. In 1902, Grant was enrolled by his aunt at Westminster School of Art; he attended for the next three years. While at Westminster, Grant was encouraged in his studies by Simon Bussy, a French painter and lifelong friend of Matisse, who went on to marry Dorothy Strachey.

In the winter of 1904–5, Grant visited Italy where, commissioned by Harry Strachey, he made copies of part of the Masaccio frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, in the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence. Grant also made a study of the Portrait of Federigo da Montefeltro, one half of the diptych by Piero della Francesca in the Uffizi and was greatly impressed by the frescoes of Piero in the Basilica of San Francesco, Arezzo. On his return, at the advice of Simon Bussy, Grant made a copy of the Angel musicians in Piero&#x27;s Nativity in the National Gallery, London.

Grant was introduced to Vanessa Bell (then Vanessa Stephen) by Pippa Strachey at the Friday Club in the autumn of 1905. From 1906, thanks to a gift of £100 from an aunt, Grant spent a year in Paris studying at the &quot;Académie de La Palette,&quot; Jacques-Émile Blanche&#x27;s school. During this period, he visited the Musée du Luxembourg and saw, among other paintings, the Caillebotte bequest of French Impressionists.

In January 1907, and again in the summer of 1908, Grant spent a term at the Slade School of Art. In 1908, Grant painted a portrait of John Maynard Keynes, whom he had met the previous year, while the two were on holiday in Orkney. A year later, the pair would share rooms on Belgrave Road.

In 1909, Grant visited Michael and Gertrude Stein in Paris and saw their collection that included paintings by, among others, Picasso and Matisse. In the summer, with an introduction from Simon Bussy, Grant visited Matisse himself, then living at Clamart, Paris.

== Duncan Grant in London ==
=== Bloomsbury Foundations ===
In November 1909, Grant moved to 21 Fitzroy Square, where he occupied two rooms on the second floor of the building on the west side of the square. A few doors away, at 29 Fitzroy Square, lived Adrian and Virginia Stephen (later Virginia Woolf). Grant would later recall: &#x27;a close friendship sprang up between Adrian Stephen and myself and I had only to tap on the window to be let in. The maid told Virginia &quot;that Mr Grant gets in everywhere&quot;. But very irregular as my visits were, they became more and more a habit, and I think they soon became frequent enough to escape notice.&#x27;

In June 1910 Grant exhibited with the Friday Club at the Alpine Club Gallery. Later that year Grant would visit Roger Fry&#x27;s &quot;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&quot; exhibition at the Grafton Galleries in Mayfair, which included work by the likes of Gauguin, Matisse and Van Gogh, where he was said to be particularly interested in the paintings of Paul Cézanne.

During the summer of 1911, Grant was invited by Roger Fry to contribute to the redecoration of the dining room at the Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University). Grant composed two oil paintings to fit with the theme of illustrating &quot;London on Holiday&quot;. Both his paintings, &quot;Football&quot; and &quot;Bathing,&quot; bear the influence of early Italian art and Byzantine mosaics. Grant also drew on his exposure to the work of the post-impressionists; &quot;The Times&quot; reported of his depiction of the figures that &#x27;Mr Grant has used all his remarkable powers of draughtsmanship to represent the act of swimming rather than any individual swimmers.’

=== The &quot;Dreadnought&quot; Hoax ===
In February 1910, Grant, along with Horace de Vere Cole, Virginia Stephen, Adrian Stephen and others, disguised themselves as an Abyssinian royal delegation and fooled their way on to HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. The delegation was greeted by a band and given a tour of the battleship. As flag ship of the Home Fleet, the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was a high-profile target for the pranksters in opposing this new killing machine, and as such the hoax attracted much attention in the press once discovered.

== Career in art ==
Grant is best known for his painting style, which developed in the wake of French post-impressionist exhibitions mounted in London in 1910. He often worked with, and was influenced by, another member of the group, art critic and artist Roger Fry. As well as painting landscapes and portraits, Fry designed textiles and ceramics.


After Fry founded the Omega Workshops in 1913, Grant became co-director with Vanessa Bell, who was then involved with Fry. Although Grant had always been actively homosexual, a relationship with Vanessa blossomed, which was both creative and personal, and he eventually moved in with her and her two sons by her husband Clive Bell. In 1916, in support of his application for recognition as a conscientious objector, Grant joined his new lover, David Garnett, in setting up as fruit farmers in Suffolk. Both their applications were initially unsuccessful, but eventually the Central Tribunal agreed to recognise them on condition of their finding more appropriate premises. Vanessa Bell found the house named Charleston near Firle in Sussex. Relationships with Clive Bell remained amicable, and Bell stayed with them for long periods fairly often – sometimes accompanied by his own mistress, Mary Hutchinson.

Between 1932 and 1934 Grant and Bell created the 50-piece Famous Women Dinner Service at Charleston, commissioned by the art historian and museum director Kenneth Clark.

In 1935, Grant was selected along with nearly 30 other prominent British artists of the day to provide works of art for the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; then being built in Scotland. Grant was commissioned to provide paintings and fabrics for the first class Main Lounge. In early 1936, after his work was installed in the Lounge, directors from the Cunard Line made a walk-through inspection of the ship. When they saw what Grant had created, they immediately rejected his works and ordered it removed.

Grant is quoted in the book &quot;The Mary: The Inevitable Ship&quot;, by Potter and Frost, as saying:

:&quot;I was not only to paint some large murals to go over the fireplaces, but arrange for the carpets, curtains, textiles, all of which were to be chosen or designed by me. After my initial designs had been passed by the committee I worked on the actual designs for four months. I was then told the committee objected to the scale of the figures on the panels. I consented to alter these, and although it entailed considerable changes, I got a written assurance that I should not be asked to make further alterations. I carried on, and from that time my work was seen constantly by the Company&#x27;s (Cunard&#x27;s) representative.

:When it was all ready I sent the panels to the ship to put the finishing touches to them when hanging. A few days later I received a visit from the Company&#x27;s man, who told me that the chairman had, on his own authority, turned down the panels, refusing to give any reason.

:From then on, nothing went right. My carpet designs were rejected and my textiles were not required. The whole thing had taken me about a year... I never got any reason for the rejection of my work. The company simply said they were not suitable, paid my fee, and that was that.&quot;

During World War Two, Grant received a short-term commission from the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee for two paintings, the most notable of which is an image of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral during the 1941 London Blitz as seen from the basement of a nearby bombed building.

In the late 1950s Grant was commissioned to decorate the Russell Chantry of Lincoln Cathedral. Grant modelled the figure of Christ in these murals on his lover Paul Roche. The Cathedral authorities closed the Chantry in the 1960s and it was used as a store room for many years. Grants&#x27; murals were eventually restored and the space reopened to the public in the 1990s.

== Personal life ==

Grant&#x27;s early affairs were exclusively homosexual. His lovers included his cousin, the writer Lytton Strachey, the future politician Arthur Hobhouse and the economist John Maynard Keynes, who at one time considered Grant the love of his life because of his good looks and the originality of his mind. Through Strachey, Grant became involved in the Bloomsbury Group, where he made many such great friends including Vanessa Bell. He would eventually live with Vanessa Bell who, though she was a married woman, fell deeply in love with him and, one night, succeeded in seducing him; Bell very much wanted a child by Grant, and she became pregnant in the spring of 1918. Although it is generally assumed that Grant&#x27;s sexual relations with Bell ended in the months before Angelica was born (Christmas, 1918), they continued to live together for more than 40 years. During that time, their relationship was mainly domestic and creative; they often painted in the same studio together, praising and critiquing each other&#x27;s work.

Living with Vanessa Bell was no impediment to Grant&#x27;s relationships with men, either before or after Angelica was born. Angelica grew up believing that Vanessa&#x27;s husband Clive Bell was her biological father; she bore his surname and his behaviour toward her never indicated otherwise. Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell had formed an open relationship, although she herself apparently never had any further affairs. Grant, in contrast, had many physical affairs and several serious relationships with other men, most notably David Garnett, who would one day marry Angelica and have four daughters with her, including Amaryllis Garnett. Grant&#x27;s love and respect for Bell, however, kept him with her until her death in 1961.

Angelica wrote: &quot;(Grant) was a homosexual with bisexual leanings&quot;.

== Later years ==

In Grant&#x27;s later years, his lover, the poet Paul Roche (1916–2007), whom he had known since 1946, took care of him and enabled Grant to maintain his accustomed way of life at Charleston for many years. Grant and Roche&#x27;s relationship was strong and lasted even during Roche&#x27;s marriage and five children he had by the late 1950s. Roche was made co-heir of Grant&#x27;s estate. Grant eventually died in Roche&#x27;s home in 1978.

Duncan Grant&#x27;s remains are buried beside Vanessa Bell&#x27;s in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church, West Firle, East Sussex.

<doc id="197270" wikidata="Q1748131" url="?curid=197270" title="Edward Pococke">
<text>Edward Pococke (baptised 8 November 160410 September 1691) was an English Orientalist and biblical scholar.

==Early life==
The son of Edward Pococke (died 1636), vicar of Chieveley in Berkshire, he was brought up at Chieveley and educated from a young age at Lord Williams&#x27;s School, Thame, Oxfordshire. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford in 1619, and later was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford (scholar in 1620, fellow in 1628). He was ordained a priest of the Church of England on 20 December 1629.

The first result of his studies was an edition from a Bodleian Library manuscript of the four New Testament epistles (&quot;2 Peter&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3 John&quot;, &quot;Jude&quot;) which were not in the old Syriac canon, and were not contained in European editions of the &quot;Peshito&quot;. This was published at Leiden at the instigation of Gerard Vossius in 1630, and in the same year Pococke sailed for Aleppo, Syria as chaplain to the English factor. At Aleppo he studied the Arabic language and collected manuscripts. He also studied and translated Arabic Islamic works. His &quot;Philosophus Autodidacticus&quot;, a translation of Ibn Tufayl&#x27;s &quot;Life of Hayy Ibn Yaqzan&quot;, may have influenced the political philosopher John Locke.

At this time William Laud was both Bishop of London and chancellor of the University of Oxford, and Pococke was recognised as one who could help his schemes for enriching the university. Laud founded a Chair of Arabic at Oxford, and invited Pococke to fill it. He entered the post on 10 August 1636; but the next summer he sailed back to Constantinople in the company of John Greaves, later Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, to prosecute further studies and collect more books; he remained there for about three years.

==Return to England==
When he returned to England, Laud was in the Tower of London, but had taken the precaution to make the Arabic chair permanent. Pococke does not seem to have been an extreme churchman or to have been active in politics. His rare scholarship and personal qualities brought him influential friends, foremost among these being John Selden and John Owen. Through their offices he obtained, in 1648, the chair of Hebrew at the University of Oxford on the death of John Morris, though he lost the emoluments of the post soon after, and did not recover them until the Restoration.

These events hampered Pococke in his studies, or so he complained in the preface to his &quot;Eutychius&quot;; he resented the attempts to remove him from his parish of Childrey, a college living near Wantage in North Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) which he had accepted in 1643. In 1649, he published the &quot;Specimen historiae arabum&quot;, a short account of the origin and manners of the Arabs, taken from Bar-Hebraeus (Abulfaragius), with notes from a vast number of manuscript sources which are still valuable. This was followed in 1655 by the &quot;Porta Mosis&quot;, extracts from the Arabic commentary of Maimonides on the &quot;Mishnah&quot;, with translation and very learned notes; and in 1656 by the annals of Eutychius in Arabic and Latin. He also gave active assistance to Brian Walton&#x27;s polyglot bible, and the preface to the various readings of the &quot;Arabic Pentateuch&quot; is from his hand.

==Post-Restoration==

After the Restoration, Pococke&#x27;s political and financial troubles ended, but the reception of his &quot;magnum opus&quot;a complete edition of the Arabic history of Bar-Hebraeus (&quot;Greg. Abulfaragii historia compendiosa dynastiarum&quot;), which he dedicated to the king in 1663showed that the new order of things was not very favourable to scholarship. After this, his most important works were a &quot;Lexicon heptaglotton&quot; (1669) and English commentaries on &quot;Micah&quot; (1677), &quot;Malachi&quot; (1677), &quot;Hosea&quot; (1685) and &quot;Joel&quot; (1691). An Arabic translation of Grotius&#x27;s &quot;De veritate&quot;, which appeared in 1660, may also be mentioned as a proof of Pococke&#x27;s interest in the propagation of Christianity in the East, as is his later Arabic translation of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in 1674. Pococke had a long-standing interest in the subject, which he had talked over with Grotius at Paris on his way back from Constantinople.

== Personal life ==
Pococke married Mary Burdet in about 1646, and they had six sons and three daughters. One son, Edward (1648–1727), published several contributions from Arabic literature: a fragment of Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi&#x27;s &quot;Account of Egypt&quot; and the &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; of Ibn Tufayl (Abubacer).

Edward Pococke died on 10 September 1691 and was buried in the north aisle of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. His monument, a bust erected by his widow, is now elsewhere in the cathedral. 

== Legacy ==
His valuable collection of 420 oriental manuscripts was bought by the university in 1693 for 600l., and is in the Bodleian (catalogued in Bernard, Cat. Libr. MSS. pp. 274–278, and in later special catalogues), and some of his printed books were acquired by the Bodleian in 1822, by bequest from the Rev. C. Francis of Brasenose (Macray, Annals of the Bodl. Libr. p. 161).

Both Edward Gibbon and Thomas Carlyle exposed some &quot;pious&quot; lies in the missionary work by Grotius translated by Pococke, which were omitted from the Arabic text.

The theological works of Pococke were collected, in two volumes, in 1740, with a curious account of his life and writings by Leonard Twells.

The Pococke Garden of Christ Church, Oxford is named after him, and contains the Pococke Tree, an Oriental Plane planted by him, possibly from seed he collected around 1636. This tree, with its circa nine metre girth, may be the inspiration for the Tumtum tree of Lewis Carol&#x27;s poem Jabberwocky.

<doc id="197271" wikidata="Q1990922" url="?curid=197271" title="Cappadocian Fathers">
<text>The Cappadocian Fathers, also traditionally known as the Three Cappadocians, were a trio of Byzantine Christian prelates, theologians and monks who helped shape both early Christianity and the monastic tradition. Basil the Great (330–379) was Bishop of Caesarea; Basil&#x27;s younger brother Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – c. 395) was Bishop of Nyssa; and a close friend, Gregory of Nazianzus (329–389), became Patriarch of Constantinople. The Cappadocia region, in modern-day Turkey, was an early site of Christian activity.

The Cappadocians advanced the development of early Christian theology, for example the doctrine of the Trinity, and are highly respected as saints in both Western and Eastern churches.

== Biographical background ==
An older sister of Basil and Gregory of Nyssa, Macrina, converted the family&#x27;s estate into a monastic community. Basil the Great was the oldest of Macrina&#x27;s brothers, the second eldest being the famous Christian jurist Naucratius. Another brother, Peter of Sebaste, also became a bishop. Their maternal grandfather had been a martyr, and their parents, Basil the Elder and Emmelia of Caesarea are also recognized as saints.

== Theological contributions ==

=== The Trinity ===
The fathers set out to demonstrate that Christians could hold their own in conversations with learned Greek-speaking intellectuals and that Christian faith, while it was against many of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle (and other Greek philosophers), was an almost scientific and distinctive movement with the healing of the soul of man and his union with God at its center—one best represented by monasticism. They made major contributions to the definition of the Trinity finalized at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and the final version of the Nicene Creed, finalised there.

They made key contributions to the doctrine of the Trinity and to the responses to Arianism and Apollinarianism.

Subsequent to the First Council of Nicea, Arianism did not simply disappear. The Council of Nicea had asserted that the Son was of the same substance (homoousios) as the Father. The semi-Arians taught that the Son is of like substance with the Father (homoiousios) as against the outright Arians who taught that the Son was not like the Father, but had been created, and was therefore not God. So the Son was held to be &quot;like&quot; the Father but not of the same essence as the Father.
The Cappadocians worked to bring these semi-Arians back to the orthodox cause. In their writings they made extensive use of the (now orthodox) formula &quot;one substance (ousia) in three persons (hypostaseis)&quot;. The relationship is understandable, argued Basil of Caesarea, in a parallel drawn from Platonism: any three human beings are each individual persons and all share a common universal, their humanity. The formulation explicitly acknowledged a distinction between the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (a distinction that Nicea had been accused of blurring), but at the same time insisting on their essential unity.

Thus Basil wrote:

In a brief statement, I shall say that essence (ousia) is related to person (hypostasis) as the general to the particular. Each one of us partakes of existence because he shares in ousia while because of his individual properties he is A or B. So, in the case in question, ousia refers to the general conception, like goodness, godhead, or such notions, while hypostasis is observed in the special properties of fatherhood, sonship, and sanctifying power. If then they speak of persons without hypostasis they are talking nonsense, ex hypothesi; but if they admit that the person exists in real hypostasis, as they do acknowledge, let them so number them as to preserve the principles of the homoousion in the unity of the godhead, and proclaim their reverent acknowledgment of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in the complete and perfect hypostasis of each person so named. —Epistle 214.4.

Basil thus attempted to do justice to the doctrinal definitions of Nicea while at the same time distinguishing the Nicene position from modalism, which had been Arius&#x27;s original charge against Pope Alexander in the Nicene controversy. The outcome was that Arianism and semi-Arianism virtually disappeared from the church.

=== Women and Mariology ===
The Cappadocians held a higher view of women than many of their contemporaries. Some scholars suggest that Macrina was an equal in the group, and therefore ought to be recognized as &quot;The Fourth Cappadocian.&quot; They contributed to the development of Marian theology and incipient Marian devotion; all three men affirmed the doctrine of the perpetual virginity which was at that time subject to criticism from some circles. Gregory of Nyssa taught that she took a vow of Virginity, and was perhaps the first theologian to associate the burning bush typologically with Mary, in his &quot;Life of Moses&quot;. The Cappadocians affirmed the title Theotokos more than 50 years before it became central to the Nestorian controversy. Gregory of Nazianzus asserted that &quot;if anyone does not believe the holy Mary to be Theotokos, he is without the Godhead.&quot; Both Gregories were early witnesses to the understanding of Mary as &quot;virgin earth&quot;, and the contemplation of &quot;the venerable womb of the Virgin&quot; as the place wherein God united &quot;the two natures in one.&quot; This language, which particularly abounds in Gregory of Nyssa, anticipated the Council of Ephesus and Marian theologians like Proclus, Gregory of Nazianzus&#x27; successor in the Archepiscopate of Constantinople. Furthermore, Nazianzus taught that Mary was pre-purifed in soul and body prior to the conception of Jesus. Moreover, he bears witness to the earliest known prayer to Mary from the Patristic literary corpus, relating how a virgin prayed to Mary to help her overcome temptation, showing the ascetic matrix that was the context of early Marian devotion vis-à-vis the perpetual virginity. The roots of Marian invocation may therefore be associated with Nazianzus&#x27; Nicene circle in Constantinople. Gregory of Nyssa also presents the earliest record of a Marian apparition, associating it with Gregory the Wonder Worker in the middle of the third century.

While the Cappadocians shared many traits, each one exhibited particular strengths. Scholars note that Basil was &quot;the man of action&quot;, Gregory of Nazianzus &quot;the orator&quot; and Gregory of Nyssa &quot;the thinker&quot;.

<text>Stjerneborg (&quot;Star Castle&quot; in English) was Tycho Brahe&#x27;s underground observatory next to his palace-observatory Uraniborg, located on the island of Ven in the Öresund between Denmark and Sweden.

Tycho Brahe built it circa 1581. He wrote: &quot;My purpose was partly to have placed some of the most important instruments securely and firmly in order that they should not be exposed to the disturbing influence of the wind, and should be easier to use, partly to separate my collaborators when there were several with me at the same time, and have some of them make observations in the castle itself, others in these cellars, in order that they should not get in the way of each other or compare their observations before I wanted this.&quot; He named it Stiernburg in vernacular or Stellæburgus in Latin. Both the Danish and Latin names mean &quot;castle of the stars&quot;.

The underground portions of the observatory were excavated in the 1950s and are today fitted with a roof approximating the original one. The chambers now house a multimedia show open to the public.

<text>Ven (older Swedish spelling &quot;Hven&quot;), is a Swedish island in the Öresund strait laying between Skåne, Sweden and Zealand, Denmark. A part of Landskrona Municipality, Skåne County, the island has an area of and 371 inhabitants as of 2020. During the 1930s, the population was at its peak, with approximately 1,300 inhabitants. There are four villages on the island: Bäckviken, Tuna By, Norreborg and Kyrkbacken. The island is best known as the location of the observatories Uraniborg and Stjerneborg, both of which were established and operated by the Danish Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe.

==Geography==

The island is a single plateau that rises up to 45 meters above sea level. This highest point is located in the middle of the island, where the remains of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s castle and observatory are now located. The landscape is fertile thanks to the soil and the mild climate for Nordic conditions. The soil is moraine clay and therefore well suited for agriculture. It is one of the northernmost places in Europe where it is possible to grow durum wheat (&quot;Triticum durum&quot;), which is used to make pasta.

Unlike the relatively flat islands Amager and Saltholm, Ven rises from the Öresund with steep and dramatic coastlines. This makes the island easily visible from both Zealand and Scania, as well as from all ships that sail in and out of the Baltic Sea. Its southern coastline resembles the White Cliffs of Dover, Møns Klint and Cape Arkona, but owing to a higher degree of sand and lower of chalk, the cliffs are more yellow than white.

Along the entire coast, the island drops steeply towards the sea where the Öresund meets a rocky beach. This steep coast is called Backafall. Ven&#x27;s backafall is a nature reserve established in 1990. There are no large forests, but smaller stands of trees occur closest to the coast the slightly higher altitude, the climate on the island in general is similar to that of the lower terrain coastal areas around Öresund.

The island has three smaller fishing ports: &quot;Bäckviken&quot; (where small ferries depart to Landskrona), &quot;Norreborg&quot; and &quot;Kyrkbacken&quot;. The last is located on the south-western coast just beneath the old church &quot;Sankt Ibb&quot;. This coast is known as &quot;Backafall.&quot;

==History==
The island was historically under Danish rule. Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) built two observatories there, Uraniborg and Stjerneborg, during 1576–1596. The observatories were built by the inhabitants of the island with Tycho Brahe as their Lord.

The Swedish took over control in 1658, as the rest of Scania was ceded to Sweden by the Treaty of Roskilde. The island was not specifically mentioned in the treaty, and according to the Danes it was not part of Scania, but part of Zealand and therefore still under Danish rule. The Swedes did not agree with that interpretation, and sent troops to occupy the island on 6 May 1658. The transfer to Sweden was confirmed in 1660 by the Treaty of Copenhagen. The 350th anniversary of this transfer was commemorated on the island in 2010.

Two churches are located on this island. The older one, St Ibb&#x27;s Church, is located at the top of a hill in the churchyard close to the west coast of the island, overlooking the Danish town of Rungsted. It was built in the 13th century and is a popular church for weddings. The younger church, which has been converted into a museum, is located in the middle of the island, near Uraniborg, one of the two observatories built by the astronomer Tycho Brahe. The asteroid 379 Huenna, which orbits halfway between Mars and Jupiter, is named for Ven.

Ven has ferries to Landskrona, and, in the summer only, to Helsingborg and Copenhagen. The ferries dock at Bäckviken. The island is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer. It is sometimes called &quot;The pearl of Öresund&quot;. As the earth is rich in till, it is good for agriculture. Durum wheat and grapes are grown there.

==Representation in culture==
Backafall on Ven is named in Gabriel Jönsson&#x27;s poem &quot;Vid vakten&quot;. He also wrote the song &quot;Flicka från Backafall&quot; (&quot;Girl from Backafall&quot;).

==Golf course==
The island is home to the St Ibb Golf Club, founded in 1972 by Gösta Carlsson, who also operated nearby Barsebäck G&amp;CC. The nine-hole par-68 course hosted the St Ibb Open, a professional tournament on the Swedish Golf Tour 2000–2010.

<text>John Selden (16 December 1584 – 30 November 1654) was an English jurist, a scholar of England&#x27;s ancient laws and constitution and scholar of Jewish law. He was known as a polymath; John Milton hailed Selden in 1644 as &quot;the chief of learned men reputed in this land&quot;.

==Early life==

He was born at Salvington, in the parish of West Tarring, West Sussex (now part of the town of Worthing), and was baptised at St Andrew&#x27;s, the parish church. The cottage in which he was born survived until 1959 when it was destroyed by a fire caused by an electrical fault.

His father, also named John Selden, had a small farm. It is said that his skill as a violin-player was what attracted his wife, Margaret, who was from a better family, being the only child of Thomas Baker of Rustington and descended from a knightly family of Kent. Selden was educated at the free grammar school at Chichester, The Prebendal School, and in 1600 he went on to Hart Hall, Oxford. In 1603, he was admitted to Clifford&#x27;s Inn, London; in 1604 he moved to the Inner Temple; and in 1612 he was called to the bar. His earliest patron was Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, the antiquary, who seems to have employed him to copy and summarise some of the parliamentary records then held at the Tower of London. For some reason, Selden very rarely practised in court, but his practice in barristers&#x27; chambers as a conveyancer and consulting counsel was large and apparently lucrative.

==Legal scholar into politics==

In 1618, his &quot;History of Tithes&quot; appeared. Although it had passed censorship and licensing, this dissertation on the historical basis of the tithe system caused anxiety among the bishops and provoked the intervention of the king, James I. The author was summoned before the Privy Council and was compelled to retract his opinions. Also, his work was suppressed, and he was forbidden to reply to anyone who might come forward to answer it.

This all seems to have caused Selden&#x27;s entry into politics. Although he was not in the Parliament of England, he was the instigator and perhaps the draughtsman of the Protestation of 1621 on the rights and privileges of the House, affirmed by the House of Commons on 18 December 1621. He and several others were imprisoned, at first in the Tower and later under the charge of Sir Robert Ducie, sheriff of London. During his brief detention, he occupied himself in preparing an edition of medieval historian Eadmer&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; from a manuscript lent to him by his host or jailor, which he published two years afterwards.

==Parliamentarian==

In 1623 he was returned to the House of Commons for the borough of Lancaster, and sat with John Coke, William Noy, and John Pym on Sergeant Glanville&#x27;s election committee. He was also nominated reader of Lyon&#x27;s Inn, an office he declined to undertake. For this the benchers of the Inner Temple fined him £20 and disqualified him from being one of their number. Nevertheless, after a few years, he became a master of the bench. In the first parliament of Charles I (1625), it appears from the &quot;returns of members&quot; printed in 1878 that contrary to the assertion of all his biographers, he had no seat. In Charles&#x27;s second parliament (1626), he was elected for Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, and took a prominent part in the impeachment of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. In the following year, in Darnell&#x27;s Case (the Five Knights&#x27; Case), he was counsel for Sir Edmund Hampden in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench.

In 1628 he was returned to the third parliament of Charles for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, and was involved in drawing up and carrying the Petition of Right. In the session of 1629 he was one of the members responsible for the tumultuous passage in the House of Commons of the resolution against the illegal levy of tonnage and poundage, and, along with Sir John Eliot, Denzil Holles, Long, Valentine, William Strode, and the rest, he was sent back to the Tower. There he remained for eight months, deprived for a part of the time of the use of books and writing materials. He was then removed, under less rigorous conditions, to the Marshalsea, until Archbishop Laud arranged for him to be freed. Some years before, he had been appointed steward to Henry Grey, 8th Earl of Kent, to whose seat, Wrest in Bedfordshire, he now retired.

He was not elected to the Short Parliament of 1640; but to the Long Parliament, summoned in the autumn, he was returned without opposition for Oxford University. He opposed the resolution against episcopacy which led to the exclusion of the bishops from the House of Lords, and printed an answer to the arguments used by Sir Harbottle Grimston on that occasion. He joined in the protestation of the Commons for the maintenance of the Protestant religion according to the doctrines of the Church of England, the authority of the Crown, and the liberty of the subject. He was equally opposed to the court on the question of the commissions of lieutenancy of array and to the parliament on the question of the militia ordinance. In the end, he supported Parliament against King Charles, because, according to him, Charles was certainly acting illegally; but Selden was not certain if Parliament was doing the same.

In 1643 he participated in the discussions of the Westminster Assembly, where his Erastian views were opposed by George Gillespie. Selden&#x27;s allies included Thomas Coleman, John Lightfoot, and Bulstrode Whitelocke.

In October 1643 Selden was appointed by Commons to take control of the office of Clerk and Keeper of the Records in the Tower, which duty passed to the Master of the Rolls in 1651. In 1645, he was named one of the parliamentary commissioners of the admiralty and was elected master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, an office that he declined to accept. In 1646, he subscribed to the Solemn League and Covenant and, in 1647, was voted £5000 (£ in ) by the parliament as compensation for his pains under the monarchy.

==Last years==

After the death of the Earl of Kent in 1639, Selden lived permanently under the same roof with the earl&#x27;s widow, the former Elizabeth Talbot. It is believed that he married her, although their marriage does not seem to have ever been publicly acknowledged. He assembled a famous library which eventually became part of the Bodleian Library&#x27;s collection in 1659. In addition to a wide range of Greek, Arabic, Hebrew and Latin works, it included the Codex Mendoza and the Selden Map of China. He died at Friary House in Whitefriars, London on 30 November 1654, and was buried in the Temple Church, London. His tomb is today clearly visible through glass plates in the floor of this church. Furthermore, he is commemorated by a monumental inscription on the south side of the Temple Church. More than two centuries after his death, in 1880, a brass tablet was erected to his memory by the benchers of the Inner Temple in the parish church of St. Andrew&#x27;s, West Tarring.

==Works==
It was as a prolific scholar and writer that Selden won his reputation. The early books were on English history.

===English history and antiquities===

In 1610 three of his works came out: &quot;Jani Anglorum Facies Altera&quot; (&quot;The Back Face&quot; [or &quot;Two Faces&quot;] &quot;of the English Janus&quot;) and &quot;England&#x27;s Epinomis&quot;, which dealt with the progress of English law down to Henry II; and &quot;The Duello, or Single Combat&quot;, in which he traced the history of trial by battle in England from the Norman Conquest. In 1613 he supplied a series of notes, including quotations and references, to the first eighteen cantos of Michael Drayton&#x27;s &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot;. In 1614 he published &quot;Titles of Honor&quot;, which, in spite of defects and omissions, remained a comprehensive work for centuries. It was republished in a larger and greatly revised edition in 1631, and in a third edition in 1672. It earned for Selden the praise &quot;monarch of letters&quot; from his friend Ben Jonson.

In 1615, the &quot;Analecton Anglobritannicon&quot;, an account of the civil administration of England before the Norman Conquest, written in 1607, was published; its title and argument imitated the &quot;Franco-Gallia&quot; of François Hotman. In 1616 appeared notes on John Fortescue&#x27;s &quot;De laudibus legum Angliae&quot; and Ralph de Hengham&#x27;s &quot;Summae magna et parva&quot;.

In 1618 his controversial &quot;History of Tithes&quot; was published. A first sign of the coming storm was the 1619 book controverting Selden, &quot;Sacrilege Sacredly Handled in two parts; with an Appendix, answering some objections&quot; by James Sempill. Selden hit back, but was soon gagged. The churchmen Richard Tillesley (1582–1621) (&quot;Animadversions upon M. Seldens History of Tithes&quot;, 1619) and Richard Montagu (&quot;Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes&quot;, 1621) attacked the work. There were further replies by William Sclater (&quot;The Quaestion of Tythes Revised&quot;, 1623), and by Stephen Nettles (&quot;Answer to the Jewish Part of Mr. Selden&#x27;s History of Tithes&quot; 1625). In it Selden tried to demonstrate that tithing depended on the civil law, rather than canon law. He also made much of the complexities of the ancient Jewish customs on tithes.
The work was also a milestone in the history of English historical writing through its mixture of antiquarian-philological scholarship with historical narrative, two approaches to the study of the past previously seen as distinct.

In 1623 he produced an edition of Eadmer&#x27;s &quot;Historia Novarum&quot;. It was notable for including in appendices information from the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, which at the time had not been published and could only be consulted in the original at Westminster, on the payment of a fee.

He published in 1642 &quot;Privileges of the Baronage of England when they sit in Parliament and Discourse concerning the Rights and Privileges of the Subject&quot;. In 1652 he wrote a preface and collated some of the manuscripts for Sir Roger Twysden&#x27;s &quot;Historiae Anglicanae scriptores X&quot;.

===Literature and archaeology of the Near East===

In 1617, his &quot;De dis Syris&quot; was issued, and immediately established his fame as an orientalist. It is remarkable for its early use of the comparative method, on Semitic mythology. Also, in 1642, he published a part of the Arabic chronicle of Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria, under the title &quot;Eutychii Aegyptii, Patriarchae Orthodoxorum Alexandrini, ... ecclesiae suae origines&quot;. Controversial was the discussion in it of the absence in Alexandria of the distinction between priests and bishops, a burning issue in the debate at the time in the Church of England.

In 1628, at the suggestion of Sir Robert Cotton, Selden compiled, with the assistance of two other scholars, Patrick Young and Richard James, a catalogue of the Arundel marbles.

===Studies on Judaism===

He employed his leisure at Wrest in writing &quot;De successionibus in bona defuncti secundum leges Ebraeorum&quot; and &quot;De successione in pontificatum Ebraeorum&quot;, published in 1631.

During the progress of the constitutional conflict, he was absorbed in research, publishing &quot;De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum&quot; in 1640. It was a contribution to the theorising of the period on natural law. In the words of John Milton, this &quot;volume of naturall &amp; national laws proves, not only by great authorities brought together, but by exquisite reasons and theorems almost mathematically demonstrative, that all opinions, yea errors, known, read, and collated, are of main service &amp; assistance toward the speedy attainment of what is truest.&quot; It develops into a theory of international law, taking as its basis the Seven Laws of Noah.

In 1644, he published &quot;Dissertatio de anno civili et calendario reipublicae Judaicae&quot;, in 1646 his treatise on marriage and divorce among the Jews entitled &quot;Uxor Ebraica&quot;, and in 1647 the earliest printed edition of the old English law-book &quot;Fleta&quot;. In 1650 Selden began to print the trilogy he planned on the Sanhedrin, as the first part of &quot;De synedriis et prefecturis juridicis veterum Ebraeorum&quot; through the press, the second and third parts being severally published in 1653 and 1655. The aim of this work was to counter the use by the Presbyterians, in particular, of arguments and precedents drawn from Jewish tradition; it was a very detailed study aimed at refuting such arguments, and pointing out the inherent flexibility of the tradition that was being cited.

===International law===

His &quot;Mare clausum&quot; was written to dismantle the pretensions advanced by Grotius in &quot;The Free Sea&quot; (&quot;Mare liberum&quot;), on behalf of the Dutch fishermen, to poach in the waters off the English coasts.

The circumstances of its delayed publication, in 1635, suggest that during the early 1630s Selden inclined towards the court rather than the popular party and even secured the personal favour of the king, Charles I. It had been written sixteen or seventeen years earlier, but for political reasons Charles&#x27;s predecessor, James I, had prohibited its publication. When it eventually appeared, a quarter of a century after &quot;Mare liberum&quot;, it was under Charles&#x27;s royal patronage, as a kind of state paper, and with a dedication to him. The fact that Selden was not retained in the great case of ship money in 1637 by John Hampden, the cousin of Sir Edmund, his former client in the Five Knights&#x27; Case, may be taken as additional evidence that his zeal for the popular cause was neither so warm nor so unquestioned as it had once been.

His last publication was a vindication of himself from certain charges advanced against him and his &quot;Mare clausum&quot; around 1653 by Theodore Graswinckel, a Dutch jurist.

===Posthumous publications===

Several of Selden&#x27;s minor works were printed for the first time after his death, including a tract in defence of the 25 December birth of Christ written during the Puritan Commonwealth (1649–1660) when celebration of Christmas was prohibited. A collective edition of his writings was published by David Wilkins in 3 volumes folio in 1725, and again in 1726. &quot;Table Talk&quot;, for which he is perhaps best known, did not appear until 1689. It was edited by his amanuensis, Richard Milward, who affirms that &quot;the sense and notion is wholly Selden&#x27;s&quot; and that &quot;most of the words&quot; are his also. Its genuineness has sometimes been questioned.

==Views==

Selden arrived at an Erastian position in church politics. He also believed in free will, which was inconsistent with Calvinism.

He was sceptical of the legend of King Arthur as it had grown up, but believed Arthur had existed. The Druids, he suggested in comments on &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot;, were ancient and presumed esoteric thinkers. The popular image of a Druid descends via a masque of Inigo Jones from a reconstruction by Selden, based (without good foundations) on ancient German statuary.

==Commemoration==

Selden is commemorated in the name of the Selden Society, a learned society concerned with the study of English legal history, founded in 1887.

He is also commemorated in place-names in Salvington, including &quot;The John Selden Inn&quot;, which purports to be on the site of his dwelling; Selden Road; and the Selden medical centre. Also The Selden Arms on Lyndhurst Road in Worthing.

==Influence==

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing&quot;, he &quot;played a role of fundamental importance in the transition of English historical writing from a medieval antiquarianism to a more modern understanding of the scope and function of history than had ever before been expressed in Renaissance England&quot;. His reputation lasted well, with Mark Pattison calling him &quot;the most learned man, not only of his party, but of Englishmen&quot;.

By about 1640, Selden&#x27;s views (with those of Grotius) had a large impact on the Great Tew circle around Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland: William Chillingworth, Dudley Digges, Henry Hammond. It was in this milieu that Selden met and befriended Thomas Hobbes. They had much in common, in political thought, but the precise connections have not been clarified.

Richard Cumberland followed Selden over both Grotius and Hobbes on natural law. Selden contested the scholastic position, after Cicero, that &quot;right reason&quot; could by its dictates alone generate obligation, by claiming that a formal obligation required a superior in authority. In his &quot;De legibus&quot; Cumberland rejects Selden&#x27;s solution by means of the Noahide laws, in &quot;De jure naturali&quot;, in favour of Selden&#x27;s less developed alternate solution. The latter is more orthodox for a Thomist, an &quot;intellectus agens&quot; as a natural faculty in the rational soul, by the mediation of which divine intellect can intervene directly with individuals. Matthew Hale tried to merge the theory of Grotius on property with Selden&#x27;s view on obligation. Cumberland and Hale both belonged to a larger group, followers in a broad sense of Selden, with backgrounds mostly of Cambridge and the law, comprising also Orlando Bridgeman, Hezekiah Burton, John Hollings, Richard Kidder, Edward Stillingfleet, John Tillotson, and John Wilkins.

Giambattista Vico called Grotius, Selden and Samuel Pufendorf the &quot;three princes&quot; of the &quot;natural right of the gentes&quot;. He went on to criticise their approach foundationally. In his &quot;Autobiography&quot; he specifies that they had conflated the natural law of the &quot;nations&quot;, based on custom, with that of the philosophers, based on human abstractions. Isaiah Berlin comments on Vico&#x27;s admiration for Grotius and Selden.

== Library collections ==

By the time of his death in 1654, Selden had accumulated a library of several thousand manuscripts and printed books. Selden&#x27;s will left his intentions for this library somewhat ambiguous, although the will and codicil seem to suggest that he intended to bequeath most of his Oriental manuscripts, Greek manuscripts, a Latin manuscript, and his printed Talmudic and Rabbinical books to the Bodleian Library, Oxford. There is some evidence to suggest that Selden intended to leave his printed books and historical manuscripts to the Inner Temple but that this transaction did not occur because the Temple did not possess a large enough library. By 1656, two years after Selden&#x27;s death, his executors (Edward Heyward, John Vaughan, Matthew Hale, and Rowland Jewks) were in negotiation with the Bodleian library to transfer Selden&#x27;s entire collection. In 1659, the executors stipulated that Selden&#x27;s manuscripts &quot;bee forever heerafter kepte together in one distincte pile and body under the name of Mr. Selden’s Library.&quot; The Bodleian agreed, and the library received Selden&#x27;s collection in June 1659.

Selden&#x27;s collection was the largest received by the Bodleian in the seventeenth century, comprising around 8,000 items. Even this massive collection did not represent the extent of Selden&#x27;s library. Duplicates, meaning books the library already owned, were given to Gloucester Cathedral library. A rumor also circulated in the decades after Selden&#x27;s death that part of his library had remained in London and was destroyed by a fire. The 1704 edition of Edward Chamberlayne&#x27;s &quot;The Present State of England&quot; claimed that a fire at the Inner Temple destroyed &quot;8 Chests full&quot; of Selden&#x27;s manuscripts. Still, the collection the Bodleian received was large enough that it required several years and multiple librarians to fully catalogue. Since then, the original collection has been enhanced by further acquisitions, most notably by a group of forty Selden manuscripts purchased by the Bodleian from James Fairhurst in 1947.
The Selden collection at the Bodleian houses more than 400 manuscript volumes taking up more than 40 meters (approx. 130 feet) of shelf space. The linguistic range of these manuscripts reflects Selden&#x27;s interest in eastern and other languages. The languages represented include

* Russian
** An incomplete Russian-English vocabulary (MS. Selden Supra 61)
** Samples of Russian calligraphy (MS. Arch. Selden A. 72 (5))
* Greek
** Astronomical and musical treatises (MS. Arch. Selden B. 17)
** Several Greek versions of the New Testament Gospels (MS. Selden Supra 2, 3, 6, 28–9)
* Arabic
** Prayers, meditations, and Quranic praises (MS. Selden Superius 3)
** Works on astrology and medicine (MS. Selden Superius 15)
** Works on Algebra and mathematics (MS. Selden Superius 65)
* Hebrew
** Hebrew and Arabic grammar and vocabulary (MS. Selden Supra 107)
** Kabbalah and Kabbalistic collections (MS. Arch. Selden A. 56; MS. Selden Superius 107)
* New World languages
** A treatise on Mexican hieroglyphics (MS. Arch. Selden A. 2)

Many manuscripts relate to Selden&#x27;s study of the law both in England and internationally. These include

* A fragment on Islamic law (MS. Selden Superius 42)
* Canon law (MS. Arch. Selden A. 63)
* An account of the laws of Ivan the Terrible (MS. Selden Supra. 59)
*Various legal topics, such as maritime law and a Latin treatise on procedure in Civil Courts (MS. Arch. Selden B. 27)

Some manuscripts touch on contemporary events. For instance MS. Arch. Selden B. 8 includes a Latin speech given in Oxford on the return of Prince Charles from Spain in 1623. Still others contain classical works of philosophy and literature, such as

* Treatises of Aristotle (MS. Selden Supra 24)
* Aeschylus and Lycophron (MS. Selden Supra 18)
Beyond manuscripts, the Selden collection contains several notable printed works. Among them is the first book ever printed in Japan using moveable type, &quot;Sanctos no gosagueo no uchi nuqigaqi&quot; (Arch.b.f.69). The printed books included in the Selden collection contain many that are significant in part because they originated in the libraries of other famous figures, including Sir Robert Cotton, John Donne, and John Dee. According to Geoffrey Keynes, several of the books Selden received from John Donne&#x27;s library include inscriptions from both men. One such book is Theodorus Beza&#x27;s &quot;Tractatio de polygamia&quot;, which includes Donne&#x27;s signature and motto (&quot;Per Rachel ho servitor, &amp; non per Lea&quot;), as well as Selden&#x27;s motto (&quot;περί παντός τήν έλευθερίαν&quot;, &quot;Freedom above all things&quot;).

<text>This article deals with the stamps and postal history of the Austrian Empire, Cisleithania within Austria-Hungary, and the Republic of Austria.

==The historical context==

The Austrian Empire stamps were first issued on June 1, 1850: a coat of arms under the text KK Post-Stempel. KK is German abbreviation for &quot;Kaiserlich-Königlich&quot; (Imperial-Royal) as the Habsburgs were indeed Emperor and Kings. The word Austria does not appear. 

Territory of the Austrian Empire included current following countries:
* in the north: the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland;
* in the East Ukraine and Romania; 
* in the South Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro and the north of Italy;
* Austria and Hungary.

The languages used in the empire were German, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Serbo-Croat, Polish and French (postmark &quot;Chargé&quot;).

For a better understanding of the historical context, see the article Austria-Hungary.

== Empire (1850–1867) and Dual-Monarchy (1867–1918) ==
The first postage stamp issue of the Empire of Austria was a series of imperforate typographed stamps featuring the coat of arms. At first they were printed on a rough handmade paper, but after 1854 a smooth machine-made paper was used instead. Issues between 1858 and 1861 used a profile of Emperor Franz Josef, then switched back to the coat of arms, in an oval frame. Four clichés of the 1850 issue had St. Andrew&#x27;s crosses printed per pane so that an even multiple of florins were paid per pane sold.

The scarlet Red Mercury (&quot;Zinnoberrote Merkur&quot;, lit. &quot;vermilion Mercury&quot;), issued on March 21, 1856, is the rarest of the lithographed newspaper stamps authorized on September 12, 1850 which bore Mercury heads but no denominations. The low value blue variety used to frank individual newspapers is the commonest but the higher values in yellow, rose, and scarlet were used on wrappers of bundles of 10 or 50 newspapers and were often discarded.

Franz Josef profiles reappeared in 1867, as a side effect of the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (at this point Hungary began issuing its own stamps), and continued until 1907, with various changes, including a change of monetary system in 1899 - from 60 kreutzer to the florin to 100 heller to the crown.
1899 also saw the appearance of varnish bars, as diagonal shiny yellowish strips applied to the stamp paper before printing, intended to prevent cleaning and reuse of stamps. The experiment was abandoned with the 1908 issue.

In 1908, Austria issued a series of large pictorial stamps, designed by Koloman Moser, to commemorate the 60th year of Franz Josef&#x27;s reign, depicting previous emperors, Franz Josef at various ages, Schönbrunn Palace, and the Hofburg (both in Vienna). The designs were reused in 1910 for a Birthday Jubilee issue celebrating Franz Josef&#x27;s 80th birthday, the dates &quot;1830&quot; and &quot;1910&quot; being added at top and bottom.

A series in 1916 depicted Franz Josef, the Austrian crown, and the coat of arms, and between 1917 and 1919 Emperor Charles I briefly made an appearance on stamps before the republic was established.

=== Austro-German Postal Union ===
On 6 April 1850 the Austro-German Postal Union agreement was concluded between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Prussia to take effect from 1 July 1850. The primary purpose of the agreement was to provide a uniform system of postal rates. By 1 June 1852 all the remaining German states joined the Union. It subsequently became the model for the creation of the Universal Postal Union in 1874.

== First Republic (1918–1938) ==

The first issues of the Republic of German Austria were overprints reading &quot;Deutschösterreich&quot; on stamps of the empire, issued beginning in December 1918.

In 1919 the Republic of Austria issued stamps with new designs; a post horn, the coat of arms, a kneeling man representing the new republic, and the Parliament building, all done in a vaguely Art Nouveau style, and inscribed &quot;DEUTSCHÖSTERREICH&quot; (&quot;ÖSTERREICH&quot; appeared in 1922).

However, Austria was caught in the hyperinflation of the early 1920s, and was forced to print new stamps in ever-increasing denominations, topping out at a 10,000 kroner value in 1924. (Even so, Austria was still better off than neighbor Germany, which at that time was issuing stamps of 50 billion marks.)

In 1925, a new monetary system was introduced, 100 groschen to the schilling, which continued in use until replaced by the euro in 2002. New stamps were printed also, featuring numerals (for the low values), a field crossed by telegraph wires, a white-shouldered eagle, and a church of the Minorite Friars. Subsequent issues depicted scenic views (1929), and costumes of various districts (1934). The assassinated chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss was commemorated in both 1934 and 1936.

== Nazi Germany (1938–1945) ==

In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed Austria and incorporated its territory, which put a sudden end to Austria&#x27;s stamps. Although the entry of German troops in March was sudden, the transition of the postal system took several months; and included a period where German stamps were required in addition to Austrian stamps (a mixed franking). After the transition period was over, Austrians used stamps of Germany until the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.

== Allied occupation (1945) ==
The wreckage of World War II included the postage stamp production system, and the Allied occupation forces handled the situation in different ways; the Soviets overprinted German stamps before issuing locally printed stamps, while the American/British/French zone used stamps printed in the United States.

In the Soviet occupation zone, starting on 2 May 1945, the stamps of Germany were overprinted. Initially the overprint consisted of just &quot;Österreich&quot;, or &quot;Österreich&quot;, and a bar obliterating the &quot;Deutsches Reich&quot; inscription. Hitler&#x27;s face remained visible, and this was objectionable, so after 4 June postal clerks were expected to blot out Hitler&#x27;s face manually, until on 21 June a new series of overprints came out with a set of stripes over Hitler. In the meantime, some semi-postal stamps of Germany were also surcharged. In Graz, an additional set of overprints with &quot;Österreich&quot; vertical were issued on 22 May for use in Styria.

New stamps inscribed were issued on 3 July by the Soviet Union, for use in Vienna and surrounding areas, still denominated in German currency.
On the other side of occupied Austria, the Allied Military Government issued a series 28 June depicting a posthorn, for use in areas under Allied occupation (Upper Austria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, Styria, and Carinthia). These stamps were produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., and valid for postage into 1947.

Despite the relatively short period of use, almost all of the occupation-related issues are common and inexpensive to collect today.

== Second Republic (since 1945) ==
General issues produced by the Second Republic became available on 24 November 1945.

Since that time Austria has issued a steady stream of stamps with a variety of subjects, many of them attractively engraved.

== Austria-related issues ==

=== Lombardy-Venetia ===

Lombardy-Venetia was a kingdom in the north of Italy that was part of the Austrian empire. The inhabitants used the Italian lira for money, so in 1850 the government issued stamps identical to those for the rest of Austria, but denominated in values from 5 to 45 centesimi. The monetary system changed in 1858, 100 soldis to the florin, which required a new issue of stamps, designs otherwise identical to the contemporary Austrian issues. Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia in 1859, and Venetia to the new kingdom of Italy in 1866, at which point the Lombardy-Venetia stamps went out of use.

Because of the early date and limited area, all Lombardy-Venetia stamps are uncommon, especially unused, the cheapest costing US$3 or so. The rarest type of newspaper tax stamp last sold for US$100,000.

=== Italian occupation ===

Near the end of World War I, Italy captured the Austrian territories of Trentino and Venezia Giulia. In 1918, Italy issued overprinted stamps for these areas. Stamps sold at Trieste were overprinted &quot;Regno d&#x27;Italia / Venezia Giulia / 3. XI. 18.&quot; on Austrian stamps of 1916, and then just &quot;Venezia / Giulia&quot; on Italian stamps, while in the Trentino the overprint was &quot;Regno d Italia / Trentino / 3 nov 1918&quot; on Austrian stamps and then just &quot;Venezia / Tridentina&quot; on Italian stamps. In January 1919 the Italians issued overprinted stamps for all of the occupied territories, the overprint consisting of, for instance, &quot;5 / centesimi / di corona&quot;. This lasted until September, when the Trentino was permanently assigned to Italy and used Italian stamps thereafter, while Trieste became a free city.

=== Austrian post offices abroad ===

During the 19th and early 20th centuries Austria maintained post offices in the Levant (Ottoman empire) and in Liechtenstein (Balzers and Vaduz, considered domestic post office):

=== Military post ===

Austria-Hungary issued stamps named Feldpost (K.u.K. FELDPOST) in 1915 until 1918 for use in the occupied regions.
== Postal stationery ==

The first items of postal stationery to be issued by Austria were envelopes &quot;Briefumschlägen&quot; in 1861 followed by postal cards &quot;Korrespondenzkarten&quot; in 1869 and wrappers in 1872. The concept of &quot;Korrespondenzkarten&quot; has been invented in 1869 by Emanuel Herrmann. They have been printed in eight languages.

Lettercards were issued in 1886 and aerogrammes were first issued in 1952.

<text>William Noy (1577 – 9 August 1634) was an English jurist.

He was born on the family estate of Pendrea in St Buryan, Cornwall. He left Exeter College, Oxford, without taking a degree, and entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1594. From 1603 until his death he was elected, with one exception, to each parliament, sitting invariably for a constituency of his native county. For several years his sympathies were in antagonism to the court party, yet every commission that was appointed numbered Noy among its members, and even those who were opposed to him in politics acknowledged his learning.

A few years before his death he changed political allegiance, went over to the side of the court, and in October 1631 he was created Attorney-general, but was never knighted. It was through his advice that the impost of ship money was levied, resulting in a controversy that helped trigger the English Civil War. Noy suffered from stones, and died in great pain; he was buried at New Brentford church.

His principal works are &quot;On the Grounds and Maxims of the Laws of this Kingdom&quot; (1641) and &quot;The Compleat Lawyer&quot; (1661).

<text>Sir John Coke MP JP PC (5 March 1563 – 8 September 1644) was an English civil servant and naval administrator, described by one commentator as &quot;the Samuel Pepys of his day&quot;. He was MP for various constituencies in the House of Commons between 1621 and 1629, and served as Secretary of State under Charles I, playing a key part in government during the eleven years of Personal Rule from 1629 to 1640.

The younger son of a Derbyshire lawyer, Coke owed his career to the patronage of Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, both of whom valued his efficiency and capacity for hard work. This brought him to the attention of Charles I, who appointed him Secretary of State in 1625 with responsibility for implementing his domestic policy. The Royalist statesman Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon later wrote that he was &quot;unadorn’d with any parts of vigour or quickness&quot;, but he retained this position until dismissed at the age of 77 in January 1640.

When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, his eldest son John supported Parliament while his younger son Thomas joined the Royalists. Too old to take part and with his country house of Melbourne Hall occupied by a Parliamentarian garrison, Coke moved to Tottenham, where he died on 8 September 1644.

==Personal details==

John Coke was born in Trusley on 5 March 1563, second son of Richard Coke (ca.1540–1582), a prominent Derbyshire lawyer, and his wife Mary. He was one of at least four children, the others being his elder brother Francis (1561–1639), who inherited the family estates, George Coke (1570–1646), later Bishop of Hereford, and Dorothy, wife of Valentine Cary (ca. 1570–1626), Bishop of Exeter from 1621 to 1626.

Coke married twice, the first time in 1604 to Mary or Marie Powell (ca.1578–1624), with whom he had six surviving children; Joseph (ca.1605–1624), John (1607–1650), Thomas (1610–1656), Ann (1617–1686);

==Career==

Thought to have attended Westminster School, Coke entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1576, where he remained for the next fifteen years, serving as a lecturer in rhetoric from 1584 to 1591. During this period, he became loosely acquainted with a circle of friends around Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex including Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, for whom he seems to have acted as an accountant. He left Cambridge in 1591 to work for Greville full time, then spent the years from 1593 to 1597 travelling in Europe, almost certainly on behalf of Essex who was seeking to establish a network of agents there.

In 1621 Coke was elected Member of Parliament for Warwick. He was appointed a Master of Requests in 1622 and was knighted in 1624. In 1624 he was elected MP for St Germans and was re-elected for the seat in 1625. In the parliament of 1625 Coke acted as a secretary of state; in this and later parliaments he introduced the royal requests for money, and defended the foreign policy of Charles I and Buckingham, and afterwards the actions of the king. His actual appointment as secretary dates from September 1625. He was elected MP for Cambridge University in 1626 and 1628. Disliked by the leaders of the popular party, his speeches in the House of Commons did not improve the king&#x27;s position.

Coke married Marie Powell, and they set up home at Hall Court, Kynaston, Much Marcle. Several of their letters to each other survive.

King Charles ruled without a parliament from 1628 and he found Coke&#x27;s industry very useful to him. Coke kept his post until 1640. Dismissed from office, he retired to his estate at Melbourne in Derbyshire, which he had bought in 1628. He died at his house in Tottenham near London, on 8 September 1644.

Coke in his earlier years had been a defender of absolute monarchy and greatly disliked the papacy. He was described by Clarendon as &quot;a man of very dumb education and a narrower mind&quot;; and again he says, &quot;his cardinal perfection was industry and his most eminent infirmity covetousness.&quot;

Coke&#x27;s elder son, Sir John Coke was a Parliamentarian in the English Civil War, while his younger son Thomas Coke was a Royalist.
The Coke family continued to own Melbourne Hall until George Lewis Coke, an ambiguous figure who died childless in 1777. His sister married the family&#x27;s lawyer and the Coke name was lost.

<doc id="197279" wikidata="Q706475" url="?curid=197279" title="Steve McQueen (director)">
<text>Sir Steve Rodney McQueen (born 9 October 1969) is a British film director, film producer, screenwriter, and video artist. Known for directing films that deal with intense subject matters, he has received several awards including an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He was honoured with the BFI Fellowship in 2016 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2020 for services to art and film. In 2014, he was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the &quot;most influential people in the world&quot;. 

McQueen began his formal training studying painting at London&#x27;s Chelsea College of Art and Design. He later pursued film at Goldsmiths College and briefly at New York University. Influenced by Jean Vigo, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman, and Andy Warhol, McQueen started making short films. In 1999 McQueen was awarded the Turner Prize for his &quot;range&quot; and &quot;emotional intensity&quot; of his art.

He made his feature length directorial film debut with the historical drama &quot;Hunger&quot; (2008) which focused on the 1981 Irish hunger strike followed by the erotic psychosexual drama &quot;Shame&quot; (2011) which explored sex addiction. He won the Academy Award for Best Picture directing the historical drama &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; (2013). He also directed the contemporary crime thriller &quot;Widows&quot; (2018), and the World War II drama &quot;Blitz&quot; (2024). 

For television, he released &quot;Small Axe&quot; (2020), a collection of five anthology films &quot;set within London&#x27;s West Indian community from the late 1960s to the early &#x27;80s&quot;. He also directed the BBC documentary series &quot;Uprising&quot; (2021) and the documentary film &quot;Occupied City&quot; (2023).

==Early years and education==
McQueen was born in London to a Grenadian father and a Trinidadian mother, both of whom migrated to England. He grew up in Ealing, West London, and went to Drayton Manor High School. In a 2014 interview, McQueen stated that he had had a very bad experience in school, where he had been placed into a class for students believed best suited &quot;for manual labour, more plumbers and builders, stuff like that&quot;. He said that, when he returned to present some achievement awards, the new head of the school claimed that there had been institutional racism at the time. McQueen added that he was dyslexic and had to wear an eyepatch because of a lazy eye, and reflected this may be why he was &quot;put to one side very quickly&quot;.

He was a keen football player, turning out for the West London youth football team St. George&#x27;s Colts. He took A-level art at Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, then studied art and design at Chelsea College of Arts and then fine art at Goldsmiths College, University of London, where he first became interested in film. He left Goldsmiths and studied briefly at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in the United States. He found the approach there too stifling and insufficiently experimental, complaining that &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t let you throw the camera up in the air&quot;. His artistic influences include Andy Warhol, Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, Jean Vigo, Buster Keaton, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Robert Bresson, and Billy Wilder.

==Career==
===1990–2007: Short films and visual art===

McQueen&#x27;s films as an artist were typically projected onto one or more walls of an enclosed space in an art gallery, and often in black-and-white and minimalistic. He has cited the influence of the &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; and the films of Andy Warhol. He often appeared in the films himself. McQueen met the art curator Okwui Enwezor in 1995 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. Enwezor became a mentor to him as well as a friend and had a significant influence on McQueen&#x27;s work.

His first major work was &quot;Bear&quot; (1993), in which two naked men (one of them McQueen) exchange a series of glances that might be taken to be flirtatious or threatening. &quot;Deadpan&quot; (1997) is a restaging of a Buster Keaton stunt in which a house collapses around McQueen, who is left unscathed because he is standing where there is a missing window.

As well as being in black-and-white, both these films are silent. The first of McQueen&#x27;s films to use sound was also the first to use multiple images: &quot;Drumroll&quot; (1998). This was made with three cameras, two mounted to the sides, and one to the front of an oil drum, which McQueen rolled through the streets of Manhattan. The resulting films are projected on three walls of an enclosed space. McQueen has also made sculptures such as &quot;White Elephant&quot; (1998), as well as photographs.

He won the Turner Prize in 1999, although much of the publicity went to Tracey Emin, who was also a nominee. In 2006, he went to Iraq as an official war artist. The following year he presented &quot;Queen and Country&quot;, a piece that commemorated British soldiers killed in the Iraq War by presenting their portraits as sheets of stamps. A proposal to have the stamps placed in circulation was rejected by the Royal Mail.

His 2007 short film &quot;Gravesend&quot; depicted the process of coltan refinement and production. It premiered at The Renaissance Society in the United States.

===2008–2018: Breakthrough as filmmaker ===

In 2008, his first feature-length film &quot;Hunger&quot;, about the 1981 Irish hunger strike, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. McQueen received the Caméra d&#x27;Or (first-time director) Award at Cannes, the first British director to win the award. The film was also awarded the inaugural Sydney Film Festival Prize for &quot;its controlled clarity of vision, its extraordinary detail and bravery, the dedication of its cast and the power and resonance of its humanity&quot;. The film also won the 2008 Diesel Discovery Award at the Toronto International Film Festival; the award is voted on by the press attending the festival. &quot;Hunger&quot; also won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for a New Generation film in 2008 and the best film prize at the London Evening Standard Film Awards in 2009.

McQueen represented Britain at the 2009 Venice Biennale. In 2009, it was announced that McQueen has been tapped to direct &quot;Fela&quot;, a biopic about the Nigerian musician and activist Fela Kuti; however, by 2014, the proposal was no longer produced under Focus Features, and while he maintained his role as the main writer, McQueen was replaced by Andrew Dosunmu as the director. McQueen told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that the film was &quot;dead&quot;.
In 2011, McQueen&#x27;s second major theatrical film &quot;Shame&quot; was released. Set in New York City, it stars Michael Fassbender as a sex addict whose life is suddenly turned upside-down when his estranged sister (Carey Mulligan) reappears. The film was premiered at Venice Film Festival and was shown at the New York Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival. It received critical acclaim with Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; giving the film four out of four stars and describing it as &quot;a powerful film&quot; and &quot;courageous and truthful&quot;, commenting that &quot;this is a great act of filmmaking and acting. I don&#x27;t believe I would be able to see it twice.&quot; Ebert would later name it his second best film of 2011. Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; gave the film a positive review, stating, &quot;Driven by a brilliant, ferocious performance by Michael Fassbender, &quot;Shame&quot; is a real walk on the wild side, a scorching look at a case of sexual addiction that&#x27;s as all-encompassing as a craving for drugs.&quot;

McQueen&#x27;s next film was &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; (2013). Based on the 1853 autobiography of the same name by Solomon Northup, the film tells the story of a free black man who is kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery, working on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before being released. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in March 2014, becoming the first Best Picture winner to have a black director or producer. The film also won a supporting actress Oscar for Lupita Nyong&#x27;o. On the process of making &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot;, actor and producer Brad Pitt stated: &quot;Steve was the first to ask the big question, &#x27;Why has there not been more films on the American history of slavery?&#x27;. And it was the big question it took a Brit to ask.&quot;
In 2012, McQueen debuted a new artistic installation &quot;End Credits&quot;, which focuses on the political persecution of Paul Robeson, with over 10 hours each of video footage and audio recordings, unsynced. It has been exhibited at a number of locations including the Art Institute of Chicago, Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, Perez Art Museum (Miami), and (June 2019) International Performing Arts festival in Amsterdam. In 2014 he announced plans to do a feature film on Robeson with Harry Belafonte.

In 2013, McQueen signed on to develop &quot;Codes of Conduct&quot;, a six-episode limited series for HBO. However, after the pilot episode was shot, HBO shut down production. He also worked on a BBC drama about the lives of black Britons, which follows a group of friends and their families from 1968 to 2014.

In 2015, McQueen shot the video for Kanye West&#x27;s single &quot;All Day&quot;. The film was screened at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris on 7 March 2015 before the first concert of a four-night residency by the American artist, at the Frank Gehry-designed building, began. The film subsequently received its American premiere at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in July 2015.

In 2018, McQueen directed &quot;Widows&quot;, which was co-written with &quot;Gone Girl&quot; writer Gillian Flynn and based on the 1983 British series of the same name. Viola Davis starred in the heist thriller about four armed robbers who are killed in a failed heist attempt, only to have their widows step up to finish the job. He also directed a one-minute commercial for Chanel&#x27;s men fragrance Bleu de Chanel starring Gaspard Ulliel.

===2019–present: Streaming projects ===

In 2019, it was announced that &quot;Small Axe&quot;, an anthology series of five films created and directed by McQueen, would be released on BBC One and Amazon Prime Video. Some form of the series had been in development since 2012, and was first announced in 2014. The series focuses on &quot;five stories set within London&#x27;s West Indian community from the late 1960s to the early &#x27;80s&quot;. Three films in the series premiered at the New York Film Festival, receiving critical acclaim. The series was released weekly on BBC One and Amazon Prime Video starting in November 2020.

The anthology was a particularly personal project for McQueen, as it portrays the larger community that he grew up in. They are films he felt should have been made &quot;35 years ago, 25 years ago, but they weren&#x27;t&quot;.

To close the Anthology, McQueen chose to base the final film, &quot;Education&quot;, on a story from his own life.

The anthology, particularly the films &quot;Mangrove&quot; and &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;, received numerous accolades and appeared on several critics&#x27; top ten lists. &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; was the top-ranked film in &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; best films of 2020, an aggregation of top 10 lists by the magazine&#x27;s contributors. Both &quot;Mangrove&quot; and &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; were selected for Cannes in 2020, and had the festival not been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, McQueen would have been the first director to have two films in competition in Cannes in the same year.

According to &quot;Film Stage&quot;, Jordan Raup reported that McQueen would direct a WWII documentary titled &quot;Occupied City&quot; dealing with the occupation of Amsterdam by German forces between 1940 and 1945. It premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

He returned to feature filmmaking with &quot;Blitz&quot;, a story about Londoners during &quot;The Blitz&quot; of World War II, which he wrote, directed and produced. It received its world premiere as the BFI London Film Festival&#x27;s opening film on October 9, 2024, screened at the Chicago International Film Festival October 22, 2024, and is scheduled for release in select cinemas in the United Kingdom and United States on November 1, 2024, followed by a streaming release on Apple TV+ on November 22, 2024.

==Experimental and short films==
&quot;Bear&quot; (1993) was McQueen&#x27;s first major film, presented at the Royal College of Art in London. Although not an overtly political piece, for many it raised questions about race, sexual attraction to men, and violence. It shows a wrestling match between two men who alternate ambiguous relations and gestures of aggression and erotic attraction. Like all McQueen&#x27;s early films, &quot;Bear&quot; is black-and-white, and was shot on 16-millimetre film. It was featured in a two-part film exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.

&quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1995) is a short film by McQueen. It follows a woman across a tight-rope; McQueen has stated that he finds a tight-rope walker to be &quot;the perfect image of a combination of vulnerability and strength&quot;.

&quot;Just Above My Head&quot; (1996) is a short film which shares close ties with McQueen&#x27;s preceding film with the key theme of walking. A man – played by McQueen – is shot in a way so as to crop out his body, but his head appears small at the bottom of the image, rising and falling with his step and coming in and out of frame according to the movement of the camera. As stated by David Frankel, the &quot;simultaneous fragility and persistence&quot; is seemingly meant as a metaphor for black life in England as elsewhere.

&quot;Deadpan&quot; (1997) is a four-minute black and white short film directed by and starring McQueen showing a multitude of angles on a reenactment of a stunt from Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot;. &quot;Frieze Magazine&quot; noted his lack of shoelaces and inferred a multitude of depth and commentary on the prison system. Media Art noted that his use of black and white emulates 1920s film style without &quot;a historicizing strategy or to reinterpret the origins of moving images&quot;. The film was exhibited on loop in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s &quot;Contemporary Galleries, 1980-Now&quot; from 17 November 2011 to 17 February 2014.

&quot;Exodus&quot; (1997) is a 65-second colour video that takes the title of a record by Bob Marley as its starting point. It records a found event, two black men carrying potted palms whom McQueen followed down a London street, the greenery waving precariously above their heads. Then they get on a bus and leave.

&quot;Caribs&#x27; Leap/Western Deep&quot; (2002), two complementary shorts, were commissioned for documenta 11. &quot;Carib&#x27;s Leap&quot; explores an event in the Caribbean island of Grenada when, in 1651, the last remaining community of Caribs, resisting French colonialism, chose to leap to their death. &quot;Western Deep&quot; is a powerful exploration of the sensory experience of the TauTona Gold Mine in South Africa, showing migrant labourers working in dark, claustrophobic environments and the ear-splitting noise of drilling.

&quot;Pursuit (Version 2)&quot; (2005), a 16mm film transferred to video as a front and rear-projected mirror installation on three walls, is a 14-minute film selected for the Sharjah Biennial 15: Thinking Historically in the Present. The work originally premiered at the Fondazione Prada, Milan in 2005. Consisting of a sound and video installation with mirrored walls, the imagery is difficult to discern in the chaotic, low-light setting which has been described as disorienting and kaleidoscopic.

&quot;Running Thunder&quot; (2007), an 11-minute short film of a dead horse in a meadow. It was bought by the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 2014.

==Personal life==
McQueen is married to Bianca Stigter, a Dutch cultural critic, with whom he has a daughter and a son, Alex and Dexter. Since 1997, the McQueens have kept a home in Amsterdam, in addition to their home in London. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to the visual arts, and was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to film. McQueen has been twice listed in the Powerlist Top 10 of the most influential Black Britons.

McQueen was a fan of English football club Tottenham Hotspur, but said in 2014: &quot;I gave up football. It affected my day too much. It&#x27;s just stupid.&quot; 

==Political views==
In 2014, McQueen criticised the film industry for ignoring American slavery and the Atlantic slave trade, saying that World War II &quot;lasted five years and there are hundreds and hundreds of films about the second world war and the Holocaust. Slavery lasted 400 years and there are less than 20 [films].&quot;

In June 2020, McQueen accused the film and television industry in the United Kingdom of racism and a lack of racial diversity. He wrote an op-ed for the &quot;Guardian&quot; about the &quot;blatant racism&quot; of the British film industry, saying &quot;I visited a TV-film set in London. It felt like I had walked out of one environment, the London I was surrounded by, into another, a place that was alien to me. I could not believe the whiteness of the set.&quot; He said there were not enough opportunities for black actors in the UK film industry.

In October 2020, he said he experienced racism &quot;every day&quot;. He expressed support for the George Floyd protests.

<text>Eadmer or Edmer ( – ) was an English historian, theologian, and ecclesiastic. He is known for being a contemporary biographer of his archbishop and companion, Saint Anselm, in his &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot;, and for his &quot;Historia novorum in Anglia&quot;, which presents the public face of Anselm. Eadmer&#x27;s history is written to support the primacy of Canterbury over York, a central concern for Anselm.

==Life==
Eadmer was born of Anglo-Saxon parentage, shortly before the Norman conquest of England in 1066. He became a monk in the Benedictine monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, where he made the acquaintance of Anselm, at that time visiting England as abbot of the Abbey of Bec. The intimacy was renewed when Anselm became archbishop of Canterbury in 1093; afterward Eadmer was not only Anselm&#x27;s disciple, but also his friend and director, being formally appointed to this position by Pope Urban II. In 1120 he was nominated to the bishopric of St. Andrews (Cell Rígmonaid), but as the Scots would not recognize the authority of the see of Canterbury he was never consecrated, and soon afterwards he resigned his claim to the bishopric. His death is accepted as during or after 1126.

Eadmer must also be credited with influencing the spread of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the West when he defended popular traditions in his &quot;De Conceptione sanctae Mariae&quot;. The origins of the dogma lay in the East and had been long-established in Greece. The idea began to gain currency in England in the opening decades of the 11th Century and had become the subject of liturgical veneration and a feast day (8 or 9 December) at Canterbury, Worcester and Winchester by about 1030. The feast had been discarded by Lanfranc in his reorganization of the liturgical calendar after the Conquest and Eadmer&#x27;s advocacy of a sinless Mary was probably motivated as much by the restoration of local Anglo-Saxon devotions at Canterbury as with the wider propagation of the doctrine. The idea that Mary herself was born of a Virgin was not sanctioned by Rome and was considered by some to be a heresy. Whilst Eadmer argued that Christ&#x27;s human perfection required that his Mother should be also without sin, Anselm held that by excluding any person from the taint of Original Sin destroyed the absolute necessity for the Incarnation. The fact that the doctrine spread throughout England and France throughout the Twelfth Century may have been largely, and ironically, due to the mis-attribution of Eadmer&#x27;s &quot;De Conceptione Sanctae Mariae&quot; to Anselm&#x27;s authorship.

==Works==
Eadmer left a large number of writings, the most important of which is his &quot;Historia novorum in Anglia&quot;, a work which deals mainly with the history of England between 1066 and 1122. Although concerned principally with ecclesiastical affairs, the &quot;Historia&quot;, scholars agree, is one of the ablest and most valuable writings of its kind. It was first edited by John Selden in 1623 and, with Eadmer&#x27;s &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot;, was edited by Martin Rule for the &quot;Rolls Series&quot; (London, 1884). R. W. Southern re-edited &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot; in 1963 with a facing page translation, and Geoffrey Bosanquet translated the Rolls text of &quot;Historia Novorum&quot; in 1964.

The &quot;Vita Anselmi&quot;, written in about 1124, and first printed at Antwerp in 1551, is probably the best contemporary life of the saint. Less noteworthy are Eadmer&#x27;s lives of St Dunstan, St Bregwine, archbishop of Canterbury, and St Oswald, archbishop of York. The manuscripts of most of Eadmer&#x27;s works are preserved in the Parker Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

<doc id="197284" wikidata="Q1151839" url="?curid=197284" title="Prospect theory">
<text>Prospect theory is a theory of behavioral economics, judgment and decision making that was developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. The theory was cited in the decision to award Kahneman the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.

Based on results from controlled studies, it describes how individuals assess their loss and gain perspectives in an asymmetric manner (see loss aversion). For example, for some individuals, the pain from losing $1,000 could only be compensated by the pleasure of earning $2,000. Thus, contrary to the expected utility theory (which models the decision that perfectly rational agents would make), prospect theory aims to describe the actual behavior of people.

In the original formulation of the theory, the term &quot;prospect&quot; referred to the predictable results of a lottery. However, prospect theory can also be applied to the prediction of other forms of behaviors and decisions.

Prospect theory challenges the expected utility theory developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 and constitutes one of the first economic theories built using experimental methods.

==History==

In the draft received by the economist Richard Thaler in 1976, the term &quot;Value Theory&quot; was used instead of Prospect Theory. Later on, Kahneman and Tversky changed the title to Prospect Theory to avoid possible confusions. According to Kahneman, the new title was &#x27;meaningless.&#x27;

== Overview ==

Prospect theory stems from loss aversion, where the observation is that agents asymmetrically feel losses greater than that of an equivalent gain. It centralises around the idea that people conclude their utility from &quot;gains&quot; and &quot;losses&quot; relative to a certain reference point. This &quot;reference point&quot; is different for each person and relative to their individual situation. Thus, rather than making decisions like a rational agent (i.e using expected utility theory and choosing the maximum value), decisions are made in relativity not in absolutes.

Consider two scenarios;

# 100% chance to gain $450 or 50% chance to gain $1000
# 100% chance to lose $500 or 50% chance to lose $1100

Prospect theory suggests that;

* When faced with a risky choice leading to gains agents are &quot;risk averse&quot;, preferring the certain outcome with a lower expected utility (concave value function). 
** &quot;Agents will choose the certain $450 even though the expected utility of the risky gain is higher&quot;
* When faced with a risky choice leading to losses agents are &quot;risk seeking&quot;, preferring the outcome that has a lower expected utility but the potential to avoid losses (convex value function).
** &quot;Agents will choose the 50% chance to lose $1100 even though the expected utility is lower, due to the chance that they lose nothing at all&quot;

These two examples are thus in contradiction with the expected utility theory, which only considers choices with the maximum utility. Also, the concavity for gains and convexity for losses implies diminishing marginal utility with increasing gains/losses. In other words, someone who has more money has a lower desire for a fixed amount of gain (and lower aversion to a fixed amount of loss) than someone who has less money.

The theory continues with a second concept, based on the observation that people attribute excessive weight to events with low probabilities and insufficient weight to events with high probability. For example, individuals may unconsciously treat an outcome with a probability of 99% as if its probability were 95%, and an outcome with probability of 1% as if it had a probability of 5%. Under- and over-weighting of probabilities is importantly distinct from under- and over-estimating probabilities, a different type of cognitive bias observed for example in the overconfidence effect.

==Model==
The theory describes the decision processes in two stages:
*During an initial phase termed &quot;editing&quot;, outcomes of a decision are ordered according to a certain heuristic. In particular, people decide which outcomes they consider equivalent, set a reference point and then consider lesser outcomes as losses and greater ones as gains. The editing phase aims to alleviate any framing effects. It also aims to resolve isolation effects stemming from individuals&#x27; propensity to often isolate consecutive probabilities instead of treating them together. The editing process can be viewed as composed of coding, combination, segregation, cancellation, simplification and detection of dominance.
*In the subsequent &quot;evaluation&quot; phase, people behave as if they would compute a value (utility), based on the potential outcomes and their respective probabilities, and then choose the alternative having a higher utility.

The formula that Kahneman and Tversky assume for the evaluation phase is (in its simplest form) given by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the overall or expected utility of the outcomes to the individual making the decision, formula_3 are the potential outcomes and formula_4 their respective probabilities and formula_5 is a function that assigns a value to an outcome. The value function that passes through the reference point is s-shaped and asymmetrical. Losses hurt more than gains feel good (loss aversion). This differs from expected utility theory, in which a rational agent is indifferent to the reference point. In expected utility theory, the individual does not care how the outcome of losses and gains are framed. The function formula_6 is a probability weighting function and captures the idea that people tend to overreact to small probability events, but underreact to large probabilities. Let formula_7 denote a prospect with outcome formula_8 with probability formula_9 and outcome formula_10 with probability formula_11 and nothing with probability formula_12. If formula_7 is a regular prospect (i.e., either formula_14, or formula_15, or formula_16), then:

formula_17

However, if formula_18 and either formula_19 or formula_20, then:

formula_21

It can be deduced from the first equation that formula_22 and formula_23. The value function is thus defined on deviations from the reference point, generally concave for gains and commonly convex for losses and steeper for losses than for gains. If formula_24 is equivalent to formula_25 then formula_26 is not preferred to formula_27, but from the first equation it follows that formula_28, which leads to formula_29, therefore:

formula_30

This means that for a fixed ratio of probabilities the decision weights are closer to unity when probabilities are low than when they are high. In prospect theory, formula_6 is never linear. In the case that formula_19, formula_33 and formula_34 prospect formula_35 dominates prospect formula_36, which means that formula_37, therefore:

formula_38

As formula_39, formula_40, but since formula_41, it would imply that formula_6 must be linear; however, dominated alternatives are brought to the evaluation phase since they are eliminated in the editing phase. Although direct violations of dominance never happen in prospect theory, it is possible that a prospect A dominates B, B dominates C but C dominates A.

==Example==
To see how prospect theory can be applied, consider the decision to buy insurance. Assume the probability of the insured risk is 1%, the potential loss is $1,000 and the premium is $15. If we apply prospect theory, we first need to set a reference point. This could be the current wealth or the worst case (losing $1,000). If we set the frame to the current wealth, the decision would be to either

1. Pay $15 for insurance, which yields a prospect-utility of formula_43,

OR

2. Enter a lottery with possible outcomes of $0 (probability 99%) or −$1,000 (probability 1%), which yields a prospect-utility of formula_44.

According to prospect theory,

* formula_45, because low probabilities are usually overweighted;
* formula_46, by the convexity of value function in losses.

The comparison between formula_47 and formula_48 is not immediately evident. However, for typical value and weighting functions, formula_49, and hence formula_50. That is, a strong overweighting of small probabilities is likely to undo the effect of the convexity of formula_5 in losses, making the insurance attractive.

If we set the frame to -$1,000, we have a choice between formula_52 and formula_53. In this case, the concavity of the value function in gains and the underweighting of high probabilities can also lead to a preference for buying the insurance.

The interplay of overweighting of small probabilities and concavity-convexity of the value function leads to the so-called &quot;fourfold pattern of risk attitudes&quot;: risk-averse behavior when gains have moderate probabilities or losses have small probabilities; risk-seeking behavior when losses have moderate probabilities or gains have small probabilities.

Below is an example of the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes. The first item in each quadrant shows an example prospect (e.g. 95% chance to win $10,000 is high probability and a gain). The second item in the quadrant shows the focal emotion that the prospect is likely to evoke. The third item indicates how most people would behave given each of the prospects (either Risk Averse or Risk Seeking). The fourth item states expected attitudes of a potential defendant and plaintiff in discussions of settling a civil suit.

Probability distortion is that people generally do not look at the value of probability uniformly between 0 and 1. Lower probability is said to be over-weighted (that is, a person is overly concerned with the outcome of the probability) while medium to high probability is under-weighted (that is, a person is not concerned enough with the outcome of the probability). The exact point in which probability goes from over-weighted to under-weighted is arbitrary, but a good point to consider is probability = 0.33. A person values probability = 0.01 much more than the value of probability = 0 (probability = 0.01 is said to be over-weighted). However, a person has about the same value for probability = 0.4 and probability = 0.5. Also, the value of probability = 0.99 is much less than the value of probability = 1, a sure thing (probability = 0.99 is under-weighted). A little more in depth when looking at probability distortion is that &quot;π&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) + &quot;π&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;) &lt; 1 (where &quot;π&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is probability in prospect theory).

== Myopic Loss Aversion (MLA) ==
Myopic loss aversion (MLA), a concept derived from prospect theory, refers to the natural tendency of humans to focus on short-term losses and gains and to weigh them more heavily than long-term losses and gains. This bias can lead to seemingly poorer decision making, as individuals may focus towards avoiding immediate losses instead of achieving long-term gains.

A prolific study that examined myopic loss aversion was conducted by Gneezy and Potters in 1997.[9] In this study, participants engaged in a straightforward betting game in which they could either place a bet on a coin landing , or they could choose to not bet at all. The participants were provided with a fixed amount of money, and held the task to maximize their earnings over a series of rounds.

The results of the study exhibited that participants were more likely to place a bet when they had just lost money in the previous round, and they were more likely to avoid a bet when they had just won money in the previous round. This behavior is consistent with myopic loss aversion theory, as the participants were placing greater magnitude on their short-term gains and losses instead of their overall earnings over the course of the study.

Additionally, the findings revealed that the participants that were provided with a higher amount of money at the beginning of the study tended to be more risk-averse than those who were given a lower starting amount. This observation supports the concept of diminishing sensitivity to changes in wealth predicted by prospect theory.

Overall, the study by Gneezy and Potters emphasizes the existence of myopic loss aversion, demonstrating how this bias can result in non-optimal decisions. By analyzing how prospect theory and myopic loss aversion influence decision-making, it provides the ability for researchers and policymakers to create interventions that help people make more informed choices and attain their long-term goals.

When referring to investment decisions, myopic loss aversion has the ability to lead to investment decisions that can be of a more conservative approach. For instance, investors potentially overreact to dips in stock prices in their stock portfolio, which causes feelings of fear and anxiety of profit loss. This reaction from investors has the ability to lead in a loss in profit due to selling off their stock. Studies in behavioral finance analyzed this pattern, observing that there is a tendency to avoid high-reward options in the market, as the risk of short-term loss potentially influences the broker.

Acclaimed behavioral economists Benartzi and Thaler analyzed this concept, calling it the &quot;equity premium puzzle.&quot; This puzzle refers to the fact that stocks, in terms of historical statistics, exceed profits in comparison to bonds over extended periods of time. More interestingly, they observed that newer investors tend not to emphasize stocks over bonds. This phenomenon has been linked by Benartzi and Thaler to myopic loss aversion due to the lack of emphasis on stocks by young investors, as young investors tended to abandon stocks due to minor dips in the market.

This behavior can lead to a decreases market predictability, as investors act on short-term losses by selling their stocks, there can be a ripple effect that intensifies dips in the economy. As investors that are heavily influenced by the market decline sell their stocks, the now increased amount of shares due to mass sell-offs further lower prices. This hypothetical community of investors react along with falling stock prices, causing them to sell, potentially causing the stock price to lower as a whole. This concept, investor anxiety, can potentially emphasize the want to sell of investments for security reasons, regardless of long-term profit potential. This constant market fluctuation is directly related to market stability.

An example of this effect was seen during economic crises such as the 2008 financial crash, when panic induced sell-offs heavily impacted market stability. The period prior to the Great Recession had a &quot;decade-long expansion in US housing market activity peaked in 2006,&quot; which came to a halt in 2007. As the trends prior to 2008 hinted at the fall of mortgage pricing, real-estate investors reacted promptly. The mass sell-offs of mortgaged-backed investments led to a similar instability in other markets, including credit markets, and the stock market.

==Applications==

=== Economics ===
Some behaviors observed in economics, like the disposition effect or the reversing of risk aversion/risk seeking in case of gains or losses (termed the &quot;reflection effect&quot;), can also be explained by referring to the prospect theory.

An important implication of prospect theory is that the way economic agents subjectively frame an outcome or transaction in their mind affects the utility they expect or receive. Narrow framing is a derivative result which has been documented in experimental settings by Tversky and Kahneman, whereby people evaluate new gambles in isolation, ignoring other relevant risks. This phenomenon can be seen in practice in the reaction of people to stock market fluctuations in comparison with other aspects of their overall wealth; people are more sensitive to spikes in the stock market as opposed to their labor income or the housing market. It has also been shown that narrow framing causes loss aversion among stock market investors. And the work of Tversky and Kahneman is largely responsible for the advent of behavioral economics, and is used extensively in mental accounting.

=== Software ===
The digital age has brought the implementation of prospect theory in software. Framing and prospect theory has been applied to a diverse range of situations which appear inconsistent with standard economic rationality: the equity premium puzzle, the excess returns puzzle and long swings/PPP puzzle of exchange rates through the endogenous prospect theory of Imperfect Knowledge Economics, the status quo bias, various gambling and betting puzzles, intertemporal consumption, and the endowment effect. It has also been argued that prospect theory can explain several empirical regularities observed in the context of auctions (such as secret reserve prices) which are difficult to reconcile with standard economic theory.

Online pay-per bid auction sites are a classic example of decision making under risk. Previous attempts at predicting consumer behavior have shown that utility theory does not sufficiently describe decision making under risk. When prospect theory was added to a previously existing model that was attempting to explain consumer behavior during auctions, out-of-sample predictions were shown to be more accurate than a corresponding expected utility model. Specifically, prospect theory was boiled down to certain elements: preference, loss aversion and probability weighting. These elements were then used to find a backward solution on 537,045 auctions. The greater accuracy may be explained by the new model having the ability to correct for two behavioral irrationalities: The sunk cost fallacy and average auctioneer revenues above current retail price. These findings would also imply that the using prospect theory as a descriptive theory of decision making under risk is also accurate in situations where risk arises through the interactions of different people.

=== Politics ===
Given the necessary degree of uncertainty for which prospect theory is applied, it should come as no surprise that it and other psychological models are applied extensively in the context of political decision-making. Both rational choice and game theoretical models generate significant predictive power in the analysis of politics and international relations (IR). But prospect theory, unlike the alternative models, (1) is &quot;founded on empirical data&quot;, (2) allows and accounts for dynamic change, (3) addresses previously-ignored modular elements, (4) emphasizes the situation in the decision-making process, (5) &quot;provides a micro-foundational basis for the explanation of larger phenomena&quot;, and (6) stresses the importance of loss in utility and value calculations. Moreover, again unlike other models, prospect theory &quot;asks different sorts of questions, seeks different evidence, and reaches different conclusions.&quot; However, there exist shortcomings inherent in prospect theory&#x27;s political application, such as the dilemma regarding an actor&#x27;s perceived position on the gain-loss domain spectrum, and the discordance between ideological and pragmatic (i.e. &#x27;in the lab&#x27; versus &#x27;in the field&#x27;) assessments of an actor&#x27;s propensity toward seeking or avoiding risk.

That said, political scientists have applied prospect theory to a wide range of issues in domestic and comparative politics. For example, they have found that politicians are more likely to phrase a radical economic policy as one ensuring 90% employment rather than 10% unemployment, because framing it as the former puts the citizenry in a &quot;domain of gain,&quot; which is thereby conducive to greater populace satisfaction. On a broader scale: Consider an administration debating the implementation of a controversial reform, and that such a reform yields a small chance for a widespread revolt. &quot;[T]he disutility induced by loss aversion,&quot; even with minute probabilities of said insurrection, will dissuade the government from moving forward with the reform.

Scholars have employed prospect theory to shed light on a number of issue areas in politics. For example, Kurt Weyland finds that political leaders do not always undertake bold and politically risky domestic initiatives when they are at the pinnacle of their power. Instead, such policies often appear to be risky gambits initiated by politically vulnerable regimes. He suggests that in Latin America, politically weakened governments were more likely to implement fundamental and economically painful market-oriented reforms, even though they were more vulnerable to political backlash. Barbara Vis and Kees van Kersbergen have reached a similar conclusion in their investigation of Italian welfare reforms.

Maria Fanis uses prospect theory to show how risk acceptance can help domestic groups overcome collective action problems inherent to coalition building. She suggests that collective action is more likely in a perceive domain of loss because individuals become more willing to accept the risk of free riding by others. In Chile, this process led domestic interest groups to form unlikely political coalitions. Zeynep Somer-Topcu&#x27;s research suggests that political parties respond more strongly to electoral defeat than to success in the next election cycle. As prospect theory predicts, parties are more likely to shift their policies in response to a vote loss in the previous election cycle compared to a vote gain. Lawrence Kuznar and James Lutz find that loss frames can increase support of individuals for terrorist groups.

=== International relations ===
International relations theorists have applied prospect theory to a wide range of issues in world politics, especially security-related matters. For example, in war-time, policy-makers, when in a perceived domain of loss, are more likely to take risks that would otherwise have been avoided, e.g. &quot;gambling on a risky rescue mission&quot;, or implementing radical domestic reform to support military efforts.

Early applications of prospect theory in International Relations emphasized the potential to explain anomalies in foreign policy decision-making that remained difficult to account for on the basis of rational choice theory. They developed detailed qualitative case studies of specific foreign policy decisions to explore the role of framing effects in choice selection. For example, Rose McDermott applied prospect theory to a series of case studies in American foreign policy, including the Suez Crisis in 1956, the U-2 Crisis in 1960, the U.S. decision to admit the Iranian shah to the United States in 1979, and the U.S. decision to carry out a hostage rescue mission in 1980. Jeffrey Berejikian employed prospect theory to analyze the genesis of the Montreal Protocol, a landmark environmental agreement.

William Boettcher integrated elements of prospect theory with psychological research on personality dispositions to construct a “Risk Explanation Framework,” which he used to analyze foreign-policy decision making. He then evaluated the framework against six case studies on presidential foreign policy decision-making.

=== Insurance ===
Applications of prospect theory in the context of insurance seek to explain the consumer choices. Syndor (2010) suggests that the probability weighting aspect of prospect theory aims to explain the behaviour of the consumers who choose a higher premium for a reduced deductible even when the annualised claim rate is very low (approximately 5%). In a study of 50,000 customers, they had four options for the deductibles on their policy; $100, $250, $500, $1000. From this it was found that a $500 deductible resulted in a $715 annual premium and $1000 deductible being $615. The customers that chose the $500 deductible were paying an additional $100 per year even though the chance that a claim will be made is extremely low, and the deductible be paid. Under the expected utility framework, this can only be realised through high levels of risk aversion. Households place a greater weight on the probability that a claim will be made when choosing a policy, thus it is suggested that the reference point of the household significantly influences the decisions when it comes to premiums and deductibles. This is consistent with the theory that people assign excessive weight to scenarios with low probabilities and insufficient weight to events with high probability.

==Limits and extensions==
The original version of prospect theory gave rise to violations of first-order stochastic dominance. That is, prospect A might be preferred to prospect B even if the probability of receiving a value x or greater is at least as high under prospect B as it is under prospect A for all values of x, and is greater for some value of x. Later theoretical improvements overcame this problem, but at the cost of introducing intransitivity in preferences. A revised version, called cumulative prospect theory overcame this problem by using a probability weighting function derived from rank-dependent expected utility theory. Cumulative prospect theory can also be used for infinitely many or even continuous outcomes (for example, if the outcome can be any real number). An alternative solution to overcome these problems within the framework of (classical) prospect theory has been suggested as well.

The reference point in the prospect theory inverse s-shaped graph also could lead to limitations due to it possibly being discontinuous at that point and having a geometric violation. This would lead to limitations in regards to accounting for the zero-outcome effect, the absence of behavioral conditionality in risky decisions as well as limitations in deriving the curve. A transitionary concave-convex universal system was proposed to eliminate this limitation.

Critics from the field of psychology argued that even if Prospect Theory arose as a descriptive model, it offers no psychological explanations for the processes stated in it.
Furthermore, factors that are equally important to decision making processes have not been included in the model, such as emotion.

A relatively simple ad hoc decision strategy, the priority heuristic, has been suggested as an alternative model. While it can predict the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979), and predicts the majority choice better than cumulative prospect theory across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems, this heuristic, however, fails to predict many simple decision situations that are typically not tested in experiments and it also does not explain heterogeneity between subjects.

An international survey in 53 countries, published in &quot;Theory and Decision&quot; in 2017, confirmed that prospect theory describes decisions on lotteries well, not only in Western countries, but across many different cultures. The study also found cultural and economic factors influencing systematically average prospect theory parameters.

A study published in &quot;Nature Human Behaviour&quot; in 2020 replicated research on prospect theory and concluded that it successfully replicated: &quot;We conclude that the empirical foundations for prospect theory replicate beyond any reasonable thresholds.&quot;

==Critiques==
Although Prospect Theory is a largely celebrated idea in behavioural economics it does have limitations. The reference point has been argued to be difficult to precisely determine in any given context. Many external factors can influence what the reference point is and thus makes it difficult to define what a “gain” and a “loss” actually is. Kőszegi and Rabin (2007) present the idea of a personal equilibrium in decision making. This is essentially the premise that expectations and context have a large impact on determining the reference point and therefore the perception of “gains” and “losses”. Considering personal equilibrium and choice with risk creates even more ambiguity about the perception of what the reference point may be.

Some critics have charged that while prospect theory seeks to predict what people choose, it does not adequately describe the actual process of decision-making. For example, Nathan Berg and Gerd Gigerenzer claim that neither classical economics nor prospect theory provide a convincing explanation of how people actually make decisions. They go so far as to claim that prospect theory is even more demanding of cognitive resources than classical expected utility theory.

Moreover, scholars have raised doubts about the degree to which framing effects matter. For instance, John List argues that framing effects diminish in complex decision environments. His experimental evidence suggests that as actors gain experience with the consequences of competitive markets, they behave more like rational actors and the impact of prospect theory diminishes.

Steven Kachelmeier and Mohamed Shehata find little support for prospect theory among experimental subjects in China. They do not, however, make a cultural argument against prospect theory. Rather, they conclude that when payoffs are large relative to net wealth, the effect of prospect theory diminishes.

<doc id="197286" wikidata="Q209988" url="?curid=197286" title="Gödöllő">
<text>Gödöllő, officially the City of Gödölló, is a city in Pest County, Budapest metropolitan area, Hungary, about northeast from the outskirts of Budapest. Its population is 34,396 according to the 2010 census and is growing rapidly. It can be easily reached from Budapest with the suburban railway (HÉV), and national railway (MÁV-START).

Gödöllő is home to the Szent István University, the main education institute of agriculture in Hungary. The palace at Gödöllő was originally built for the aristocratic Grassalkovich family; Franz Josef, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary and his wife Elisabeth (&quot;Sisi&quot;) later had their summer residence here.

Communism saw much of the town&#x27;s original one-storey housing levelled to make way for the blocks of flats which continue to dominate the town centre, as well as much of the Royal Forest and Elisabeth&#x27;s Park levelled for industrial use.

==History==
===Early Ages===
The city has been inhabited since the Neolithic period, as shown by archaeological discoveries. Around 5,000 BC, the Transdanubian culture, known for its line-ornate pottery, lived in the region.

===Ancient times===
The earliest evidence of occupation is from the Roman period. The Devil&#x27;s Dykes (Hungarian: Ördögárok) is situated south from Gödöllő. It is also known as the Csörsz árka (&quot;Csörsz Ditch&quot;) or the Limes Sarmatiae (Latin for &quot;Sarmatian border&quot;), are several lines of Roman fortifications built mostly during the reign of Constantine I (312–337).

===Middle Ages===
The earliest available written data on the property rights in Gödöllő date from the early 14th century, at which time the town was separated from the larger community of Besnyő. The settlement was then owned by families of the lesser nobility. By the middle of the 15th century, Gödöllő developed into a village.

===Turkish rule===

After the disastrous defeat at Mohács in 1526, the invading Turkish troops occupied Buda and then Gödöllő, too. As a result of this, the population decreased to merely a few families. No data on property rights during the 160-year-long Turkish rule remain.

By the mid-17th century, Gödöllő again became a village. Its proprietor, Ferenc Hamvay, was the first owner who resided in the locality, in his country house in the village centre. At that time, the village consisted of a few houses with walls of wattle and daub and thatched roofs in addition to the mansion and the reform church.

===Habsburg rule===
A decisive turn in the life of Gödöllő was brought about by Antal Grassalkovich I (1694–1771), one of the most notable noblemen of 18th-century Hungary. Grassalkovich, born of an impoverished family of the minor nobility, began his career as a lawyer in 1715. A year later he was already working with the &quot;Hofkammer&quot; (the &quot;Royal Chamber&quot;, a body of the Habsburg financial administration in the 16–18th centuries). In 1727, he became president of the Commission of &quot;New Acquisitions&quot; (Neoaquistica Commissio), dealing with the revision and arrangement of the chaotic ownership rights after the Turkish rule. It was in this capacity that he first came across the estate of Gödöllő, whose then proprietress, Krisztina Bossányi, could verify her ownership rights.

Increasing in political power and wealth, Grassalkovich planned the development of a large estate, having its centre in Gödöllő. This became possible after the death of Krisztina Bossányi in 1737, when Grassalkovich successively purchased the properties from her heirs. He began to build his palatial residence as early as 1741, which, as the greatest Baroque manor house in Hungary, is even today the principal landmark of Gödöllő.

Grassalkovich, who curried favour with King Charles III and Queen Maria Theresa, also managed very successfully the properties of the treasury. For his economic and political abilities, he received first the title of baron and later on became a count.

He took meticulous care in making his properties profitable and in keeping them in good order. On his estates, he built 33 churches, including the church in the holy place of Máriabesnyő, and the chapel of the mansion house in Gödöllő. In the centre of Gödöllő, he had rows of houses built and settled German artisans and craftsmen there, thereby increasing the number of Roman Catholics alongside the Reformed population. He added a storey to Hamvay House and made it operate as a retreat. In public places, Baroque works of art were also made on his initiative (such as the Calvary, the Column of the Holy Virgin, and the statue of St. John of Nepomuk). Owing to his village-planning activities, Gödöllő became a country town in 1763, with the right of holding markets.

The son of Grassalkovich I, Antal Grassalkovich II (1734–1794), who was raised to the rank of prince, cared little for the estate. He leased out the properties one after the other, liquidated the household in Gödöllő and moved to Vienna. Following his death, the estate, heavily charged with debts, was inherited by his son, Antal Grassalkovich III. He continued to increase the debts and died without offspring, hence the properties were inherited on the female line.

At that time, the mansion house came to be the scene of an important political event. In the course of the spring campaign of the 1848-1849 War of Independence, the Hungarian soldiers gained a victory in Isaszeg on 6 April 1849. After this, Lajos Kossuth and his generals set up quarters in the mansion house of Gödöllő. Here a war council was held where the idea to dethrone the Habsburgs and to fight for Hungarian independence emerged.

In 1850, a banker, György Sina, purchased the estate of Gödöllő. He, and later his son, rarely stayed in Gödöllő; they considered the transaction merely a capital investment and in 1864 sold the whole of the property to a Belgian bank. The Hungarian state bought it back from this bank in March 1867 and gave it, together with the mansion house, to Francis Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth of Austria (&quot;Sissi&quot;) as a coronation gift. From that time on, the royal family stayed in Gödöllő mainly in spring and autumn, and this resulted in a significant upswing in the life of the town.

The northern railway line, for instance, contrary to the original plan, passes close to Gödöllő because the royal summer resort was there. The gas factory, destined to produce the gas needed for the railway station and the royal mansion house, was accomplished by 1874. The number of artisans and small shopkeepers increased. Many of them were provided with work by the estate and the court. In 1869, the Gödöllő Savings Bank was established, its first shareholder being Francis Joseph I. The country town (that is, from 1864 on, a large village as an administrative division) grew into an increasingly popular summer resort, owing, in addition to the presence of the royal family, to its natural endowments and fresh air. Annually 300–400 families of Pest spent the summer season in Gödöllő, which was growing richer and richer with bathing places, restaurants, and village inns. The &quot;Hotel Queen Elisabeth&quot;, established in the Hamvay mansion, became the scene of a teeming social life. The casino was open there and various social clubs and circles often organised their evening parties linked with theatrical performances.

The agrarian character of the village began to take shape at the tum of the century. The legal successors of the agricultural training institutes and model farms established in the territories of the royal demesne are still operating today. Besides, the number of artisans further increased since, partly because the royal summer resort was here; no big industry had settled in Gödöllő: A result of the transport development was the lengthening of the suburban (&quot;HÉV&quot;) railway line, originally between Budapest and Kerepes, up to Gödöllő. This line still works well today.

Gödöllő at the turn of the century also wrote its name into the history book of Hungarian art. From 1901 to 1920, the only organised artists colony of the period of the Hungarian Sezession was working here.

This was the time when secondary school teaching started in the community. The Grammar School of the Minorites opened its gates in 1911. By 1924, the Grammar School of the Premonstratensian Order had also been built.

===During the World Wars===
In autumn 1918, in the &quot;manor house&quot; of the town, King Charles IV accepted the resignation of the Hungarian government.

Around this time the manor house was briefly occupied by Prime Minister Mihály Károlyi.

In 1919, military general staff of the Hungarian Soviet Republic had their headquarters in the manor house. 

Regent Miklós Horthy occupied the Royal Palace from 1920 until 1944.

===4th World Scout Jamboree===

Gödöllő in the area around the royal palace hosted the 4th World Scout Jamboree during 2–13 August 1933 at the Royal Forest of Gödöllő. A total of 25,792 scouts from 54 nations camped on the site. The Jamboree Camp Chief was the Chief Scout of Hungary, Count Teleki Pál, a member of the International Committee who had previously been and would later once again become Prime Minister of Hungary. The General Camp Manager was Vitez Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army, who was later appointed the Chief Scout of Hungary on Teleki Pál&#x27;s death in 1941. The scouts lived in ten sub-camps. The overall encampment was serviced by its own post office, ambulance station, hospital, a steam railway and station, an electric local tram line with four stations, radio service, water supply with 9 wells, and an air-service.

This event was notable as the first international gathering where Air Scouts were represented, including the famous pilots, Hungarian László Almásy and Austrian Robert Kronfeld. In 1939 the royal park also hosted a jamboree of Girl Scouts.

===Gödöllő and the Holocaust===
Gödöllő has records of a Jewish population since the first half of the 19th century, suppliers to the court of Francis Joseph I since 1867. A synagogue was built in 1870, and a Jewish school operated from 1857 to 1944. The Jewish population was 195 in 1880, and 276 in 1930, after reaching a peak of 451 in 1920. After World War I, the Jews were severely persecuted, particularly after László Endre&#x27;s 1923 appointment as district commissioner of the town.

According to Yad Vashem, there were 188 Jewish people resident in the town in 1941. The area governor, Dr Laszlo Endre, sent many of the Jewish men to Hungarian army for forced labour, where most perished on the Eastern Front in Ukraine. The town ghetto was established at the end of April 1944, before the publication of the decree ordering the establishment of ghettos in the district, which according to Yad Vashem was issued on May 12, 1944 by the deputy commissioner of the district, Dr Laszlo Andre. 

The Jewish population of Gödöllő was deported to Auschwitz via a sugar beet factory in Hatvan on 12 June 1944 as part of the so-called &quot;emergency&quot; deportations from Zala County and other parts of southern Hungary, rather than as part of the operations in Zones III and IV. Randolph L. Braham suggests this order came directly from Hungarian government circles, citing allegations that it was &quot;to enable Miklós Horthy to walk around the town without having to see any Jews and to make it possible for him to personally experience the consequences of the anti-Jewish measures.&quot; The town was at this time the &quot;summer residence&quot; of Horthy, regent of Hungary.

===Soviet Era===
After World War II, the development of the community took a new turn. Soviet troops were stationed in part of the mansion house, while in a larger part there was a social welfare home. In contrast to its earlier character as a summer resort, industry started in Gödöllő. The first step in this direction was the building of the Ganz Factory of Electric Measuring Instruments in 1950, which was followed by other industrial plants. In the same year, the University of Agricultural Sciences moved into the buildings of the closed-down institute of the Premonstratensian. This meant the completion of the community&#x27;s character as an agrarian centre and resulted in a further expansion of the network of agricultural institutions linked to the university.

The role of the ecclesiastical schools nationalised in 1948 was taken over by the general and secondary schools of the state. In 1951, the School of Apprentices started its activities and in 1955, the &quot;Török Ignác&quot; General State Grammar School began its work. The library of the community opened in 1955 and since then it has been extended with departments for children and for music.

On 1 January 1966, Gödöllő was promoted to the rank of a town. The present face of the town began to take shape at that time. The old rows of peasant houses disappeared one after the other, giving place to housing estates and public institutions.

In the cultural life of the town, a new era started in 1981 when the &quot;Sándor Petőfi&quot; Cultural Centre was inaugurated which, with its varied programmes, soon attained nationwide renown. During this decade, the town centre changed a lot. In the main square, a bank and a travel agency were built. Construction of a town hall was completed in 1986 (demolished 2018 to make way for a children&#x27;s playground and public seating). Opposite this the new building of the grammar school was inaugurated in 1988. It was in this year that Hamvay House, which had held the collection of local history since 1978, received the rank of a museum. At the same time, the collection of mechanical machinery of the Agricultural University was opened.

Political changes which came about at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s brought about significant changes in the life of Gödöllő, too. Some of the industrial projects settled here in the 1950s closed, while others which were viable were privatised. The number of industrial and service units in private ownership increased and quickly transformed the appearance of the town.

The influence of the changes also made itself felt in education. The church schools restarted their activities. In 1989, the Capuchins and the Salvator Sisters received back their monasteries; in 1990, the Premonstratensian returned to Gödöllő and, after having opened their school, built their church in 1993.

===After Communism===
In 1990, after the departure of the Soviet troops, the process of renovating the almost ruined Grassalkovich mansion house began, and although work continues, the majority of the Royal Palace is open to visitors as a museum and concert venue.

During the 2011 Hungarian EU Presidency, informal international ministerial meetings were held in the Royal Palace. The main venues were the Baroque Palace&#x27;s riding school and the reconstructed stables.

The town hosted The 10th ASEM Foreign Ministers&#x27; Meeting, an interregional forum of the 27 members of the European Union, the European Commission, the 10 members of the ASEAN Secretariat, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, India, Mongolia, Pakistan, Australia, Russia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Norway and Switzerland.

In 2016 (July 28 through August 6), Gödöllő hosted the Men&#x27;s 2016 European Lacrosse Championships. The championships consisted of 24 European nations. The matches for the tournaments were held on the ground of Szent István University.

===Royal Palace of Gödöllő===
The Royal Palace of Gödöllő is one of the most important, largest monuments of Hungarian palace architecture. it is a Baroque building on the area of 1,700 m2 with a park of 28 ha. It is famous for being a favourite place of Queen Elisabeth of Hungary.

===Main square===
Gödöllő&#x27;s main square, Szabadság Tér (Liberty Square), is reached with a short walk from the suburban train (HEV) stop of the same name. Its sights are: right from Dózsa György Road: the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, Reformed Church (9 Szabadság Square), town hall (7 Szabadság Square), the World Peace Gong (right side of the town hall), Hamvay Mansion (5 Szabadság Square), Gödöllő Town Museum (5 Szabadság Square), town market and the Pelican Well (5 Szabadság Square).

As a part of the New Hungary Development Plan, the town&#x27;s main square has been completely renovated, with work completed in 2011, in an attempt to restore the atmosphere of the town to that of the time prior to the Socialist Party&#x27;s building programme, which demolished much of the town centre to make way for blocks of flats. As part of the renovation, the square has been pedestrianised, 46 Secession era-style street lights added, and a singing fountain built in front of the Reformed Church.

===Reformed Church===

The baroque-style Reformed Church, built in 1745, is an onion dome church with a beautifully simple façade. The building process was patronized; the money and the plot for the church were donated by Antal Grassalkovich I who had demolished a Reformed Church built in 1657 at the site of the present Royal Castle. The new church was consecrated in 1745. It was renovated several times: in 1912, the complete painted and carved wooden ceiling and the chancel were changed into concrete. The prang in 1945 affected the church seriously and the renovation processes took very long. The renovation of the tower was finished in 1993.

===World Peace Gong===

The World Peace Gong on the Szabadság (Liberty) Square is the fifth in the world and the first and only European peace gong which was given by Indonesia as a present and a symbol of worldwide friendship and fraternity to the town of Gödöllő. The gong shows the flags of all the countries, the symbols of all the religions and the maps of the oceans of the Earth. It was created by the World Peace Committee as a memento for the bomb attack in Bali in 2002. The gong was offered to Gödöllő in 2007 as an acknowledgement of advances in civilization, technology and economy as well as the peaceful social circumstances in Gödöllő. The gong weighs 150 kg; it is a 2m diameter bronze circle relic, the work of Djuyoto Suntani, an Indonesian sculptor. The gong was inaugurated on 2 May 2007. The story of the gong is engraved in the small plaque in front and the park around it is populated with shrub species typically found in the Tropics. The gong remains in excellent condition, apart from the scratching out, prior to 2009, of the Israeli flag.

===Hamvay Mansion===
The mansion, a one-story characteristic baroque building in the town centre, recalls Gödöllő&#x27;s baroque era with its typical yellow color, wrought-iron lamps. Ferenc Hamvay, landed lord of Gödöllő, built this mansion (a ground level building at the time) in 1662.

In the 18th century, it was rebuilt and became a one-storey building when Antal Grassalkovich I made it a guest house. Then it fulfilled a number of functions, including Gödöllő&#x27;s first pharmacy in 1814. Some of the ceiling decorations in the interiors of the ground floor are probably left from that time. In the 19th century, it became the hotel bearing the name of Queen Elizabeth of Hungary. From this time on, the hotel was the venue for numerous cultural and artistic events like theatre performances, and it hosted a casino and a number of balls in its ballroom. The Commemorative Room arranged in 1927 in the school operating in the building until 1988 is home to a collection of souvenirs of Gödöllő&#x27;s history and cultural life. In 1978, another collection on local history was exhibited, the successor of which came to be the Town Museum Gödöllő. The Hamvay Mansion and the market in its garden were renovated in 1998–99; the works were awarded numerous national and international prizes.

===Town market===
The modern town market is a lively place. Open on weekday mornings through the early afternoon, it includes outdoor and indoor stands selling fresh produce, flowers, and local craft work, with some stall holders wearing traditional dress. The market has several cafes and a bar.

====Amerigo Tot&#x27;s &quot;The Apotheosis of the Nucleus&quot;====
Amerigo Tot is a sculptor of Hungarian origin. His copper relief created on an imposing 120 square metres entitled &quot;The Apotheosis of the Nucleus&quot; can be seen in the University Hall of the Faculty of Technical Studies.
&quot;I wanted to show the apotheosis of the nucleus in copper...The nucleus, he said, is a general thought. It is the grain for the plant and the beginning for biology as well.&#x27; Theoretically grain and soil and woman go together...&quot; said Tot about the theoretical background of the relief. His work was originally designed for the gate of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. The first design was ready in 1970 but, due to a series of historical events it was only inaugurated in 1983 in the presence of the artist, who was by then seriously ill.

====Museum of Agricultural Machinery====
The museum hosts the second largest collection of agricultural machinery in the world. On its 6,000 square meters, it is home to a collection of more than 2,000 agricultural machines that are still working. Six exhibitions introduce agricultural machinery and curiosities in the history of agricultural techniques. The visitor will be introduced to the 2.5 million year-old history of food acquisition and production, through models reconstructed with the help of original designs and machines. It is a true adventure of understanding mankind&#x27;s tough fight for the daily bread. The exhibitions show the development of the machines from very early times like wind, water and steam powered agricultural machines, to modern ones used today. Some 200 agricultural models show the development of food producing machinery together with documentation on the technical history of the respective time.

Hungaricums (traditional Hungarian food types) are on display here: more than 300 types of food introduce the traditional food of Hungarians arranged in a thematic order according to region. The complete history of Hungarian agricultural production is explained in an exhibition in which the visitor can see soil cultivating machines, plant cultivating machines and those for animal husbandry used by ploughmen in earlier times, as well as modern machines used today.

<text>William Strode (1598 – 9 September 1645) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1624 and 1645. He was one of the Five Members whose impeachment and attempted unconstitutional arrest by King Charles I in the House of Commons in 1642 sparked the Civil War, during which he fought on the Parliamentarian side.

==Origins==

Strode was the second son of Sir William Strode (d. 1637), MP, of Newnham, Plympton St Mary, Devon, by his first wife Mary Southcote, daughter of Thomas Southcote of Bovey Tracey in Devon.

==Education==
He was admitted as a student of the Inner Temple in 1614, matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1617, and took the degree of BA in 1619.

==Career==
In 1624, Strode was elected Member of Parliament for Bere Alston, and was re-elected MP for Bere Alston in 1625, 1626 and 1628. He opposed Charles I from the start, and took a leading part in the disorderly scene of 2 March 1629, when the speaker, Sir John Finch, was held down in the chair after refusing to put the resolution of Sir John Eliot against arbitrary taxation and innovations in religion (see Denzil Holles). Strode was prosecuted before the star chamber, but refused &quot;to answer anything done in the House of Parliament but in that House.&quot; On 7 May a fresh warrant was issued, and a month later, to prevent his release on bail, he was sent by Charles with two of his fellow members to the Tower. Refusing to give a bond for his good behaviour, he was sentenced to imprisonment during the king&#x27;s pleasure, and was kept in confinement in various prisons for eleven years. During those eleven years, King Charles ruled without parliament.

In January 1640, in accordance with the king&#x27;s new policy of moderation, Strode was released and on 13 April took his seat as MP for Bere Alston in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected for the Long Parliament, which met on 3 November 1640. He was the first to propose parliamentary control over ministerial appointments, the militia, and its own duration, He supported the Grand Remonstrance of 7 November 1641. He zealously pursued the prosecution of Strafford, and actually proposed that all who appeared as the prisoner&#x27;s counsel should be charged as conspirators in the same treason. As a result, he was included among the Five Members impeached by Charles of high treason on 3 January 1642.

Strode opposed all suggestions of compromise with Charles and urged on the preparations for war. He was present at the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. He was as relentless in the prosecution of Laud as he had been in that of Strafford. It was he who carried up the message from the Commons to the Lords on 28 November 1644 which desired them to hasten on the ordinance for the archbishop&#x27;s execution. Strode did not long survive his victim. He is mentioned as having been elected a member of the Westminster Assembly on 31 January 1645. He died on 9 September the same year, and by order of parliament was accorded a public funeral in Westminster Abbey. The body was exhumed after the Restoration and thrown into a pit in the churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, with about twenty other rebels.

==Identification==

The identity of the W. Strode imprisoned in 1628 and of the W. Strode impeached in 1642 has been questioned, but is now established. On the other hand, he is to be distinguished from Colonel William Strode of Barrington, also parliamentarian and Member of Parliament, who died in 1666; and from William Strode (1602–1645), the orator, poet and dramatist.

<text>Vanessa Bell (née Stephen; 30 May 1879 – 7 April 1961) was an English painter and interior designer, a member of the Bloomsbury Group and the sister of Virginia Woolf (née Stephen).

== Early life and education ==
Vanessa Stephen was the elder daughter of Sir Leslie Stephen and Julia Prinsep Duckworth. The family included her sister Virginia, brothers Thoby (1880–1906) and Adrian (1883–1948), half-sister Laura (1870–1945) whose mother was Harriett Thackeray and half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth; they lived at 22 Hyde Park Gate, Westminster, London. She was educated at home in languages, mathematics and history, and took drawing lessons from Ebenezer Cook before she attended Sir Arthur Cope&#x27;s art school in 1896. She then studied painting at the Royal Academy in 1901.

Later in life, she said that during her childhood she had been sexually abused by her half-brothers, George and Gerald Duckworth.

==Personal life==

After the deaths of her mother in 1895 and her father in 1904, Vanessa sold 22 Hyde Park Gate and moved to Gordon Square in Bloomsbury with her sister Virginia and brothers Thoby and Adrian. Thoby began inviting his Cambridge friends to &#x27;at-homes&#x27; on Thursday evenings. These social gatherings at Vanessa&#x27;s home on Gordon Square led to the formation of the Bloomsbury Group, which included: Lytton Strachey, Desmond MacCarthy, Maynard Keynes, Leonard Woolf, Roger Fry, and Duncan Grant.

In 1907, Vanessa married Clive Bell. They had two sons, Julian (who died in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War at the age of 29) and Quentin. The couple had an open marriage, both taking lovers throughout their lives. Vanessa Bell had intimate relationships with art critic Roger Fry and with the painter Duncan Grant, with whom she had a daughter, Angelica in 1918, whom Clive Bell raised as his own child.
Vanessa, Clive, Duncan Grant, and Duncan&#x27;s lover David Garnett moved to the Sussex countryside shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, and settled at Charleston Farmhouse near Firle, East Sussex. John Maynard Keynes was also a close friend and frequent member of the household, until his marriage to Lydia Lopokova, whom Bell disliked.

At Charleston, Bell and Grant painted and worked on commissions for the Omega Workshops, established by Roger Fry. Her first solo exhibition was at the Omega Workshops in 1916.

On 7 April 1961, Vanessa Bell died from a brief illness at Charleston, Firle and was buried in the Firle Parish Churchyard. When Duncan Grant died in 1978, he was buried next to her.

==Art==
In 1906, when Bell started to think of herself as an artist, she formed the Friday Club to create a place in London that was more favourable to painting. Vanessa was encouraged by the Post-Impressionist exhibitions organised by Roger Fry, and she copied their bright colours and bold forms in her artworks. In 1914, she turned to Abstraction.

Bell rejected the examples of Victorian narrative painting and rejected a discourse on the ideal and aberrant qualities of femininity. She also designed book jackets for all of her sister Virginia&#x27;s books that were published by Virginia and Leonard Woolf&#x27;s publishing company, the Hogarth Press.

Bell is one of the most celebrated painters of the Bloomsbury group. She exhibited in London and Paris during her lifetime, and has been praised for innovative works and for her contributions to design.
Bell&#x27;s paintings include &quot;Studland Beach&quot; (1912), &quot;The Tub&quot; (1918), &quot;Interior with Two Women&quot; (1932), and portraits of her sister Virginia Woolf (three in 1912), Aldous Huxley (1929–1930) and David Garnett (1916). Bell also worked with Duncan Grant to create murals for Berwick Church in Sussex (1940–42).

In 1932, Bell and Grant were commissioned to produce a dinner service for Kenneth Clark. With oversight from Kenneth&#x27;s wife Jane Clark, they produced the Famous Women Dinner Service: 50 plates painted with portraits of notable women throughout history. The collection eventually passed on to a private collector, and passed out of public view until 2017. The full collection was exhibited in London in early 2018.

===Exhibitions===
In the summer of 1909, &quot;Iceland Poppies&quot; (1908) was exhibited at the New English Art Club. It was praised by Walter Sickert and marks Bell&#x27;s artistic maturity.

&quot;Designs for a Screen: Figures by a Lake&quot; (1912), gouache on board, was influenced by Nabis paintings by Édouard Vuillard and Maurice Denis and might have been a part of Bell&#x27;s exhibit Design for Screen, which was shown at the Friday Club Exhibition in February 1912.

In 1916, Bell&#x27;s first solo exhibition was held in the Omega Workshop in London, a prominent place for exhibitions which supported young artists and introduced design work to the public. Bell had become a co-director of the Omega Workshop in 1913.

&quot;Design for Overmantel Mural&quot; (1913), oil on paper, depicts herself and Molly MacCarthy naked in Bell&#x27;s studio at 46 Gordon Square.

&quot;Street Corner Conversation&quot; (also created in 1913) features four individuals in conversation amidst massive geometrical forms.

&quot;Summer Camp&quot; (1913), oil on board, illustrates a summer camp organized at Brandon on the Norfolk-Suffolk border near Thetford.

&quot;By the Estuary&quot; (1915), oil on canvas, is a modestly scaled landscape showing her fondness for clarity of design in which segments of contrasting color harmonize.

&quot;Nude with Poppies&quot; (1916), oil on canvas, is a preliminary design for a headboard which Bell painted for Mary Hutchinson.

In 1920, she painted a mysterious, narrative painting, “The Party,” which she exhibited in May 1922 at the prestigious London Group Exhibition but was “not for sale.” The painting was prominently illustrated and praised in British &quot;Vogue&quot;, June 1922, but then disappeared for 61 years until sold by the Anthony d’Offay Gallery from the estate of Virginia Woolf with the title of “Mrs. Dalloway’s Party.” It is unknown who retitled it, and Woolf’s novel, &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot;, was not published until 1925. Bell created the cover art for the first edition dust jacket of that novel. 

In 2021, Bell was one of four featured women artists at an exhibition at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle. Bell&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

A 2024–2025 exhibition at the MK Gallery in Milton Keynes, &quot;Vanessa Bell: A World of Form and Colour&quot;, claimed to her largest-ever solo show. It included the &quot;Famous Women Dinner Service&quot;, a series of plates hand-painted by Bell and Duncan Grant depicting prominent women, and one man (Grant himself).

==Media portrayal==
Bell was portrayed by Janet McTeer in the Dora Carrington biopic &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995) and by Miranda Richardson in the film &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002).

Bell is the subject of the Susan Sellers novel &quot;Vanessa and Virginia&quot; (2010) and of the Priya Parmar novel &quot;Vanessa and Her Sister&quot; (2014). She was portrayed by Phoebe Fox and Eve Best in the BBC mini-series &quot;Life in Squares&quot; (2015).

Bell was portrayed by Emerald Fennell in the film &quot;Vita &amp; Virginia&quot; (2018).

<text>Arthur Clive Heward Bell (16 September 1881 – 17 September 1964) was an English art critic, associated with formalism and the Bloomsbury Group. He developed the art theory known as significant form.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Bell was born in East Shefford, Berkshire, in 1881, the third of four children of William Heward Bell (1849–1927) and Hannah Taylor Cory (1850–1942). He had an elder brother (Cory), an elder sister (Lorna, Mrs Acton), and a younger sister (Dorothy, Mrs Hony). His father was a civil engineer who built his fortune in the family coal mines at Merthyr Tydfil in Wales – &quot;a family which drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it on the destruction of wild animals.&quot; They lived at Cleeve House, Seend, near Devizes, Wiltshire, where Squire Bell&#x27;s many hunting trophies were displayed.

Bell was educated at Marlborough College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, studying history. In 1902 he gained an Earl of Derby scholarship to study in Paris, where his interest in art began.

===Marriage and other liaisons===
On returning to London early in 1907, he met and married Vanessa Stephen, the artist sister of Virginia Woolf. They had two sons, Julian (1908–1937) and Quentin (1910–1996), who both became writers. Julian joined the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War as an ambulance driver and was killed by an enemy shell, aged 29.

By World War I their marriage was over. Vanessa had begun a lifelong relationship with Duncan Grant, and Clive had a number of liaisons with other women including Mary Hutchinson, wife of St John Hutchinson. However, Clive and Vanessa never officially separated or divorced. Not only did they visit each other regularly, they also sometimes spent holidays together and paid &quot;family&quot; visits to Clive&#x27;s parents. Clive lived in London but often spent long periods at Charleston Farmhouse, Sussex, where Vanessa lived with Duncan and her three children by Clive and Duncan. He supported her wish to have a child by Duncan and allowed his wife&#x27;s only daughter, Angelica, to bear his surname.

Vanessa&#x27;s daughter by Duncan, Angelica Garnett (1918–2012, née Bell), was raised as Clive&#x27;s daughter until she married. She was informed by her mother, just prior to her marriage and shortly after her brother Julian&#x27;s death, that Duncan Grant was her biological father. This deception forms the central message of her memoir, &quot;Deceived with Kindness&quot; (1984).

According to historian Stanley Rosenbaum, &quot;Bell may, indeed, be the least liked member of Bloomsbury... Bell has been found wanting by biographers and critics of the Group – as a husband, a father, and especially a brother-in-law. It is undeniable that he was a wealthy snob, hedonist, and womaniser, a racist and an anti-Semite (but not a homophobe), who changed from a liberal socialist and pacifist into a reactionary appeaser. Bell&#x27;s reputation has led to his being underestimated in the history of Bloomsbury...&quot;

===Significant form===

Soon after Bell met Roger Fry, he developed his art theory significant form. The two shared a passion for contemporary French art. Bell&#x27;s book &quot;Art&quot; (1914) was the first publication of his theory, which he describes as &quot;lines and colours combined in a particular way, certain forms, and relations of forms, that stir our aesthetic emotions.&quot; This form can be seen in art created by many members of the Bloomsbury Group, an example being &quot;Interior at Gordon Square&quot; by Duncan Grant.

==Political views==
Bell was at one point an adherent of absolute pacifism, and during the First World War was a conscientious objector, allowed to perform Work of National Importance by assisting on the farm of Philip Morrell MP, at Garsington Manor. In his 1938 pamphlet &quot;War Mongers&quot;, he opposed any attempt by Britain to use military force, arguing &quot;the worst tyranny is better than the best war.&quot; Ideas that Bell eventually supported the war are unproven, as Mark Hussey points out in his 2021 biography of Bell (p. 350 n1).

<text>Roger Eliot Fry (14 December 1866 – 9 September 1934) was an English painter and critic, and a member of the Bloomsbury Group. Establishing his reputation as a scholar of the Old Masters, he became an advocate of more recent developments in French painting, to which he gave the name Post-Impressionism. He was the first figure to raise public awareness of modern art in Britain, and emphasised the formal properties of paintings over the &quot;associated ideas&quot; conjured in the viewer by their representational content. He was described by the art historian Kenneth Clark as &quot;incomparably the greatest influence on taste since Ruskin ... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry&quot;. The taste Fry influenced was primarily that of the Anglophone world, and his success lay largely in alerting an educated public to a compelling version of recent artistic developments of the Parisian avant-garde.

==Life==
Born in London in 1866, the son of the judge Edward Fry, he grew up in a wealthy Quaker family in Highgate. His siblings included Joan Mary Fry, Agnes Fry and Margery Fry; Margery was principal of Somerville College, Oxford. Fry was educated at Clifton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Conversazione Society, alongside freethinking men who would shape the foundation of his interest in the arts, including John McTaggart and Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson. After taking a first in the Natural Science tripos, he went to Paris and then Italy to study art. Eventually, he specialised in landscape painting.

In 1896, he married the artist Helen Coombe and they subsequently had two children, Pamela and Julian. Helen soon became seriously mentally ill and the couple moved to Guildford, Surrey in the hope the quieter environment would help her, but in 1910 she was committed to a mental institution, where she remained for the rest of her life. Fry took over the care of their children with the help of his sister, Joan Fry. That same year, Fry met the artists Vanessa Bell and her husband Clive Bell, and it was through them that he was introduced to the Bloomsbury Group. Vanessa&#x27;s sister, the author Virginia Woolf later wrote in her biography of Fry that &quot;He had more knowledge and experience than the rest of us put together&quot;.
Shortly after their relocation to Guildford, Fry had a house called &quot;Durbins&quot; built to his own individual design in Chantry View Road, then on the edge of the town, overlooking the Surrey Hills. Durbins was in a stripped-back classical style with large windows suggesting Dutch precedent and Fry regarded it as a &#x27;genuine and honest piece of domestic architecture&#x27;. The most unusual feature is a double-height living hall (or ‘house-place’ as Fry called it). It is now a Grade II* listed building. He employed Lottie Hope and Nellie Boxall (in 1912) as his young servants until 1916 when he decided to rent the house and establish a trust for it. Lottie and Nellie went to work for Leonard and Virginia Woolf on his recommendation.

In 1911, Fry began an affair with Vanessa Bell, who was recovering from a miscarriage. Fry offered her the tenderness and care she felt was lacking from her husband. They remained lifelong close friends, even though Fry&#x27;s heart was broken in 1913 when Vanessa fell in love with Duncan Grant and decided to live permanently with him.

After short affairs with artists Nina Hamnett and Josette Coatmellec, Fry too found happiness with Helen Maitland Anrep. She became his emotional anchor for the rest of his life, although they never married (she too had had an unhappy first marriage, to the mosaicist Boris Anrep).

Fry died after a fall at his home in London and his death caused great sorrow among the Bloomsbury Group, who loved him for his generosity and warmth. Vanessa Bell decorated his coffin. Fry&#x27;s ashes were placed in the vault of Kings College Chapel in Cambridge. Virginia Woolf was entrusted with writing his biography, a task she found difficult because his family asked her to omit certain key facts, his love affair with Vanessa Bell among them.

==Artistic style==

As a painter Fry was experimental (his work included a few abstracts), but his best pictures were straightforward naturalistic portraits, although he did not pretend to be a professional portrait painter. In his art he explored his own sensations and gradually his own personal visions and attitudes asserted themselves. His work was considered to give pleasure, &#x27;communicating the delight of unexpected beauty and which tempers the spectator&#x27;s sense to a keener consciousness of its presence&#x27;. Fry did not consider himself a great artist, &quot;only a serious artist with some sensibility and taste&quot;. He considered &quot;Cowdray Park&quot; his best painting: &quot;the best thing, in a way that I have done, the most complete at any rate&quot;.

==Career==

In the 1900s, Fry started to teach art history at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London.

In 1903 Fry was involved in the foundation of &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot;, the first scholarly periodical dedicated to art history in Britain. Fry was its co-editor between 1909 and 1919 (first with Lionel Cust, then with Cust and More Adey) but his influence on it continued until his death: Fry was on the consultative committee of &quot;The Burlington&quot; since its beginnings and when he left the editorship, following a dispute with Cust and Adey regarding the editorial policy on modern art, he was able to use his influence on the committee to choose the successor he considered appropriate, Robert Rattray Tatlock. Fry wrote for &quot;The Burlington&quot; from 1903 until his death: he published over two hundred pieces on eclectic subjects – from children&#x27;s drawings to bushman art. From the pages of &quot;The Burlington&quot;, it is also possible to follow Fry&#x27;s growing interest in Post-Impressionism.
Fry&#x27;s later reputation as a critic rested upon essays he wrote on Post-Impressionist painters, and his most important theoretical statement is considered to be &quot;An essay in Aesthetics&quot;, one of a selection of Fry&#x27;s writings on art extending over a period of twenty years published in 1920. In &quot;An essay in Aesthetics&quot;, Fry argues that the response felt from examining art comes from the form of an artwork; meaning that it is the use of line, mass, colour and overall design that invokes an emotional response. His greatest gift was the ability to perceive the elements that give an artist his significance.
Fry was also a born letter writer, able to communicate his observations on art or human beings to his friends and family.

In 1906 Fry was appointed Curator of Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. This was also the year in which he &quot;discovered&quot; the art of Paul Cézanne, the year the artist died, beginning the shift in his scholarly interests away from the Italian Old Masters and towards modern French art.

In November 1910, Fry organised the exhibition &#x27;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&#x27; (post-impressionism being a term which Fry coined) at the Grafton Galleries, London. This exhibition was the first to prominently feature Gauguin, Cézanne, Matisse, and Van Gogh in England and brought their art to the public. Though the exhibition would eventually be widely celebrated, the sentiments at the time were much less favourable. This was due to the exhibition&#x27;s selection of art that the public was unaccustomed to at the time. Fry was not immune to the backlash. Desmond MacCarthy, the secretary of the exhibition stated that &quot;by introducing the works of Cézanne, Matisse, Seurat, Van Gogh, Gauguin and Picasso to the British public, he smashed for a long time his reputation as an art critic. Kind people called him mad and reminded others that his wife was in an asylum. The majority declared him to be a subverter of morals and art, and a blatant self-advertiser.&quot; Yet the foreignness of &quot;post-impressionism&quot; would inevitably disappear and eventually, the exhibition would be regarded as a critical moment for art and culture. Virginia Woolf later said, &quot;On or about December 1910 human character changed&quot;, referring to the effect this exhibit had on the world. Fry followed it up with the Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition in 1912. It was patronised by Lady Ottoline Morrell, with whom Fry had a fleeting romantic attachment.

In 1913 he founded the Omega Workshops, a design workshop based in London&#x27;s Fitzroy Square, whose members included Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant and other artists of the Bloomsbury Group. It was an experimental design collective in which all the work was anonymous with everything that was produced in the workshops, bold decorative homeware ranging from rugs to ceramics and furniture to clothing, bearing only the Greek letter Ω (Omega). As Fry told a journalist in 1913: &#x27;It is time that the spirit of fun was introduced into furniture and into fabrics. We have suffered too long from the dull and the stupidly serious.&#x27; As well as high society figures such as Lady Ottoline Morrell and Maud Cunard, other clients included Virginia Woolf, George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, W.B. Yeats and E.M. Forster and also Gertrude Stein, with whom Fry shared a love of contemporary art, on one of her visits to London in the 1910s. The workshops also brought together the artists Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, Edward Wadsworth and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who would later, following a quarrel between Fry and Wyndham Lewis with the latter setting up The Rebel Art Centre in 1914 as a rival business, branch away to form the Vorticist movement. The workshops stayed open during World War I but closed in 1919. The Courtauld Gallery houses one of the most important collections of designs and decorative objects made by artists of the Omega Workshops and, in 2017, held an exhibition &#x27;Bloomsbury Art and Design&#x27; that presented a wide-ranging selection of objects from its holdings, many of which were bequeathed to The Courtauld Institute of Art by Roger Fry. An earlier exhibition in 2009, &#x27;Beyond Bloomsbury: Designs of the Omega Workshops 1913-19&#x27;, contained the largest collection of surviving working drawings of the Omega Workshops, bequeathed to The Courtauld Gallery by Fry&#x27;s daughter Pamela Diamand in 1958.

The London Artists&#x27; Association was set up in 1925 by Samuel Courtauld and John Maynard Keynes at the instigation of Roger Fry who was a friend of both men and advised them on their art collections. Fry&#x27;s association with Samuel Courtauld was celebrated by him in The Burlington Magazine after Courtauld endowed a chair in History of Art at London University which Fry welcomed as an &#x27;unexpected realisation of a long-cherished hope&#x27;. In 1933, he was appointed the Slade Professor at Cambridge, a position that Fry had much desired.

In September 1926 Fry wrote a definitive essay on Seurat in &quot;The Dial&quot;. Fry also spent ten years translating, &quot;for his own pleasure&quot;, the poems of the symbolist poet Stephane Mallarmé. Between 1929 and 1934, the BBC released a series of twelve broadcasts wherein Fry conveys his belief that art appreciation should begin with a sensibility to form as opposed to an inclination to praise art of high culture. Fry also argues that an African sculpture or a Chinese vase is just as deserving of study as a Greek sculpture.

His works can be seen in Tate Britain, the Ashmolean Museum, Leeds Art Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Manchester Art Gallery, Somerville College, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Courtauld Gallery who purchased the 1928 self-portrait (above) with the assistance of the Art Fund and others in 1994. The Collection of Roger Fry of paintings and decorative art objects bequeathed to the Courtauld also contains photographs which are held in the Conway Library who are in the process of digitising their collection of primarily architectural images as part of the wider Courtauld Connects project. Lithographs produced by Fry from 1927 to 1930 are held at Tate Britain and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The lithographs were drawn in France (except for one from Trinity College, Cambridge) and many were published in the portfolio, Ten Architectural Lithographs.

The Arts Council exhibition &#x27;Roger Fry Paintings and Drawings&#x27; at their St James Square gallery in 1952, consolidated Fry&#x27;s reputation as an artist.
A blue plaque was unveiled in Fitzroy Square on 20 May 2010.

<doc id="197296" wikidata="Q423185" url="?curid=197296" title="Cortisone">
<text>Cortisone is a pregnene (21-carbon) steroid hormone. It is a naturally-occurring corticosteroid metabolite that is also used as a pharmaceutical prodrug. Cortisol is converted by the action of the enzyme corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 into the inactive metabolite cortisone, particularly in the kidneys. This is done by oxidizing the alcohol group at carbon 11 (in the six-membered ring fused to the five-membered ring). Cortisone is converted back to the active steroid cortisol by stereospecific hydrogenation at carbon 11 by the enzyme 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, particularly in the liver.

The term &quot;cortisone&quot; is frequently misused to mean either any corticosteroid or hydrocortisone, which is in fact cortisol. Many who speak of receiving a &quot;cortisone shot&quot; or taking &quot;cortisone&quot; are more likely receiving hydrocortisone or one of many other, much more potent synthetic corticosteroids.

Cortisone can be administered as a prodrug, meaning it has to be converted by the body (specifically the liver, converting it into cortisol) after administration to be effective. It is used to treat a variety of ailments and can be administered intravenously, orally, intra-articularly (into a joint), or transcutaneously. Cortisone suppresses various elements of the immune system, thus reducing inflammation and attendant pain and swelling. Risks exist, in particular in the long-term use of cortisone. However, using cortisone only results in very mild activity, and very often more potent steroids are used instead.

==Effects and uses==
Cortisone itself is inactive. It must be converted to cortisol by the action of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. This primarily happens in the liver, the main site at which cortisone becomes cortisol after oral or systemic injection, and can thus have a pharmacological effect. After application to the skin or injection into a joint, local cells that express 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 instead convert it to active cortisol.

A cortisone injection may provide short-term pain relief and may reduce the swelling from inflammation of a joint, tendon, or bursa in, for example, the joints of the knee, elbow and shoulder and into a broken coccyx.

Cortisone is used by dermatologists to treat keloids, relieve the symptoms of eczema and atopic dermatitis, and stop the development of sarcoidosis.

==Side effects==
Oral use of cortisone has a number of potential systemic adverse effects, including asthma, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression, amenorrhoea, cataracts, glaucoma, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, increased risk of infections, and impaired growth. With topical application, it can lead to thinning of the skin, impaired wound healing, increased skin pigmentation, tendon rupture, and skin infections (including abscesses).

==History==
Cortisone was first identified by the American chemists Edward Calvin Kendall and Harold L. Mason while researching at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason/Myers/Kendall&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the discovery process, cortisone was known as compound E (while cortisol was known as compound F).

In 1949, Philip S. Hench and colleagues discovered that large doses of injected cortisone were effective in the treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. Kendall was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine along with Philip Showalter Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein for the discovery of the structure and function of adrenal cortex hormones including cortisone. Both Reichstein and the team of O. Wintersteiner and J. Pfiffner had separately isolated the compound prior to the discovery made by Mason and Kendall, but failed to recognize its biological significance. Mason&#x27;s contributions to the crystallization and characterization of the compound have generally been forgotten outside of the Mayo Clinic.

Cortisone was first produced commercially by Merck &amp; Co. in 1948 or 1949. On September 30, 1949, Percy Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone from bile acids. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, a rare, expensive, and dangerous chemical. In the UK in the early 1950s, John Cornforth and Kenneth Callow at the National Institute for Medical Research collaborated with Glaxo to produce cortisone from hecogenin from sisal plants.

==Production==
Cortisone is one of several end-products of a process called steroidogenesis. This process starts with the synthesis of cholesterol, which then proceeds through a series of modifications in the adrenal gland to become any one of many steroid hormones. One end-product of this pathway is cortisol. For cortisol to be released from the adrenal gland, a cascade of signaling occurs. Corticotropin-releasing hormone released from the hypothalamus stimulates corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary to release ACTH, which relays the signal to the adrenal cortex. Here, the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis, in response to ACTH, secrete glucocorticoids, in particular cortisol. In various peripheral tissues, notably the kidneys, cortisol is inactivated to cortisone by the enzyme corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2. This is crucial because cortisol is a potent mineralocorticoid and would cause havoc with electrolyte levels (raising blood sodium and lowering blood potassium levels) and raise blood pressure if it were not inactivated in the kidneys.

Because cortisone must be converted to cortisol before being active as a glucocorticoid, its activity is less than simply administering cortisol directly (80–90%).

==Popular culture==
Abuse and addiction to cortisone was the subject of the 1956 motion picture &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot;, produced by and starring James Mason. Though it was a box-office flop upon its initial release, many modern critics hail the film as a masterpiece and brilliant indictment of contemporary attitudes toward mental illness and addiction. In 1963, Jean-Luc Godard named it one of the ten greatest American sound films ever made.

John F. Kennedy was regularly administered corticosteroids such as cortisone as a treatment for Addison&#x27;s disease.

<text>The Chassepot (pronounced &quot;SHAS-poh&quot;), () officially known as Fusil modèle 1866, was a bolt-action military breechloading rifle. It is famous for having been the arm of the French forces in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. It replaced an assortment of Minié muzzleloading rifles, many of which were converted in 1864 to breech loading (the Tabatière rifles). An improvement to existing military rifles in 1866, the Chassepot marked the commencement of the era of modern bolt action, breech-loading military rifles. The Gras rifle was an adaption of the Chassepot designed to fire metallic cartridges introduced in 1874.

It was manufactured by &quot;Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Saint-Étienne&quot; (MAS), &quot;Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Châtellerault&quot; (MAC), &quot;Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Tulle&quot; (MAT) and, until 1870, in the &quot;Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Mutzig&quot; in the former Château des Rohan. Many were also manufactured under contract in England (the &quot;Potts et Hunts&quot; Chassepots delivered to the French Navy), in Belgium (Liege), and in Italy at Brescia (by &quot;Glisenti&quot;). The approximate number of Chassepot rifles available to the French Army in July 1870 was 1,037,555 units. Additionally, state manufacturies could deliver 30,000 new rifles monthly. Gun manufacturers in England and Austria also produced Chassepot rifles to support the French war effort. The &quot;Josef und Franz Werndl &amp; Co.&quot; in Steyr, Austria delivered 12,000 Chassepot carbines and 100,000 parts to France in 1871. Manufacturing of the Chassepot rifle ended in February 1875, four years after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, with approximately 700,000 more Chassepot rifles made between September 1871 and July 1874.

== History ==
The Chassepot was named after its inventor, Antoine Alphonse Chassepot (1833–1905), who, from the mid-1850s onwards, had constructed various experimental forms of breech loaders. The first two models of the Chassepot still used percussion cap ignition. The third model, using a similar system to the Prussian Dreyse needle gun, became the French service weapon on 30 August 1866. In the following year it made its first appearance at the Battle of Mentana on 3 November 1867, where it inflicted severe losses upon Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s troops. It was reported at the French Parliament that &quot;Les Chassepots ont fait merveille!&quot;, (&quot;The Chassepots have done wonderfully!&quot;) The heavy cylindrical lead bullets fired at high velocity by the Chassepot rifle inflicted wounds that were even worse than those of the Minié rifle. By 1868, the entire French active army had been re-armed with the Chassepot.

In the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the Chassepot met its Prussian counterpart, the Dreyse needle-fire rifle. The Chassepot had several advantages over the Dreyse. It featured a rubber obturator on its bolt head to provide a more efficient gas-seal. Although it fired a smaller caliber (11 mm vs. 15.4 for the Dreyse), the Chassepot ammunition had more gunpowder (5.68 grams vs 4.85 grams), resulting in higher muzzle velocity (436 meters per second, 33% over the Dreyse), a flatter trajectory and a longer range. Thus the sights on the Chassepot could be elevated up to 1,600 meters, while the maximum sight setting of the Dreyse was only 600 meters. The Chassepot had a weight of 4.1 kg versus 4.57 kg for the needle-fire rifle. It was also shorter (1310 mm vs. 1424 mm).

After the war, 20,000 captured Chassepot rifles were sold to the Shah of the Persian Qajar dynasty. 

In 1872 the Empire of Brazil purchased 8631 Chassepots; after being faced with a possible war involving Argentine claims over Paraguay. The weapons, however, were never officially distributed to the Army, since the decision to buy the Comblain had already been made and because of issue with the cartridge&#x27;s reliability. The weapons ended their career in deposit or were handed over to police forces and shooting clubs. Some of these weapons were possibly used by rebels during the War of Canudos, they may have been captured from the Bahia police after the engagement at Maceté. Chassepots were used during the Federalist Revolution and by the rebels of the 1923 revolution in Rio Grande do Sul.

In June 1880, some 40 1866 Chassepots with a few bayonets were delivered to the port of Buenos Aires. Those Chassepots were of 11mm calibre and were possibly rechambered for the Gras cartridge (They were delivered together with Gras rifles in a shipment of 450 weapons). 

Surplus Chassepot were exported to China. Some of the warriors of the Ethiopian Empire were equipped with Chassepot rifles during the first Italo-Ethiopian War of 1896.

==Technology==

===Bolt mechanism===

The breech was closed by a bolt similar to those of more modern rifles. Amongst the technical features of interest introduced in 1866 on the Chassepot rifle was the method of obturation of the bolt by a segmented rubber ring which expanded under gas pressure and thus sealed the breech when the shot was fired. This simple yet effective technology was successfully adapted to artillery in 1877 by Colonel de Bange, who invented grease-impregnated asbestos pads to seal the breech of his new cannons (the De Bange system).

===Cartridge===
The Chassepot used a paper cartridge that many refer to as &#x27;combustible&#x27;, although in reality it was quite the opposite. It held an round-headed cylindro-conoidal lead bullet that was wax paper patched. An inverted standard percussion cap was at the rear of the paper cartridge and hidden inside. It was fired by the Chassepot&#x27;s needle (a sharply pointed firing pin) upon pressing the trigger. While the Chassepot&#x27;s ballistic performance and firing rates were excellent for the time, burnt paper residues as well as black powder fouling accumulated in the chamber and bolt mechanism after continuous firing. The bolt&#x27;s rubber obturator eroded in action but was easily replaced in the field by infantrymen. The older Dreyse needle gun and its cartridge had been designed to minimize those problems but to the detriment of its ballistic properties.

To correct this problem the &quot;Chassepot&quot; was replaced in 1874 by the Gras rifle which used a centerfire drawn brass metallic cartridge. Otherwise, the Gras rifle was basically identical in outward appearance to the Chassepot rifle. Nearly all rifles of the older Chassepot model (Mle 1866) remaining in store were eventually converted to take the 11 mm Gras metallic cartridge ammunition (&quot;fusil Modèle&quot; 1866/74). About 665,327 Chassepot rifles had been captured by the German coalition that defeated France in 1871. Large numbers of these captured Chassepot rifles were shortened and converted to 11 mm Mauser metallic cartridge. It served with cavalry units of the Kingdom of Saxony and of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Others were disposed of &quot;as is&quot; with British surplus dealers. In most but not all, the French receiver markings on these German-captured Chassepot rifles had been erased.

<text>Augsburg (; Swabian German: &quot;Augschburg&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the city of Augsburg and the districts of Aichach-Friedberg, Landsberg, Ostallgäu, Unterallgäu, Günzburg, Dillingen and Donau-Ries. The city of Augsburg is not part of the district, but nonetheless is its administrative seat.

== History ==
In Roman times the Via Claudia connected the city of Augsburg and Italy. In 233 the Alamanni broke through the limes, and the Roman rule over Swabia was ended. During the time of the Holy Roman Empire Augsburg was a bishopric principality. The city and the adjoining regions became subordinate to Bavaria after the Napoleonic Wars.

The district of Augsburg was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Augsburg and Schwabmünchen and parts of other adjoining districts.

More than twice as old as Nuremberg or Munich, Augsburg was founded in 15 B.C. by the Roman commanders Drusus and Tiberius. Under the orders of their stepfather Emperor Augustus, they enslaved the Celts and Alp-dwellers and founded the military camp Augusta Vindelicorum on the site of current-day Augsburg. The camp soon became the capital of the Roman province Raetia.

Augsburg&#x27;s early development was molded by its 400-year affiliation with the Roman Empire. Critical to its ascent were its military importance in the Roman Empire, as well as its favorable location at the confluence of the Alpine rivers, the Lech and the Wertach, with direct access to the most important Alpine passes. Consequently, Augsburg was situated at the intersection of many important European east-west and north-south connections. Out of these Roman roads emerged the trade routes of the Middle Ages.

In the 13th century, Augsburg became a Free Imperial City and remained so for the next 500 years. Augsburg has been a bishopric for over 1250 years.

The peak years of growth were reached in the 15th and 16th centuries through the bank and metal businesses of the merchant families Fugger and Welser. The financial power of these families fostered Augsburg&#x27;s position as a cosmopolitan city, as a city of emperors and parliaments. It was a creative center for famous painters, sculptors and musicians. Augsburg is the birthplace of the Holbein family of artists and print-makers, notably Hans Holbein the Elder and Holbein, as well as composer Leopold Mozart (father of Amadeus Wolfgang), and the playwright Berthold Brecht. Rococo became so prevalent in the city that it became known as “Augsburg style”.

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the decorative arts came to the fore. Gold- and silversmiths as well as copper engraving and lithography flourished. The crafters guilds were very strong and their work was known internationally. At the end of the 18th century, the textile industry began its rise to prominence, followed by machine manufacturing (MAN, Diesel, Messerschmitt). Groundbreaking innovations in industry lent Augsburg international standing.

Rudolf Diesel constructed the first internal combustion engine here, Linde built the first refrigerator, and Messerschmitt created the first mass-produced jet airplane. Today, with its rich heritage, Augsburg and the region are centers for industry, science, art and culture. Augsburg has circa 275,000 inhabitants, is a university city and is the third largest economic- and industrial center in Bavaria. The city of Augsburg and its surrounding rural areas offer attractive business and industry zones and are the headquarters of research institutions and technology concerns.

Augsburg is the only German city with its own legal holiday, the Peace of Augsburg, celebrated on August 8 of every year, to commemorate the religious parity declared in Augsburg in 1555. This gives Augsburg more legal holidays than any other region or city in Germany.

== Geography ==
The district comprises a large area west of the city of Augsburg. 90% are located in the Augsburg-Westliche Wälder Nature Park, which is a hilly region covered with forests. It is sparsely populated and crisscrossed by brooks, flowing either eastwards to the Lech or northwards to the Danube. The Lech forms the eastern border of the district.

The six cities (see below) are all situated in the easternmost part of the district, mainly in the vicinity of Augsburg. The western forest region consists of small villages.

<text>Woolwich Arsenal station is an interchange station in the heart of Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich for Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and National Rail services.

It has two parts; its raised, south-western part of the station is on the semi-slow, commuter service, corollary of the North Kent Line and also in its Dartford Loop services section between London and Dartford, run by Southeastern. Regular services beyond Dartford are to the Medway Towns, which start/finish in the opposite direction at Luton via the City of London, West Hampstead and St Albans. Its other part is the terminus of its own branch of the DLR, run by Transport for London.

The older part of the station, built in a modernist style, is located on a corner of General Gordon Square, a green town square. The newer part has entrances to Woolwich&#x27;s subterranean end of the DLR, and faces the top of Powis Street, a long, semi-pedestrianised retail avenue. It is named after the area&#x27;s Woolwich or Royal Arsenal, to distinguish the Arsenal site from the former Royal Dockyard, which before the 19th century was complemented with wharves and yards for large naval ships. In zoning it is the furthest DLR station – in Travelcard Zone 4.

On the national network, it is down from .

==History==

The station opened in 1849, serving the North Kent Line from London to Gillingham. The station building was rebuilt in 1906 in a London brick form typical of southeast London. It was again rebuilt in 1992–93 to a modern design in steel and glass by the Architecture and Design Group of British Rail, under the leadership of Nick Derbyshire. It has a, clean, naturally-lit ellipsoid theme, contrasting with the earlier forms.

In 1973 a government report on the redevelopment of London&#x27;s Docklands projected a greater form of the never-built &quot;Fleet line&quot; from Charing Cross via Fenchurch Street to Woolwich Arsenal and on towards Thamesmead, with a preceding stop at Silvertown. The Fleet line plans were shelved in favour of a route that became the western part of the Jubilee line, despite council (local government) approval, due to financial constraints. By the start of the 1990s plans emerged in both levels of government and business forums for the Jubilee Line Extension to serve the south bank of the Thames twice on its way to Stratford. In the Royal Borough of Greenwich the line takes in a small area, North Greenwich (a peninsula).

Woolwich Arsenal was expanded in 2009, when Transport for London completed the construction of an extension of what was then termed the London City Airport branch of the Docklands Light Railway from King George V to Woolwich Arsenal. The official opening took place on 12 January that year.

In 2014, a petition was started and presented to the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to rezone Woolwich Arsenal station from Zone 4 to Zone 3. However he ruled this out, stating it would cause losses of over a million pounds a year.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 November 1948, a train – an electric multiple unit – crashed into the rear of another train, killing two people. It had departed from against signals.

==Design==

The National Rail part of the station consists of two above-ground platforms. The up platform for London has a refreshment facility. The down platform serves trains going east, towards north Kent, via Plumstead, Abbey Wood and Slade Green.

The Docklands Light Railway part of the station is underground, and consists of two platforms in an island platform configuration. As Woolwich Arsenal is a terminus, both platforms serve an up line to Bank or Stratford International via London City Airport and Canning Town. Trains depart in an easterly direction because of the alignment beneath the River Thames.
==Connections==
A large number of London Buses routes serve the station.

==Crossrail station at the former Royal Arsenal base==
In May 2022 an Elizabeth line station opened in north-east Woolwich, after a campaign to complement housing developments built on former public-sector land. Among the successful lobbyists for this extra station were those who developed the land, including Berkeley Homes. The station is about north of Woolwich Arsenal station, on the north side of the A206 road.

<text>Blackheath railway station is Grade II-listed and is in the south-centre of Blackheath, a village in southeast London. In traditional terms the area immediately south-west of the station around Lee Terrace and Lee Park is part of Lee; a status challenged by the station&#x27;s naming, buildings such as the Blackheath Halls and the development of Blackheath Park to the south east. It is measured from .

The tracks run through the village and are crossed by a road overbridge on which the station buildings stand.

==Station==
Much of the original station, dating back at track level to 1849 and at ticket office level to 1879, still remains today. It was built using London bricks to a design by George Smith (who also built Greenwich station). At the &quot;country&quot; end of the platforms the lines branch off to the North Kent and Bexleyheath lines. The former passes through the one mile long (1.6 km) &quot;Blackheath Tunnel&quot; immediately after the junction; the latter through the shorter &quot;Kidbrooke Tunnel&quot; after a short cutting.

Blackheath&#x27;s station has two platforms which are partially covered with a weather canopy. Glass and metal waiting shelters were erected on the London ends of both platforms in April 2018. The upside platform has a disused platform face (bay platform) facing towards London, which was used in the past by commuter trains terminating here. Unusually, the track in the bay platform still remains &quot;in situ&quot;, although it is now heavily overgrown and otherwise obstructed. The area to the north, now a car park, was originally an area of railway sidings, where the commuter trains were stabled when out of service.

The bay platform used to come into its own when a circus was taking place on Blackheath. Many of the animals would arrive in railway box vans. The circus would then proceed through Blackheath Village on to the heath.

The station cannot be relied upon as a way of reaching Blackheath during the traditional free fireworks display in November, as it is normally closed early on that day for safety reasons. Conversely, in April, on the Sunday of the London Marathon, it is crucial in enabling athletes and their supporters to reach the starting line, as on that day bus services across the heath are usually suspended as the roads are closed.

Blackheath Halls, run by Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, and The Conservatoire are approximately 100m south of the station.

==Collision in Blackheath Tunnel==
On 16 December 1864, six wagons from a ballast train travelling from Charlton became detached from the rear of the train and were run into by an express passenger train from Maidstone, wrecking the train. Five platelayers in the wagons were killed in the collision and many passengers were injured. A sixth platelayer and the passenger train&#x27;s fireman died from their injuries later.

== Services ==

All services at Blackheath are operated by Southeastern using , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to 
* 1 tph to London Charing Cross
* 4 tph to London Cannon Street
* 2 tph to via , continuing to London Cannon Street via and 
* 3 tph to via Bexleyheath of which 2 continue to 
* 2 tph to Dartford via Woolwich Arsenal 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours.


==Facilities==

There is an adjacent car park to the north of the station (with 205 spaces) and another nearby off Blackheath Grove. Both are managed by the local authority. Charges apply 365 days a year at all times.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 54, 89, 108, 202 and night route N89 serve the station.

<text>Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish are British comedy performers known together as Adam and Joe. They are best known for presenting &quot;Adam and Joe&quot; on BBC Radio 6 Music (2007–2009, 2011) and &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; on Channel 4 (1996–2001).

==History==
Adam and Joe began working on comedy material during their time at Westminster School together, where they created numerous amateur films along with their friend Louis Theroux. Some of these films were submitted to Channel 4&#x27;s home video showcase &quot;Takeover TV&quot; in 1994 and led to Adam hosting that show in 1995.

Together, they hosted &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot; on Channel 4 from 1996 to 2001. They won the Royal Television Society Best Newcomers Award in 1998, published &quot;The Adam and Joe Book&quot; in 1999, and presented BBC Three&#x27;s coverage of the Glastonbury Festival in 2000 and 2002. Other spin-off projects included &quot;Adam &amp; Joe&#x27;s Fourmative Years&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Adam and Joe&#x27;s American Animation Adventure&quot; in 2001. In 2002, Adam and Joe (who is an amateur magician) went on to present &quot;50 Greatest Magic Tricks&quot; for Channel 4

They directed pop promos for Frank Black and Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci, as well as appearing in two Surf washing powder commercials, in which they comically set upon Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Keith Harris and Orville.

In 2003, Buxton and Cornish presented &quot;Adam and Joe Go Tokyo&quot;, a Tokyo-based magazine show covering Japanese pop culture for BBC Three and BBC One. The same year, they began hosting a show on British radio station Xfm, filling in for Ricky Gervais on Saturday afternoons. When Gervais left the station they took over permanently, and continued to present the Saturday morning show, until Summer 2006. The best parts of these shows were condensed into a series of twenty podcasts, including their 2001 E4 series &quot;Shock Video&quot;, in which the duo provide an often totally irrelevant comic commentary on soft-core porn clips from around the world.

From August 2006 until October 2007, they hosted the monthly &quot;Coca-Cola New Music Podcast&quot;, which showcased unsigned bands from around Europe, presented in a similar style to their Xfm shows.
Adam and Joe began presenting the BBC Radio 6 Music Saturday morning show in October 2007. Features on the show included &quot;Song Wars&quot;, where they both composed original compositions based on a common theme. Listeners then voted for which song they think is the best. &quot;Text the Nation&quot; was another regular feature where listeners provided anecdotes based on a theme or question set by Adam and Joe. Themes have included &quot;Childhood Misconceptions&quot; and &quot;Horror Film Ideas&quot;. The &quot;Text the Nation&quot; feature was also instrumental in the uncovering and subsequent popularisation of the Stephen! call and response.

Their show won a Broadcasting Press Guild Award in 2008 for best radio programme of the year.

The duo sometimes write a column for &quot;The Idler&quot;, a yearly literary magazine.

<text>Never Say Die! is the eighth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released on 29 September 1978. It was the last studio album with the band&#x27;s original line-up and the last studio album to feature original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne until the 2013 album &quot;13&quot;. It was certified Gold in the U.S. on 7 November 1997 and as of November 2011 has sold 133,000 copies in the United States since the SoundScan era. The album received mixed reviews, with critics calling it &quot;unbalanced&quot; and insisting its energy was scattered in too many directions.

==Recording==

At the time of the recording of &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; the members of Black Sabbath were all heavily involved in drug and alcohol abuse. Prior to recording, vocalist Osbourne briefly quit the band and was temporarily replaced by Dave Walker, formerly of Savoy Brown and Fleetwood Mac. In 1992, guitarist Tony Iommi explained to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;We never wanted him [Osbourne] to leave, and I think he wanted to come back – but no one would tell the other how they felt. So we had to bring in another singer and write all new material.&quot; The band wrote a handful of songs with Walker, with that short-lived line-up even performing an early version of what would become &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot; on the BBC programme &quot;Look Hear&quot;.

Osbourne eventually rejoined, refusing to sing any of the songs written with Walker. Iommi elaborated in the 1992 &quot;Guitar World&quot; piece, 

Osbourne also refused to sing on &quot;Breakout&quot;, which remained an instrumental. The songs with Walker were redone; &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot; was rewritten to be about the then-recent death of Osbourne&#x27;s father.

&quot;We had a few internal problems,&quot; Osbourne admitted to &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine. &quot;My father was dying, so that put us out for over three months with the funeral and everything. I left the band for three months before we got back together to record it.&quot; However, the writing was on the wall, with Osbourne stating in his memoir &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;: &quot;No one really talked about what had happened. I just turned up in the studio one day – I think Bill had been trying to act as peacemaker on the phone – and that was the end of it. But it was obvious things had changed, especially between me and Tony. I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s heart was in it anymore.&quot;

The album was recorded at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto. &quot;We went to Toronto to record it, and that&#x27;s when the problems started,&quot; Iommi recalled. &quot;Why Toronto? Because of the tax, really. The studio was booked through brochures because people thought it might be a good one. We got there and it had a dead sound – totally wrong. We couldn&#x27;t get a real live sound. So what we had to do was rip the carpet up and try to make it as live as we could. They were okay about it, but it took time to get it exactly right. There were no other studios available.&quot;

In 2001 Iommi elaborated to Dan Epstein of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;I booked a studio in Toronto, and we had to find some place to rehearse. So we had this cinema that we&#x27;d go into at 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning, and it was freezing cold; it was in the heart of winter there, really awful. We&#x27;d be there, trying to write songs during the day and go and record them at night.&quot; In the same article bassist Geezer Butler added, &quot;&quot;Never Say Die&quot; was a patch-up kind of an album ... People didn&#x27;t realize that it was sort of tongue-in-cheek, the &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; thing. Because we knew that was it; we just knew it was never going to happen again. We did this 10th anniversary tour with Van Halen in 1978, and everybody&#x27;s going &#x27;Here&#x27;s to another 10 years!&#x27; And I&#x27;m going, (rolls eyes) &#x27;Yeah, sure!&#x27;&quot;

Butler was growing impatient with Osbourne&#x27;s criticism of his lyrics, telling &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1994: &quot;I used to hate doing it towards the end of the Ozzy era. He&#x27;d say, &#x27;I&#x27;m not singing that.&#x27; So you&#x27;d have to rethink the whole thing.&quot; In the 2004 book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot;, Iommi is quoted as saying, &quot;We were all into silly games ... and we were getting really drugged out ... We&#x27;d go down to the sessions and have to pack up because we were too stoned. Nobody could get anything right. We were all over the place. Everybody was playing a different thing.&quot;

&quot;With &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;, we were down on our luck,&quot; Osbourne reflected to &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. &quot;We were just a fucking bunch of guys drowning in the fucking ocean. We weren&#x27;t getting along with each other and we were all fucked-up with drugs and alcohol. And I got fired. It was just a bad thing. You try to lift your head up above water, but eventually the tide sucks you under.&quot;

In the liner notes for 1998&#x27;s live &quot;Reunion&quot;, Ward defended the album: &quot;In the circumstances, I thought we did the best we could. We were taking care of business ourselves, we didn&#x27;t have millions from the record company and, despite the booze and Ozzy&#x27;s departure, we tried to experiment with jazz and stuff the way we had in the early days. Songs like &#x27;Johnny Blade&#x27; and &#x27;Air Dance&#x27; I still like.&quot; Osbourne vehemently disagrees in his autobiography, at least as far as the jazz experiments went, calling the instrumental &quot;Breakout&quot; &quot;a jazz band going &quot;da-dah-da-dah, DAH&quot;, and I just went, Fuck this, I&#x27;m off ... The bottom line was that &#x27;Breakout&#x27; was stretching it too far for me. With tracks like that on the album, we might as well have been called Slack Haddock, not Black Sabbath. The only impressive thing about a jazz band as far as I was concerned was how much they could drink.&quot;

While Butler received credit for the lyrics of &quot;Swinging the Chain,&quot; they were actually composed by Ward.

The sleeve was the band&#x27;s second to be designed by Storm Thorgerson&#x27;s Hipgnosis group, following &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; (1976). The US and UK releases differed slightly in artwork, specifically the faint images of British military pilots seen in the sky. The inner bag featured graphics in keeping with the sleeve and credits, but no lyrics. The aeroplane on the cover appears to be a North American T-6 Texan. The band had rejected an alternate Hipgnosis design featuring masked doctors – an image eventually used for Rainbow&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot;.

==Release and critical reception==

In the UK the title track, released well ahead of the album as the band&#x27;s first UK picture sleeve single, reached No. 21 in the chart and gave the band its first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearances since 1970. In the UK the album reached No. 12, one place higher than its predecessor &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;. In the US it peaked at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Album chart. In the UK, &quot;Hard Road&quot; was released as the second single from the album and reached the UK Top 40, 25,000 copies being pressed in a limited-edition purple-vinyl. There was no picture-sleeve release but a video for &quot;A Hard Road&quot; was made during the &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; Tour to promote the single. The song marks the first and last time guitarist Tony Iommi sings backing vocals. Iommi explains in his autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven &amp; Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, that when he sang, bassist Geezer Butler couldn&#x27;t keep a straight face.

The album received mostly negative reviews; according to Terry Staunton of &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;even diehard fans among the music press [were] unsure of muddling excursions towards electronica (&#x27;Johnny Blade&#x27;) and passages that veered worryingly close to jazz (&#x27;Air Dance&#x27;, the curious horns in the instrumental &#x27;Breakout&#x27;). More than one critic described the overall sound as &#x27;murky&#x27;.&quot; It is not held in high esteem today, with AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia referring to the album as &quot;unfocused&quot;, saying it &quot;will hold little interest to the average heavy metal fan&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; says it was &quot;not a blaze of glory for the original foursome&quot; but added that it may be &quot;better than people might remember&quot;. In his own &quot;Uncut&quot; piece, Staunton bemoaned the experiments, but believed that the &quot;few occasions where the stars align and ducks form an orderly row&quot; are &quot;worth celebrating&quot;, singling out the title track for its power and &quot;Junior&#x27;s Eyes&quot; for having a vitality and tension missing elsewhere. Rob Michaels of the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995) writes that &quot;the rhythm section has a spry spring in its leaden step and the songs are tough and catchy.&quot; In 2013 Phil Alexander of &quot;Mojo&quot; referred to the album as &quot;disastrous&quot;.

Speaking in October 1978 of the new album, Osbourne said, &quot;It&#x27;s a combination of what we&#x27;ve all been through in the last 10 years. It&#x27;s a very varied album. Like, we started out playing in blues clubs, because British blues – like John Mayall and early Fleetwood Mac – was the thing at the time. We were into a twelve-bar trip and early Ten Years After-style stuff. So it&#x27;s part of that sort of trip. Then there&#x27;s the heavy thing and the rock thing. It&#x27;s not just steamhammer headbanging stuff all the way through ... We got rid of all our inner frustrations: what each of us individually wanted to put down over the years but couldn&#x27;t because of the pressures of work. So we put a lot of painstaking hours into developing this album.&quot; However, Osbourne quickly soured on the LP, telling &quot;After Hours&quot; in a 1981 interview &quot;The last album I did with Sabbath was &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; and it was the worst piece of work that I&#x27;ve ever had anything to do with. I&#x27;m ashamed of that album. I think it&#x27;s disgusting&quot;. He went on to claim that the band flew to Toronto in January during sub-zero temperature &quot;purely because the Rolling Stones had recorded a live album there.&quot; In 2013, Osbourne told &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d go down to the studio and I heard what sounded like a jazz band playing. Is this really Black Sabbath? I&#x27;d just fuck off.&quot; Osbourne was fired by the band eight months later.

Wil Malone, who oversaw the jazz-inflected horns arrangements on the album, is a British music producer and arranger, who, besides working with Black Sabbath, went on to work with Iron Maiden, Todd Rundgren, The Verve, Massive Attack, and Depeche Mode. 

Jon Elstar, who was recruited to play harmonica on &quot;Swinging the Chain,&quot; had also played on releases by R &amp; B proto-punk band The Pretty Things, as well as appearing on reggae releases on Trojan Records label.

Despite the negative reception, Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil cited &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; as one of his favourite Black Sabbath albums. Megadeth covered the title track for the 2000 tribute album &quot;Nativity In Black II&quot;, with singer Dave Mustaine telling Nick Bowcott in 2008, &quot;The simplicity of Iommi&#x27;s style makes this rhythm progression one of my all-time favorites: fast, classic English riff-stylings with a climactic arrangement.&quot; Andy LaRocque, guitarist for King Diamond, was influenced by the album in the making of the melodic guitar part of &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;, from the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; album.
In March 2017, Jon Hadusek of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; 10th out of 19 Black Sabbath studio albums. He called it &quot;straight-up pop rock, primed for heavy rotation&quot;, but felt it had merits, complimenting Osbourne&#x27;s confident vocals and Iommi&#x27;s guitar for &quot;[not being] buried like it was on &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;, and the rigid melodies force his playing to be concise and punchy.&quot; Among other similar lists, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it 15th, praising the choice of a punky opening track but panning the inclusion of a Ward-song sung and noting a lack of creative enthusiasm throughout. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked it 12th, praising the energetic title track, &quot;Johnny Blade&quot; and &quot;A Hard Road&quot;, but believing they and the abundance of weaker songs &quot;paled next to the colossal metal anthems recorded just a few years earlier&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; ranked it 10th, believing both it and &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; to be the band&#x27;s most underrated albums. Also ranking it 10th, &quot;The Guardian&quot; comments that the album &quot;has a terrible reputation, but it&#x27;s a quirky and enjoyable record, as long as you don&#x27;t expect Sabbath Even Bloodier Sabbath. The title track has garage-band rawness; Air Dance is – dare one say it – oddly beautiful. It’s hit and miss, but it’s still better than almost everything from 1981 onwards.&quot;

Geezer Butler told Metal Edge that &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; is easily the worst album that the band made. He explained, &quot;The reason for that is we tried to manage ourselves and produce the record ourselves. We wanted to do it on our own, but in truth, not one of us had a single clue about what to do. By that point, we were spending more time with lawyers and in court rather than being in the studio writing. It was just too much pressure on us, and the writing suffered.&quot;

==Never Say Die! Tour with Van Halen==
Black Sabbath&#x27;s Never Say Die! Tour opened on 16 May 1978 in Sheffield with Van Halen as their opening act, who&#x27;d just scored a hit in the United States with a cover of The Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me.&quot; Ward&#x27;s drum tech Graham Wright and Osbourne&#x27;s personal assistant David Tangye, who write extensively about the tour in their 2004 book &quot;How Black Was Our Sabbath&quot;, reveal that relations between the bands got off to a shaky start at the 22 May show at the Apollo Theatre in Manchester. After Sabbath finished their soundcheck, Van Halen &quot;hit the stage and started to play Sabbath tunes. It was their way of paying tribute to the Sabs, but Tony Iommi was annoyed by it. He may have misinterpreted the gesture as a piss-take, which it certainly was not. Van Halen were in awe of Sabbath, and their lead guitarist, Eddie Van Halen, was a big fan of Tony. The unwitting faux pas was soon forgotten. The two bands came to get along very well together, and Alex Van Halen would often sit ... behind Bill&#x27;s drum kit, watching and listening to him play onstage.&quot; On the U.S. leg of the tour, Van Halen&#x27;s presence had a major influence on ticket sales since they were a much bigger draw at home than they were in the UK. Wright and Graham also recount two riots that occurred on the &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; tour, the first happening in Neunkirchen am Brand, Germany, in front of a hall crammed with &quot;thousands of extremely stoned, drunk and rowdy GIs&quot; when, three songs into a show, Iommi stalked off the stage because of a buzzing from his guitar stack. When the audience realised the band had quit the gig they wrecked the hall. Another riot ensued at the Municipal Auditorium in Nashville when Osbourne didn&#x27;t show up and the band had to cancel; it later came to light that Osbourne had &quot;slept right round the clock, woken up, seen that it was six o&#x27;clock, and thinking that it was still the evening before, had got ready for the show. Even more incredibly, he&#x27;d been sleeping in the wrong room.&quot; A video from this period, professionally recorded on the UK tour at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, can be seen on the Sanctuary Visual Entertainment DVD, also entitled &quot;Never Say Die&quot;.

Several US dates featured the Ramones as an opener, either in addition to, or in lieu of Van Halen. The NYC punk rock band was eager to expand their fanbase, and considered themselves to have more in common with the hard rock bands of 1978 than with a band like the Sex Pistols. In part due to one promoter billing the event as “punk vs. metal”, Sabbath&#x27;s audience responded to the opener with open hostility.

==&quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance==
With the success of the &quot;Never Say Die&quot; single, Black Sabbath was invited to perform on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The band twice appeared live in the studio, miming to a pre-recorded version of the song. One of these appearances was included on the official &quot;The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1&quot; video release. In his autobiography, Osbourne remembers the appearance fondly &quot;&#x27;cos we got to meet Bob Marley. I&#x27;ll always remember the moment he came out of his dressing room – it was next to ours – and you literally couldn&#x27;t see his head through the cloud of dope smoke. He was smoking the biggest, fattest joint I&#x27;d ever seen – and believe me, I&#x27;d seen a few. I kept thinking, He&#x27;s gonna have to lip-synch, &quot;no one&quot; can do a live show when they&#x27;re that high. But no – he did it live. Flawlessly, too.&quot; In his autobiography, Iommi reveals that because drummer Bill Ward had his hair in braids at the time, &quot;everybody thought he was taking the mickey out of Bob (Marley). It wasn&#x27;t like that at all; it was just the way he happened to have his hair in those days.&quot;

<doc id="197320" wikidata="Q679742" url="?curid=197320" title="Headless Cross (album)">
<text>Headless Cross is the fourteenth studio album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath. Released in April 1989, it was the group&#x27;s second album to feature singer Tony Martin, the first to feature drummer Cozy Powell, and the only album with session bassist Laurence Cottle.

In 2024, a remaster of the album was announced as part of the box set &quot;Anno Domini 1989–1995&quot;, marking the first time the album has been officially reissued. The CD edition of the album contains the picture disc bonus track &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;, both in the box set and the stand alone remastered CD released November 15th, 2024.

==Recording and production==
According to Tony Iommi&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, the band were dropped from Warner Bros. Records in 1988 after an eighteen-year deal and after Vertigo Records had also dropped them. He met Miles Copeland, who owned I.R.S. Records at the time. Copeland told him: &quot;You know how to write albums, you know what people want. You do it and I&#x27;m fine with it.&quot; This persuaded Iommi to sign to I.R.S.

Iommi asked British drummer Cozy Powell – who had played with Jeff Beck, Rainbow, MSG and Whitesnake, among others – if he wanted to join Sabbath. Iommi and Powell began writing songs at the former&#x27;s home, with Tony Martin joining for rehearsals. Iommi got a call from Gloria Butler, wife and manager of Geezer Butler, who said the bassist wanted to rejoin Sabbath. However, Butler instead joined Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; tour lineup. Iommi and Nicholls had originally thought to bring Ronnie James Dio back or again ask David Coverdale to join the band, but Powell convinced him to keep Martin on. Powell and Iommi produced the album themselves.

Due to Jo Burt&#x27;s exit early in the sessions, Laurence Cottle played bass as a session musician rather than an official member. He appeared in the video for the title track, but was not featured in promotional photos. For the tour, the lineup was completed by Whitesnake and Gary Moore bassist Neil Murray.

Conceptually, the lyrics have predominantly occult and Satanic elements; arguably the only time in the band&#x27;s career where an entire album is based on such ideas rather than select songs.

&quot;When Death Calls&quot; has a guitar solo by Queen guitarist Brian May.

Two songs had their titles changed due to Ozzy Osbourne releasing songs with the same titles on his album &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;. &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; was originally titled &quot;Hero&quot;, and &quot;Devil &amp; Daughter&quot; was originally titled &quot;Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

&quot;Call of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Devil &amp; Daughter&quot; are also the only songs that do not end with a slow fade out with vocal ad libs by Tony Martin; while &quot;Nightwing&quot; does have a fade out, it does not feature any vocal ad libs. According to Martin, the vocals on &quot;Nightwing&quot; were the original guide vocals, because Iommi thought they sounded better than later recordings.

&quot;&#x27;Black Moon&#x27; was written with Tony Iommi, Geoff Nicholls, Eric Singer and Dave Spitz,&quot; noted Martin. &quot;They were left with one track that had no voice on it, and Tony asked me if I could sing something on it. I wrote and sang the lyrics in one day! We never played it &quot;[live]&quot; because there are too many Sabbath favourites.&quot;

According to the sleeve notes, the cover image was designed by Kevin Wimlett. The sleeve was designed by The Leisure Process at their offices in Little Portland Street London. The UK sleeve was in black-and-white, while the German release added colour.

==Touring==
The Headless Cross tour started in the summer of 1989 with a brief run of 10 shows in North America with Kingdom Come and Silent Rage opening. Further planned dates ended up being cancelled. In September the band played 10 more dates in the UK and continued to mainland Europe ending in Germany in early October. Ian Gillan joined the band for encores at two shows including Copenhagen. The same month they played six shows in Japan and finished the tour in the USSR in November - December. December dates in Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany were tentatively scheduled but did not materialize due to political unrest in the then-Communist states.

For the live show in support of this album, &quot;Ave Satani&quot;, the main theme from Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s Oscar-winning soundtrack for &quot;The Omen&quot;, was used as the intro tape, beginning as the house lights went down. This would then segue into a taped recording of &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot; before the band would begin the show with &quot;Headless Cross&quot;. The intro-tape of &quot;Ave Satani/The Gates of Hell&quot; was used many times, during various tours over the years, up until the &quot;Reunion&quot; shows. &quot;Headless Cross&quot; would be played on all subsequent tours when Tony Martin was in the band but the only other track from the &quot;Headless Cross&quot; album to last beyond that tour was &quot;When Death Calls&quot;.

Black Sabbath were one of the first bands to tour Russia, in 1989, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts. Black Sabbath played a total of 25 shows, 13 at Moscow&#x27;s Olympic Hall and 12 at EKS Hall in Leningrad. The two (afternoon/evening) 25 November shows were professionally filmed and eventually released on DVD in some territories in 2008. Two songs from the Moscow shows were also released as b-sides to the &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot; single in 1990. 

Tony Martin currently tours with a live band named after the album, going by the name of &quot;Tony Martin&#x27;s Headless Cross&quot;. They included another former Black Sabbath member, Geoff Nicholls, until his death in 2017.

==Singles==
*&quot;Headless Cross&quot; yielded two radio singles, an edit of the title track and &quot;Devil &amp; Daughter&quot;. The former was available as a 7&quot;, personally signed by Iommi, and a 12&quot; poster-sleeve, this latter being limited to 2,500 copies.
*&quot;Devil &amp; Daughter&quot; was released as a 7&quot; picture disc, a 12 picture-sleeve, and a 7&quot; box-set, containing the single, some postcards and a stencil of the band&#x27;s logo.
* &quot;Black Moon&quot; was originally a B-side on &quot;The Shining&quot; single, re-recorded for &quot;Headless Cross&quot; and released to radio to promote the US tour.

The bonus track &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; was the B-side to the &quot;Headless Cross&quot; single, and was later on the vinyl picture disc edition. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, the only CD versions of the &quot;Headless Cross&quot; edit and of &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; were on separate promotional CDs.

==Reception==

&quot;Headless Cross&quot; was praised by critics and fans as the best Sabbath album in years. Said AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia: &quot;Arguably the finest Black Sabbath album since Ozzy or Dio, &quot;Headless Cross&quot; also featured one of Black Sabbath&#x27;s most formidable lineups... In short, for those wise enough to appreciate Black Sabbath&#x27;s discography beyond the Osbourne and Dio essentials, there can be no better place to start than &quot;Headless Cross&quot; or its worthy predecessor, &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot;&quot;.

The album spent eight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 115. Sales in the US were low, leading to the curtailment of the tour. Iommi told Sabbath fanzine &quot;Southern Cross&quot;: &quot;When we had the first record out with I.R.S., Cozy and myself went into record stores in Toronto, Canada, where we are pretty big. Nobody could get the record, it wasn&#x27;t in the shops... unbelievable. We had such a fight with the local rep. I really came close to chinning him – it really was that bad. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s us that suffer. They say, &#x27;Oh, it didn&#x27;t sell.&#x27; How can it sell if you haven&#x27;t got the record in the shops?&quot;

In 2005, the album was ranked number 403 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

In 2021, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked &quot;Headless Cross&quot; as the seventh-best Black Sabbath album in a best-to-worst ranking of the band&#x27;s discography.

<doc id="197321" wikidata="Q2091455" url="?curid=197321" title="Stock swap">
<text>In corporate finance, a stock swap is the exchange of one equity-based asset for another, where, during the merger or acquisition, the swap provides an opportunity to pay with stock rather than with cash; see .

==Overview==
The acquiring company essentially uses its own stock as cash to purchase the business. Each shareholder of the acquired company will receive a predetermined number of shares from the acquiring company. 

Before the swap occurs each party must accurately value their company so that a fair &quot;swap ratio&quot; can be calculated. The valuation of a company is complicated in general; here though, additional to fair market value, the investment- and intrinsic value are to be determined as well.

After the valuation is complete, the parties will agree upon the swap ratio; this will determine the number of shares that each shareholder will receive. 
In theory, a fair ratio is such that shareholders in both previous companies now own a pro-rated share of the new company: value-wise or re earnings per share. 
The acquiring company may also need to add an extra incentive in the form of shares to ensure that the board of directors of the acquired company approve the takeover. 
In South Korea, the merger ratio is defined by a certain formula according to the law, if both companies are listed on the KRX.

When this swap is realised, the shareholders receive the new stock and own a share in the new company. Sometimes, a part of the agreement will not allow the new shareholders to sell for a certain time period to avoid a sudden drop in share price. This is a form of a shareholder rights plan or poison pill strategy that is used to combat hostile takeovers. When all things come together and are fair, then the takeover will proceed without incident.

==Internal swap==
Stock swaps can also happen internally within a company. Starbucks has used this strategy in the past. When the stock options they offered to their employees dropped so low in price that they became virtually worthless, Starbucks offered a swap option. The company allowed the employees to swap their worthless shares for more that had a higher value.

<doc id="197323" wikidata="Q166171" url="?curid=197323" title="European green woodpecker">
<text>The European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), also known as the yaffle and sometimes called a nickle, is a large green woodpecker with a bright red crown and a black moustache. Males have a red centre to the moustache stripe which is absent in females. It is resident across much of Europe and the western Palearctic but in Spain and Portugal it is replaced by the similar Iberian green woodpecker (&quot;Picus sharpei&quot;).

The European green woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the ground and does not often &#x27;drum&#x27; on trees like other woodpecker species. Though its vivid green and red plumage is particularly striking, it is a shy bird, and is more often heard than seen, drawing attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19–20 days.

==Taxonomy==
The European green woodpecker was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Picus viridis&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. The scientific name is derived from the Latin &quot;picus&quot;, meaning &quot;woodpecker&quot;, and &quot;viridis&quot; meaning &quot;green&quot;. It is member of the order Piciformes and the woodpecker family Picidae.

There are three subspecies, with subtle and mostly clinal differences between them.

* &quot;P. v. viridis&quot; Linnaeus, 1758, which breeds in Europe south to France (except south Roussillon where it is replaced by the Iberian green woodpecker), the Alps, Croatia, Slovenia and Romania
* &quot;P. v. karelini&quot; von Brandt, JF, 1841, which breeds in Italy, south-east Europe south from North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, Asia Minor, northern Iran and south-west Turkmenistan. It has duller green upperparts, cheeks and underparts than &quot;viridis&quot;
* &quot;P. v. innominatus&quot; (Zarudny &amp; Loudon, 1905), which breeds in south-west and southern Iran, is like &quot;karelini&quot; but with nearly white cheeks, throat and chest and more defined barring on the tail.

The Iberian green woodpecker (&quot;Picus sharpei&quot;) and Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker (&quot;Picus vaillantii&quot;) were formerly considered as subspecies of the European green woodpecker. They are now treated as separate species based on the results of two molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2011.

==Description==
The European green woodpecker measures in length with a wingspan. Both sexes are green above and pale yellowish green below, with yellow rump and red crown and nape; the moustachial stripe has a red centre in the male but is solid black in the female. The lores and around the white eye are black in both male and female, except in the Iberian race &quot;P. v.&quot; subsp. &quot;sharpei&quot;, in which it is dark grey and males have only a lower black border to the moustache. Juveniles are spotty and streaked all over; the moustache is dark initially, though juvenile males can show some red feathers by early June or usually by July or August.

Moult takes place between June and November with the first flight feathers being lost around the time the young fledge. Juveniles moult quickly after fledging and gain their adult plumage between August and November.

Although the European green woodpecker is shy and wary, it is usually its loud calls, known as yaffling, which first draw attention. It &#x27;drums&#x27; rarely (a soft, fast roll), but often gives a noisy &quot;kyü-kyü-kyück&quot; while flying. The song is a loud series of 10–18 &#x27;klü&#x27; sounds which gets slightly faster towards the end and falls slightly in pitch. The female makes a thinner &quot;pü-pü-pü-pü-pü-pü-pü&quot;. The flight is undulating, with 3–4 wingbeats followed by a short glide when the wings are held by the body.

It can be distinguished from the similar, but smaller, grey-headed woodpecker by its yellowish, not grey, underparts, and the black lores and facial &#x27;mask&#x27;. In Europe, its green upperparts and yellow rump can lead to confusion with the grey-headed woodpecker or possibly the female golden oriole, though the latter is smaller and more slender with narrower wings and longer tail. The closely related, very similar Levaillant&#x27;s woodpecker occurs only in north-west Africa.

==Distribution and habitat==
More than 75% of the range of the European green woodpecker is in Europe, where it is absent from some northern and eastern parts and from Ireland, Greenland and the Macaronesian Islands, but otherwise distributed widely. Over half of the European population is thought to be in France and Germany, with substantial numbers also in United Kingdom, Sweden, Russia, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria. It also occurs in western Asia.

The European green woodpecker has a large range and an Estimated Global Extent of Occurrence of between 1 million to 10 million square kilometres, and a population in the region of 920,000 to 2.9 million birds. Populations appear to be stable, so the species is considered of Least Concern. The species is highly sedentary and individuals rarely move more than around 500 m between breeding seasons.

A combination of old deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, plantations, orchards and lawns.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

The nesting hole is larger but similar to those of the other woodpeckers. It may be a few feet above the ground or at the top of a tall tree; oaks, beeches, willows and fruit trees are the preferred nest trees in western and central Europe, and aspens in the north. The hole may be excavated in sound or rotten wood, with an entrance hole of . The cavity inside may be 150 mm wide and up to deep and the work is performed mostly by the male over 15–30 days. Some tree holes are used for breeding for more than 10 years, but not necessarily by the same pair.

There is a single brood of four to six white eggs, measuring and weighing each, of which 7% is shell. After the last egg is laid, they are incubated for 19–20 days by both parents taking shifts of between 1.5 and 2.5 hours. The chicks are naked and altricial at hatching and fledge after 21–24 days.

===Food and feeding===
The main food of the European green woodpecker is ants of the genera &quot;Lasius&quot; and &quot;Formica&quot; for which it spends much of its time foraging on the ground, though other insects and small reptiles are also taken occasionally. The bird&#x27;s distinctive, elongated, cylindrical droppings often consist entirely of ant remains. At ant nests, it probes into the ground and licks up adult ants and their larvae. They have tongues that wrap to the back of their head. Green woodpeckers will often forage in short grazed or mown permanent grasslands where the availability of ant nests is high.

A study of a nest in Romania found that 10 species of ant were fed to the chicks. During the first 10 days, the young received an average of each, from days 10–20, , and from day 20, . The seven chicks consumed an estimated 1.5 million ants and pupae before leaving the nest.

The beak is relatively weak and used for pecking in soft wood only. In common with other woodpecker species, the green woodpecker&#x27;s tongue is long (10 cm) and has to be curled around its skull. It lacks the barbs of the &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; woodpeckers and black woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus martius&quot;), but is made sticky by secretions from the enlarged salivary glands. Heavy, prolonged snow cover makes feeding difficult for the green woodpecker and can result in high mortality, from which it may take ten years for the population to recover. Ant nests can be located under the snow; one bird was observed to dig 85 cm to reach a nest.

==In culture==
&#x27;Professor Yaffle&#x27;, the wooden bookend character in the 1974 children&#x27;s animation series &quot;Bagpuss&quot;, was based loosely upon the green woodpecker. &#x27;Yaffle&#x27; was among many English folk names for the European green woodpecker relating to its laughing call; others include laughing Betsey, yaffingale, yappingale and Jack Eikle. Other names, including rain-bird, weather cock and wet bird, suggest its supposed ability to bring on rain. The species has been the subject of postage stamps from several countries. The European green woodpecker is associated with Woodpecker Cider, an image of the bird is used on the merchandise. The woodpecker was the totem of the Italic tribe of the Picentes, and features of the coat of arms and flag of the Italian region of the Marches.

<doc id="197327" wikidata="Q4858758" url="?curid=197327" title="Barbara Bodine">
<text>Barbara K. Bodine (born August 28, 1948, in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American international relations scholar and former diplomat. She currently serves as the Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy and Director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University. Bodine previously directed the Scholars in the Nation&#x27;s Service Initiative (SINSI) and lectured at Princeton&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. 

==Education==
Bodine earned her B.A. in political science and Asian studies &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1970. She became a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, Gamma Rho chapter, fraternity for women. She received her master&#x27;s degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. She also studied at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Department of State&#x27;s Language Training Field Schools in Taiwan and Tunisia. She is a member of Phi Beta Kappa and serves on the board of directors of the UCSB Alumni Association and on the advisory council to the Program on Southwest Asian and Islamic Civilization Studies at the Fletcher School. She was the recipient of the UC Santa Barbara Distinguished Alumni Award in 1991.

==Diplomatic career==
After initial tours in Hong Kong and Bangkok, Bodine spent her career working primarily on Southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. She has twice served in the Bureau of Near East Affairs&#x27; Office of Arabian Peninsula Affairs, first as Country Officer for the Yemenis, then as Political-Military officer for the peninsula. She later served as Deputy Office Director. She had assignments as Deputy Principal Officer in Baghdad, and as Deputy Chief of Mission in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion and occupation in 1990. She was awarded the Secretary of State&#x27;s Award for Valor for her work in occupied Kuwait during the Gulf War.

Following Kuwait, Bodine was the Associate Coordinator for Operations and later served as the Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism. She went on to serve as the Dean of Professional Studies at the Department&#x27;s Foreign Service Institute. She has worked on the secretariat staff of Secretaries Kissinger and Vance, and as a Congressional Fellow in the office of former U.S. Senator Bob Dole. Most recently, Bodine spent a year as the Director of East African Affairs. Bodine is also an Advisory Board Member of Spirit of America, a 501(c)(3) organization that supports the safety and success of Americans serving abroad and the local people and partners they seek to help.

==Ambassador to Yemen and USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing controversies==
On November 7, 1997, Bodine was appointed to be Ambassador to the Republic of Yemen. Bodine&#x27;s appointment in Sana&#x27;a coincided with events of major importance in Yemen: In 1999, Bodine negotiated the release of three Americans kidnapped in Yemen. On October 12, 2000, the US Navy destroyer &quot;USS Cole&quot; was bombed in a terrorist attack in the Gulf of Aden. In January 2001, en route to the Yemeni city of Taiz to meet with the country&#x27;s president, a flight carrying Bodine and 90 other passengers from Yemen was hijacked by an Iraqi mid-flight. The plane was diverted to the small African nation of Djibouti, where it landed with the hijacker being overpowered by the crew. Bodine left Yemen as ambassador on August 30, 2001.

Bodine&#x27;s career was marked by controversy surrounding her relationship with the FBI during its investigation of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing: The PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;The Man Who Knew&quot; included interviews with officials such as Richard A. Clarke (the Clinton administration&#x27;s counterterrorism chief) and Barry Mawn (a former head of the New York FBI office) who stated that John P. O&#x27;Neill (an FBI agent and al-Qaeda expert) came into a personal conflict with Bodine over different perspectives on Yemen. When O&#x27;Neill briefly traveled back to New York for Thanksgiving, Bodine denied his re-entry visa, blocking O&#x27;Neill from returning to Yemen to continue the investigation on the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. &quot;Frontline&quot; cited sources as saying that &quot;O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s removal from the scene in Yemen may have seriously limited the &quot;Cole&quot; investigation.&quot;

The chilly relationship between Bodine and O&#x27;Neill is detailed in Lawrence Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;. While O&#x27;Neill viewed Yemen as a serious threat, unstable from the First Yemeni Civil War, with a large number of weapons, large cells of Ayman al-Zawahiri&#x27;s al-Jihad, and many Mujahideen veterans from the war in Afghanistan, Bodine, in contrast, viewed Yemen as an infant democracy, a &quot;promising American ally in an unsettled but strategically important part of the world.&quot; O&#x27;Neill also took a hard line toward the Yemeni security forces and viewed his mission as a criminal investigation, while Bodine viewed O&#x27;Neill as reckless and harmful to diplomacy. Bodine was furious when O&#x27;Neill arrived with 150 investigators and other staff; she had thought she had an understanding with O&#x27;Neill that his staff would total no more than 50. Murray Weiss wrote in &quot;The Man Who Warned America&quot;, a biography of O&#x27;Neill, that Bodine &quot;took an immediate and strong dislike to O&#x27;Neill, and seemingly worked to hamper some of his initiatives.&quot;

Bodine&#x27;s failures and adversarial treatment toward American investigators were further detailed in &quot;The Black Banners&quot; by Ali Soufan, the lead investigator of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. Bodine also handled evidence directly from Yemeni officials, which was &quot;contrary to protocol&quot;, as this made her part of the chain of custody and she &quot;could be called as a witness in the trial and could be questioned about her handling of the evidence and whether she had tampered with it.&quot; Typically, &quot;ambassadors would have said that the evidence should be given directly to the FBI or the regional security officer (RSO), the Department of State law enforcement officer of the embassy.&quot;

==Iraq==
After serving in Yemen, Bodine became Diplomat in Residence at the University of California, Santa Barbara, until shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Bodine was appointed coordinator for central Iraq in charge of Baghdad by the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which became the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) on April 21, 2003. She was removed from that position soon thereafter on May 11, 2003, when Paul Bremer was brought in to replace retired General Jay Garner as CPA Administrator.

==In the media==
On September 8, 2006, Bodine complained in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about her portrayal in the controversial ABC docudrama &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;. In an op-ed, Bodine wrote: &quot;According to the mythmakers, a battle ensued between a cop obsessed with tracking down Osama bin Laden and a bureaucrat more concerned with the feelings of the host government than the fate of Americans and the realities of terrorism. I know this is false. I was there. I was the ambassador.&quot; The ABC miniseries compressed Bodine&#x27;s role to a single extended scene suggesting she was dismissive, hostile, and vulgar toward John P. O&#x27;Neill from the moment of his arrival in Yemen. Broadcast worldwide on the fifth anniversary of 9/11 (9/10 and 9/11/2006), &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot; was based on the official 9/11 Commission Report and other sources. ABC/Disney aired the film in the United States without commercial interruption, adding a disclaimer stating that it was &quot;not a documentary&quot;, that various scenes were invented, and that narrative &quot;time compression&quot; was used. In the miniseries, Bodine was played by actress Patricia Heaton. O&#x27;Neill could not provide a balancing response to Bodine&#x27;s comments because he was killed in the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

More than nine years after the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing and following the apprehension of Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab, an alleged suicide bomber who is reported to have been trained and equipped in Yemen, Michelle Shephard, writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, published excerpts of an interview she conducted with Bodine. Bodine criticized the withdrawal of support the USA was providing to enhance the governance and infrastructure in Yemen, warning against US unilateral military intervention there:

Bodine was interviewed in Charles H. Ferguson&#x27;s 2007 documentary &quot;No End in Sight&quot;, and, as a guest on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, on September 3, 2007.

Bodine was portrayed by Jennifer Ehle in the Hulu miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;.

<doc id="197328" wikidata="Q2483037" url="?curid=197328" title="Bosko">
<text>Bosko is an animated cartoon character created by animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. Bosko was the first recurring character in Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s cartoon series and was the star of thirty-nine &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts released by Warner Bros. He was voiced by Carman Maxwell, Bernard B. Brown, Johnny Murray, and Philip Hurlic during the 1920s and 1930s and once by Don Messick during the 1990s.

== Creation and the first film ==
In 1927, Harman and Ising worked for the Walt Disney Studios on a series of live-action/animated short subjects known as the Alice Comedies. The two animators created Bosko in 1928 to capitalize on the recent success of talkies in the motion picture industry. They began thinking about making a sound cartoon with Bosko in 1928 even prior to their departure from Walt Disney. Hugh Harman made drawings of the new character and registered it with the U.S. Copyright Office on January 3, 1928. The character was registered as a &quot;Negro boy&quot; under the name of Bosko.

After leaving Walt Disney in early 1928, Harman and Ising went to work for Charles Mintz on Universal&#x27;s second-season Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons. In April 1929 they left Universal to market their new cartoon character. In May 1929, they produced a short pilot cartoon, similar to Max Fleischer&#x27;s Out of the Inkwell cartoons, titled &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot; that showcased their ability to animate soundtrack-synchronized speech and dancing. The short, plotless cartoon opens with live action footage of Ising at a drafting table. After he draws Bosko on the page, the character springs to life, talks, sings, dances, and plays the piano. Ising returns Bosko to the inkwell, and the short ends. &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot; was a landmark in animation history for being the first cartoon to predominantly feature synchronized speech, though Fleischer Studios&#x27; Song Car-Tune &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; was the first cartoon to contain animated dialogue a few years earlier. This cartoon set Harman and Ising &quot;apart from early Disney sound cartoons because it emphasized not music but dialogue.&quot; The short was marketed to various people by Harman and Ising until Leon Schlesinger offered them a contract to produce a series of cartoons for Warner Bros. It would not be seen by a wide audience until seventy years later, in 2000, as part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s special &quot;Toonheads: The Lost Cartoons&quot;, a compilation special of rare material from the WB/Turner archives.

In his book, &quot;Of Mice and Magic&quot;, Leonard Maltin states that this early version of Bosko
== Bosko and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; ==
Schlesinger saw the Harman-Ising test film and signed the animators to produce cartoons at their studio for him to sell to Warner Bros. Bosko became the star vehicle for the studio&#x27;s new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon series. Bosko wore long pants and a derby hat, and he had a girlfriend named Honey and a dog named Bruno. He was also sometimes accompanied by Honey&#x27;s humanized cat ward named Wilbur and an often antagonistic goat, particularly in early cartoons.

The role of Bosko was to serve as a cartoony version of Al Jolson in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927). According to Ising, he was initially supposed to be an &quot;inkspot sort of thing&quot;. He was not conceived as either a human or an animal, though behaving like a little boy. According to Leonard Maltin, Bosko was a cartoonized version of a young black boy who spoke a Southern dialect of African American Vernacular English. He cites as an example a phrase from &quot;Bosko&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, said with an intermittent drawl: &quot;I sho&#x27;done likes picnics.&quot;

Whether admiring a dress worn by Honey or eating a sandwich (with exaggerated chewing) Bosko had a stock exclamatory reaction indicating his pleasure &quot;Mmmm! Dat sho&#x27; is fine!&quot; which became something of a catch phrase.

According to Terry Lindvall and Ben Fraser, Bosko and Honey &quot;were the most balanced portrayals of blacks in cartoons to that point&quot;. They had the same type of formulaic coy adventures as Mickey and Minnie Mouse. They point to &quot;Bosko in Person&quot; (1933) where Honey gives a Billie Holiday-style performance as an example of nonracist racial tribute to a real person. According to Tom Bertino, Harman and Ising never called attention to Bosko&#x27;s racial status, and stayed clear of negative stereotypes involving dice and watermelon. Bosko instead received positive portrayals as a spunky and resourceful boy. An exception to this was a demeaning representation in &quot;Congo Jazz&quot; (1930). Bosko in a jungle setting is depicted standing between a small monkey and a gorilla. All three are depicted with virtually identical faces. The only things identifying him as human is his relative size and his clothes.

Following his first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; outing, &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot;, Bosko would go on to star in thirty-nine musical films (one of which was not released). His cartoons are notable for their generally weak plots and their abundance of music, singing, and dancing (though there were exceptions, such as &quot;Bosko the Doughboy&quot;, in 1931). These were the early days of sound cartoons, and audiences were enthralled simply to see characters talking and moving in step with the music. In terms of animation, the shorts are on-par with Disney&#x27;s shorts of the same period. Harman and Ising were allowed production costs of up to $6000 per cartoon. During the same period, Disney was spending around $10,000 per cartoon. The smaller budgets forced Harman and Ising to recycle footage much more often than Disney did.

However, Harman and Ising had an advantage in terms of music and sound recording, as Warner Bros. provided access to a large musical library with all the popular tunes of the day, lavish orchestras (like Abe Lyman&#x27;s), and sound recording equipment and staff free of charge. Disney, on the other hand, had no access to a music library and was forced to rely, for the most part, on public domain music.

Vaudeville was the major entertainment of the time, and the cartoons of the era are better understood when compared to it rather than to animation of later decades. Though rudimentary by today&#x27;s standards, Bosko&#x27;s films were quite popular in their day and rivaled films featuring Mickey Mouse in popularity in the early 1930s, although Disney cartoons would eventually surge ahead in popularity on the basis of stronger plot and character development.

In the later &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts in which Bosko appeared, his accent was gone. Consequently, his race became more ambiguous.

== Bosko at MGM ==
In 1933, Harman and Ising broke with Warner Bros. over budget disputes with Schlesinger. Having learned from Walt Disney&#x27;s experiences with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, they carefully kept all rights to the Bosko character and took him with them at the time of their departure. The two found work with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer where they launched the &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; series. At first, Bosko appeared in his original design and some of the old animation from the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series was even reused in the &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; that featured Bosko. However, after only two cartoons, the character was redesigned into an identifiable black boy, similar in appearance to Inki and Lil&#x27; Eightball, with an overactive imagination. This redesigned Bosko, whom many consider to be a different character altogether despite the shared name, only starred in seven negatively-received cartoons before Harman and Ising discontinued the character. The career of the character ended for good when MGM fired Harman and Ising due to cost overruns in the films they produced. They were replaced by Fred Quimby, who later hired Harman and Ising back, though Bosko did not make any appearances in subsequent MGM subjects they produced.

== Bosko on television ==
Bosko cartoons were packaged with other Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, to be broadcast in various television markets in the 1950s. For instance, &quot;Skipper Frank&quot; (Frank Herman), showed Bosko, along with Buddy, on &quot;Cartoon Carousel&quot; his hour-long afterschool cartoon program on KTLA-TV (Channel 5) in Los Angeles. Bosko cartoons were also later aired on Nickelodeon as part of the network&#x27;s Looney Tunes program beginning in 1988 and ending in 1992, when the network pulled all black-and-white shorts out of rotation to make room for more recent color cartoons featuring more popular Looney Tunes characters.

Bosko appeared in a 1990 episode of the television series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; titled &quot;Fields of Honey&quot;. In a parody of the then-current film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, a mysterious voice leads Babs Bunny to build a theater that shows nothing but cartoons of Bosko&#x27;s girlfriend Honey, after being told about Honey (voiced by B. J. Ward) by the Acme Looniversity&#x27;s mysterious vaultkeeper (voiced by Don Messick). Babs does so, and the resulting audience laughter rejuvenates the aged and ailing Honey. The laughter also rejuvenates the vaultkeeper, who is revealed to be none other than Bosko himself as well as the source of the voice. The cartoon depicts Bosko and Honey as dog-like talking animals similar to the lead characters of the later television series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, presumably so as not to offend viewers with the original black-face characterizations.

The character is also seen in a portrait in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, this time in his original form. He also appears in his original form in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; cartoon &quot;The Girl with the Googily Goop&quot;, in which he is seen parking his car. He was also seen in a &quot;Futurama&quot; opening in &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot; at the part where he runs off a cliff from the car with Honey in it.

The majority of the cartoons are available on VHS and DVD in the &quot;Uncensored Bosko&quot; series from Bosko Video. In 2003, Warner Home Video officially released the initial pilot film &quot;Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid&quot;, as an extra on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1&quot; DVD box set. &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3&quot; (released in 2005) also includes the first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short, &quot;Sinkin&#x27; in the Bathtub&quot; (which originally introduced Bosko and Honey to audiences in 1930) as an extra. &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6&quot; (released in 2008) includes several Bosko films on a disc officially devoted to Bosko and other early 1930s characters.

All the Bosko cartoons subject to copyright remain owned by Warner Bros., but the majority of Bosko cartoons have fallen into the public domain. Warner Bros. also owns the &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; cartoons starring Bosko through Turner Entertainment Co., as Ted Turner bought the pre-May 1986 MGM library.

<doc id="197330" wikidata="Q5321401" url="?curid=197330" title="E-GIF">
<text>An e-GIF, or eGovernment Interoperability Framework, is a scheme for ensuring the inter-operation of computer-based systems. It is intended to resolve and prevent (or at least minimise) problems arising from incompatible content of different computer systems. An e-GIF may aim to facilitate government processes at local, national or international levels.

==International implementations==
About 30 countries and international bodies are known to have implemented some form of e-GIF, most, but not all, using the &quot;e-GIF&quot; acronym. Within the EU many of these were supported by the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) of the IDABC. These included Denmark, Greece, the United Kingdom and the &quot;Reach&quot; &quot;Public Services Broker&quot; in Ireland. 

In Africa COMESA and Ghana provide examples of similar initiatives, whilst Bhutan and Thailand are examples from Asia. 
New Zealand and Australia, similarly, implemented their own frameworks. In the United States the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) shared similar aims.

==Aims of e-GIF==
* to enable the seamless flow of information across government / Public Service Organisations
* to set practical standards using stable well supported products
* to provide support, guidance and toolkits to enable the standards to be met
* to provide a long-term strategy, able to accommodate and adapt.

==Key e-GIF policies==
* alignment with the Internet: the universal adoption of common specifications used on the Internet and World Wide Web for public sector information systems
* adoption of XML as the primary standard for data integration and presentation tools for government systems
* adoption of the browser as the key interface; all public sector information systems are to be accessible through browser based technology; other interfaces are permitted but only in addition to browser based ones
* the addition of metadata to government information resources
* the development and adoption of Metadata standards such as the UK e-Government Metadata Standard (e-GMS) based on the international Dublin Core model
* the development and maintenance of standard category lists such as the UK Government Category List (GCL) and IPSV.
* adherence to a catalogue of Technical Standards such as the UK Technical Standards Catalogue.
* adherence to the e-GIF was mandated throughout the public sector.

==Drivers for selection of e-GIF specifications==
* interoperability - only specifications that are relevant to systems interconnectivity, data integration, e-services access and content management are specified
* market support - the specifications selected are widely supported by the market, and likely to reduce the cost and risk of government information systems
* scalability - specifications selected have capacity to be scaled to satisfy changed demands made on the system, such as changes in data volumes, number of transactions or number of users
* openness - the specifications are documented and available to the public at large.

==Establishing competence and capability in e-GIF==
In the UK, the e-GIF Accreditation Authority accredited organisations for their capability and competence in delivering e-GIF compliant solutions. There was also a programme of individual certifications at Foundation and Expert levels aimed at developing and recognising e-GIF skills and experience, referenced against an e-GIF Competency Framework. The UK e-GIF Compliance Assessment Service, operated by the NCC, offered a self-assessment tool for e-GIF compliance in projects and programmes.

==Fate==
Within the UK, e-GIF was replaced by the &quot;Open Source, Open Standards And Re-Use: Government Action Plan&quot;, published by the Cabinet Office in February 2009. This is now embodied in the Open Standards principles policy. The UK e-GIF documentation and UK Government Data Standards Catalogue have been archived and are available for reference only. Although now deprecated by the Cabinet Office, many systems have been built around the framework and continue to use e-GIF components, notably within the NHS.

<doc id="197333" wikidata="Q4552283" url="?curid=197333" title="USS Cole (DD-155)">
<text>USS &quot;Cole&quot; (DD-155) was a in the United States Navy during World War II, later reclassified as AG-116. It was named for Edward B. Cole, a United States Marine Corps officer who died as a result of the wounds he received at the Battle of Belleau Wood.

&quot;Cole&quot; was launched 11 January 1919, by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia sponsored by Mrs. E. B. Cole, and commissioned 19 June 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;Cole&quot; sailed from New York 30 June 1919, to join U.S. Naval Forces in Turkish waters. For the next year they aided in the evacuation of refugees fleeing turmoil and war in the Middle East and showed the flag in the eastern Mediterranean and Black Seas, returning to New York City on 4 June 1920. It cruised in East Coast and Caribbean waters until decommissioned at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 10 July 1922.

Recommissioned on 1 May 1930, &quot;Cole&quot; joined the Scouting Fleet in the Atlantic. Once again it cruised along the east coast and in the Caribbean and took part in training exercises. From 22 October 1932 to 24 March 1933, &quot;Cole&quot; was in reduced commission at Norfolk Naval Shipyard as part of a rotating reserve squadron. On 4 April 1933, the destroyer participated in the fruitless search for survivors of the wreck of the airship . From 3 February to 14 August 1934, the ship was again reduced to the rotating reserve squadron.

On 15 August 1934, &quot;Cole&quot; was assigned to the Scouting Force in the Pacific, and following maneuvers in the Caribbean reached its new base at San Diego, California on 9 November. It remained in the Pacific until 24 May 1936, and then reported to New York as a Naval Reserve training ship. She arrived at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 25 September and was decommissioned there on 7 January 1937.

Recommissioned 16 October 1939, &quot;Cole&quot; joined the Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic. From 10 June 1941, she escorted convoys to Newfoundland and Iceland making five such voyages by 28 January 1942. From 14 March to 28 September, the destroyer patrolled and escorted convoys along the east coast, making one convoy run to the Virgin Islands. She put to sea from Norfolk, Virginia on 24 October for the invasion of North Africa on 8 November during which she landed 175 men of the 47th Infantry under fire on a pier at Safi, Morocco. &quot;Cole&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation for her performance in this mission. Returning to Boston on 1 December, she resumed convoy duty and between 18 December 1942 and 16 February 1943, she operated between the east coast, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, then made a voyage to Gibraltar in March. The destroyer returned to the Mediterranean, reaching Mers El Kébir, Algeria on 23 May.

Along with patrol and escort duties in the Western Mediterranean, &quot;Cole&quot; took part in the Allied Invasion of Sicily on 10 July 1943, acting with a British submarine as a beach identification group, and later guarded transports during the assault on Salerno on 9 September. She returned to Charleston, South Carolina for overhaul on 24 December, after which she resumed convoy escort duty along the east coast and in the Caribbean, making one voyage to Casablanca in March 1944. On 3 December 1944, she began duty as a plane guard for aircraft carriers conducting air operations out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island, which continued until 31 August 1945. She was reclassified AG-116 on 30 June 1945. &quot;Cole&quot; was decommissioned on 1 November 1945, and sold 6 October 1947.

==Awards==
In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Cole&quot; received three battle stars for World War II service.

==Convoys escorted==
==In popular culture==
In June 2017, the ship&#x27;s bell from &quot;Cole&quot; was found in New Hampshire during an episode of the History cable television channel&#x27;s series, &quot;American Pickers.&quot; It was subsequently donated to the Navy Museum in Washington D.C.

Cole, a machine-gunner killed in action on Iwo Jima on 19 February 1945, during World War II. &quot;Cole&quot; is one of 62 authorized &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class guided missile destroyers, and one of 21 members of the Flight I-class that used the 5 in(127 mm)/54 caliber gun mounts found on the earliest of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers. The ship was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding and was delivered to the Navy on 11 March 1996.
On 12 October 2000, &quot;Cole&quot; was bombed in a suicide attack carried out by the terrorist organization al-Qaeda in the Yemeni port of Aden, killing 17 sailors, injuring 39 others, and damaging the ship. On 29 November 2003, &quot;Cole&quot; engaged in her first overseas deployment after the bombing and subsequently returned to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 May 2004 without incident.

==Service history ==

&quot;Cole&quot; was launched on 10 February 1995 and commissioned on 8 June 1996 in Port Everglades, Florida. &quot;Cole&quot; was in continual service for the United States Navy for several years after being commissioned, but an al-Qaeda terrorist attack in 2000, allegedly plotted by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, heavily damaged the ship, requiring extensive repairs, although still capable of eventually returning to service.

&quot;Cole&quot; spent the first seven months of 2000 completing the intermediate and advanced portions of the Inter-Deployment Training Cycle. From 7 March to 7 April, &quot;Cole&quot; participated in Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) 00-2 as part of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2, led by the aircraft carrier , operating within the Gulf of Mexico operating areas. &quot;Cole&quot; was the only unit not &#x27;damaged&#x27; during the exercise. From 9 to 22 May, &quot;Cole&quot; participated in Joint Task Force Exercise with the battle group, operating within the Cherry Point and Virginia Capes operating areas. On 8 August 2000, &quot;Cole&quot; departed on deployment, spending much time in the Mediterranean and Adriatic.

=== Al-Qaeda attack ===
On 12 October 2000, while at anchor in Aden for refueling, &quot;Cole&quot; was attacked by Al-Qaeda suicide bombers, who sailed a small boat near the destroyer and detonated explosive charges. The blast created a hole in the port side of the ship about in diameter, killing 17 crew members and injuring 37. The ship was under the command of Commander Kirk Lippold.

Eleven seriously injured sailors — two women and nine men — were evacuated to various hospitals in Aden by French Air Force Transall C-160 airplanes from the French Forces of Djibouti. French forces were mobilized to treat the wounded. Afterward, a USAF McDonnell Douglas C-9 evacuated them.

&quot;Cole&quot; was returned to the United States aboard the Norwegian heavy-lift ship , then owned by Offshore Heavy Transport of Norway. The ship was off-loaded 13 December 2000 from &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; in a dredged deep-water facility at the Pascagoula, Mississippi, shipyard of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Ingalls Operations. On 14 January 2001, &quot;Cole&quot; was moved from the floating dry dock at Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding to the land facility to begin her restoration process fully. &quot;Cole&quot;″s movement over land was accomplished by a system of electrically powered cars that traveled on rails. &quot;Cole&quot; was moved to a construction bay near where the ship was originally built five years before. On 1 July 2001, still under repair, she was transferred to Carrier Group 2, led by the aircraft carrier .

On 14 September 2001, &quot;Cole&quot; was moved from drydock into the water once again. Initially scheduled for 15 September, the transfer was done the night of 14 September secretly to avoid the large media event originally scheduled one month before the September 11 attacks. Moving the ship from the dry dock to the water took around 8 hours. As part of the increased security surrounding the undocking, sister ship provided weapons and a physical presence to deter the possibility of any militant activity during the move. After 14 months of repair, &quot;Cole&quot; departed on 19 April 2002, and returned to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia.

On 3 December 2001, &quot;Cole&quot; transitioned from Destroyer Squadron 22, to COMDESRON 18 and the Enterprise Battle Group. The move to CDS 18 was followed by a visit to &quot;Cole&quot; by Commodore Daniel Holloway, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 18, on 10–11 December 2001.

The U.S. government offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of people who committed or aided in the attack on &quot;Cole&quot;. Al-Qaeda was suspected of targeting &quot;Cole&quot; following the failure of a 3 January 2000 attack on the destroyer , one of the 2000 millennium attack plots.

On 4 November 2002, Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, a suspected al-Qaeda operative who is believed to have planned the &quot;Cole&quot; attack, was killed in Yemen by the Central Intelligence Agency using an AGM-114 Hellfire missile launched from a General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drone.

In April 2019, a federal court dismissed two years of rulings in pretrial proceedings by the judge overseeing the military trial of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged leader of the 2000 bombing of &quot;Cole&quot;, at Guantánamo Bay; the case was expected to drag on for years.

On 13 February 2020, the government of Sudan agreed to compensate the families of the sailors who died in the bombing.

=== Redeployment ===
On 20 August 2003, &quot;Cole&quot; got underway with the Argentine destroyer for a short group sail. Embarked onboard &quot;Cole&quot; was the Visit Board Search and Seizure Team from the destroyer . Together with &quot;Cole&quot;″s two VBSS teams, they conducted a series of Maritime Interdiction Operation (MIO) boardings on both &quot;Cole&quot; and &quot;Sarandí&quot; to practice for the upcoming Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX). On 21 August, &quot;Cole&quot; fired CIWS and 5-inch rounds during a Killer Tomato Exercise in addition to conducting a series of personnel transfers with &quot;Sarandí&quot; via &quot;Sarandí&quot;″s helicopter. Three of each ship&#x27;s officers spent a few hours on their counterpart. The destroyer joined the group to conduct their own MIO boardings. On 22 August, all three ships conducted an underway replenishment with the supply vessel before heading back to Norfolk.
The predeployment COMPTUEX tested &quot;Cole&quot;″s crew and all of the Enterprise Strike Group from 10 September 2003 until the beginning of October, starting with a series of structured events. On the first day, &quot;Cole&quot;″s CIC teams participated in a jamming exercise, demonstrating the effects on &quot;Cole&quot;″s sensors while being jammed.

On 29 November 2003 &quot;Cole&quot; deployed for her first overseas deployment after the bombing. December began with &quot;Cole&quot; in company with fellow destroyers &quot;Gonzalez&quot; and &quot;Thorn&quot;, transiting the Atlantic Ocean for the deployment of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12, the strike group. On 1 December, all three ships conducted an underway replenishment with the supply vessel , the Surface Strike Group&#x27;s last fuel stop until reaching Europe. She subsequently returned to her home port of Norfolk on 27 May 2004, without incident.

In 2005 &quot;Cole&quot; participated in Exercise BALTOPS 05 in the Baltic Sea. &quot;Cole&quot; returned to the U.S. in early July and attended Fourth of July celebrations in Philadelphia.

&quot;Cole&quot; deployed to the Middle East on 8 June 2006, for the first time since the bombing. While passing the port city of Aden, the ship&#x27;s company crewed the rails to honor the crewmembers killed in the bombing. She returned to her home port of Norfolk on 6 December 2006, again without incident.

On 21 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that &quot;Cole&quot;″s commanding officer at the time of the bombing, Commander Kirk Lippold, had been denied promotion to the rank of captain.

On 28 February 2008, &quot;Cole&quot; was sent to take station off Lebanon&#x27;s coast, the first of an anticipated three-ship flotilla.
On 3 February 2017, a U.S. defense official told &quot;Fox News&quot;, &quot;The Navy sent USS &quot;Cole&quot; to the Gulf of Aden following an attack earlier this week [30 January] on a Saudi warship off Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels&quot;. Both Iran and the Houthis have denied they are collaborating with each other.

In May 2022, &quot;Cole&quot; was homeported out of Naval Station Norfolk and a part of Destroyer Squadron 28, along with Carrier Strike Group 8 led by the .

&quot;Cole&#x27;s&quot; latest deployment began in May 2024. In response to escalating tensions in the Middle East following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, &quot;Cole&quot;, along with USS &quot;Laboon&quot; and several strike force vessels have been cruising areas from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. 

On 1 October 2024, &quot;Cole&quot; was involved in the interception of missiles employing SM-3 and SM-6 missiles during the October 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel.

<text>Ecophagy is a term coined by Robert Freitas that means the consumption of an ecosystem. It derives .

Freitas used the term to describe a scenario involving molecular nanotechnology gone awry. In this situation (called the grey goo scenario) out-of-control self-replicating nanorobots consume entire ecosystems, resulting in global ecophagy.

== Entemology ==
However, the word &quot;ecophagy&quot; is now applied more generally in reference to any event—nuclear war, the spread of monoculture, massive species extinctions—that might fundamentally alter the planet. Scholars suggest that these events might result in ecocide in that they would undermine the capacity of the Earth&#x27;s biological population to repair itself. Others suggest that more mundane and less spectacular events—the unrelenting growth of the human population, the steady transformation of the natural world by human beings—will eventually result in a planet that is considerably less vibrant, and one that is, apart from humans, essentially lifeless. These people believe that the current human trajectory puts us on a path that will eventually lead to ecophagy.

In the paper in which Freitas coined the term he wrote:

Perhaps the earliest-recognized and best-known danger of molecular nanotechnology is the risk that self-replicating nanorobots capable of functioning autonomously in the natural environment could quickly convert that natural environment (e.g., &quot;biomass&quot;) into replicas of themselves (e.g., &quot;nanomass&quot;) on a global basis, a scenario usually referred to as the &quot;grey goo problem&quot; but perhaps more properly termed &quot;global ecophagy&quot;.
