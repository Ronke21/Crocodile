<text>Goryeo (, ; ) was a Korean state founded in 918, during a time of national division called the Later Three Kingdoms period, that unified and ruled the Korean Peninsula until the establishment of Joseon in 1392. Goryeo achieved what has been called a &quot;true national unification&quot; by Korean historians as it not only unified the Later Three Kingdoms but also incorporated much of the ruling class of the northern kingdom of Balhae, who had origins in Goguryeo of the earlier Three Kingdoms of Korea. According to Korean historians, it was during the Goryeo period that the individual identities of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla were successfully merged into a single entity that became the basis of the modern-day Korean identity. The name &quot;Korea&quot; is derived from the name of Goryeo, also romanized as Koryŏ, which was first used in the early 5th century by Goguryeo; Goryeo was a successor state to Later Goguryeo and Goguryeo.

Throughout its existence, Goryeo, alongside Unified Silla, was known to be the &quot;Golden Age of Buddhism&quot; in Korea. As the state religion, Buddhism achieved its highest level of influence in Korean history, with 70 temples in the capital alone in the 11th century. Commerce flourished in Goryeo, with merchants coming from as far as the Middle East. The capital in modern-day Kaesong, North Korea was a center of trade and industry. Goryeo was a period of great achievements in Korean art and culture.

During its heyday, Goryeo constantly wrestled with northern empires such as the Liao (Khitans) and Jin (Jurchens). It was invaded by the Mongol Empire and became a vassal state of the Yuan dynasty in the 13th–14th centuries, but attacked the Yuan and reclaimed territories as the Yuan declined. This is considered by modern Korean scholars to be Goryeo&#x27;s Northern Expansion Doctrine () to reclaim ancestral lands formerly owned by Goguryeo. As much as it valued education and culture, Goryeo was able to mobilize sizable military might during times of war. It fended off massive armies of the Red Turban Rebels from China and professional Japanese pirates in its twilight years of the 14th century. A final proposed attack against the Ming dynasty resulted in a coup d&#x27;état led by General Yi Sŏng-gye that ended the Goryeo dynasty.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Goryeo&quot; (), which is the source of the name &quot;Korea&quot;, was originally used by Goguryeo () of the Three Kingdoms of Korea beginning in the early 5th century. Other attested variants of the name have also been recorded as &quot;Gori&quot; (高離/槀離/稾離) and &quot;Guryeo&quot; (句麗). There have been various speculations for the breakdown of Goguryeo as a name, the most common being &quot;go&quot; meaning &quot;high&quot;, &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;guri&quot; meaning &quot;castle&quot;, related to the word &quot;gol&quot; used during medieval Goryeo meaning &quot;place&quot;. In 918, Goryeo was founded as the successor to Goguryeo and inherited its name. Historically, Goguryeo (37 BC–668 AD), Later Goguryeo (901–918), and Goryeo (918–1392) all used the name &quot;Goryeo&quot;. Their historiographical names were implemented in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; in the 12th century. Goryeo also used the names &quot;Samhan&quot; and &quot;Haedong&quot;, meaning &quot;East of the Sea&quot;.

==History==
===Early period===

====Founding====

In the late 7th century, the kingdom of Silla unified the Three Kingdoms of Korea and entered a period known in historiography as &quot;Unified Silla&quot; or &quot;Later Silla&quot;. Later Silla implemented a national policy of integrating Baekje and Goguryeo refugees called the &quot;Unification of the Samhan&quot;, referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Silla organized a new central army called the &quot;Guseodang&quot; () that was divided into 3 units of Silla people, 3 units of Goguryeo people, 2 units of Baekje people, and 1 unit of Mohe people. However, the Baekje and Goguryeo refugees retained their respective collective consciousnesses and maintained a deep-seated resentment and hostility toward Silla. Later Silla was initially a period of peace, without a single foreign invasion for 200 years, and commerce, as it engaged in international trade from as distant as the Middle East and maintained maritime leadership in East Asia. Beginning in the late 8th century, Later Silla was undermined by instability because of political turbulence in the capital and class rigidity in the bone-rank system, leading to the weakening of the central government and the rise of the &quot;hojok&quot; () regional lords. The military officer Kyŏn Hwŏn revived Baekje in 892 with the descendants of the Baekje refugees, and the Buddhist monk Kung Ye revived Goguryeo in 901 with the descendants of the Goguryeo refugees; these states are called Later Baekje and Later Goguryeo in historiography, and together with Later Silla form the Later Three Kingdoms.

Later Goguryeo originated in the northern regions of Later Silla, which, along with its capital located in modern-day Kaesong, North Korea, were the strongholds of the Goguryeo refugees. Among the Goguryeo refugees was Wang Kŏn, a member of a prominent maritime &quot;hojok&quot; based in Kaesong, who traced his ancestry to a great clan of Goguryeo. Wang Kŏn entered military service under Kung Ye at the age of 19 in 896, before Later Goguryeo had been established, and over the years accumulated a series of victories over Later Baekje and gained the public&#x27;s confidence. In particular, using his maritime abilities, he persistently attacked the coast of Later Baekje and occupied key points, including modern-day Naju. Kung Ye was unstable and cruel: he moved the capital to Cheorwon in 905, changed the name of his kingdom to Majin in 904 then Taebong in 911, changed his era name multiple times, proclaimed himself the Maitreya Buddha, claimed to read minds, and executed numerous subordinates and family members out of paranoia. In 918, Kung Ye was deposed by his own generals, and Wang Kŏn was raised to the throne. Wang Kŏn, who would posthumously be known by his temple name of Taejo or &quot;Grand Progenitor&quot;, changed the name of his kingdom back to &quot;Goryeo&quot;, adopted the era name of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Mandate&quot;, and moved the capital back to his home of Kaesong. Goryeo regarded itself as the successor to Goguryeo and laid claim to Manchuria as its rightful legacy. One of Taejo&#x27;s first decrees was to repopulate and defend the ancient Goguryeo capital of Pyongyang, which had been in ruins for a long time; afterward, he renamed it the &quot;Western Capital&quot;, and before he died, he placed great importance on it in his &quot;Ten Injunctions&quot; to his descendants.

====Unification====
In contrast to Kung Ye, who had harbored vengeful animosity toward Silla, Taejo (Wang Kŏn) was magnanimous toward the weakened kingdom. In 927, Kyŏn Hwŏn, who had vowed to avenge the last king of Baekje when he founded Later Baekje, sacked the capital of Later Silla, forced the king to commit suicide, and installed a puppet on the throne. Taejo came to Later Silla&#x27;s aid but suffered a major defeat at the hand of Kyŏn Hwŏn near modern-day Daegu; Taejo barely escaped with his life thanks to the self-sacrifices of Generals Sin Sung-gyŏm and Kim Nak, and, thereafter, Later Baekje became the dominant military power of the Later Three Kingdoms. However, the balance of power shifted toward Goryeo with victories over Later Baekje in 930 and 934, and the peaceful annexation of Later Silla in 935. Taejo graciously accepted the capitulation of the last king of Silla and incorporated the ruling class of Later Silla. In 935, Kyŏn Hwŏn was removed from his throne by his eldest son over a succession dispute and imprisoned at Geumsansa Temple, but he escaped to Goryeo three months later and was deferentially received by his former archrival. In 936, upon Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s request, Taejo and Kyŏn Hwŏn conquered Later Baekje with an army of 87,500 soldiers, bringing an end to the Later Three Kingdoms period. Goryeo proceeded to incorporate a major portion of the Balhae people whose links to Goguryeo were shared with Goryeo, accepting most of their royalty and nobility in their fold.

Following the destruction of Balhae by the Khitan Liao dynasty in 927, the last crown prince of Balhae and much of the ruling class sought refuge in Goryeo, where they were warmly welcomed and given land by Taejo. In addition, Taejo included the Balhae crown prince in the Goryeo royal family, unifying the two successor states of Goguryeo and, according to Korean historians, achieving a &quot;true national unification&quot; of Korea. According to the &quot;Goryeosa jeolyo&quot;, the Balhae refugees who accompanied the crown prince numbered in the tens of thousands of households. As descendants of Goguryeo, the Balhae people and the Goryeo dynasts were related. Taejo felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, calling it his &quot;relative country&quot; and &quot;married country&quot;, and protected the Balhae refugees. This was in stark contrast to Later Silla, which had endured a hostile relationship with Balhae. Taejo displayed strong animosity toward the Khitans who had destroyed Balhae. The Liao dynasty sent 30 envoys with 50 camels as a gift in 942, but Taejo exiled the envoys to an island and starved the camels under a bridge, in what is known as the &quot;Manbu Bridge Incident&quot;. Taejo proposed to Gaozu of Later Jin that they attack the Khitans in retribution for Balhae, according to the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. Furthermore, in his &quot;Ten Injunctions&quot; to his descendants, he stated that the Khitans are &quot;savage beasts&quot; and should be guarded against.

Exodus en masse on part from the Balhae refugees would continue on at least until the early 12th century during the reign of King Yejong. Due to this constant massive influx of Balhae refugees, the Goguryeoic population in Goryeo is speculated to have become dominant in proportion compared to their Silla and Baekje counterparts that have experienced devastating war and political strife since the advent of the Later Three Kingdoms. By the end of the Later Three Kingdoms, territories populated by the original Silla people and considered that of &quot;Silla proper&quot; (原新羅) were reduced to Gyeongju and bits of the vicinity. Later Baekje fared only little better than Later Silla before its fall in 936. Meanwhile, of the three capitals of Goryeo, two were Kaesong and Pyongyang which were initially populated by Goguryeoic settlers from the Paeseo Region () and Balhae. Nonetheless, Goryeo proceeded to peacefully absorbing the ruling class of both countries and incorporated them under its bureaucracy; conducting political marriages and distributing positions according to their previous status in their respective countries. In contrast to Silla&#x27;s bone-rank system, these open policies implemented by Wang Kŏn enabled Goryeo to enjoy a larger pool of highly skilled bureaucrats and technicians with the addition of those coming from Silla and Baekje; later on instilling a single agenda in terms of identity amongst its people. During the time of its existence, Goryeo also accepted a large amount of skilled workers from Medieval China and Tamna as well.

====Political reformation====

Although Goryeo had unified the Korean Peninsula, the &quot;hojok&quot; regional lords remained quasi-independent within their walled domains and posed a threat to the monarchy. To secure political alliances, Taejo married 29 women from prominent &quot;hojok&quot; families, siring 25 sons and 9 daughters. His fourth son, Gwangjong, came to power in 949 to become the fourth ruler of Goryeo and instituted reforms to consolidate monarchical authority. In 956, Gwangjong freed the prisoners of war and refugees who had been enslaved by the &quot;hojok&quot; during the tumultuous Later Three Kingdoms period, in effect decreasing the power and influence of the regional nobility and increasing the population liable for taxation by the central government. In 958, advised by Shuang Ji, a naturalized Chinese official from the Later Zhou dynasty, Gwangjong implemented the &quot;gwageo&quot; civil service examinations, based primarily on the imperial examination of the Tang dynasty. This, too, was to consolidate monarchical authority. The &quot;gwageo&quot; remained an important institution in Korea until its abolition in 1894. In contrast to Goryeo&#x27;s traditional &quot;dual royal/imperial structure under which the ruler was at once king, emperor and Son of Heaven&quot;, according to Remco E. Breuker, Gwangjong used a &quot;full-blown imperial system&quot;. All those who opposed or resisted his reforms were summarily purged.

Gwangjong&#x27;s successor, Gyeongjong, instituted the &quot;Stipend Land Law&quot; in 976 to support the new central government bureaucracy established on the foundation of Gwangjong&#x27;s reforms. The next ruler, Seongjong, secured centralization of government and laid the foundation for a centralized political order. Seongjong filled the bureaucracy with new bureaucrats, who as products of the &quot;gwageo&quot; civil service examinations were educated to be loyal to the state, and dispatched centrally-appointed officials to administrate the provinces. As a result, the monarch controlled much of the decision making, and his signature was required to implement important decisions. Seongjong supported Confucianism and, upon a proposal by the Confucian scholar Ch&#x27;oe Sŭng-no, the separation of government and religion. In addition, Seongjong laid the foundation for Goryeo&#x27;s educational system: he founded the &quot;Gukjagam&quot; national university in 992, supplementing the schools already established in Kaesong and Pyongyang by Taejo, and national libraries and archives in Kaesong and Pyongyang that contained tens of thousands of books.

====Goryeo–Khitan War====

Following the &quot;Manbu Bridge Incident&quot; of 942, Goryeo prepared itself for a conflict with the Khitan Empire: Jeongjong established a military reserve force of 300,000 soldiers called the &quot;Resplendent Army&quot; in 947, and Gwangjong built fortresses north of the Chongchon River, expanding toward the Yalu River. However an attempt to control the Yalu River basin in 984 failed due to conflict with the Jurchens. The Khitans considered Goryeo a potential threat and, with tensions rising, invaded in 993. The Jurchens warned Goryeo of the invasion twice. At first Goryeo did not believe the information but came around upon the second warning and took up a defensive strategy. The Koreans were defeated in their first encounter with the Khitans, but successfully halted their advance at Anyung-jin (in modern Anju, South Pyongan Province) at the Chongchon River. Negotiations began between the Goryeo commander, Sŏ Hŭi, and the Liao commander, Xiao Sunning. In conclusion, Goryeo entered a nominal tributary relationship with Liao, severing relations with Song, and Liao recognized Goryeo sovereignty to the land east of the Yalu River. Goryeo was left free to deal with the Jurchens south of the Yalu and in 994-996, Sŏ Hŭi led an army into the area and built forts. Afterward, Goryeo established the &quot;Six Garrison Settlements East of the River&quot; in its new territory. In 994, Goryeo proposed to Song a joint military attack on Liao, but was declined; previously, in 985, when Song had proposed a joint military attack on Liao, Goryeo had declined. For a time, Goryeo and Liao enjoyed an amicable relationship. In 996, Seongjong married a Liao princess.

As the Khitan Empire expanded and became more powerful, it demanded that Goryeo cede the Six Garrison Settlements, but Goryeo refused. In 1009, Kang Cho staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, assassinating Mokjong and installing Hyeonjong on the throne. Goryeo sent an envoy to the Khitans telling them that the previous king had died and a new king had ascended the throne. In the following year, some Jurchen tribesmen who had been in conflict with Goryeo fled to the Khitans and told them of the coup. Under the pretext of avenging Mokjong, Emperor Shengzong of Liao led an invasion of Goryeo with an army of 400,000 soldiers. Meanwhile, Goryeo tried to establish relations with Song but was ignored, as Song had agreed to the Chanyuan Treaty in 1005. Goryeo gathered a 300,000 strong army under Kang Cho. In the first battle, the Goryeo forces led by Yang Kyu won a victory against the Liao. The Liao decided to split up their forces with one part heading south. The Goryeo army under the leadership of Kang Cho lost the second battle and suffered heavy casualties. The army was dispersed and many commanders were captured or killed, including Kang Cho himself. Later, Pyongyang was successfully defended, but the Liao army marched toward Kaesong.

Hyeonjong, upon the advice of Kang Kam-ch&#x27;an, evacuated south to Naju. Shortly afterward, the Liao won a pitched battle outside Kaesong and sacked the city. He then sent and Ko Yŏnggi to sue for peace, with a promise that he would pay homage in person to the Liao emperor. The Khitans, who were sustaining attacks from previously surrendered districts and the regrouped Korean army which disrupted their supply lines, accepted and began their withdrawal. The Liao army became bogged down in the mountains during the winter and had to abandon much of their armour. The Khitans were ceaselessly attacked during their withdrawal; Yang Kyu rescued from over 10,000 to over 30,000 prisoners of war, but died in battle. According to the &quot;Goryeosa&quot;, due to continued attacks and heavy rain, the Khitan army was devastated and lost its weapons crossing the Yalu. They were attacked while crossing the Yalu River and many drowned. Afterward, Hyeonjong did not fulfill his promise to pay homage in person to the Liao emperor, and when demanded to cede the Six Garrison Settlements, he refused.

The Khitans built a bridge across the Yalu River in 1014 and attacked in 1015, 1016, and 1017: victory went to the Koreans in 1015, the Khitans in 1016, and the Koreans in 1017. Goryeo lost the Poju (Uiju) region. In 1018, Liao launched an invasion led by Xiao Paiya, the older brother of Xiao Sunning, with an army of 100,000 soldiers. The Liao army tried to head straight for Kaesong. Goryeo gathered an army of 208,000 under Kang Kam-ch&#x27;an and ambushed and Liao army, which suffered heavy casualties. The Goryeo commander Kang Kam-ch&#x27;an had dammed a large tributary of the Yalu River and released the water on the unsuspecting Khitan soldiers, who were then charged by 12,000 elite cavalry. The Liao army pushed on toward Kaesong under constant enemy harassment. After arriving within the vicinity of the well-defended capital, a contingent of 300 cavalry sent as scouts was annihilated, upon which the Liao army decided to withdraw. The Liao troops soldiered on and headed toward the capital, but were met with stiff resistance and constant attacks, and were forced to retreat back north. During the retreat, 10,000 Liao army troops were annihilated by the Goryeo army under of Goryeo. The retreating Liao army was intercepted by Kang Kam-ch&#x27;an in modern-day Kusong and suffered a major defeat, with only a few thousand soldiers escaping.

Shengzong intended to invade again and amassed another large expeditionary army in 1019 but faced internal opposition. In 1020, Goryeo sent tribute and Liao accepted, thus resuming nominal tributary relations. Shengzong did not demand that Hyeonjong pay homage in person or cede the Six Garrison Settlements. The only peace treaty stipulations formalized in 1022 were a &quot;declaration of vassalage&quot; and the release of a detained Liao envoy. A Liao envoy was sent in the same year to formally invest the Goryeo king and upon his death in 1031, his successor Wang Hŭm was also invested as king by the Liao. After 1022, Goryeo did not have diplomatic relations with the Song until 1070, with the exception of an isolated embassy in 1030. The sole embassy was probably related to the rebellion of Balhae people in the Liao dynasty. The rebellion was quickly defeated by the Khitans, who returned to enforce Goryeo&#x27;s tributary obligations. Goryeo adopted the reign title of the Liao in the fourth month of 1022. The &quot;History of Liao&quot; claims that Hyeonjong &quot;surrendered&quot; and Shengzong &quot;pardoned&quot; him, but according to Hans Bielenstein, &quot;[s]horn of its dynastic language, this means no more than that the two states concluded peace as equal partners (formalized in 1022)&quot;. Bielenstein claims that Hyeonjong kept his reign title and maintained diplomatic relations with the Song dynasty.

Kaesong was rebuilt, grander than before, and, from 1033 to 1044, the &quot;Cheolli Jangseong&quot;, a wall stretching from the mouth of the Yalu River to the east coast of the Korean Peninsula, was built for defense against future invasions. Liao never invaded Goryeo again.

====Golden age====
Following the Goryeo–Khitan War, a balance of power was established in East Asia between Goryeo, Liao, and Song. With its victory over Liao, Goryeo was confident in its military ability and no longer worried about a Khitan military threat. Fu Bi, a grand councilor of the Song dynasty, had a high estimate of Goryeo&#x27;s military ability and said that Liao was afraid of Goryeo. Furthermore, regarding the attitude of the Koreans, he said: &quot;Among the many tribes and peoples which, depending on their power of resistance, have been either assimilated or made tributary to the Khitan, the Koreans alone do not bow their heads.&quot; Song regarded Goryeo as a potential military ally and maintained friendly relations as equal partners. Meanwhile, Liao sought to build closer ties with Goryeo and prevent a Song–Goryeo military alliance by appealing to Goryeo&#x27;s infatuation with Buddhism, and offered Liao Buddhist knowledge and artifacts to Goryeo. During the 11th century, Goryeo was viewed as &quot;the state that could give either the Song or Liao military ascendancy&quot;. When imperial envoys, who represented the emperors of Liao and Song, went to Goryeo, they were received as peers, not suzerains. Goryeo&#x27;s international reputation was greatly enhanced. Beginning in 1034, merchants from Song and envoys from various Jurchen tribes and the Tamna kingdom attended the annual &quot;Palgwanhoe&quot; in Kaesong, the largest national celebration in Goryeo; the Song merchants attended as representatives of China while the Jurchen and Tamna envoys attended as members of Goryeo&#x27;s &quot;tianxia&quot;. During the reign of Munjong, the Heishui Mohe and Japan, among many others, attended as well. The Tamna kingdom of Jeju Island was incorporated into Goryeo in 1105.
Goryeo&#x27;s golden age lasted about 100 years into the early 12th century and was a period of commercial, intellectual, and artistic achievement. The capital was a center of trade and industry, and its merchants developed one of the earliest systems of double-entry bookkeeping in the world, called the &quot;sagae chibubeop&quot;, that was used until 1920. The &quot;Goryeosa&quot; records the arrival of merchants from Arabia in 1024, 1025, and 1040, and hundreds of merchants from Song each year, beginning in the 1030s. There were developments in printing and publishing, spreading the knowledge of philosophy, literature, religion, and science. Goryeo prolifically published and imported books, and by the late 11th century, exported books to China; the Song dynasty transcribed thousands of Korean books. The first &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot;, amounting to about 6,000 volumes, was completed in 1087. The private academy was established in 1055 by Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung, who is known as the &quot;&quot;Haedong&quot; Confucius&quot;, and soon afterward there were 12 private academies in Goryeo that rivaled the &quot;Gukjagam&quot; national university. In response, several Goryeo rulers reformed and revitalized the national education system, producing prominent scholars such as Kim Pu-sik. In 1101, the &quot;Seojeokpo&quot; printing bureau was established at the &quot;Gukjagam&quot;. In the early 12th century, local schools called were established. Goryeo&#x27;s reverence for learning is attested to in the , or , a book by an envoy from the Song dynasty who visited Goryeo in 1123. The reign of Munjong, from 1046 to 1083, was called a &quot;Reign of Peace&quot; () and is considered the most prosperous and peaceful period in Goryeo history. Munjong was highly praised and described as &quot;benevolent&quot; and &quot;holy&quot; (賢聖之君) in the &quot;Goryeosa&quot;. In addition, he achieved the epitome of cultural blossoming in Goryeo. Munjong had 13 sons: the three eldest succeeded him on the throne, and the fourth was the prominent Buddhist monk Uicheon.

Goryeo was a period of great achievements in Korean art and culture, such as &quot;Koryŏ celadon&quot;, which was highly praised in the Song dynasty, and the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot;, which was described by UNESCO as &quot;one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world&quot;, with the original 81,258 engraved printing blocks still preserved at Haeinsa Temple. In the early 13th century, Goryeo developed movable type made of metal to print books, 200 years before Johannes Gutenberg in Europe.

===Middle period===

==== Goryeo-Jurchen War ====
The Jurchens in the Yalu River region were tributaries of Goryeo since the reign of Taejo of Goryeo (r. 918-943), who called upon them during the wars of the Later Three Kingdoms period. Taejo relied heavily on a large Jurchen cavalry force to defeat Later Baekje. The Jurchens switched allegiances between Liao and Goryeo multiple times depending on which they deemed the most appropriate. The Liao and Goryeo competed to gain the allegiance of Jurchen settlers who effectively controlled much of the border area beyond Goryeo and Liao fortifications. These Jurchens offered tribute but expected to be rewarded richly by the Goryeo court in return. However the Jurchens who offered tribute were often the same ones who raided Goryeo&#x27;s borders. In one instance, the Goryeo court discovered that a Jurchen leader who had brought tribute had been behind the recent raids on their territory. The frontier was largely outside of direct control and lavish gifts were doled out as a means of controlling the Jurchens. Sometimes Jurchens submitted to Goryeo and were given citizenship. Goryeo inhabitants were forbidden from trading with Jurchens.

The tributary relations between Jurchens and Goryeo began to change under the reign of Jurchen leader Wuyashu (r. 1103–1113) of the Wanyan clan. The Wanyan clan was intimately aware of the Jurchens who had submitted to Goryeo and used their power to break the clans&#x27; allegiance to Goryeo, unifying the Jurchens. The resulting conflict between the two powers led to Goryeo&#x27;s withdrawal from Jurchen territory and acknowledgment of Jurchen control over the contested region.

As the geopolitical situation shifted, Goryeo unleashed a series of military campaigns in the early 12th century to regain control of its borderlands. Goryeo had already been in conflict with the Jurchens before. In 984, Goryeo failed to control the Yalu River basin due to conflict with the Jurchens. In 1056, Goryeo repelled the Eastern Jurchens and afterward destroyed their stronghold of over 20 villages. In 1080, Munjong of Goryeo led a force of 30,000 to conquer ten villages. However by the rise of the Wanyan clan, the quality of Goryeo&#x27;s army had degraded and it mostly consisted of infantry. There were several clashes with the Jurchens, usually resulting in Jurchen victory with their mounted cavalrymen. In 1104, the Wanyan Jurchens reached Chongju while pursuing tribes resisting them. Goryeo sent Im Gan to confront the Jurchens, but his untrained army was defeated, and the Jurchens took Chongju castle. Im Gan was dismissed from office and reinstated, dying as a civil servant in 1112. The war effort was taken up by Yun Kwan, but the situation was unfavorable and he returned after making peace.

Yun Kwan believed that the loss was due to their inferior cavalry and proposed to the king that an elite force known as the Byeolmuban (別武班; &quot;Special Warfare Army&quot;) be created. It existed apart from the main army and was made up of cavalry, infantry, and a &quot;Hangmagun&quot; (&quot;Subdue Demon Corps&quot;). In December 1107, Yun Kwan and O Yŏnch&#x27;ong set out with 170,000 soldiers to conquer the Jurchens. The army won against the Jurchens and built Nine Fortresses over a wide area on the frontier encompassing Jurchen tribal lands, and erected a monument to mark the boundary. However due to unceasing Jurchen attacks, diplomatic appeals, and court intrigue, the Nine Fortresses were handed back to the Jurchens. In 1108, Yun Kwan was removed from office and the Nine Fortresses were turned over to the Wanyan clan. It is plausible that the Jurchens and Goryeo had some sort of implicit understanding where the Jurchens would cease their attacks while Goryeo took advantage of the conflict between the Jurchens and Khitans to gain territory. According to Breuker, Goryeo never really had control of the region occupied by the Nine Fortresses in the first place and maintaining hegemony would have meant a prolonged conflict with militarily superior Jurchen troops that would prove very costly. The Nine Fortresses were exchanged for Poju (Uiju), a region the Jurchens later contested when Goryeo hesitated to recognize them as their suzerain.

Later, Wuyashu&#x27;s younger brother Aguda founded the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). When the Jin was founded, the Jurchens called Goryeo their &quot;parent country&quot; or &quot;father and mother&quot; country. This was because it had traditionally been part of their system of tributary relations, its rhetoric, advanced culture, as well as the idea that it was &quot;bastard offspring of Koryŏ&quot;. The Jin also believed that they shared a common ancestry with the Balhae people in the Liao dynasty. The Jin went on to conquer the Liao dynasty in 1125 and capture the Song capital of Kaifeng in 1127 (Jingkang incident). The Jin also put pressure on Goryeo and demanded that Goryeo become their subject. While many in Goryeo were against this, Yi Cha-gyŏm was in power at the time and judged peaceful relations with the Jin to be beneficial to his own political power. He accepted the Jin demands and in 1126, the king of Goryeo declared himself a Jin vassal (tributary). However the Goryeo king retained his position as &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; within Goryeo. By incorporating Jurchen history into that of Goryeo and emphasizing the Jin emperors as bastard offspring of Goryeo, and placing the Jin within the template of a &quot;northern dynasty&quot;, the imposition of Jin suzerainty became more acceptable.

====Power struggles====

The Inju Yi clan married women to the kings from the time of Munjong to the 17th King, Injong. Eventually the Inju Yi clan gained more power than the monarch himself. This led to the coup of Yi Cha-gyŏm in 1126. It failed, but the power of the monarch was weakened; Goryeo underwent a civil war among the nobility.

In 1135, Myocheong argued in favor of moving the capital to Seogyeong (now Pyongyang). This proposal divided the nobles. One faction, led by Myocheong, believed in moving the capital to Pyongyang and expanding into Manchuria. The other one, led by Kim Pu-sik (author of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;), wanted to keep the status quo. Myocheong failed to persuade the king; he rebelled and established the state of Daebang, but it failed and he was killed.

====Military regime====

Although Goryeo was founded by the military, its authority was in decline. In 1014, a coup occurred but the effects of the rebellion did not last long, only making generals discontent with the current supremacy of the civilian officers.

In addition, under the reign of King Uijong, military officers were prohibited from entering the Security Council, and even at times of state emergency, they were not allowed to assume commands. After political chaos, Uijong started to enjoy traveling to local temples and studying sutra, while he was almost always accompanied by a large group of civilian officers. The military officers were largely ignored and were even mobilized to construct temples and ponds.

Beginning in 1170, the government of Goryeo was de facto controlled by a succession of powerful families from the warrior class, most notably the Ch&#x27;oe family, in a military dictatorship akin to a &quot;shogunate&quot;.

In 1170, a group of army officers led by Chŏng Chung-bu, Yi Ŭi-bang and Yi Ko launched a coup d&#x27;état and succeeded. King Uijong went into exile and King Myeongjong was placed on the throne. Effective power, however, lay with a succession of generals who used an elite guard unit known as the Tobang to control the throne: military rule of Goryeo had begun. In 1179, the young general Kyŏng Tae-sŭng rose to power and began an attempt to restore the full power of the monarch and purge the corruption of the state.

However, he died in 1183 and was succeeded by Yi Ŭi-min, who came from a &quot;nobi&quot; (slave) background. During this period, despite nearly three centuries of Goryeo rule, loyalty to the old Silla kingdom and Silla traditions remained latent in the Kyŏngju area. There were multiple rebellions by the Silla restoration movement to overthrow Goryeo&#x27;s rule over the Sillan people. Yi&#x27;s unrestrained corruption and cruelty led to a coup by general Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn, who assassinated Yi Ui-min and took supreme power in 1197. For the next 61 years, the Ch&#x27;oe house ruled as military dictators, maintaining the Kings as puppet monarchs; Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn was succeeded in turn by his son Ch&#x27;oe U, his grandson Ch&#x27;oe Hang and his great-grandson Ch&#x27;oe Ŭi.

When he took control, Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn forced Myeongjong off the throne and replaced him with King Sinjong. What was different from former military leaders was the active involvement of scholars in Ch&#x27;oe&#x27;s control, notably Prime Minister Yi Kyu-bo who was a Confucian scholar-official.

After Sinjong died, Ch&#x27;oe forced his son to the throne as Huijong. After 7 years, Huijong led a revolt but failed. Then, Ch&#x27;oe found the pliable King Gojong instead.

Although the House of Ch&#x27;oe established strong private individuals loyal to it, continuous invasion by the Mongols ravaged the whole land, resulting in a weakened defense ability, and also the power of the military regime waned.

====Mongol invasions and Yuan domination====

Fleeing from the Mongols, in 1216 the Khitans invaded Goryeo and defeated the Korean armies multiple times, even reaching the gates of the capital and raiding deep into the south, but were defeated by Korean General Kim Ch&#x27;wi-ryŏ () who pushed them back north to Pyongan, where the remaining Khitans were finished off by allied Mongol-Goryeo forces in 1219.

Tension continued through the 12th century and into the 13th century, when the Mongol invasions started. After nearly 30 years of warfare, Goryeo swore allegiance to the Mongols, with the direct dynastic rule of Goryeo monarchy.

In 1231, Mongols under Ögedei Khan invaded Goryeo following the aftermath of joint Goryeo-Mongol forces against the Khitans in 1219. The royal court moved to Ganghwado in the Bay of Gyeonggi in 1232. The military ruler of the time, Ch&#x27;oe U, insisted on fighting back. Goryeo resisted for about 30 years but finally sued for peace in 1259.

Meanwhile, the Mongols began a campaign from 1231 to 1259 that ravaged parts of Gyeongsang and Jeolla. There were six major campaigns: 1231, 1232, 1235, 1238, 1247, 1253; between 1253 and 1258, the Mongols under Möngke Khan&#x27;s general Jalairtai Qorchi launched four devastating invasions against Korea at tremendous cost to civilian lives throughout the Korean peninsula.

Civilian resistance was strong, and the Imperial Court at Ganghwa attempted to strengthen its fortress. Korea won several victories but the Korean military could not withstand the waves of invasions. The repeated Mongol invasions caused havoc, loss of human lives and famine in Korea. In 1236, Gojong ordered the recreation of the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot;, which was destroyed during the 1232 invasion. This collection of Buddhist scriptures took 15 years to carve on some 81,000 wooden blocks, and is preserved to this day.

In March 1258, the dictator Ch&#x27;oe Ŭi was assassinated by Kim Chun. Thus, dictatorship by his military group was ended, and the scholars who had insisted on peace with Mongolia gained power. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after decades of fighting, Goryeo sent Crown Prince Wonjong to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to the Mongols; Kublai Khan accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince. Khubilai, who became khan of the Mongols and emperor of China in 1260, did not impose direct rule over most of Goryeo. Goryeo Korea, in contrast to Song China, was treated more like an Inner Asian power. The dynasty was allowed to survive, and intermarriage with Mongols was encouraged, even with the Mongol imperial family, while the marriage between Chinese and Mongols was strictly forbidden when the Song dynasty was ended. Some military officials who refused to surrender formed the Sambyeolcho Rebellion and resisted in the islands off the southern shore of the Korean Peninsula.

===Late period===

After 1270 Goryeo became a semi-autonomous client state of the Yuan dynasty. The Mongols and the Kingdom of Goryeo tied with marriages and Goryeo became &quot;khuda&quot; (marriage alliance) vassal of the Yuan dynasty for about 80 years and monarchs of Goryeo were mainly imperial sons in-law (&quot;khuregen&quot;). The two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses, and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty, Empress Gi, was a daughter of a Goryeo lower-ranked official; Empress Gi was sent to Yuan as one of the many &quot;kongnyŏ&quot; (貢女; lit. &#x27;tribute women&#x27;, who were in effects slaves sent over as a sign of Goryeo submission to the Mongols) and became empress in 1365. Empress Gi had great political influence both the Yuan and the Goryeo court, and even manage to significantly increase the status and influence of her family members, including her father who was formally made into a king in the Yuan and her brother Gi Cheol who at some point manage to get more authority than the Goryeo king. In 1356, King Gongmin purged the family of Empress Gi. The kings of Goryeo held an important status like other important families of Mardin, the Uyghurs and Mongols (Oirats, Khongirad, and Ikeres). It is claimed that one of Goryeo monarchs was the most beloved grandson of Kublai Khan.

The Goryeo dynasty survived under the Yuan until King Gongmin began to push the Mongolian garrisons of the Yuan back in the 1350s. By 1356 Goryeo regained its lost northern territories.

====Last reform====

When King Gongmin ascended to the throne, Goryeo was under the influence of the Mongol Yuan China. He was forced to spend many years at the Yuan court, being sent there in 1341 as a virtual prisoner before becoming king. He married the Mongol princess Princess Noguk (also known as Queen Indeok). But in the mid-14th century the Yuan was beginning to crumble, soon to be replaced by the Ming dynasty in 1368. King Gongmin began efforts to reform the Goryeo government and remove Mongolian influences.

His first act was to remove all pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officers from their positions. Mongols had annexed the northern provinces of Goryeo after the invasions and incorporated them into their empire as the Ssangseong and Dongnyeong Prefectures. The Goryeo army retook these provinces partly thanks to defection from Yi Cha-ch&#x27;un, a minor Korean official in service of Mongols in Ssangseong, and his son Yi Sŏng-gye. In addition, Generals Yi Sŏng-gye and Chi Yong-su () led a campaign into Liaoyang.

After the death of Gongmin&#x27;s wife Noguk in 1365, he fell into depression. In the end, he became indifferent to politics and entrusted that great task to the Buddhist monk Sin Ton. But after six years, Sin Ton lost his position. In 1374, Gongmin was killed by Hong Ryun (), Ch&#x27;oe Man-saeng (), and others.

After his death, a high official Yi In-im assumed the helm of the government and enthroned eleven-year-old, King U, the son of King Gongmin.

During this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered Liaoyang in 1356, repulsed two large invasions by the Red Turbans in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng defeated an invading Mongol tumen in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its attention to the Wokou menace and used naval artillery created by Ch&#x27;oe Mu-sŏn to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships.

====Fall====
In 1388, King U (son of King Gongmin and a concubine) and general Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng planned a campaign to invade now Liaoning of China. King U put the general Yi Sŏng-gye (later Taejo) in charge, but he stopped at the border and rebelled.

Goryeo fell to General Yi Sŏng-gye who put to death the last three Goryeo kings, usurped the throne and established in 1392 the Joseon dynasty.

==Government==

Goryeo positioned itself at the center of its own &quot;world&quot; () called &quot;Haedong&quot;. &quot;Haedong&quot;, meaning &quot;East of the Sea&quot;, was a distinct and independent world that encompassed the historical domain of the &quot;Samhan&quot;, another name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The rulers of Goryeo, or &quot;Haedong&quot;, used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven. Imperial titles were used since the founding of Goryeo, and the last king of Silla addressed Wang Geon as the Son of Heaven when he capitulated. Posthumously, temple names with the imperial characters of &quot;progenitor&quot; () and &quot;ancestor&quot; () were used. Imperial designations and terminology were widely used, such as &quot;empress&quot;, &quot;imperial crown prince&quot;, &quot;imperial edict&quot;, and &quot;imperial palace&quot;.

The rulers of Goryeo donned imperial yellow clothing, made sacrifices to Heaven, and invested sons as kings. Goryeo used the Three Departments and Six Ministries imperial system of the Tang dynasty and had its own &quot;microtributary system&quot; that included Jurchen tribes outside its borders. The military of Goryeo was organized into 5 armies, like an empire, as opposed to 3, like a kingdom. Goryeo maintained multiple capitals: the main capital &quot;Gaegyeong&quot; (also called &quot;Hwangdo&quot; or &quot;Imperial Capital&quot;) in modern-day Kaesong, the &quot;Western Capital&quot; in modern-day Pyongyang, the &quot;Eastern Capital&quot; in modern-day Gyeongju, and the &quot;Southern Capital&quot; in modern-day Seoul. The main capital and main palace were designed and intended to be an imperial capital and imperial palace. The secondary capitals represented the capitals of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

The Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties were all well informed of, and tolerated, Goryeo&#x27;s imperial claims and practices. According to Henry Em, &quot;[a]t times Song reception rituals for Koryŏ envoys and Koryŏ reception rituals for imperial envoys from Song, Liao, and Jin suggested equal rather than hierarchical relations&quot;. In 1270, Goryeo capitulated to the Mongols and became a semi-autonomous &quot;son-in-law state&quot; () of the Yuan dynasty, bringing an end to its imperial system. The Yuan dynasty demoted the imperial titles of Goryeo and added &quot;chung&quot; (), meaning &quot;loyalty&quot;, to the temple names of Goryeo kings, beginning with Chungnyeol. This continued until the mid-14th century, when Gongmin declared independence.

===Military===

The military comprises both the army and the navy. Military leaders were appointed by Kings/Emperors.

===Regional administration===
==Foreign relations==
Goryeo affiliated itself with the successive short-lived Five Dynasties beginning with the Shatuo Later Tang dynasty in 933, and Taejo was acknowledged as the legitimate successor to Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.

In 962, Goryeo entered relations with the nascent Song dynasty. Song did not have real suzerainty over Goryeo, and Goryeo sent tribute mainly for the sake of trade. Later, Goryeo entered nominal tributary relations with the Khitan Liao dynasty then the Jurchen Jin dynasty while maintaining trade and unofficial relations with the Song dynasty. The Korean missions to China were intended to seek knowledge on fields such as Confucianism, Buddhism, history, and other subjects, conduct diplomacy, and trade. Missions to the Song in 976, 986, and after 1105 stayed there for study. Goryeo requested texts from the Song in 991, 993, 1019, 1021, 1073, 1074, 1092, and after 1105. They also brought texts to China. Diplomatic missions were conducted to announce birthdays, deaths, and successions. Trade, in particular, was an important aspect of all the missions. Annual tribute was expected to be exchanged for proper payment. In 1093, Su Shi suggested that Goryeo envoys should stick to trade in commercial products such as silk and hair instead of books. Sometimes missions were sent even though they would not be received to conduct trade.

The Five Dynasties, Song dynasty, and Jin dynasty pretended that Goryeo was a tributary vassal. However this was a fiction. The Five Dynasties and the Song did not share a border with Goryeo and had no way to assert supremacy over it. The Liao invasions of Goryeo from 993 to 1020 were successfully repelled. The Jin made no similar effort against Goryeo. Goryeo was not a vassal to these powers and successfully stood up to Liao and Jin through clever diplomacy and minimal appeasement. Goryeo was autonomous until Mongol rule. Sinologist Hans Bielenstein described the nature of Goryeo&#x27;s nominal tributary relations with the dynasties in China:

 In 1270, Goryeo capitulated to the Yuan dynasty, which exercised a powerful influence over Goryeo affairs and the succession of Goryeo kings. Goryeo remained under the Yuan dynasty until the mid-14th century.

Goryeo used multiple calendars. In 938, it used the Later Jin calendar, in 948 Later Han, in 952 Later Zhou, in 963 Song, in 994 Liao, in 1016 Song, and in 1022 Liao. In 1136, Goryeo was presented with a Jin calendar. It is possible that Goryeo used different calendars simultaneously depending on which country they dealt with.

==Society==
===Nobility===

At the time of Goryeo, Korean nobility was divided into 6 classes.
* Gukgong (), duke of a nation
* Gungong (), duke of a county
* Hyeonhu (), marquis of a town
* Hyeonbaek (), count of a town
* Gaegukja () or hyeonja (), viscount of a town
* Hyeonnam (), baron of a town

Also the title taeja () was given to sons of monarch. In most other east Asian countries this title meant crown prince. Taeja was similar to daegun () or gun () of the Joseon Dynasty.

===Religion===

====Buddhism====


Buddhism in medieval Korea evolved in ways which rallied support for the state.

Initially, the new Seon schools were regarded by the established doctrinal schools as radical and dangerous upstarts. Thus, the early founders of the various &quot;nine mountain&quot; monasteries met with considerable resistance, repressed by the long influence in court of the Gyo schools. The struggles which ensued continued for most of the Goryeo period, but gradually the Seon argument for the possession of the true transmission of enlightenment would gain the upper hand. The position that was generally adopted in the later Seon schools, due in large part to the efforts of Jinul, did not claim clear superiority of Seon meditational methods, but rather declared the intrinsic unity and similarities of the Seon and Gyo viewpoints. Although all these schools are mentioned in historical records, toward the end of the dynasty, Seon became dominant in its effect on the government and society, and the production of noteworthy scholars and adepts. During the Goryeo period, Seon thoroughly became a &quot;religion of the state,&quot; receiving extensive support and privileges through connections with the ruling family and powerful members of the court. Although Buddhist predominated, taoism was practiced in some temples, as was shamanism.

Although most of the scholastic schools waned in activity and influence during this period of the growth of Seon, the &quot;Hwaeom&quot; school continued to be a lively source of scholarship well into the Goryeo, much of it continuing the legacy of Uisang and Wonhyo. In particular the work of Gyunyeo (均如; 923–973) prepared for the reconciliation of Hwaeom and Seon, with Hwaeom&#x27;s accommodating attitude toward the latter. Gyunyeo&#x27;s works are an important source for modern scholarship in identifying the distinctive nature of Korean Hwaeom.

Another important advocate of Seon/Gyo unity was Uicheon. Like most other early Goryeo monks, he began his studies in Buddhism with the Hwaeom school. He later traveled to China, and upon his return, actively promulgated the Cheontae (天台宗, or Tiantai in Chinese) teachings, which became recognized as another Seon school. This period thus came to be described as &quot;five doctrinal and two meditational schools&quot; (). Uicheon himself, however, alienated too many Seon adherents, and he died at a relatively young age without seeing a Seon-Gyo unity accomplished.

The most important figure of Seon in the Goryeo was Jinul (知訥; 1158–1210). In his time, the sangha was in a crisis of external appearance and internal issues of doctrine. Buddhism had gradually become infected by secular tendencies and involvements, such as fortune-telling and the offering of prayers and rituals for success in secular endeavors. This kind of corruption resulted in the profusion of increasingly larger numbers of monks and nuns with questionable motivations. Therefore, the correction, revival, and improvement of the quality of Buddhism were prominent issues for Buddhist leaders of the period.

Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon, which he called the &quot;samādhi and prajñā society&quot;, whose goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. He eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of the Seonggwangsa monastery at Mt. Jogye (曹溪山). Jinul&#x27;s works are characterized by a thorough analysis and reformulation of the methodologies of Seon study and practice. One major issue that had long fermented in Chinese &quot;Seon&quot;, and which received special focus from Jinul, was the relationship between &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;sudden&quot; methods in practice and enlightenment. Drawing upon various Chinese treatments of this topic, most importantly those by Zongmi (780–841) and Dahui (大慧; 1089–1163), Jinul created a &quot;sudden enlightenment followed by gradual practice&quot; dictum, which he outlined in a few relatively concise and accessible texts. From Dahui, Jinul also incorporated the &quot;gwanhwa&quot; (觀話) method into his practice. This form of meditation is the main method taught in Korean Seon today. Jinul&#x27;s philosophical resolution of the Seon-Gyo conflict brought a deep and lasting effect on Korean Buddhism.
The general trend of Buddhism in the latter half of the Goryeo was a decline due to corruption, and the rise of strong anti-Buddhist political and philosophical sentiment. However, this period of relative decadence would nevertheless produce some of Korea&#x27;s most renowned Seon masters. Three important monks of this period who figured prominently in charting the future course of Korean Seon were contemporaries and friends: Gyeonghan Baeg&#x27;un (景閑白雲; 1298–1374), Taego Bou (太古普愚; 1301–1382) and Naong Hyegeun (懶翁慧勤; 1320–1376). All three went to Yuan China to learn the &quot;Linji&quot; (臨濟 or &quot;Imje&quot; in Korean) &quot;gwanhwa&quot; teaching that had been popularized by Jinul. All three returned, and established the sharp, confrontational methods of the Imje school in their own teaching. Each of the three was also said to have had hundreds of disciples, such that this new infusion into Korean Seon brought about considerable effect. Despite the Imje influence, which was generally considered to be anti-scholarly in nature, Gyeonghan and Naong, under the influence of Jinul and the traditional &quot;Tongbulgyo&quot; tendency, showed an unusual interest in scriptural study, as well as a strong understanding of confucianism and taoism, due to the increasing influence of Chinese philosophy as the foundation of official education. From this time, a marked tendency for Korean Buddhist monks to be &quot;three teachings&quot; exponents appeared.

A significant historical event of the Goryeo period is the production of the first woodblock edition of the Tripitaka, called the Tripitaka Koreana. Two editions were made, the first one completed from 1210 to 1231, and the second one from 1214 to 1259. The first edition was destroyed in a fire, during an attack by Mongol invaders in 1232, but the second edition is still in existence at Haeinsa in Gyeongsang province. This edition of the Tripitaka was of high quality, and served as the standard version of the Tripitaka in East Asia for almost 700 years.

====Confucianism====

Gwangjong created the national civil service examinations. Seongjong was a key figure in establishing confucianism. He founded Gukjagam, the highest educational institution of the Goryeo dynasty. This was facilitated by the establishment in 1398 of the Sungkyunkwan – an academy with a Confucian curriculum – and the building of an altar at the palace, where the king would worship his ancestors.

====Islam====
According to Goryeosa, Muslims arrived in the peninsula in the year 1024 in the Goryeo kingdom, a group of some 100 Muslims, including Hasan Raza, came in September of the 15th year of Hyeonjong of Goryeo and another group of 100 Muslim merchants came the following year.

Trading relations between the Islamic world and the Korean peninsula continued with the succeeding Goryeo kingdom through to the 15th century. As a result, a number of Muslim traders from the Near East and Central Asia settled down in Korea and established families there. Some Muslim Hui people from China also appear to have lived in the Goryeo kingdom.

With the Mongol armies came the so-called &quot;Saengmokin&quot; (Semu), or &quot;colored-eye people&quot;, this group consisted of Muslims from Central Asia. In the Mongol social order, the &quot;Saengmokin&quot; occupied a position just below the Mongols themselves, and exerted a great deal of influence within the Yuan dynasty.

It was during this period satirical poems were composed and one of them was the &quot;Sanghwajeom&quot;, the &quot;Colored-eye people bakery&quot;, the song tells the tale of a Korean woman who goes to a Muslim bakery to buy some dumplings.

Small-scale contact with predominantly Muslim peoples continued on and off. During the late Goryeo period, there were mosques in the capital Kaesong, called &quot;Ye-Kung&quot;, whose literary meaning is a &quot;ceremonial hall&quot;.

One of those Central Asian immigrants to Korea originally came to Korea as an aide to a Mongol princess who had been sent to marry King Chungnyeol of Goryeo. Goryeo documents say that his original name was &quot;Samga&quot; but, after he decided to make Korea his permanent home, the king bestowed on him the Korean name of Jang Sun-nyong. Jang married a Korean and became the founding ancestor of the Deoksu Jang clan. His clan produced many high officials and respected Confucian scholars over the centuries. Twenty-five generations later, around 30,000 Koreans look back to Jang Sunnyong as the grandfather of their clan: the Jang clan, with its seat at Toksu village.

The same is true of the descendants of another Central Asian who settled down in Korea. A Central Asian named Seol Son fled to Korea when the Red Turban Rebellion erupted near the end of the Mongol&#x27;s Yuan dynasty. He, too, married a Korean, originating a lineage called the Gyeongju Seol that claims at least 2,000 members in Korea.

=====Soju=====
Soju was first distilled around the 13th century, during the Mongol invasions of Korea. The Mongols had acquired the technique of distilling &quot;Arak&quot; from the Muslim world during their invasion of Central Asia and the Middle East around 1256, it was subsequently introduced to Koreans and distilleries were set up around the city of Kaesong. Indeed, in the area surrounding Kaesong, Soju is known as &quot;Arak-ju&quot; (). Under the reign of King Chungnyeol, soju quickly became a popular drink, while the stationed region of Mongolian troops came to produce high-quality soju, for instance in Andong.

==Culture==

===Literature===
The official histories of early Korea such as the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, written in Classical Chinese, remain some of the most important historical works in Korean historiography.

Various writing systems that utilized the phonetic value of Hanja characters were used to transcribe Old Korean, Idu being the most notable of them as it was used for administrative purposes and recordkeeping. This script originates in Goguryeo and was designed for a very specific sort of syntax that made use of postpositional particles, such as the Old Korean accusative marker *-ul/*-ur ending represented by 尸 &#x27;corpse&#x27; and 乙 &#x27;2nd Heavenly stem&#x27;. It was eventually phased out once it became too impractical upon the invention of Hangeul.

Gugyeol was used to gloss Middle Chinese poems so Koreans could read them, with two versions having been used limited by their timeframes. Interpretative Gugyeol was predominant up to the 12th century and was supposed to tell the reader the meaning of the text and was meant to be read in Old Korean. The later form of Gugyeol appearing in the 13th century was meant to make it possible to spell out the Middle Chinese poem for the average reader, who would not know how Chinese sounded, by inferring the Koreanized pronunciation on it instead.

Hyangga poetry, which made use of Hyangchal, another writing system used to write Old Korean, was contrary to common belief still widespread during Goryeo and a number of the surviving poems that were attributed to the Unified Silla period have been revealed to have been created during Goryeo. The Cheoyongga is one of these examples, a story about a man and his unfaithful wife.

The Goryeo aristocracy emphasized engaging with high literature and court poetry in Classical Chinese. Learning Chinese poetry as well as composing poetry in Classical Chinese was a popular leisure activity for the aristocracy.

====Tripitaka Koreana====

Tripitaka Koreana () is a Korean collection of the &quot;Tripitaka&quot; of approximately 80,000 pages. The wooden blocks that were used to print it are stored in Haeinsa temple in South Gyeongsang Province. The second version was made in 1251 by Gojong in an attempt invoke the power of Buddhism to fend off the Mongol invasion. The wooden blocks are kept clean by leaving them to dry outside every year. The Tripiṭaka Koreana was designated a National Treasure of South Korea in 1962, and inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2007.

===Art===
====Goryeo celadon====

The ceramics of Goryeo are considered by some to be the finest small-scale works of ceramics in Korean history. Key-fret, foliate designs, geometric or scrolling flowerhead bands, elliptical panels, stylized fish and insects, and the use of incised designs began at this time. Glazes were usually various shades of celadon, with browned glazes to almost black glazes being used for stoneware and storage. Celadon glazes could be rendered almost transparent to show black and white inlays.

While the forms generally seen are broad-shouldered bottles, larger low bowls or shallow smaller bowls, highly decorated celadon cosmetic boxes, and small slip-inlaid cups, the Buddhist potteries also produced melon-shaped vases, chrysanthemum cups often of spectacularly architectural design on stands with lotus motifs and lotus flower heads. In-curving rimmed alms bowls have also been discovered similar to Korean metalware. Wine cups often had a tall foot which rested on dish-shaped stands.

====Lacquerware with mother of pearl inlay====
During the Goryeo period, lacquerware with mother-of-pearl inlay reached a high point of technical and aesthetic achievement and was widely used by members of the aristocracy for Buddhist ritual implements and vessels, as well as horse saddles and royal carriages. Inlaid lacquers combine texture, color, and shape to produce a dazzling effect in both large and small objects. Although Korean lacquerware of the Goryeo period was highly prized throughout East Asia, fewer than fifteen examples are known to have survived, one of which is this exquisite box in the Museum&#x27;s collection. This paucity of material is largely attributable to the fragility of lacquer objects and, to a certain extent, to wars and raids by foreign powers, notably those launched from Japan by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536–1598) in the late sixteenth century.

====Construction techniques====
These ceramics are of a hard porcellaneous body with porcelain stone as one of the key ingredients; however, it is not to be confused with porcelain. The body is low clay, quartz rich, high potassia and virtually identical in composition to the Chinese Yueh ceramics which scholars hypothesize occasioned the first production of celadon in Korea. The glaze is an ash glaze with iron colourant, fired in a reduction atmosphere in a modified Chinese-style &#x27;dragon&#x27; kiln. The distinctive blue-grey-green of Korean celadon is caused by the iron content of the glaze with a minimum of titanium contaminant, which modifies the color to a greener cast, as can be seen in Chinese Yueh wares. However, the Goryeo potters took the glaze in a different direction than their Chinese forebears; instead of relying solely on underglaze incised designs, they eventually developed the &quot;sanggam&quot; technique of inlaying black (magnetite) and white (quartz) which created bold contrast with the glaze. Scholars also theorize that this developed in part to an inlay tradition in Korean metalworks and lacquer, and also to the dissatisfaction with the nearly invisible effect of incising when done under a thick celadon glaze.

==== Modern celadon ====
A revival of Goryeo celadon pottery began in the early 20th century. Playing a leading role in its revival was Yu Geun-hyeong, a Living National Treasure whose work was documented in the 1979 short film, Koryo Celadon.

==Technology==

It is generally accepted that the world&#x27;s first metal movable type was invented in Goryeo during the 13th century by Ch&#x27;oe Yun-ŭi. The first metal movable type book was the Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun that was printed in 1234. Technology in Korea took a big step in Goryeo and strong relation with the Song dynasty contributed to this. In the dynasty, Korean ceramics and paper, which come down to now, started to be manufactured.

Cotton was introduced in the 1370s.

<text>Nathaniel Branden (born Nathan Blumenthal; April 9, 1930 – December 3, 2014) was a Canadian–American psychotherapist and writer known for his work in the psychology of self-esteem. A former associate and romantic partner of Ayn Rand, Branden also played a prominent role in the 1960s in promoting Rand&#x27;s philosophy, Objectivism. Rand and Branden split acrimoniously in 1968, after which Branden focused on developing his own psychological theories and modes of therapy.

==Early life and education==
Nathaniel Branden was born Nathan Blumenthal in Brampton, Ontario to Dinah (née Copp) and Joseph Blumenthal, who were Jewish immigrants from Russia. He grew up alongside three sisters, Florence, Elayne, and Reva. A gifted student, he became impatient with his studies during his first year of high school and skipped school often in favor of the library. After getting failing grades as a result, he convinced his mother to send him to a special accelerated high school for adults, and subsequently did well in that environment.

After graduating from high school, Branden went on to earn his BA in psychology from the University of California Los Angeles, an MA from New York University, and in 1973, a Ph.D. in psychology from the California Graduate Institute (CGI), then an unaccredited, state-approved school whose graduates may be licensed by the state to practice psychology. (Graduates of unaccredited state-approved schools such as CGI are limited to associate membership in the American Psychological Association.)

==Objectivist movement==
In 1950, after he had read &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and exchanged letters and phone calls with Ayn Rand, Branden and his then-girlfriend Barbara Weidman visited Rand and her husband Frank O&#x27;Connor at their Los Angeles home. The four became close friends, with Branden and Rand in particular sharing a vivid interest in philosophical exploration and development. After the publication of Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, Branden sensed an interest on the part of Rand&#x27;s readers in further philosophic education. In 1958 he created the Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later renamed the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI). The organization disseminated Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism by offering live and taped lecture courses by a variety of Objectivist intellectuals, including Rand, Branden, and Alan Greenspan, whom Branden had brought into Rand&#x27;s fold. During this time, Branden also contributed articles to Rand&#x27;s newsletters on subjects ranging from economics to politics to psychology. Branden&#x27;s work at NBI included translating the principles expressed by Rand in her fiction and non-fiction writing into a systematized construct that became known as Objectivism.

NBI expanded considerably over the course of its existence, ultimately offering courses in 80 cities and establishing an office in the Empire State Building. In 1968, Rand publicly broke with Branden and published an article denouncing him and accusing him of a variety of offenses, such as philosophic irrationality and unresolved psychological problems. In response, Branden sent out a letter to the NBI mailing list denying Rand&#x27;s accusations and suggesting that the actual cause of Rand&#x27;s denunciation of him was his unwillingness to engage in a romantic relationship with her. (Branden later explained in his memoir that he and Rand had in fact been romantically intimate for a period of time in the late 1950s; see personal life.)

After the break, Branden went on to publish &quot;The Psychology of Self-Esteem&quot; (many chapters of which he had published originally in Rand&#x27;s newsletter), and then to develop his theory and mode of therapy more independently of Rand&#x27;s influence. Though he remained supportive of the broad essentials of Rand&#x27;s philosophy, he eventually offered criticisms of aspects of her work, naming as problems a tendency to encourage emotional repression and moralizing, a failure to understand psychology beyond its cognitive aspects, and a failure to appreciate adequately the importance of kindness in human relationships. He also apologized in an interview to &quot;every student of Objectivism&quot; for &quot;perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique&quot; and for &quot;contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement.&quot;

==Psychology of self-esteem==
Branden argued that self-esteem is a human psychological need and that to the extent this need remains unmet, pathology (defensiveness, anxiety, depression, difficulty in relationships, etc.) tends to result. He defined self-esteem formally as &quot;the disposition to experience oneself as competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness&quot;, and proposed that, while others (parents, teachers, friends) can nurture and support self-esteem in an individual, self-esteem also relies upon various internally generated practices. These consisted, in Branden&#x27;s framework, of six &quot;pillars&quot; of self-esteem:
* Living consciously: the practice of being aware of what one is doing while one is doing it, i.e., the practice of mindfulness.
* Self-acceptance: the practice of owning truths regarding one&#x27;s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors; of being kind toward oneself with respect to them; and of being &quot;for&quot; oneself in a basic sense.
* Self-responsibility: the practice of owning one&#x27;s authorship of one&#x27;s actions and of owning one&#x27;s capacity to be the cause of the effects one desires.
* Self-assertiveness: the practice of treating one&#x27;s needs and interests with respect and of expressing them in appropriate ways.
* Living purposefully: the practice of formulating goals and of formulating and implementing action plans to achieve them.
* Personal integrity: the practice of maintaining alignment between one&#x27;s behaviors and convictions.

In his book &quot;Taking Responsibility&quot; Branden defended voluntarism as a moral concept and libertarianism as a political one; likewise, individualism and personal autonomy are seen as essential to human freedom.

Branden distinguished his approach to self-esteem from that of many others by his inclusion of both confidence and worth in his definition of self-esteem, and by his emphasis on the importance of internally generated practices for the improvement and maintenance of self-esteem. For this reason, he at times expressed lack of enthusiasm about the teachings of the &quot;self-esteem movement&quot;, which he is sometimes credited with having spawned (he was sometimes referred to as &quot;the father of the self-esteem movement&quot;).

==Mode of therapy==
While Branden began his practice of therapy as, primarily, a cognitivist, starting in the 1970s he rapidly shifted toward a decidedly technically eclectic stance, utilizing techniques from gestalt therapy, psychodrama, neo-Reichian breathwork, Ericksonian hypnosis, as well as original techniques such as his sentence completion method, which he favored. In a piece from 1973, he characterized his mode of therapy as consisting of four aspects: education, emotional unblocking, stimulation of insight, and encouragement of behavior change. In contrast to the exclusively experiential or exclusively cognitive (insight-oriented) methods of the day, Branden saw his mode of therapy as distinguished in part by &quot;the integration of the emotional and the cognitive, the practice of constantly moving back and forth between the experiential and the conceptual.&quot;

Sentence completion, a method that figured prominently in Branden&#x27;s mode of therapy, is an example of this dual focus. In its most common variation, it consists of a therapist giving a client an incomplete sentence—a sentence stem—and having the client repeat the sentence stem over and over, each time adding a new ending, going quickly, without thinking or censoring, and inventing endings when stuck. In this way, a therapist can facilitate the generation of awareness and insight (for example, with a stem such as, &quot;If my fear could speak, it might say—&quot;), and shifts in cognitive-motivational structure (for example, with a stem such as, &quot;If I were to be kinder to myself when I&#x27;m afraid—&quot;). By improvising a succession of such stems, many based on endings generated by a previous stem, a therapist can, according to Branden, lead a client on a sometimes dramatically emotional journey of self exploration and self-discovery.

Eventually, Branden integrated techniques from the field of energy psychology, such as Thought Field Therapy and Seemorg Matrix work, into his practice, viewing psychological trauma (which such techniques target) as a significant barrier to growth and development. He has described human problems as occurring both &quot;above the line&quot;—that is, in the realm of cognition and volitional behavior—and &quot;below the line&quot;—that is, in the realm of unconscious trauma stored in the body.

==Personal life==
Branden married Barbara Weidman in 1953, with Rand and Rand&#x27;s husband Frank O&#x27;Connor in attendance. Branden would later state the marriage was unwise, and troubled from the beginning. In the context of these troubles, and Rand&#x27;s reported frustrations in her own marriage, Branden and Rand—who had a passionate philosophic bond—developed amorous feelings for each other and began a love affair in 1954. The affair lasted until the publication of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; in 1957, after which, according to Branden, Rand became depressed, and the affair, practically speaking, ended.

Branden reported that in this period Rand began seeking a resumption of their affair; his own marriage, meanwhile, was deteriorating, although he and Barbara were becoming closer as friends. Branden then met and fell in love with a young model, Patrecia Scott (née Gullison). The two began a secret affair in 1964. In mid-1965, Nathaniel told Barbara of the affair and the two separated (and subsequently divorced). Despite Rand&#x27;s romantic involvement with Nathaniel, her close intellectual collaboration with him, and her strong public endorsements of him, both Brandens kept Nathaniel&#x27;s affair with Patrecia secret from Rand, fearing her reaction. In 1968, four years into the affair, Barbara Branden informed Rand of it. In response, Rand morally condemned the Brandens and dissociated herself from them in an article for her journal, &quot;The Objectivist,&quot; which, without revealing the existence of her romantic involvement with Branden, accused him of &quot;deliberate deception&quot; and financial misdealings in their business partnership.

Branden at this point moved to California with Patrecia; the two married in November 1969. In March 1977, Patrecia drowned accidentally, having fallen into a pool after presumably suffering a mild epileptic seizure. Branden subsequently married businesswoman (and later psychotherapist) Estelle Devers in December 1978. The two later divorced, though they remained friends. Branden subsequently married Leigh Horton.

Branden retained a relationship—sometimes friendly, sometimes acrimonious—with his first wife, Barbara, who wrote a successful biography, &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot;, which presented her version of Branden&#x27;s relationship with Rand and the bitter breakup. The book was made into a motion picture in 1999 titled &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot;, starring Helen Mirren as Rand and Eric Stoltz as Branden.

Branden died on December 3, 2014, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Bertrand Russell Berns (November 8, 1929 – December 30, 1967), also known as Bert Russell and (occasionally) Russell Byrd, was an American songwriter and record producer of the 1960s. His songwriting credits include &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot;, &quot;Cry to Me&quot; and &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;, and his productions include &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; and &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in the Bronx, New York City, Berns contracted rheumatic fever as a child, an illness that damaged his heart and would mark the rest of his life, resulting in his early death. Turning to music, he found enjoyment in the sounds of his African American and Latino neighbors. As a young man, Berns danced in mambo nightclubs, and made his way to Havana before the Cuban Revolution.

== Music career ==
=== Beginnings (1960–1963) ===
Shortly after his return from Cuba, Berns began a seven-year run from an obscure Brill Building songwriter to owner of his own record labels. He signed as a $50/week () songwriter with Robert Mellin Music at 1650 Broadway in 1960. His first hit record was &quot;A Little Bit of Soap&quot;, performed by the Jarmels on Laurie Records in 1961. Berns himself had a short-lived career as a recording artist, and in 1961, under the name &quot;Russell Byrd&quot;, Berns scored his only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 appearance with his own composition, &quot;You&#x27;d Better Come Home&quot;, which peaked at Number 50. That song would later be recorded by the Isley Brothers, and featured as the B-side of their 1962 single &quot;Twistin&#x27; With Linda&quot;. Also in 1962, the Isley Brothers recorded &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; on Wand Records, written by Berns and Phil Medley. Berns also hit the charts in late 1962 with the Exciters&#x27; &quot;Tell Him&quot; on United Artists, and with Solomon Burke&#x27;s &quot;Cry to Me&quot; on Atlantic Records. As an independent producer working with myriad record labels, Berns also made important records with Garnet Mimms (&quot;Cry Baby&quot;) and Gene Pitney (&quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have a Dime (to Play the Jukebox)&quot;).

=== Atlantic Records (1963–1965) ===
Berns&#x27;s early work with Solomon Burke brought him to the attention of Atlantic label chiefs Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler. In 1963, Berns replaced Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as staff producer at Atlantic, where he wrote and produced hits for Solomon Burke (&quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot;), the Drifters (&quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;), Barbara Lewis (&quot;Baby I&#x27;m Yours&quot; and &quot;Make Me Your Baby&quot;), Little Esther Phillips (&quot;Hello Walls,&quot; written by Willie Nelson), Ben E. King, Wilson Pickett and LaVern Baker.

=== British Invasion (1964–1965) ===
With many of Berns&#x27;s songs being recorded by British Invasion bands such as the Beatles (&quot;Twist and Shout&quot;), the Rolling Stones (&quot;Cry to Me&quot;) and the Animals (&quot;Baby Let Me Take You Home&quot;), Berns became the first American record producer to travel across the Atlantic to work in London. He went to England three times between 1964 and 1965, where he produced a number of British Decca songs such as &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go,&quot; a traditional blues song recorded by Them, and &quot;Here Comes the Night,&quot; recorded by Lulu and Them.

=== BANG Records (1965–1967) ===
Berns formed his own record label, BANG Records, in 1965. BANG was home to such artists as the McCoys (&quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot;), the Strangeloves (&quot;I Want Candy&quot;), Them&#x27;s ex-lead singer Van Morrison (&quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;), and, most notably, Neil Diamond (&quot;Solitary Man&quot; and &quot;Cherry Cherry,&quot; both produced by Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich).

=== Shout Records (1966–1967) ===
With BANG Records releasing predominantly rock and roll, Berns formed Shout Records in 1966 as an outlet for his greatest passions of R&amp;B and soul music, recording artists such Freddie Scott (&quot;Are You Lonely for Me Baby&quot;) and Erma Franklin (&quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;). &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, one of his last songs, was covered shortly thereafter by Big Brother and the Holding Company, which the then unknown Janis Joplin fronted, peaking at #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; the song also charted on both the Hot 100 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues Singles charts for Franklin&#x27;s version (in 1967), on the Hot 100 for a medley by Melissa Etheridge and Joss Stone (in 2005), as well as charting at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart for Faith Hill&#x27;s version (in 1994).

== Death and legacy ==
Berns, who had a history of cardiac trouble as a result of his heart being damaged from rheumatic fever contracted during childhood, died in his New York apartment of heart failure on December 30, 1967, aged 38. He was buried two days later, following a funeral service at Riverside Memorial Chapel on New York&#x27;s 180 West 76th Street in Manhattan. His widow Ilene outlived her husband by nearly 50 years; she died at the age of 73 on February 20, 2017.

The Led Zeppelin outtake &quot;Baby Come on Home&quot; (originally titled &quot;A Tribute to Bert Berns&quot;) was loosely based on a song Berns wrote for Hoagy Lands, and was recorded in Berns&#x27; honour.

&quot;Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm and Blues&quot; by Joel Selvin, a book on his life and career, was published in 2014.

A musical, &quot;Piece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story&quot; by Daniel Goldfarb, premiered off-Broadway in 2014 at the Pershing Square Signature Center.

A documentary film titled &quot;BANG! The Bert Berns Story&quot;, co-directed by Bert Berns&#x27; son Brett Berns and Bob Sarles, premiered at the 2016 SXSW Film Festival to great acclaim. The narration was written by Joel Selvin from his book &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; and it was narrated by Stevie Van Zandt.

== Awards and honors ==
Berns was inducted as a non-performer and given the Ahmet Ertegun Lifetime Achievement Award with the 2016 class to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<doc id="188444" wikidata="Q6790087" url="?curid=188444" title="Matthew Arnold School, Staines-upon-Thames">
<text>The Matthew Arnold School is a co-educational secondary school with academy status located in Staines-upon-Thames, Surrey, England. The school was opened by Lord Lucan on 24 May 1954 and educates pupils from the age of 11 (Year 7) to 16 (Year 11). It is named after the 19th-century poet Matthew Arnold, who lived in nearby Laleham.

==Admissions==
The Matthew Arnold School is on the outskirts of the east of Staines-upon-Thames, south of the A308, towards Ashford. It has transport links via buses 117 and 290, and via trains at Staines railway station. Matthew Arnold takes in many pupils from a variety of schools located around Staines-upon-Thames and surrounding areas, including Buckland Primary School, Laleham Church of England School, Riverbridge Primary School, Town Farm Primary School, Our Lady of Rosary, Stanwell Fields, Clarendon, Ashford Park, Echelford Primary School and many more.

==History ==

Aerial photographs taken on two occasions in 1933 illustrate the progress of construction of new housing in the immediate vicinity of the survey area. Photographs also show the cropmarks of a supposed Roman enclosure in the playing fields of the school. Subsequent aerial photographs, taken at regular intervals from the late 1940s to present also record cropmarks of the enclosure. The site was partially excavated in 1989-1990 and although the dating is inconclusive, it is suggested that the enclosures are of medieval date.

The Matthew Arnold School began before the Second World War as a hospital, and some pupils were admitted before hostilities started (the boys section). The School was completed after the war as two Secondary Modern Schools. There was no state Grammar School in Staines-upon-Thames. Boys and Girls who passed the 11+ went to Ashford County School (Mixed) or Hampton Grammar School (boys only). With comprehensivisation in the 1970s Matthew Arnold became a mixed comprehensive school. The school became an academy in 2012.

Construction was completed in January 2021 whereupon the old building was demolished and replaced by new facilities built by Wates Construction company with funding by the government’s Priority School Building Programme 2 (PSBP2), which aims to rebuild or replace the schools in the worst condition across the UK.

In September 2021 the school uniform was updated, and the school&#x27;s colours were changed from Green and Yellow to Black and Blue.

==Academic performance==
In January 2008 the school was awarded &quot;The Most Improved School in the Country&quot;.

In 2014 the school was placed in special measures following an Ofsted inspection report that rated the school as &#x27;inadequate&#x27;. As part of an improvement plan the school has joined the Bourne Education Trust, a Surrey-based multi-academy trust that includes Epsom and Ewell High School and Jubilee High School.

==Fictitious alumni==
Ali G, the fictional character created by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, called it &quot;Da Matthew Arnold Skool&quot;.

<doc id="188446" wikidata="Q1301181" url="?curid=188446" title="London and Birmingham Railway">
<text>The London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) was a railway company in the United Kingdom, in operation from 1833 to 1846, when it became part of the London and North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR).

The railway line which the company opened in 1838, between London and Birmingham, was the first intercity line to be built into London. It is now the southern section of the West Coast Main Line.

The line was engineered by Robert Stephenson. It started at Euston Station in London, went north-west to Rugby, where it turned west to Coventry and on to Birmingham. It terminated at Curzon Street Station, which it shared with the Grand Junction Railway (GJR), whose adjacent platforms gave an interchange with full connectivity (with through carriages) between Liverpool, Manchester and London.

==History==
===Early plans===
As early as 1823, a company was formed with the objective of building a railway between London and Birmingham, and in 1826, the engineer John Rennie surveyed a route through Oxford and Banbury, a route later taken by the Great Western Railway.

In 1829 a rival company was formed by Francis Giles who proposed building a line through Watford Gap and Coventry. Neither company obtained backing for its scheme, and in late 1830 the two companies decided to merge. The new company appointed Robert Stephenson chief engineer, and after preparing a detailed survey, he chose the route through Watford Gap, largely to avoid possible flooding from the River Thames at Oxford.

===The L&amp;BR===
The prospectus for the London and Birmingham Railway offered the following inducements to potential investors:

The company was created with an initial capitalisation of £5,500,000.
Much of the subscribed funds came from Lancashire, where great profits were being made in the cotton industries.

The construction of the line was the subject of much opposition by landowners, who organised a campaign in the early 1830s to prevent the L&amp;BR from driving a line across their estates. Turbulent public meetings were held in towns in west Hertfordshire to protest against the project, including one held at the King&#x27;s Arms public house in Berkhamsted. Another was held in Watford which was attended by wealthy and influential peers of the realm who had property interests on the planned route of the line: the Earl of Essex was keen to protect his Cassiobury Estate from invasion by the &quot;iron horse&quot;, as was the Earl of Clarendon, who owned The Grove Estate. The anatomist Sir Astley Cooper was also in attendance, intent on preventing the new railway from cutting across his Gadebridge Estate. On 22 June 1832, Lord Brownlow of Ashridge voiced his opposition in the House of Lords to &quot;the forcing of the proposed railway through the land and property of so great a proportion of dissentient landowners.&quot; The L&amp;BR company&#x27;s first application for an act of Parliament to construct the line was rejected in 1832, due to pressure from landowners and road and canal interests.


The railway route proposals through Hertfordshire were modified; a second parliamentary bill was approved in May 1833 as the (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. xxxvi), and the line received royal assent. Construction began in November of that year. The line would follow the River Bulbourne instead of the River Gade, skirting around the edge of Hemel Hempstead to protect Sir Astley Cooper&#x27;s interests; for this reason, Hemel Hempstead railway station is located outside the town centre, at Boxmoor.

===Construction===

Peter Lecount, an assistant engineer of the London and Birmingham railway, produced a number of – possibly hyperbolic – comparisons in an effort to demonstrate that the London and Birmingham Railway was &quot;the greatest public work ever executed either in ancient or modern times&quot;. In particular, he suggested that the effort to build the Great Pyramid of Giza amounted to the lifting of of stone by .

The railway, excluding a long string of tasks (drainage, ballasting, and so on) involved the lifting of of material reduced to the weight of stone used in the pyramid. The pyramid involved, he says, the effort of 300,000 men (according to Diodorus Siculus) or 100,000 (according to Herodotus) for twenty years. The railway involved 20,000 men for five years. In passing, he also noted that the cost of the railway in penny pieces, was enough to more than form a belt of pennies around the equator; and the amount of material moved would be enough to build a wall high by one foot wide, more than three times around the equator.

===Opening===

The line had been planned to open at the same time as the Grand Junction Railway which entered Birmingham from the north. However great difficulty in constructing the Kilsby Tunnel in Northamptonshire delayed the opening. The first part of the line between Euston Station and Boxmoor (Hemel Hempstead) opened on 20 July 1837. Services were extended to Tring on 16 October 1837. On 9 April 1838 the company opened the north end of the line, between Birmingham and Rugby, and the south end from London to a temporary station at near Bletchley with a stagecoach shuttle service linking the two parts to allow through journeys to London. The line was officially fully opened on 17 September 1838, with the first passenger train from London to Birmingham arriving that day. The first London-to-Birmingham trains took hours to complete the journey. 
It has often been claimed that initially, owing to the lack of power available to early locomotives, trains from Euston were cable-hauled up the relatively steep incline to Camden by a stationary steam engine. However, this was denied by Peter Lecount, one of the L&amp;BR engineers, who wrote in his &#x27;History of the Railway connecting London and Birmingham&#x27; (1839), page 48: &quot;It is not because locomotives cannot draw a train of carriages up this incline that a fixed engine and endless rope are used, for they can and have done so, but because the Company are restricted, by their Act of Parliament, from running locomotive engines nearer London than Camden Town.&quot; The railway opened from Euston on 20 July 1837; the stationary engines and rope haulage did not commence until 27 September, and handled all trains from 14 October 1837. Until then, and whenever the rope system was stopped for repairs, locomotives hauled the trains up the incline. From November 1843 some expresses were worked without recourse to the rope, and from 15 July 1844 the rope working ceased permanently.

===Locomotives===

Initially, it was decided that it would be cheaper to work the railway by a contractor, and Edward Bury was chosen and awarded the contract in May 1836. The contract stipulated that the company would provide locomotives to Bury&#x27;s specification, while he would maintain them in good repair and convey each passenger and each ton of goods for a fixed sum at a speed not to exceed .

Bury provided specifications and drawings for a passenger and a goods engine, and by mid-1841 the L&amp;BR was equipped with sixty 2-2-0 passenger engines and thirty 0-4-0 goods engines. They all had inside cylinders and dome-topped fireboxes, and were mounted on inside bar-frames; they were manufactured by seven different firms, including Bury&#x27;s own.

Working the line by contract never worked in practice, because of the unforeseen ever-increasing traffic and the demand for higher speeds, so in July 1839 the contract was annulled, and thereafter Bury was engaged as manager of the Locomotive Department in the normal way, on a fixed salary with a profits bonus.

By the end of the L&amp;BR&#x27;s separate existence in July 1846, the total stock was about 120 locomotives; some six-wheeled engines had been acquired, but some of these proved inferior to the original four-wheelers.

The locomotive workshops were established in 1838 at Wolverton, roughly halfway between the two termini at London and Birmingham. These workshops remained in use for locomotive repairs until 1877, but had been gradually taken over by the Carriage Dept from 1864, and remained as a manufacturing facility up until the 1980s; today just a few parts of the original Wolverton railway works are used solely for rolling stock maintenance and repair.

===Stations===
When the railway was fully opened, it had sixteen intermediate stations between London and Birmingham. The &quot;first-class&quot; stations (served by all trains) were at Watford, , Leighton, , , , and . Additionally, &quot;second-class&quot; intermediate stations (served by slower second-class trains only) were at Harrow, , , , , Crick, Brandon and Hampton. Roade was later redesignated as first-class due to its stagecoach connections. From about 1844 platforms were opened at Camden for tickets to be collected on southbound trains. This became a public station in 1851.

===Links and branches===

The first branch from the main line was the Aylesbury Railway at Aylesbury Railway Junction, of single track, which opened in 1839 and was leased to the L&amp;BR until purchased outright by the LNWR in 1846. The Warwick and Leamington Union Railway, a branch of almost between Coventry and Leamington, was purchased by the L&amp;BR in 1843 and opened in 1844.

From 1840, when the Midland Counties Railway made a junction to its line at Rugby, the L&amp;BR also provided through connections from London to the East Midlands and the North East. It also made connections to the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway at Hampton-in-Arden between Coventry and Birmingham.
In 1845, the Northampton and Peterborough Railway, a branch from the main line, was opened from Blisworth. Also in 1845 branch lines, from Bletchley to Bedford and from Leighton to Dunstable, were leased; they opened in 1846 and 1848. The &quot;&quot;&#x27; (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clvi) authorised the L&amp;BR to lease the West London Railway, and this took effect from 1846 (jointly with the GWR). The West London Railway has opened in 1844 between Willesden Junction and the canal basin at Kensington.

The L&amp;BR purchased the Trent Valley Railway in 1846 on behalf of the LNWR; this line connected Rugby on the L&amp;BR with Stafford on the Grand Junction Railway thus creating a more direct line from London to Liverpool and Manchester by avoiding the original route through Birmingham. The Rugby and Stamford Railway, a further branch into the Eastern Counties was approved in 1846.

===Merger===
In July 1846 the L&amp;BR merged with the Grand Junction Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway to form the London and North Western Railway, which in turn was later absorbed into the London Midland and Scottish Railway, before finally passing into the hands of the nationalised British Railways in 1948 to become part of the West Coast Main Line as it is known today. The major change to the line during this period was electrification, which was carried out during the mid-1960s as part of BR&#x27;s Modernisation Plan.

Neither of the L&amp;BR&#x27;s original termini, both designed by Philip Hardwick, has survived in its original form. Curzon Street station in Birmingham closed to passenger traffic in 1854 (the original entrance building remains) when it was replaced by New Street station and the original Euston station in London was demolished in 1962 to make way for the present structure which opened in 1968. On the closure of Curzon Street as a passenger station, the site became the London and North Western Railway goods depot (Birmingham) and became fully operational in 1865. The Curzon Street goods site continued railway operations as a parcel depot until 1966. The remaining parts of the old passenger station received listed building status in 1952.

<doc id="188447" wikidata="Q3879383" url="?curid=188447" title="Number Six (The Prisoner)">
<text>Number Six is the central character in the 1967–1968 television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. The unnamed character in the original TV series was played by series co-creator Patrick McGoohan. For one episode, &quot;Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling&quot;, Number Six was portrayed by Nigel Stock due to McGoohan being away filming the movie &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;.

In the AMC remake, Number Six is played by Jim Caviezel; in the Big Finish Productions audio series of 2019, Number Six is voiced by Mark Elstob.

==Biography==
Much of Number Six&#x27;s background is kept a mystery during the series, including his name, his job and whom he worked for. In the first episode, it is stated that he was born on 19 March 1928, the same date as McGoohan, and that he held a position of some responsibility with the British government. Certain clues though can be determined from some episodes where Number Six knows and appears to have worked for people in British Intelligence.

===Life before The Village===
During the episode &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, Number Six undergoes an intense form of brainwashing and interrogation in which his mind is reverted to that of a child and he is made to relive major events of his life.

Among the events presented is the suggestion that, as a young man, Number Six caused a fatal car accident by speeding. It is also suggested that he attended some sort of private school and was once punished for not telling the headmaster about some of his friends&#x27; rule-breaking activities. Later in the episode, it is also stated that Number Six was a bomb-aimer during &quot;the War&quot;, and that he worked for a British banking firm before being enrolled in a top secret government job.

Other episodes suggest that he was a spy or similar operative, though director Alex Cox stated in his 2017 book &quot;I Am (Not) A Number: Decoding The Prisoner&quot; that he was in fact a rocket engineer who resigned from his work because he felt his research was being misused. He is shown to be highly sagacious, if not a genius, with proficiency and expertise in subjects ranging from fencing, boxing and marksmanship to mathematics, languages, astronomy and craftsmanship.

Prior to his capture and internment in the Village, he was engaged to be married to Janet Portland, the daughter of his superior, Sir Charles Portland.

===Ultimate fate===
In the final episode, &quot;Fall Out&quot;, Number Six and several other residents appear to have escaped the Village. However, his ultimate fate is not revealed, and McGoohan repeatedly maintained in interviews that Number Six does not have his freedom at the end of the series. The last shot of the series is of Angelo Muscat (the butler of Number Two, The Village&#x27;s overseer) entering Number Six’s house in the City of Westminster, and the door of the house automatically opening and closing like that of his house in The Village.

==Adaptations and remakes of Number Six==

===&quot;Shattered Visage&quot;===
In the late 1980s, DC Comics published &quot;Shattered Visage&quot;, a four-issue comic book based on &quot;The Prisoner,&quot; with events taking place twenty years after the television series. The first official follow-up to the TV show, it was illustrated by &quot;Mister X&quot; creator Dean Motter and co-written with Mark Askwith.

In the mini-series, Alice Drake is shipwrecked on the shores of the Village and meets an older Number Six, the single resident of the Village.

=== 2009 mini-series ===
&quot;The Prisoner&quot; was remade in a 2009 mini-series produced by AMC with Jim Caviezel playing the part of Number Six. Despite receiving mixed reviews, the remake was nominated for several awards, including an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie and Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or a Movie.

==Fan theories==

===John Drake===
Many fans of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; believe that Number Six is really John Drake, the title character of McGoohan&#x27;s prior series &quot;Danger Man&quot;. McGoohan always denied the theory; in a 1966 interview in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, he stated that &quot;John Drake of &quot;Secret Agent&quot; [as &quot;Danger Man&quot; was known in the US] is gone.&quot; Furthermore, McGoohan stated in a 1985 interview that Number Six is not the same character as John Drake, adding that he had originally wanted another actor to portray the character.

However, script editor George Markstein, who co-created the series with McGoohan, always claimed that Number Six is John Drake. According to Markstein, he conceived &quot;The Prisoner&quot; as a sequel of &quot;Danger Man&quot; when McGoohan resigned from the role.

Novels based on the series by Thomas Disch and David McDaniel also connect John Drake to Number Six, though these are generally not considered canonical. McDaniel&#x27;s novel refers to Number Six as &quot;Drake&quot; from its very first sentence: &quot;Drake woke.&quot;

While John Drake and Number Six look identical and have the same moral integrity, profession, skills, and mannerisms, some differences are noteworthy. Drake is a less emotional, more restrained character, while Number Six has a tendency to act out in anger. Drake is also a regular smoker and drinker, while Number Six smokes only twice in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and claims to rarely drink.

===Number 93===
In the opening moments of the 2009 mini-series, Michael, the amnesiac who would be known in that series as Six, discovers an old man in the middle of the desert being fired upon by security forces in some kind of an escape attempt. The old man is dressed in Number Six&#x27;s trademark black sweater jacket with white trim, now displaying a badge that identifies the wearer as &quot;93&quot;. 93&#x27;s final words were &quot;Listen to me: tell them all that I got out… be seeing you.&quot; Six later explores 93&#x27;s apartment, which is identical to Number Six&#x27;s from the original series. Producer Trevor Hopkins stated on a ComiCon panel that he had invited Patrick McGoohan to play the role of 93; McGoohan declined, suggesting that he could play Two instead (the role of Two went to Ian McKellen).

==In popular culture==
*&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot;, parodies &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, with McGoohan reprising his role as Number Six and Homer Simpson as Number Five.
*Number Six, played by Tricia Helfer, is a character on the television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica.&quot; According to &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion,&quot; it is a tribute to the original character.
*In the second volume of the &quot;Tales of the Shadowmen&quot; series, Xavier Mauméjean&#x27;s short story, entitled &quot;Be Seeing You!&quot;, has Sherlock Holmes in the role of the original Number Six.
*Several Iron Maiden songs allude to the original series. In the song, &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, lines from the original series are played at the beginning of the song. The Village is also the setting of their song &quot;Back in the Village.&quot;
* UK indie rock act Mansun&#x27;s second album, &quot;Six&quot;, is heavily inspired by the series as the band&#x27;s former frontman Paul Draper is a big fan of the show.

<doc id="188448" wikidata="Q765514" url="?curid=188448" title="USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)">
<text>USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (BB-38) was the lead ship of the of super-dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1910s. The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;s were part of the standard-type battleship series, and marked an incremental improvement over the preceding , carrying an extra pair of guns for a total of twelve guns. Named for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, she was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in October 1913, was launched in March 1915, and was commissioned in June 1916. Equipped with an oil-burning propulsion system, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was not sent to European waters during World War I, since the necessary fuel oil was not as readily available as coal. Instead, she remained in American waters and took part in training exercises; in 1918, she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France to take part in peace negotiations.

During the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; served as the flagship of first the Atlantic Fleet, and after it was merged with the Pacific Fleet in 1921, the Battle Fleet. For the majority of this period, the ship was stationed in California, based in San Pedro. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was occupied with a peacetime routine of training exercises (including the annual Fleet problems), port visits, and foreign cruises, including a visit to Australia in 1925. The ship was modernized in 1929–1931. The ship was present in Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941; she was in drydock with a pair of destroyers when the Japanese launched their surprise attack on the port. She suffered relatively minor damage in the attack, being protected from torpedoes by the drydock. While repairs were effected, the ship received a modernized anti-aircraft battery to prepare her for operations in the Pacific War.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; joined the fleet in a series of amphibious operations, primarily tasked with providing gunfire support. The first of these, the Aleutian Islands Campaign, took place in mid-1943, and was followed by an attack on Makin later that year. During 1944, she supported the landings on Kwajalein and Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands and the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, including the Battles of Saipan, Guam, Peleliu, and Battle of Angaur. During the Philippines campaign, in addition to her typical shore bombardment duties, she took part in the Battle of Surigao Strait, though due to her inadequate radar, she was unable to locate a target and did not fire. During the Battle of Okinawa, she was torpedoed by a Japanese torpedo bomber and badly damaged, forcing her to withdraw for repairs days before the end of the war.

Allocated to the target fleet for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was repaired only enough to allow her to make the voyage to the test site, Bikini Atoll. She survived both blasts, but was badly contaminated with radioactive fallout from the second test, and so was towed to Kwajalein, where she was studied for the next year and a half. The ship was ultimately scuttled in deep water off the atoll in February 1948.

== Description ==

Part of the standard-type battleship series, the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;-class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors, the . &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of (at the waterline), and a draft of at deep load. This was longer than the older ships. She displaced at standard and at deep load, over more than the older ships. The ship had a metacentric height of at deep load.

The ship had four direct-drive Curtis steam turbine sets, each of which drove a propeller in diameter. They were powered by twelve Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , for a designed speed of . She was designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but had a maximum capacity of . At full capacity, the ship could steam at a speed of for an estimated with a clean bottom. She had four turbo generators.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; carried twelve 45-caliber guns in triple gun turrets. The turrets were numbered from I to IV from front to rear. The guns could not elevate independently and were limited to a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a maximum range of . The ship carried 100 shells for each gun. Defense against torpedo boats was provided by twenty-two 51-caliber guns mounted in individual casemates in the sides of the ship&#x27;s hull. Positioned as they were they proved vulnerable to sea spray and could not be worked in heavy seas. At an elevation of 15°, they had a maximum range of . Each gun was provided with 230 rounds of ammunition. The ship mounted four 50-caliber three-inch guns for anti-aircraft defense, although only two were fitted when completed. The other pair were added shortly afterward on top of Turret III. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; also mounted two torpedo tubes submerged, one on each broadside, and carried 24 torpedoes for them.

The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;-class design continued the all-or-nothing principle of armoring only the most important areas of the ship begun in the &quot;Nevada&quot; class. The waterline armor belt of Krupp armor measured thick and covered only the ship&#x27;s machinery spaces and magazines. It had a total height of , of which was below the waterline; beginning below the waterline, the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of . The transverse bulkheads at each end of the ship ranged from 13 to 8 inches in thickness. The faces of the gun turrets were thick while the sides were thick and the turret roofs were protected by of armor. The armor of the barbettes was thick. The conning tower was protected by of armor and had a roof eight inches thick.

The main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of ; over the steering gear the armor increased to in two plates. Beneath it was the splinter deck that ranged from in thickness. The boiler uptakes were protected by a conical mantlet that ranged from in thickness. A three-inch torpedo bulkhead was placed inboard from the ship&#x27;s side and the ship was provided with a complete double bottom. Testing in mid-1914 revealed that this system could withstand of TNT.

==Service history==
===Construction and World War I===

The keel for &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was laid down on 27 October 1913 at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. Her completed hull was launched on 16 March 1915, thereafter beginning fitting-out. Work on the ship finished in mid-1916, and she was commissioned on 12 June under the command of Captain Henry B. Wilson. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and then completed final fitting out from 1 to 20 July. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; then began sea trials in 20 July, steaming first to the southern drill grounds off the Virginia Capes and then north to the coast of New England. Rear Admiral Austin M. Knight and officers from the Naval War College came aboard on 21 August to observe fleet training exercises. Three days later, the ship was visited by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo transferred to &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; on 12 October, making her the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet. At the end of the year, she went into drydock at the New York Navy Yard for maintenance. After emerging from the shipyard in January 1917, she steamed south to join fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea, during which she stopped in: Culebra, Puerto Rico; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. While in Port-au-Prince, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; again hosted Roosevelt, who met with the President of Haiti aboard the ship. The battleship arrived back in Yorktown, Virginia on 6 April, the same day the United States declared war on Germany, bringing the country into World War I. Since &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was oil-fired, she did not join the ships of Battleship Division Nine, as the British had asked for coal-burning battleships to reinforce the Grand Fleet. As a result, she stayed in American waters and saw no action during the war.

In August, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; took part in a naval review for President Woodrow Wilson. Foreign naval officers visited the ship in September, including the Japanese Vice Admiral Isamu Takeshita and the Russian Vice Admiral Alexander Kolchak. For the rest of the year and into 1918, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was kept in a state of readiness through fleet exercises and gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound. She was preparing for night battle training on 11 November 1918, when the Armistice with Germany came into effect, ending the fighting. She thereafter returned for another stint in the New York Navy Yard for maintenance that was completed on 21 November. She began the voyage to Brest, France, on 2 December by way of Tomkinsville, New York, in company with the transport ship that carried Wilson to France to take part in the peace negotiations; they were escorted by ten destroyers. The ships arrived on 13 December and the next day, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; began the trip back to New York with Battleship Divisions Nine and Six. The battleships reached their destination on 26 December, where they took part in victory celebrations.

=== Inter-war period ===
====1919–1924====

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and the rest of the Atlantic Fleet departed on 19 February, bound for the Caribbean for another round of exercises in Cuban waters. The ship arrived back in New York on 14 April, and while there on 30 June, Mayo was replaced by Vice Admiral Henry Wilson. On 8 July at Tomkinsville, a delegation consisting of: Vice President Thomas R. Marshall; Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy; Carter Glass, the Secretary of the Treasury; William B. Wilson, the Secretary of Labor; Newton D. Baker, the Secretary of War; Franklin K. Lane, the Secretary of the Interior; and Senator Champ Clark came aboard the ship for a cruise back to New York. The fleet conducted another set of maneuvers in the Caribbean from 7 January to April 1920, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; returning to her berth in New York on 26 April. Training exercises in the area followed, and on 17 July she received the hull number BB-38.

On 17 January 1921, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left New York, passed through the Panama Canal to Balboa, Panama, where she joined the Pacific Fleet, which together with elements of the Atlantic Fleet was re-designated as the Battle Fleet, with &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; as its flagship. On 21 January, the fleet left Balboa and steamed south to Callao, Peru, where they arrived ten days later. The ships then steamed north back to Balboa on 2 February, arriving on 14 February. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; crossed back through the canal to take part in maneuvers off Cuba and on 28 April she arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, where President Warren G. Harding, Edwin Denby, the Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Admiral Robert Coontz, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), came aboard the ship. Further training was held from 12 to 21 July in the Caribbean, after which she returned to New York. On 30 July, she proceeded on to Plymouth, Massachusetts for a visit that lasted until 2 August. Anothery drydock period in New York lasted from 5 to 20 August.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; departed New York thereafter, bound for the Pacific; she passed through the Panama Canal on 30 August and remained at Balboa for two weeks. On 15 September, she resumed the voyage and steamed north to San Pedro, Los Angeles, which she reached on 26 September. The ship spent most of 1922 visiting ports along the US west coast, including San Francisco, Seattle, Port Angeles, and San Diego, and from 6 March to 19 April, she underwent a refit at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. She won the Battle Efficiency Award for the 1922 training year. She went back to Puget Sound on 18 December, and remained there into 1923. She left the shipyard on 28 January and steamed south to San Diego, where she stayed from 2 to 8 February, before continuing on to the Panama Canal. After passing through, she steamed to Culebra for a short visit. The ship then passed back through the canal and arrived back in San Pedro on 13 April. Beginning in May, she visited various ports in the area over the course of the rest of 1923, apart from a round of fleet training from 27 November to 7 December. She ended the year with another stint in Puget Sound from 22 December until 1 March 1924.

====1924–1931====
The ship arrived in San Francisco on 3 March, where she loaded ammunition before joining the Battle Fleet in San Diego on 9 March. The fleet cruised south to the Gulf of Fonseca, then continued south and passed through the Panama Canal to Bahía Limón. The ships visited several ports in the Caribbean, including in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before returning to the Pacific in early April. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; arrived back in San Pedro on 22 April, where she remained until 25 June, when she steamed north to Seattle. By this time, she was serving as the flagship of Battle Division 3 of the Battle Fleet. While in the Seattle area, she took part in training exercises with the ships of her division that lasted until 1 September. Further training exercises took place from 12 to 22 September off San Francisco. She thereafter took part in joint training with the coastal defenses around San Francisco from 26 to 29 September. The ship underwent a pair of overhauls from 1 to 13 October and 13 December to 5 January 1925. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; then steamed to Puget Sound on 21 January for a third overhaul that lasted from 25 January to 24 March.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; returned to San Pedro on 27 March and then joined the fleet in San Francisco on 5 April. The ships then steamed to Hawaii for training exercises before departing on 1 July for a major cruise across the Pacific to Australia. They reached Melbourne on 22 July, and on 6 August &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; steamed to Wellington, New Zealand, where she stayed from 11 to 22 August. On the voyage back to the United States, they stopped in Pago Pago in American Samoa and Hawaii, before reaching San Pedro on 26 September. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; went to San Diego for target practice from 5 to 8 October, thereafter returning to San Pedro, where she remained largely idle for the rest of 1925. She left San Pedro with the Battle Fleet on 1 February 1926 for another visit to Balboa, during which the ships conducted tactical training from 15 to 27 February. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; spent early March in California before departing for Puget Sound on 15 March for another refit that lasted until 14 May, at which point she returned to San Pedro. Another tour of west coast ports began on 16 June and ended on 1 September back in San Pedro.
&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; remained at San Pedro from 11 December to 11 January 1927 when she left for another refit at Puget Sound that lasted until 12 March. She returned to San Francisco on 15 March and then moved to San Pedro the next day. She left to join training exercises off Cuba on 17 March; she passed through the canal between 29 and 31 March and arrived in Guantánamo Bay on 4 April. On 18 April, she left Cuba to visit Gonaïves, Haiti before steaming to New York, arriving there on 29 April. After touring the east coast in May, she departed for the canal, which she crossed on 12 June. She remained in Balboa until 12 June, at which point she left for San Pedro, arriving on 28 June. The ship spent the rest of 1927 with training, maintenance, and a tour of the west coast. She went to Puget Sound for a refit on 1 April 1928 that lasted until 16 May, after which she went to San Francisco. She left that same day, however, and steamed back north to visit Victoria, British Columbia. She remained there from 24 to 28 May and then returned to San Francisco. She spent June visiting various ports, and in August she embarked Dwight F. Davis, the Secretary of War, in San Francisco; she carried him to Hawaii, departing on 7 August and arriving on the 13th. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; returned to Seattle on 26 August.

Another cruise to Cuba took place in January 1929, after which she went to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 1 June for a major refit and modernization. She received a number of modifications, including increased deck and turret roof armor, anti-torpedo bulges, new turbo-generators, new turbines, and six new three-drum boilers. Her main battery turrets were modified to allow them to elevate to 30 degrees, significantly increasing the range of her guns, and her secondary battery was revised. The number of 5-inch guns was reduced to twelve, and her 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced with eight 5-inch /25 guns. Her torpedo tubes were removed, as were her lattice masts, which were replaced with sturdier tripod masts. Her bridge was also enlarged to increase the space available for an admiral&#x27;s staff, since she was used as a flagship. Her living space was increased to 2,037 crew and marines, and she was fitted with two catapults for seaplanes.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; returned to service on 1 March 1931 and she conducted trials in Delaware Bay in March and April. She then steamed south to Cuba on 8 May for a training cruise before returning to Philadelphia on 26 May. Another cruise to Cuba followed on 30 July; the ship arrived there on 5 August and this time she steamed across the Caribbean to the Panama Canal, which she transited on 12 August to return to the Battle Fleet. She reached San Pedro on 27 August, where she remained for the rest of the year. She toured the west coast in January 1932 and before crossing over to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 3 February. There, she took part in extensive fleet maneuvers as part of Fleet Problem XIII. She returned to San Pedro on 20 March, remaining there until 18 April, when she began another cruise along the coast of California. She returned to San Pedro on 14 November and remained there until the end of the year.

====1932–1941====
The ship departed San Pedro on 9 February to participate in Fleet Problem XIV, which lasted from 10 to 17 February. She returned to San Francisco on 17 February and then went to San Pedro on 27 February, remaining there until 19 June. Another west coast cruise followed from 19 June to 14 November, and after returning to San Pedro, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; stayed there inactive until early March 1934. From 4 to 8 March, she made a short visit to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco and then returned to San Pedro. From there, she went to join the fleet for Fleet Problem XV, which was held in the Caribbean this year; she passed through the canal on 24 April, the maneuvers having already started on the 19th. They lasted until 12 May, at which point &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; went to Gonaïves with the rest of the fleet, which then continued on to New York, where it arrived on 31 March. There, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; led the fleet in a naval review for now-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. On 15 June, Admiral Joseph M. Reeves took command of the fleet aboard &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, which was once again the fleet flagship.

On 18 June, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left New York for the Pacific, stopping in Hampton Roads on 20 June on the way. She passed through the canal on 28 June and reached San Pedro on 7 July. She then went to Puget Sound for a refit that lasted from 14 July to 2 October. The ship left the shipyard on 16 October and returned to San Francisco two days later, beginning a period of cruises off the coast of California and visits to cities in the state. She ended the year in San Pedro, remaining there or in San Francisco until 29 April 1935, when she took part in Fleet Problem XVI in the Hawaiian islands. The maneuvers lasted until 10 June, and were the largest set of exercises conducted by the US Navy at the time. The ship then returned to San Pedro on 17 June and embarked on a cruise of the west coast for several months; on 16 December, she went to Puget Sound for another overhaul that lasted from 20 December to 21 March 1936. Fleet Problem XVII followed from 27 April to 7 June, this time being held off Balboa. She returned to San Pedro on 6 June and spent the rest of the year with training exercises off the west coast and Hawaii, ending the training program for the year in San Pedro on 18 November.

The ship remained in port until 17 February, when she departed for San Clemente, California at the start of a tour along the west coast. She participated in Fleet Problem XVIII, which lasted from 16 April to 28 May. Another stint in Puget Sound began on 6 June and concluded on 3 September, when she returned to San Pedro. She spent the rest of the year alternating between there and San Francisco, seeing little activity. She made a short trip to San Francisco in February 1938 and took part in Fleet Problem XIX from 9 March to 30 April. Another period in San Pedro followed until 20 June, after which she embarked on a two-month cruise along the west coast that concluded with another stay at Puget Sound on 28 September. After concluding her repairs on 16 December, she returned to San Pedro by way of San Francisco, arriving on 22 December. Fleet Problem XX occurred earlier the year than it had in previous iterations, taking place from 20 to 27 February 1939 in Cuban waters. During the exercises, Franklin Roosevelt and Admiral William D. Leahy, the CNO, came aboard &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; to observe the maneuvers.

The ship then went to Culebra on 27 February, departing on 4 March to visit Port-au-Prince, Haiti from 6 to 11 March. A stay in Guantanamo Bay followed from 12 to 31 March, after which she went to visit the US Naval Academy in Annapolis on 5 April. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; began the voyage back to the Pacific on 18 April and passed through the canal at the end of the month, ultimately arriving back in San Pedro on 12 May. Another tour of the west coast followed, which included stops in San Francisco, Tacoma, and Seattle, and ended in San Pedro on 20 October. She went to Hawaii to participate in Fleet Problem XXI on 2 April 1940. The exercises lasted until 17 May, after which the ship remained in Hawaii until 1 September, when she left for San Pedro. The battleship then went to Puget Sound on 12 September that lasted until 27 December; during the overhaul, she received another four 5-inch /25 guns. She returned to San Pedro on 31 December. Fleet Problem XXII was scheduled for January 1941, but the widening of World War II by this time led the naval command to cancel the exercises. On 7 January, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; steamed to Hawaii as part of what was again the Pacific Fleet, based at Pearl Harbor. Over the course of the year, she operated out of Pearl Harbor and made a short voyage to the west coast of the United States from 12 September to 11 October.

=== World War II ===
====Attack on Pearl Harbor====

On the morning of 7 December, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was in Dry Dock No. 1 in Pearl Harbor undergoing a refit; three of her four screws were removed. The destroyers and were also in the dock with her. When it became clear that the port was under air attack from the Japanese fleet, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;″s crew rushed to their battle stations, and between 08:02 and 08:05, her anti-aircraft gunners began engaging the hostile aircraft. Japanese torpedo bombers unsuccessfully attempted to torpedo the side of the drydock to flood it; having failed, several aircraft then strafed &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. At 08:30, several high-altitude bombers began a series of attacks on the ship; over the course of the following fifteen minutes, five aircraft attempted to hit her from different directions. One of the Japanese bombers hit &quot;Downes&quot; and one scored a hit on &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; that passed through the boat deck and exploded in casemate No. 9. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners fired at all of these aircraft but failed to hit any of them, apparently owing to incorrect fuse settings that caused the shells to explode before they reached the correct altitude. The gunners did manage to shoot down a low-flying aircraft that attempted to strafe the ship; they claimed to have shot down another five aircraft, but the after-action investigation noted that only two aircraft were likely hit by &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;″s guns.

By 09:20, both destroyers were on fire from bomb hits and the fire had spread to &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, so the drydock was flooded to help contain the fire. Ten minutes later, the destroyers began to explode as the fires spread to ammunition magazines, and at 09:41, &quot;Downes&quot; was shattered by an explosion that scattered parts of the ship around the area. One of her torpedo tubes, weighing , was launched into the air, striking &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;″s forecastle. As part of her crew battled the fire in her bow, other men used the ship&#x27;s boats to ferry anti-aircraft ammunition from stores in the West Loch of Pearl Harbor. Beginning at 14:00, the crew began preparatory work to repair the bomb damage; a 5-inch /25 gun and a 5-inch /51 casemate gun were taken from the damaged battleship to replace weapons damaged aboard &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. In the course of the attack, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; had 15 men killed (including her executive officer), 14 missing, and 38 wounded. On 12 December, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was refloated and taken out of the drydock; having been only lightly damaged in the attack, she was ready to go to sea. She departed Pearl Harbor on 20 December and arrived in San Francisco nine days later. She went into drydock at Hunter&#x27;s Point on 1 January 1942 for repairs that were completed on 12 January.

The ship left San Francisco on 20 February and began gunnery training before returning to San Francisco the next day. Further training followed in March, and from 14 April to 1 August, she took part in extensive maneuvers off the coast of California; during this period, she underwent an overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in San Francisco. The work involved considerably strengthening the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft capabilities, with ten Bofors 40 mm quad mounts and fifty-one Oerlikon 20 mm single mounts. The tripod mainmast was removed, with the stump replaced by a deckhouse above which the aft main battery director cupola was housed. One of the new CXAM-1 radars was installed above the cupola. The older 5-inch /51 cal anti-ship guns in casemates and 5-inch /25 cal anti-aircraft guns were replaced with rapid fire 5-inch /38 cal guns in eight twin turret mounts. The new 5&quot;/38 cal dual purpose guns could elevate to 85 degrees and fire at a rate of one round every four seconds. The ship briefly went to sea during the Battle of Midway as part of Task Force 1, commanded by Vice Admiral William S. Pye, but the ships did not see action during the operation.

==== Aleutians and Makin Atoll ====
On 1 August, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left San Francisco, bound for Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 14 August and took part in further training, including guard tactics for aircraft carrier task forces. Another overhaul followed in San Francisco from 3 to 10 January 1943. After further training and tests at San Francisco and Long Beach that lasted into April, she departed to join the Aleutian Islands Campaign on 23 April. She bombarded Holtz Bay and Chichagof Harbor on 11–12 May to support the forces that went ashore on the island of Attu. While she was leaving the area on the 12th, the Japanese submarine launched a torpedo at the ship, which was observed by a patrolling PBY Catalina flying boat. The Catalina radioed &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, which took evasive maneuvers and escaped unharmed; a pair of destroyers then spent the next ten hours hunting the submarine before severely damaging her and forcing her to surface. &quot;I-31&quot; was later sunk by another destroyer the next day.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; returned to Holtz Bay on 14 May to conduct another bombardment in support of an infantry attack on the western side of the bay. She continued operations in the area until 19 May, when she steamed to Adak Island for another amphibious assault. While en route, one of her gasoline stowage compartments exploded, which caused structural damage, though no one was injured in the accident. She was forced to leave Adak on 21 May for repairs at Puget Sound that lasted from 31 May to 15 June; during the overhaul, another accidental explosion killed one man and injured a second. She left port on 1 August, bound for Adak, which she reached on 7 August. There, she became the flagship of Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, commander of the task force that was to attack Kiska. The troops went ashore on 15 August but met no resistance, the Japanese having evacuated without US forces in the area having becoming aware of it. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; patrolled off Kiska for several days before returning to Adak on 23 August.

Two days later, the battleship departed Adak for Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 1 September. She embarked a contingent of 790 passengers before steaming on 19 September, bound for San Francisco. She arrived there six days later and debarked her passengers before returning to Pearl Harbor on 6 October to take part in bombardment training from 20 to 23 October and 31 October – 4 November. Now the flagship of Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, the commander of the Fifth Amphibious Force, itself part of the Northern Attack Force, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 10 November to lead the assault on Makin Atoll, part of the Gilbert Islands. She was joined by three other battleships, four cruisers, three escort carriers, and numerous transports and destroyers; they arrived off Makin on 20 November, and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; opened fire on Butaritari Island that morning at a range of , beginning the Battle of Makin. Early on the morning of 24 November, the ship was rocked by an explosion off her starboard bow; lookouts reported that the escort carrier had been torpedoed and had exploded. Japanese torpedo bombers conducted repeated nighttime attacks on 25 and 26 November, but they failed to score any hits on the American fleet. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left the area on 30 November to return to Pearl Harbor.

==== Marshalls and Marianas campaigns====
At the start of 1944, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was at Pearl Harbor; over the course of the first two weeks of January, she took part in maneuvers in preparation for landings on Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. She departed Pearl Harbor on 22 January in company with the invasion fleet, and on 31 January she began her preparatory bombardment of the atoll to start the Battle of Kwajalein. Troops went ashore the next day, and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; remained offshore to provide artillery support to the marines as they fought to secure the island. By the evening of 3 February, the Japanese defenders had been defeated, allowing the ship to depart to Majuro Atoll to replenish her ammunition supply. She left shortly thereafter, on 12 February, to support the next major attack on Eniwetok in the Marshalls; five days later she arrived off the island, the Battle of Eniwetok already underway, and over the course of 20 and 21 February, she shelled the island heavily to support the men fighting ashore. On 22 February, she supported the landing on Parry Island, part of the Eniwetok atoll.

On 1 March, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; steamed back to Majuro before proceeding south to Havannah Harbor on Efate Island in the New Hebrides. She remained there until 24 April, when she left for a short visit to Sydney, Australia from 29 April to 11 May, when she returned to Efate. She thereafter steamed to Port Purvis on Florida Island, in the Solomons, to participate in amphibious assault exercises. After replenishing ammunition and supplies at Efate, she left on 2 June, bound for Roi, arriving there six days later. On 10 June, she joined a force of battleships, cruisers, escort carriers, and destroyers that had assembled for the Marianas campaign. While en route that night, one of the escorting destroyers reported a sonar contact and the ships of the fleet took evasive maneuvers; in the darkness, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; accidentally collided with the troop transport . &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; incurred only minor damage and was able to continue with the fleet, but &quot;Talbot&quot; had to return to Eniwetok for emergency repairs.

&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; began her bombardment of Saipan on 14 June to prepare the island for the assault that came the next day. She continued shelling the island while cruising off Tinian on 15 June as the assault craft went ashore. On 16 June, she attacked Japanese positions at Orote Point on Guam before returning to Saipan. She left the area on 25 June to replenish at Eniwetok, returning to join the preparatory bombardment of Guam on 12 July. The shelling continued for two days, and late on 14 July, she steamed to Saipan to again replenish her ammunition. Back on station three days later, she continued to blast the island through 20 July. This work also included suppressing guns that fired on demolition parties that went ashore to destroy landing obstacles. On the morning of 21 July, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; took up her bombardment position off Orote Point as the assault craft prepared to launch their attack. The ship operated off the island supporting the men fighting there for the next two weeks.

==== Operations in the Philippines ====
&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left Guam on 3 August to replenish at Eniwetok, arriving there on 19 August. From there, she steamed to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides before joining landing training off Guadalcanal. The ship left on 6 September as part of the Bombardment and Fire Support Group for the invasion of Peleliu. She bombarded the island from 12 to 14 September and supported the landings the next day. She shelled Anguar Island on 17 September and remained there for three days, departing on 20 September. She then steamed to Seeadler Harbor on Manus, one of the Admiralty Islands for repairs. On 28 September, she arrived there and entered a floating dry dock on 1 October for a week&#x27;s repairs. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; left on 12 October in company with the battleships , , , , and &quot;West Virginia&quot;, under the command of Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. These ships, designated Task Group 77.2, formed the Fire Support Group for the upcoming operations in the Philippines. They arrived off Leyte on 18 October and took up bombardment positions; over the next four days, they covered Underwater Demolition Teams, beach reconnaissance operations, and minesweepers clearing the way for the landing force.

On 24 October, reports of Japanese naval forces approaching the area led Oldendorf&#x27;s ships to prepare for action at the exit of the Surigao Strait. Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force steamed through the Surigao Strait to attack the invasion fleet in Leyte Gulf; his force comprised Battleship Division 2—the battleships and , the heavy cruiser , and four destroyers—and Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima&#x27;s Second Striking Force—the heavy cruisers and , the light cruiser , and four more destroyers. As Nishimura&#x27;s flotilla passed through the strait on the night of 24 October, they came under attack from American PT boats, followed by destroyers, initiating the Battle of Surigao Strait. One of these destroyers torpedoed &quot;Fusō&quot; and disabled her, though Nishimura continued on toward his objective.

In the early hours of 25 October, the Southern Force came into contact with Oldendorf&#x27;s battleships, which had positioned themselves to cross Nishimura&#x27;s T. At 03:53, &quot;West Virginia&quot; opened fire, followed by some of the other battleships, though &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; had trouble locating a target in the darkness with her search radar. Her older Mark 3 radar was not as effective as the more modern sets on &quot;West Virginia&quot; and some of the other battleships. Task Group 77.2&#x27;s battleships effectively annihilated Battleship Division 2; Shima&#x27;s Second Striking Force had fallen behind and had not yet entered the fray. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was set on fire and then exploded; she turned to flee, covered by a salvo of torpedoes from the burning &quot;Mogami&quot;, but the American battleships were able to evade them without damage. Despite having disengaged from Oldendorf&#x27;s battleships, &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was hit by more torpedoes and capsized and sank around 04:20. Shima&#x27;s ships passed the still-floating &quot;Fusō&quot; and realized that Nishimura had entered a trap, so he reversed course to flee; in the confusion, his flagship &quot;Nachi&quot; collided with &quot;Mogami&quot;, damaging her and slowing her to be attacked by American light forces. She was later sunk, as were three of the four destroyers. Later on 25 October, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners helped to shoot down four aircraft that attacked a nearby destroyer.

Late on 28 October, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; shot down a torpedo bomber. The ship remained on station off Leyte until 25 November, when she departed for Manus, from which she steamed to Kossol Roads off Palau on 15 December to refill her magazines. She conducted gunnery training on 22 December, and on 1 January 1945, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; re-joined Oldendorf&#x27;s Fire Support Group on the way to Lingayen Gulf for the next major operation in the Philippines. Over the course of 4–5 January, Japanese aircraft repeatedly attacked the ships, including kamikazes that destroyed the escort carrier . &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; began bombarding Japanese positions on Santiago Island at the entrance to Lingayen Gulf on 6 January before entering the gulf that night to suppress Japanese guns while minesweepers cleared the area. The next morning, the rest of Oldendorf&#x27;s ships joined her in the gulf to begin the main preparatory bombardment, which continued through the 8th. On 9 January, the amphibious assault began as troops from the Sixth United States Army went ashore.

Japanese aircraft struck the invasion fleet on 10 January, and four bombs landed close to &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, though she was undamaged. Later that day, a fire control party directed &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; to shell a group of Japanese tanks that were massing to launch a counterattack on the beachhead. The ship patrolled outside the gulf from 10 to 17 January, when she returned to the gulf; she saw no further action, however, and she departed on 10 February for maintenance at Manus. From there, she left on 22 February for San Francisco, stopping in the Marshalls and at Pearl Harbor on the way. After arriving on 13 March, she underwent a thorough overhaul, including the replacement of her worn-out main battery and secondary guns. She also received a new Mk.34 main battery director, which was equipped with the latest Mk.8 fire control radar, on her aft superstructure. With the kamikaze threat in mind, her anti-aircraft armament was increased to seventy-one 20 mm guns in twenty-seven single and twenty-two twin mounts. An additional pair of 40 mm Bofors guns in a twin mount was installed on top of turret 2, for a total of forty-two guns. With the work done, she went on sea trials off San Francisco, followed by training at San Diego. She left San Francisco on 12 July and arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 18th, where she engaged in further training from 20 to 23 July. The next day, she departed to join the invasion fleet off Okinawa.

While transiting the Pacific, she stopped to bombard Wake Island on 1 August. In the artillery duel with Japanese coastal guns, one of their shells detonated close enough that fragments disabled one of the ship&#x27;s fire control directors for her 5-inch guns. One of her Curtiss SC Seahawks was damaged in heavy seas, and the destroyer recovered the pilot. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; loaded ammunition at Saipan before continuing on to Okinawa, arriving there on 12 August where she became flagship of Task Force 95. That night, while moored next to &quot;Tennessee&quot; in Buckner Bay, a Japanese torpedo bomber managed to penetrate the Allied defensive screen undetected; the aircraft launched its torpedo at &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; and hit her aft, causing serious damage. The torpedo opened a hole approximately in diameter, causing the ship to take on a considerable amount of water and begin to settle by the stern. Damage control teams were able to contain the flooding. Twenty men were killed and another ten were injured in the attack, including Oldendorf, who was aboard at the time and suffered several broken ribs. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was the last major US warship to be damaged in the war. The next day, salvage tugs towed her to shallow water where temporary repairs could be effected. On 15 August, the Japanese surrendered, ending the war.

=== Post-war career ===
&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was taken under tow by a pair of tugboats on 18 August, bound for Apra Harbor, Guam, where they arrived on 6 September. The next day, she was taken into a floating drydock, where a large steel patch was welded over the torpedo hole, which would allow the ship to make the voyage back for permanent repairs. The battleship relieved &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; as flagship on 15 September, and on 2 October, she was able to leave the drydock. Two days later, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; steamed out of Guam, bound for Puget Sound, where repairs would be effected. She was escorted by the light cruiser and the destroyer . While still en route on 17 October, the ship&#x27;s number 3 propeller shaft slipped aft. Divers were sent to cut the shaft loose; &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; now had just one operational screw, and the open propeller shaft was now allowing water to leak into the hull. She nevertheless completed the voyage to Puget Sound, arriving on 24 October. The ship received the Navy Unit Commendation for her wartime service there on 3 November.

On 16 January 1946, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was designated to be expended as a target ship for the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll to be carried out later that year. Repairs were completed enough to allow her to sail to the Marshall Islands, and she left Puget Sound on 24 February. After stopping in Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Bikini Atoll on 31 May, where she was anchored along with another eighty-three warships. The first explosion, Test Able, took place on 1 July, and was an air burst. After tests determined that the ship had not been contaminated with radiation, the crew returned to the ship from 3 to 24 July. The second blast, Test Baker, was done the next day. This was an underwater detonation, and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was moored just from ground zero. She was only lightly damaged from the blast, but the surge of water caused significant radioactive contamination; work parties came aboard the ship from 17 to 21 August to prepare the ship to be towed, and on the 21st she was taken under tow by the transport , which took her to Kwajalein, where she was decommissioned on 29 August. Various radiological and structural studies were completed over the next year and a half until she was scuttled off Kwajalein on 10 February 1948. She was officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 February.

The ship&#x27;s bell is on display at The Pennsylvania State University near the main entrance of the Wagner Building, home of the university&#x27;s ROTC programs. It has been on permanent loan to the university from the Department of the Navy since 1955. Two of the ship&#x27;s 14-inch guns that had been replaced during the 1945 overhaul are on outdoor display at the Pennsylvania Military Museum in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania.

<text>Real McCoy is a German Eurodance and pop music project best known for their hit singles throughout the mid-1990s: &quot;Another Night&quot;, &quot;Automatic Lover (Call for Love)&quot;, &quot;Run Away&quot;, &quot;Love &amp; Devotion&quot;, &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot;, and &quot;One More Time&quot;. Their first U.S. album &quot;Another Night&quot; went multi-platinum and charted in countries around the world.

==History==
===1989–1990: Early success in Germany===
The Real McCoy project (originally known in Europe as M.C. Sar &amp; the Real McCoy) was the result of the successful collaboration between record producers Juergen Wind (J. Wind), and Frank Hassas (Quickmix), plus the rapper Olaf Jeglitza (O-Jay), under their music production company Freshline Records. Wind and Hassas wrote and produced the project&#x27;s main hits between 1990 and 1994 at Wind Studios B.C. in Spandau, Berlin. Traditionally, Jeglitza was given additional producer credits alongside Wind and Hassas as &quot;J. Wind, Quickmix &amp; O. Jeglitza&quot; for Freshline. In reality, Jeglitza only had a minor songwriting role on the team, and strictly provided rap vocals for the song productions. In 1993, he became the front man of the project.

The first single from the project was a cover version of the hit &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; by Technotronic featuring new rap verses from Jeglitza. The single was released in 1989 and distributed by ZYX Records in Germany where it reached No. 16 on the singles chart. Following the unexpected success of the single, Wind took over the management of Freshline Records, and became the leading producer and composer behind the project. The follow-up releases were hip house style records. &quot;It&#x27;s On You&quot; debuted in 1990 and became a top hit in Germany and a success in other European territories. The single was particularly successful in France, where it had earned silver status for selling 200,000 units. The growing success of the two singles motivated ZYX Records to request a live act, and a music video for &quot;It&#x27;s On You&quot;. A Frenchman of African descent named George Shampro Mario was hired to be M.C. Sar, and to act as the front man and rapper for the project. Unbeknownst to the public, he was really a lip-sync artist, who was miming the rap vocals of Jeglitza for the live performances and the music video. During this early stage of the project, Jeglitza remained completely anonymous. The American singer, Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Petersen, sang the choruses on the single and fronted the project with Mario. Four more singles (&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, &quot;Make a Move&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, and &quot;No Showbo&quot;) and an album (&quot;On the Move!)&quot; were later released. Each of these follow-up releases failed commercially. In 1992, Freshline ended their relationship with ZYX Records.

===1993–1995: Mainstream success with &quot;Another Night&quot;===
In late 1992, Freshline had formed a new partnership deal with Hansa Records (BMG Berlin) to release new music for the project. After a deal was finalized, Wind immediately began planning out a success strategy for the project, with Hansa&#x27;s A&amp;R executive, David Brunner and BMG President Andy Selleneit. The three then made a creative decision to change the musical style of the project from hip house to Eurodance and pop. Wind and Hassas wrote and produced the new single &quot;Another Night&quot; while Jeglitza wrote his rap verses. A producer duo known as the Berman Brothers (siblings Frank and Christian Berman) recommended to Wind their session singer, Karin Kasar, for the singing choruses. After hearing a demo of her voice, Wind selected her for the role. In exchange for her participation in the project, the brothers made a deal with Wind to be listed as producers with Freshline as Freshline &amp; The Berman Brothers. They also made a deal with Wind to make the remixes for the single. A mix created by the brothers was selected to be the official single version of the song. Petersen remained the front woman and mimed Kasar&#x27;s vocals for live performances and the music video for the new single. Wind and Brunner then decided to remove Mario from the project. Jeglitza was then promoted into a front man role alongside Petersen thus making the project a duo act. Brunner organized the marketing, promotion, distribution, sales strategies for the single and was credited as executive producer under the alias &quot;D.N.B.&quot;

When released in the Summer of 1993, &quot;Another Night&quot; was only a minor hit in Europe reaching No. 18 in Germany and barely making the Top 100 in several other countries. Shortly after the release of the single, Wind and Hassas produced the Maxx hit &quot;Get-A-Way&quot; under the alias &quot;The Movement&quot;. Brunner distributed the single through Intercord. When released in October 1993, the single became a major commercial success in Europe alongside the growing success of &quot;Another Night&quot;.

By mid-1994, M.C. Sar &amp; The Real McCoy had begun to achieve notable success on the charts alongside the massive success of the Maxx hits: &quot;Get-A-Way&quot; and No More (I Can&#x27;t Stand It)&quot;. Thanks to the promotional efforts of BMG Canada, &quot;Another Night&quot; had suddenly hit No. 1 on the Canadian dance/urban chart in March 1994 and had remained on the chart for several weeks. The follow-up singles &quot;Automatic Lover (Call for Love)&quot; and &quot;Run Away&quot; and the album &quot;Space Invaders&quot; were then released in Europe. After noticing how quickly &quot;Another Night&quot; had reached No. 1 on the Canadian dance/urban chart, Arista Records CEO Clive Davis became interested in bringing M.C. Sar &amp; The Real McCoy to the U.S. market. Davis had previously had success making the Swedish pop group Ace of Base a hit the U.S., and sought to do the same with M.C. Sar &amp; The Real McCoy.

After a deal was finalized between Arista and BMG, the project name was shortened to Real McCoy and &quot;Another Night&quot; was released in the U.S. in mid 1994. The single had peaked at No. 3 in the U.S. by November 1994, and had quickly reached platinum status. The follow-up single release of &quot;Run Away&quot; was also a successful hit in the U.S. reaching gold status. Thanks to the success of the two hits, an all new U.S. release of the &quot;Space Invaders&quot; album was quickly planned for 1995. The project was officially re-branded as a trio act featuring Jeglitza, Petersen and newcomer Vanessa Mason. The &quot;Space Invaders&quot; album was re-titled &quot;Another Night&quot;. The cover art, imagery and marketing for the album was completely changed to present a lighter romantic tone. Several tracks from the album were removed for the new release. Davis commissioned a new team of producers to write and produce three new covers songs (&quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot;, &quot;Ooh Boy&quot;, &quot;If You Should Ever Be Lonely (Deep in the Night)&quot;), along with an original track (Sleeping with an Angel) for the album. The new production team included: songwriters Billy Steinberg &amp; Rick Nowels, producer Shep Pettibone and the Lemon Productions team (Per Adebratt, Douglas Carr &amp; Tony Ekman).

Thanks to the promotional efforts of Arista along with the popularity of &quot;Another Night&quot; and &quot;Run Away&quot;, the album reached double platinum status and became a mainstream commercial success in 1995. &quot;Come and Get Your Love&quot; was released as the third Real McCoy single and reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play chart. &quot;Automatic Lover (Call for Love)&quot; was also released late in 1995 as a fourth single but saw lesser success peaking at No. 52 on the chart. The &quot;Space Invaders&quot; track &quot;Love &amp; Devotion&quot; was released in Europe and Australia as a Real McCoy single. It earned gold status in Australia and peaked at No. 11 in the United Kingdom. While Real McCoy&#x27;s success was at its peak in 1995, the Maxx project had quickly begun to decline in Europe due to the lack of new hits on the European charts. By the end of 1995, the project had permanently disbanded.

===1997–1998: Group decline after &quot;One More Time&quot; album===
In 1997, the follow-up album &quot;One More Time&quot; was released. Singer Lisa Cork was recruited as a replacement for Petersen and Kasar. Wind produced the album without Hassas or Brunner&#x27;s involvement and instead worked with the Lemon Productions team (Adebratt, Carr &amp; Ekman) and songwriter/producer Brent Argovitz. The Berman Brothers produced a cover of Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;(If You&#x27;re Not in It for Love) I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; for the album, while also making new remixes for the singles. For promotional reasons, Jeglitza was credited as an executive producer alongside Davis. The lead single from the album, (also called &quot;One More Time&quot;), reached No. 3 in Australia and achieved platinum status but saw lesser success in the U.S. peaking at No. 27 on the chart. The follow-up singles &quot;I Wanna Come (with You)&quot; and the Shania Twain cover &quot;(If You&#x27;re Not in It for Love) I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; failed to chart and were also commercial failures. The disappointing commercial sales of the album and the final singles lead to the quick demise of the lineup in 1997. In 1998, BMG re-released the original &quot;Space Invaders&quot; album, under the title &quot;Real McCoy – Love &amp; Devotion&quot; in Germany.

===1999–2015: Real McCoy continuation and hiatus===
In 1999 and 2000, two new Real McCoy singles were released with an all new line-up. Rapper Jason Ammon and singers Gabriele Koopmans and Ginger Maria Kamphuis were marketed as the &#x27;new&#x27; Real McCoy. The first single released with the new line-up was a re-recorded version of &quot;It&#x27;s On You&quot;. Koopmans and Kamphuis recorded new vocals for the song, while Jeglitza re-recorded his original rap verses. A music video was filmed for the single in Miami, Florida, starring Ammon, Koopmans and Kamphuis with a cameo from Jeglitza. Ammon mimed Jeglitza&#x27;s rap vocals in the music video. A second single titled &quot;Hey Now&quot; was released in 2000, featuring rap from Ammon and singing from Koopmans and Kamphuis. Both singles became commercial failures resulting in the demise of the new line-up.

After a long hiatus, Jeglitza (under the name Real McCoy) collaborated with the Polish band Ich Troje in 2006 to create the song &quot;Follow My Heart&quot;. Jeglitza and the band represented Poland at the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. The song, however, failed to qualify for the grand final. In early 2007, a new Real McCoy song titled &quot;People Are Still Having Sex&quot; was released in Germany. The single was a cover of the famous LaTour single of the same name.

In August 2009, Jeglitza performed as Real McCoy with singers Debbie Butts and Gemma Louise Sampson for DJ BoBo&#x27;s &quot;DJ BoBo and Friends&quot; concert in Engelberg, Switzerland. Jeglitza also recorded the track &quot;Two Hearts&quot; with Butts and Sampson, but the track was never released officially.

===2016–2020: Return of Karin Kasar and Real McCoy revival===
In 2016, Jeglitza returned again as Real McCoy with the original studio singer Karin Kasar. As a live duo act, Jeglitza and Kasar performed as Real McCoy at 1990s festivals worldwide.

===2020-present: Kasar&#x27;s departure and line up changes===
In January 2020, Karin Kasar revealed on her Instagram page that she was retiring from performing with the group. Real McCoy remained dormant for much of 2020 and 2021, with a handful of performances in the latter year with O-Jay as the sole member. In late 2021, Real McCoy announced that they would be returning for performances in 2022 with O-Jay, producer/hypeman K.I.S.T.E, and new vocalists Sara Mosquera and Mac. In December 2023, the band released a new single called &quot;Magnify&quot;.

<text>Jing Ke (died 227 BC) was a &quot;youxia&quot; during the late Warring States period of Ancient China. As a retainer of Crown Prince Dan of the Yan state, he was infamous for his failed assassination attempt on King Zheng of the Qin state, who later became Qin Shi Huang, the Qin Dynasty&#x27;s first emperor (from 221 BC to 210 BC). His story is told in the chapter titled &quot;Biographies of Assassins&quot; (刺客列傳) in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;.

==Background==
In 230 BC, the Qin state began conquering other states as part of King Zheng&#x27;s ambition to unify the country under one rule. The Qin army, having already achieved absolute military supremacy over the other states since 260 BC, first successfully annihilated the state of Han, the weakest of the Seven Warring States. Two years later, the once-formidable Zhao state was also conquered in 228 BC.

Zhao&#x27;s northeastern neighbor, the Yan state was next in line to be threatened by Qin expansion. In exchange for peace, King Xi of Yan had earlier forced his son Crown Prince Dan to be held a diplomatic hostage in the Qin, but Prince Dan returned knowing that Qin was far stronger than Yan and would attack it sooner or later.

Jing Ke originally came from the minor Wey state. He was of the clan name Qing (庆氏) of the ancestral name Jiang (姜姓) and a distant descendant of Wukui of Qi, had good education and was proficient in the art of the sword. His homeland of Wey was annexed by Qin in 239 BC, and Jing Ke fled to Yan. A &quot;youxia&quot; named Tian Guang (田光) first introduced him to Prince Dan. There Jing Ke accepted the hospitality of Prince Dan, who, as a last resort, decided to send an assassin against the King of Qin. The plan involved either kidnapping the king and forcing him to release the territories from his control; or failing this, killing him. The expectation in either case was that Qin would be left disorganized, enabling the other remaining major states to unite against its conquest.

== Assassination plot ==
=== Planning ===
In 228 BC, the Qin army was already at the Zhao capital of Handan, and was waiting to approach the state of Yan. Jing Ke agreed to go to Qin and pretend to be a nobleman begging for mercy. According to events at the time, Dukang (督亢) (in present-day Hebei Province) was the first part of the Yan state that the Qin wanted, by reason of its fertile farmland. The plan was to present as gifts the map of Dukang and the severed head of the traitorous Qin general Fan Yuqi (identified as Huan Yi by Yang Kuan) to the king of Qin, in order to approach him.

At the time, General Fan Yuqi (Huan Yi) had lost favor with Qin and wanted revenge against it; whereas the Qin state put a bounty on capturing him of 1,000 gold pieces. Jing Ke went to Huan himself to discuss the assassination plan. Fan Yuqi (Huan Yi) believed that the plan would work, and agreed to commit suicide so that his head could be collected.

Prince Dan then obtained the sharpest possible dagger, refined it with poison, and gave it to Jing Ke. To accompany him, Prince Dan assigned Qin Wuyang as his assistant. Qin Wuyang was known to have successfully committed murder at the age of 13.

In 227 BC, Prince Dan and other guests wore white clothing and white hats at the Yi River (易水) to send the pair of assassins off. Jing Ke reportedly sang a song &quot;The wind howls, and the waters of the River Yi are cold. When a hero sets out, he never returns!&quot; (風蕭蕭兮易水寒，壯士一去兮不復還). The King of Qin received the message of visitors presenting a gift to him, and was willing to receive them at the city.

=== The attempt ===

Concealing the dagger inside the map scroll, Jing Ke and Qin Wuyang represented the Yan as ambassadors and met with King Zheng. Qin Wuyang reportedly became so nervous that he acted almost paralyzed when entering the palace, and Jing Ke managed the excuse that his partner had never set eyes on the grace of Son of Heaven. Other sources suggest Jing Ke described Qin Wuyang as a rural boy who had never seen the world and was suffering a cultural shock. The panicked Qin Wuyang was then barred from moving up the palace, and Jing Ke was ordered to present the map alone.

Jing Ke approached King Zheng and politely presented the map scroll. When the King Zheng unrolled the map, Jing Ke immediately seized the revealed dagger, grabbed the king&#x27;s clothes and attacked him, who somehow managed to back away from the initial thrust by tearing off a sleeve in the process. While King Zheng fled from his attacker on foot, he attempted to draw his own sword hanging from his belt, but was unable to do so while running desperately as it was a very long ceremonial sword. None of the other Qin officials within the vicinity were armed and able to stop Jing Ke, and the guards were all stationed outside the palace and were unable to immediately reach the scene. In the confusion Jing Ke began to close in on the king, who struggled to get away from the assassin by circling behind a pillar.

Seeing the king in grave danger, a royal physician named Xia Wuju (夏無且) grabbed his own medicine bag and hurled it at Jing Ke, which slowed down the assassin just enough to allow King Zheng to recover some distance. Reminded by cries from other officials, the king managed to shift his longsword behind his back and unsheathe it from behind. Now armed, he immediately turned back and struck Jing Ke in the thigh, effectively immobilizing him. The injured Jing Ke, out of a desperate last attempt, threw his dagger towards King Zheng, only to miss the target. The king then proceeded to stab Jing Ke eight more times, mortally wounding him. Knowing it was hopelessly over, the dying Jing Ke sat with his legs stretched forward and apart (a posture then considered very rude), and used the last of his strength to taunt King Zheng with abuses. At this point, the guards had arrived at the scene to finish off both Jing Ke and the fleeing Qin Wuyang.

It was recorded that right after the incident, King Zheng sat on his throne catatonically holding the sword due to the exhaustion caused by the adrenaline rush, before he finally recovered after a short while and thanked the physician Xia Wuju for attempting to stop the assassin.

==Yan annihilation==
After Jing Ke&#x27;s attempt, the Qin army general Wang Jian was sent against the Yan state. In 226 BC, Prince Dan sent his army to fight at Ji (薊), but were soon defeated. In an effort to try to appease the King of Qin, King Xi of Yan put his son to death; however, the Yan were annexed and destroyed nonetheless.

== In popular culture ==
*The 1996 Chinese historical film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Shadow&quot; features Jing Ke&#x27;s assassination attempt.
*The Chinese film &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot; (1999), featuring Gong Li and others, is based on the aforementioned events.
* The 2002 Chinese epic &quot;Hero&quot; is a highly fictionalized take on Jing Ke&#x27;s attempted assassination.
* Nobel laureate Mo Yan wrote a play in 2003, entitled &quot;Our Jing Ke&quot; (我们的荆轲), which retells the story of Jing Ke&#x27;s failed assassination attempt. The play premiered in August 2011 in Beijing by Beijing People&#x27;s Art Theatre (BPAT). The play won the highest drama award in China in 2012.

<text>John Mugabi (born March 4, 1960) is a Ugandan former professional boxer who competed from 1980 to 1999. He held the WBC super-welterweight title from 1989 to 1990, and challenged twice for world titles at middleweight, including the undisputed championship.

Mugabi was part of an exceptionally talented group of light-middleweights and middleweights during a &quot;golden era&quot; of the 1980s which included Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, Wilfred Benítez, and Roberto Durán. As an amateur, Mugabi won a silver medal in the welterweight division at the 1980 Summer Olympics, and was the only medallist for Uganda at the event. He is listed #38 on &quot;Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time

== Amateur career ==
Representing Uganda, Mugabi was the Silver medalist at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, boxing in the Welterweight class. Mugabi lost to Andrés Aldama of Cuba in the final.

== Professional career ==

John Mugabi started as a professional on December 5, 1980, by knocking out Oemer Karadenis in round one in Cologne. Soon after that win, Mugabi moved to London where he became acquainted with boxing promoter Mickey Duff, an expert in boxer marketing who landed Mugabi various fights in England and built his reputation there. Mugabi won eight fights in Europe. Searching for more formidable foes, John moved to Florida where he became a favourite of American TV networks with his sensational knockouts of contenders such as Curtis Ramsey, Gary Guiden, former world champion Eddie Gazo, Curtis Parker, &quot;Frank The Animal Fletcher&quot;, Nino Gonzalez and Earl Hargrove through a display of tenacity and ferociousness. &#x27;The Beast’ as he would become known (for his ferocious attacks and untamable style—bashing his prey with overhand rights and wild left hooks) was able to fluctuate his weight between middleweight and junior middleweight. Some people lose effectiveness by changing weight classes, but not Mugabi. He was able to knock out every opponent he faced to that point of his career.

Mugabi’s first victory of note came on May 2, 1982, when he took on veteran Curtis Ramsey. It was Mugabi’s 11th bout and he took care of the American in two rounds in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 1983 was a busy calendar year for the Beast. In that year he took on Gary Guiden, who had just come off of a world championship fight against Davey Moore; Mugabi stopped him in three. Many started speculating about Mugabi’s role in the future of the Junior Middleweight and Middleweight divisions. The fact Mugabi easily made the weight at both divisions made him more intriguing than most prospects. Nicaraguan, Eddie Gazo, a former WBA Junior Middleweight Champion provided Mugabi with his first real test. Gazo went rounds with Mugabi, but ‘The Beast’ ended things the way he always did. Mugabi was simply stronger and faster tactically overwhelming the busier Gazo. In the same year, Mugabi took on Curtis Parker (a former Pennsylvania Golden Gloves amateur champion )The ‘meeting’ with Curtis Parker was on national television. Parker was an established fighter, but Mugabi’s destruction of Parker was savage. It was the first time that Parker had lost a bout by knockout.

In February 1984 Mugabi’s ability to take adversity was tested by James ‘Hard Rock’ Green. Mugabi slowly took control of the fight until it was stopped in the 10th round, with Mugabi declared the winner by technical knockout. The bout between ‘The Beast’ and Frank ‘The Animal’ Fletcher marked a quiet maturity that marked Mugabi’s transformation from being what had been dubbed a ‘banger’ with raw power to a refined tactical boxer. The Beast hurt his prey, gently testing with his jabs and then in the 4th round a couple of roundhouse punches and a haymaker travelling all the way from his waist caught Fletcher asleep—the fight ended with Fletcher’s body between the ropes.

On his way to becoming the number one contender for the middleweight title of each of the three major sanctioning bodies (WBA, WBC, and IBF), Mugabi ran roughshod over the division and finished each of his opponents inside the distance. Mugabi&#x27;s ferocity was captured by Phil Berger. Writing in the New York Times in 1986, Berger, commenting on Mugabi’s preparation for the Hagler fight noted the intensity of preparation that left his sparring partners in a &#x27;woebegone condition&#x27; and further that some did not last long enough to draw their second paycheck and left Mugabi’s training camp ‘looking like extras from &#x27;Night of the Living Dead&#x27;.

Because of his ability to fight both at junior middleweight and middleweight, fans began to talk about the possibility of him challenging either world light middleweight champion Hearns or world middleweight champion Hagler. Despite Mugabi being a mandatory contender for some time, a Hearns - Mugabi title match never materialised, as Hearns elected to move to Middleweight to challenge Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Considering his streak and Hagler&#x27;s tough battle with Hearns on April 15, 1985, some felt Mugabi had a shot at doing what eleven men before him could not: wresting Hagler&#x27;s undisputed world middleweight title from him. On March 10, 1986, Marvin ‘Marvelous’ Hagler rose to a very stiff challenge. A young, undefeated powerhouse was destroying every opponent in his path. John ‘The Beast’ Mugabi had won all of his contests by knockout—many spectacular; many in the first few rounds of the fight. He possessed incredible knockout power and provided the boxing world with an epic encounter.
The fight was the first televised by Showtime. Mugabi landed his share of blows to Hagler&#x27;s head during the early rounds. The turning point came in the sixth round when Hagler landed many heavy blows and staggered Mugabi. Mugabi fought back gamely but his early knockout wins left him ill-prepared for a long, tough fight. In the end, it was Hagler who came out the victor, with a knockout in the eleventh round. Many boxing fans consider this to have been the toughest contest of Hagler&#x27;s career. Sugar Ray Leonard&#x27;s decision to come out of retirement and challenge Hagler for the Middleweight Championship was heavily influenced by Hagler&#x27;s performance in the Mugabi fight.

After his first loss, Mugabi retired to Uganda and ballooned in weight to 190 lbs. In September 1986 he contacted Mickey Duff, stating that he was ready to fight again. Mugabi went down in weight and was given an opportunity by the WBC to win their world light middleweight title, vacated by Hearns. Once again many fans favoured him, this time against Duane Thomas, on December 5 of &#x27;86. However, Mugabi suffered a broken eye socket, the consequence of a punch in round three and the fight had to be stopped. Mugabi underwent optical surgery the next day to repair his injury.

Discouraged by two consecutive losses, Mugabi gained weight and did not fight for nearly fourteen months. In January 1988, he came back to fight Bryan Grant on the undercard of Mike Tyson&#x27;s title defence against Larry Holmes. Mugabi won by quick knockout and set off on another knockout winning streak. He became number one contender for the WBC 154 lb title in August 1988 but could not land a fight with then-champion Donald Curry. After Curry lost his title in an upset in early 1989, Mugabi was given another opportunity to become world champion by the WBC. On July 8 of that year, Mugabi finally made his dream come true, when Curry&#x27;s successor Rene Jacquot could not continue the fight due to an injury in round one in Grenoble to become the WBC light middleweight champion. After two first-round knockout wins against Ricky Stackhouse and Carlos Antunes, Mugabi, who by this time was having difficulty making the weight limit of 154 lbs, put his title on the line against Terry Norris. When Norris downed the champion for the count with a right to the jaw, Mugabi received the dubious distinction as the second fighter, after Al Singer, to both win and lose a world title by the first-round knockout when he was defeated by Norris. Showing resilience, Mugabi resurfaced with two more wins and once again found himself fighting for a world title, facing Gerald McClellan on November 20, 1991, in London for the vacant WBO middleweight championship. Mugabi looked a shadow of his former self by this time, and once again came out on the losing end, again by a first-round knockout.

Mugabi took a five-year layoff in which he moved to Australia. In 1996, he came back for the first of an eight-fight comeback. He went on to claim the Australian middleweight championship by way of a 12th-round decision over Jamie Wallace. It only took John two fights before he was in line for a world title again. In his third fight back from the loss to Norris, Mugabi would challenge Glen Kelly. That November night in 1999, marked the decline of Mugabi’s illustrious boxing career as he was again knocked out in the eighth round. Mugabi resides in Australia where among other functions he trains fighters.

When Mugabi finally retired, he had a record of 42 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, 39 wins by knockout. His 25 fight knockout win streak stands as one of the longest knockout streaks ever in boxing.

===Life after boxing===

Mugabi has a daughter, Mildred Prudence Mugabi who lives in Tampa, Florida and he has another daughter who still resides in Kampala, Uganda named Mourine Basemera Mugabi.

<text>Manning the rail is a method of saluting (or rendering honors) used by naval vessels. The custom evolved from that of &quot;manning the yards&quot;, which dates from the days of sail. On sailing ships, crew stood evenly spaced on all the yards (the spars holding the sails) and gave three cheers to honor distinguished persons. Today, the crew are stationed along the rails and superstructure of a ship when honors are rendered.

The United States Navy prescribes manning the rail as a possible honor to render to the President of the United States and for the heads of state of foreign nations. A similar but less formal ceremony is to have the crew &quot;at quarters&quot; when the ship is entering or leaving port.
Manning the rail is also the traditional way to honor the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial when it is passed by all U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Merchant Marine vessels. More recently, as foreign military vessels are entering Pearl Harbor for joint military exercises, foreign sailors have participated in the traditional manning the rails. Notable instances occurred on July 24, 1997, when the guided-missile destroyer and the frigate rendered honors to the during her 200th birthday celebration, and on September 14, 2001, when the crew of the German destroyer &quot;Lütjens&quot; manned the rails as they approached the destroyer and displayed an American flag and a banner reading &quot;We Stand By You&quot;.

<text>The Real McCoys is an American sitcom starring Walter Brennan, Richard Crenna, and Kathleen Nolan. Co-produced by Danny Thomas&#x27;s Marterto Productions in association with Walter Brennan and Irving Pincus&#x27;s Westgate Company, it was broadcast for six seasons: five by the ABC-TV network, from 1957 to 1962; and a final season by CBS, 1962–1963. Set in California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley, it was filmed at Desilu studios in Hollywood.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Real McCoys&quot; concerns the lives of a family originally from the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, from a fictional place named Smokey Corners. They relocated to California to live and work on a farm they inherited from Ben McCoy, brother to patriarch Amos McCoy. The family included Grandpa Amos (Walter Brennan), his grandson Luke (Richard Crenna), Luke&#x27;s new wife Kate (Kathleen Nolan), Luke&#x27;s teenage sister Tallahassie &quot;Hassie&quot; (Lydia Reed), and her 11-year-old brother &quot;Little Luke&quot; (Michael Winkelman). The double naming of the brothers is explained in the first full episode (&quot;Californy, Here We Come&quot;), when the elder Luke introduces Little Luke to Pepino Garcia (Tony Martinez) and says, &quot;Well, you see, in the excitement of having him, Ma and Pa plum forgot they already had me.&quot; Only Crenna appeared in all 225 episodes.

The former West Virginians join the Grange farm association and hire Pepino when he informs them he was Ben&#x27;s foreman. In the episode broadcast January 8, 1962, Pepino becomes an American citizen and assumes the surname &quot;McCoy.&quot; The McMichaels, a brother and sister played by Andy Clyde and Madge Blake in 29 and 21 episodes, respectively, lived on the hill near the McCoys. Amos McCoy and George McMichael, both crotchety old men, sometimes quarreled, often about their games of checkers and horseshoes. Kate is friendly with Flora McMichael, George&#x27;s sister, and becomes involved with life in the community.

Although still in her 20s, Kate serves as a mother figure for Luke&#x27;s younger siblings, Hassie and Little Luke. Many episodes have a moral theme consistent with the conservative opinions of Walter Brennan.

Jon Lormer was cast seven times as an actor for &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; during 1959 and 1960, six as the character Sam Watkins. Joan Blondell appeared three times near the end of the series as Aunt Win. Marjorie Bennett was cast three times as Amanda Comstock. Pat Buttram and Howard McNear also appeared three times; they were subsequently cast as Eustace Haney on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Green Acres&quot; and as Floyd the Barber on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Olin Howland and Willard Waterman appeared five times each as Charley Perkins and Mac Maginnis, respectively.

Early in the series, Charles Lane, who often appeared in a character role on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, was cast twice as Harry Poulson, a fast-talking egg salesman; Hassie McCoy has an interest in Harry&#x27;s son. During 1963, Jack Oakie appeared three times in the role of Uncle Rightly. Dick Elliott was cast twice as Doc Thornton, and Lurene Tuttle appeared twice as Gladys Purvis, the widowed mother of series character Kate McCoy, with Jay Novello in one of those appearances as Gladys&#x27; intended second husband, a retired photographer from Fresno.

Malcolm Cassell appeared several times as Hassie McCoy&#x27;s boyfriend, Tommy. Edward Everett Horton (the narrator of &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;) played J. Luther Medwick, the grandfather of Hassie&#x27;s other boyfriend, Jerry; Medwick and Amos soon clash. Verna Felton, a member of the &quot;December Bride&quot; cast, appeared once as Cousin Naomi Vesper. Jesse White, known later as the actor portraying the Maytag repairman for television commercials and subsequently a cast member of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;, portrayed a used car salesman named &quot;San Fernando Harry&quot; who clashes with Amos in &quot;The New Car&quot; (October 2, 1958). On June 1, 1961, Amos, Luke, and Kate return to West Virginia for the 100th-birthday gathering of &quot;Grandmother McCoy&quot;, played by Jane Darwell. In one episode, Lee Van Cleef played an Air Force Security Guard; in another Tom Skerritt appeared as a letter carrier.

The episode &quot;The Tycoon&quot; (August 30, 1960) four years later coincidentally shared the title of Brennan&#x27;s next ABC sitcom, &quot;The Tycoon&quot;, with his co-actor Van Williams. Barbara Stanwyck made a cameo appearance in the 1959 episode &quot;The McCoys Go To Hollywood&quot;, which also features Dorothy Provine, and a glimpse of the Desilu Studios, where the series was filmed. In 1961, Fay Wray is featured in the episode &quot;Theatre in the Barn&quot;, as herself. She volunteers to direct a local amateur production to raise money for the Grange.

On February 23, 1961, while working on &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, Kathleen Nolan was thrown from a horse and seriously injured. Her character of Kate was off the series for several months. Hassie left home to attend college, and Little Luke joined the United States Army. For the final season Hassie appeared only in the first episode; Little Luke was never seen again. Amos McCoy did not appear in the last eleven episodes; he was said to be back visiting family in West Virginia. Luke was a widower, and many of the stories concerned Grandpa trying to find him a new wife. This nearly succeeded when Luke met Louise Howard, portrayed by Janet De Gore, a widow with a young son, Greg, played by Butch Patrick, later of CBS&#x27;s series &quot;The Munsters&quot;, a relationship which continued through the end of the series.

<doc id="188472" wikidata="Q123025" url="?curid=188472" title="Level 42">
<text>Level 42 are an English jazz-funk band formed on the Isle of Wight in 1979. They had a number of UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.

Their highest-charting single in the UK was &quot;Lessons in Love&quot;, which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, &quot;Something About You&quot;, was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

After much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42&#x27;s commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001.

==History==
===1979–1980: Prehistory and formation===
Mark King and the Gould brothers (Phil and Rowland, the latter generally known by his nickname Boon) were all brought up on the Isle of Wight and played together in various bands during their teenage years. Phil Gould went on to study at London&#x27;s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where he met keyboard player Mike Lindup in a percussion course. Both musicians found that they had the same feelings about musical heroes: Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Keith Jarrett and Jan Hammer.

By 1979, Phil Gould and Mark King were both based in London and became involved in Robin Scott&#x27;s pop project M. While working with M, they became acquainted with Afro-French keyboard player Wally Badarou, who played synthesizer on M&#x27;s US number one single &quot;Pop Muzik&quot;. In late 1979, Phil Gould introduced Mark King and Mike Lindup to each other, and all of them began playing together in loose rehearsal sessions, developing their own jazz-funk fusion style. The developing band&#x27;s original guitarist was Dominic Miller (later to find fame playing with Sting), but he was replaced by Boon Gould on the latter&#x27;s return from working in the United States.

Initially, instrumental roles were flexible, with Boon Gould also playing bass guitar and saxophone and Lindup doubling on keyboards and drums. Mark King was primarily a drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and quick learner, he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his own take on the style in a matter of weeks.

The developing band (at this point, entirely an instrumental act) took the name Level 42 and settled on a working line-up of King (bass guitar, percussion), Lindup (keyboards, percussion), Boon Gould (guitar, saxophone) and Phil Gould (drums). The name of the band is a reference to the novel &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, in which &quot;42&quot; is the answer to &quot;the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.&quot; Having maintained their links with Wally Badarou, Phil Gould and Mark King invited him to work with Level 42. Although he never formally joined the band, Badarou would become a fifth member in all but name: co-writing songs, playing keyboards and synthesizers in the studio and co-producing the records.

===1980–1983: Early albums (&quot;Level 42&quot;, &quot;The Early Tapes&quot;, &quot;The Pursuit of Accidents&quot;)===
After they were seen jamming together, Level 42 were invited to sign to Elite Records (a small independent label) in 1980. They were also encouraged to branch out into vocal music. Having considered recruiting a singer, the band eventually settled on giving King and Lindup the vocal role. The two men developed a complementary style, with Lindup&#x27;s falsetto frequently used for harmonies and choruses while King&#x27;s deep tenor led the verses (although Lindup would also sing entire songs on his own). Lyrics were generally written by the Gould brothers while King, Badarou and Lindup concentrated on Level 42&#x27;s music.

The Elite Records single &quot;Love Meeting Love&quot; brought the band to the attention of Polydor Records, with whom they signed their second recording contract. In 1981, they released their first Polydor single, &quot;Love Games&quot;, which became a Top 40 hit. They then cut their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, which was an immediate success throughout Europe. 

The band quickly established themselves as concert favourites on the budding British and European jazz-funk scene, taking advantage of the musical expertise and performance skills of all four members. Polydor capitalised on the band&#x27;s success by releasing a second album, &quot;The Early Tapes&quot; later in the same year. This was a compilation of material from the Elite Records period (and is also known by an alternate name, &quot;Strategy&quot;).

In 1982, Level 42 released their third album &quot;The Pursuit of Accidents&quot;. This was a further development of the Level 42 formula, maintaining their instrumental jazz-funk skills and styling but also experimenting further with pop songs. Both of the singles from the album — &quot;Weave Your Spell&quot; and &quot;The Chinese Way&quot; — charted. The latter, in particular, rose high in the charts and gained the band a much wider audience than before.

===1983–1985: Moving towards pop (&quot;Standing in the Light&quot; and &quot;True Colours&quot;)===

A fourth album, &quot;Standing in the Light&quot;, was released in 1983. Produced by Larry Dunn and Verdine White (of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire), this album began a new era for the band, being less experimental and less jazzy than previous releases. It provided them with their first UK Top Ten hit, &quot;The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)&quot;. Notably, the album featured no instrumental tracks, with the band now focusing heavily on songs. (The band would not release another instrumental on an album until 1988&#x27;s &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;).

The 1984 album &quot;True Colours&quot; continued the band&#x27;s development away from primarily jazz-funk based music, switching between funk, power pop, mid-tempo rock and moody ballads. It yielded the singles &quot;The Chant Has Begun&quot; and &quot;Hot Water&quot;. The latter was a Top 20 hit in Britain and a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands where the band became popular (the song also reached No. 7 in Belgium). During the same year, Mark King released his first solo album &quot;Influences&quot; on which he played the majority of the instruments (with a guest appearance by Aswad&#x27;s Drummie Zeb, and with Lindup guesting on additional keyboards).

Level 42 became known for their power as a live band (as showcased on the 1985 double live album &quot;A Physical Presence&quot;). For live gigs the band added saxophonist Krys Mach, who toured with the group from 1984 to 1988 and contributed to some album recordings.

===1985–1987: Worldwide fame (&quot;World Machine&quot; and &quot;Running in the Family&quot;) and split of original line-up===

By this time, the band were well established in their mainstream pop/rock sound, as evidenced on their next studio album, &quot;World Machine&quot;, released later in 1985. King&#x27;s dextrous bass playing and Lindup and Badarou&#x27;s chugging keyboards acted as templates for pop songs such as &quot;Something About You&quot; and &quot;Leaving Me Now&quot;, which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).

Significantly, &quot;Something About You&quot; was also their first (and only) US Top 10 the following year; also reaching the Top 5 in Canada and the Top 20 in Italy and New Zealand. &quot;Leaving Me Now&quot; was the second hit from this album, peaking at No. 15 in the United Kingdom but proving less successful in Europe. Elements of Level 42&#x27;s roots could still be found in the funky &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot; and &quot;Dream Crazy&quot; on the UK version of the album, as well as a long instrumental track named &quot;Hell,&quot; which was also recorded during the &quot;World Machine&quot; sessions (This last track did not see the light of day until the early 2000s as an MP3 download on the original Napster).

&quot;World Machine&quot; gained positive reviews from critics, with AllMusic journalist William Cooper, in a retrospective review, describing it as &quot;one of the finest pop albums of the mid-&#x27;80s.&quot; During the recording of the album, the first major tensions between Phil Gould and Mark King began to surface over musical direction, production and their personal relationship. This clashing led to Gould leaving the band for a week. Allan Holdsworth&#x27;s drummer Gary Husband was lined up as a potential replacement, but Gould and King&#x27;s dispute was subsequently patched up and the group went on to enjoy their most successful year to date.

Released in early 1986 (and initially recorded to keep up the band&#x27;s European chart momentum while the band was busy touring the United States), &quot;Lessons in Love&quot; was an international hit and became Level 42&#x27;s biggest selling single. It gave the band their first number one in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and South Africa, increasing the band&#x27;s popularity considerably. It also placed at No. 2 in Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, No. 3 in the UK and in Ireland, No. 4 in Austria, No. 10 in Norway, No. 12 in the US in 1987, No. 18 in New Zealand and No. 22 in France). 

&quot;Lessons in Love&quot; became the lead single on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Running in the Family&quot; album, recorded to capitalise on the impact. With the band now at the peak of their success, the album added further gloss to Level 42&#x27;s polished pop sound (despite adding to Phil Gould&#x27;s disquiet). Further singles from the album continued and built on the band&#x27;s existing profile: &quot;To Be With You Again&quot; (No. 6 in the Netherlands and in Ireland), the ballad &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot; (No. 3 in Ireland and No. 7 in the Netherlands) and &quot;Running In The Family&quot;″s title track (No. 1 in Denmark, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 7 in Norway and No. 9 in New Zealand). The album itself was a major international success, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries.

By now a leading British pop band, Level 42 played at the Prince&#x27;s Trust concert in June 1987, with Eric Clapton standing in on lead guitar for a performance of &quot;Running in the Family&quot;. King and Lindup also performed with artists including Ben E. King on &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and George Harrison and Ringo Starr on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;.

Despite the success, Level 42 were on the brink of splitting up. Although Phil Gould was the most visibly dissatisfied member, it was Boon Gould who was the first to leave, departing in late 1987, following a support slot on a Madonna tour. The quietest member of the band, Boon surprised both King and Lindup with his sudden departure. However, he had been suffering from nervous exhaustion and also wanted to leave the lifestyle of a constantly touring musician in order to settle down and spend more time with his wife and children. Boon&#x27;s relationship with the band remained amicable and, although he would not return to Level 42 as a performing or recording member, he continued to write lyrics for the band following his departure. He was temporarily replaced by Paul Gendler (an experienced session player who had previously been the guitarist for Modern Romance) for a six-week headlining tour and for further support slots with Tina Turner.

In December 1987, midway through the tour, Phil Gould left Level 42 permanently. Like his brother, he was suffering from exhaustion, but his relationship with King had broken down once again and they now found it difficult to work together. Phil was also reportedly dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s direction in terms of their newer &quot;pop&quot; sound, and King and Lindup failed to convince him to stay. To complete the tour dates, the band hired Prefab Sprout drummer Neil Conti to fill in.

===1988–1989: The second line-up (&quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;)===

Following the tour, Level 42 recruited Gary Husband as the band&#x27;s new full-time drummer. He in turn recommended Steve Topping as a replacement guitarist. However, Topping and King&#x27;s personalities clashed and Topping eventually left the band in early 1988 after initial writing and rehearsing sessions in Dublin. Most of the next Level 42 album, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, was recorded without a permanent guitarist. Rhythm guitar on the studio recordings was handled either by the band&#x27;s old friend Dominic Miller or by an uncredited Mark King. In April 1988, towards the end of the sessions, the band recruited lead guitarist Alan Murphy (a session guitarist who had worked extensively with Kate Bush and had also been a member of Go West).

&quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; was released in 1988, reaching number 2 in the UK and the top ten in several European charts. It included the hit-single &quot;Heaven in My Hands&quot; (number 12 in the UK and also top twenty in the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland). Boon Gould had co-written many of the tracks with King, Lindup and Badarou, while Gary Husband was credited with his first co-write with King on &quot;Tracie&quot; (a tribute to King&#x27;s childhood sweetheart). To promote the album, Level 42 embarked on a four-month European tour, culminating in six sell-out nights at Wembley Arena. These latter dates were recorded for what would become the band&#x27;s second live album, &quot;Live At Wembley&quot; (eventually released in 1996).

Although the band seemed to have maintained their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they were about to be hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown to the rest of Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something which he himself may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy&#x27;s reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.

Devastated, Level 42 took a year off to regroup and rethink. To cover the gap and to fulfil the band&#x27;s contract with Polydor Records, &quot;Level Best&quot; (a greatest hits compilation) was released at the end of 1989; also marking a decade since the band&#x27;s beginnings. During the break, Mike Lindup also recorded and released his debut solo album, &quot;Changes&quot; (featuring Dominic Miller, Pino Palladino on bass and Manu Katché on drums).

===1990–1992: Third and fourth lineups – &quot;Guaranteed&quot; album, Allan Holdsworth and Jakko Jakszyk===

The band signed a new contract with RCA Records in 1990, for whom they produced their next album, &quot;Guaranteed&quot;. Although most of the rhythm guitar work was once again handled by Dominic Miller, Gary Husband asked Allan Holdsworth to provide some guitar work (notably on &quot;A Kinder Eye&quot;). As well as drumming, Husband also played keyboards and increased his songwriting role, co-writing many tracks with King, Lindup and Badarou. The album features the only track entirely written by Husband – &quot;If You Were Mine&quot; – which also featured on the &quot;Guaranteed&quot; single release. Mark King also collaborated with lyricists Drew Barfield and George Green to expand the songwriting. &quot;Guaranteed&quot; was well received by American music critics. However, the album did not get good reviews in the UK (despite reaching No. 3 in the UK charts while the title track reached No. 17 in the singles charts) and was ultimately less commercially successful than previous efforts.

In December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band&#x27;s recent hiatus. The concerts featured Allan Holdsworth (whom Husband had asked to play as a favour while the band searched for a permanent guitarist) plus four additional players: Lyndon Connah (ex-64 Spoons) on additional keyboards and percussion and sharing backing vocals with Annie McCaig, plus the horn section from the &quot;Guaranteed&quot; album (John Thirkell and Gary Barnacle).

After the recording of &quot;Guaranteed&quot; and a week-long promotional tour, Level 42 were in need of a permanent guitarist. Mark King assumed (erroneously) that Allan Holdsworth would not be interested in taking the position. Instead the band recruited well-respected art-pop guitarist, session player and sometime solo artist Jakko Jakszyk: the former frontman for 64 Spoons, he&#x27;d also collaborated with Tom Robinson, Sam Brown and Stewart/Gaskin among others. Although he did not play on &quot;Guaranteed&quot;, Jakszyk appeared on the album&#x27;s cover photo and took part in promotional duties and the tour for the album, as well as playing on two B-sides from this era (&quot;At This Great Distance&quot; and &quot;As Years Go By&quot;). Unlike Husband, Jakszyk never became a full legal member of the band (apparently due to &quot;record company politics&quot;). 

Following the end of promotion for &quot;Guaranteed&quot;, the King-Lindup-Husband-Jakszyk line-up began writing and recording new material together, with at least two songs (&quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Free Your Soul&quot;) completed. Following the next development in the band&#x27;s history, this work was shelved and remains unreleased.

===1993–1994: Fifth and sixth lineups (including brief return of Phil Gould), &quot;Forever Now&quot; and disbandment===

In early 1993, Gary Husband left Level 42, leading to the return of group founder member Phil Gould as Level 42&#x27;s drummer (and principal lyricist) for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Forever Now&quot; album. Further changes to the band were evident in that Jakko Jakszyk did not play on the album: all guitars were performed by the American session guitarist Danny Blume (erroneously credited as &quot;Danny Bloom&quot;).

Although &quot;Forever Now&quot; was a critical success, the reunion of Gould and the group was short-lived. When Level 42 began to promote the new album (with Jakszyk returning to the live band for concerts and TV appearances), Gould played only one promotional gig and did not go on the road for the &quot;Forever Now&quot; tour. He was replaced as live drummer by Jakszyk&#x27;s friend and frequent collaborator Gavin Harrison (who later played drums for both Porcupine Tree and King Crimson as well as remaining an esteemed studio player). 

It was announced halfway through the &quot;Forever Now&quot; tour, on the day of the Manchester Apollo gig, that the band would be disbanding permanently following their concert commitments. Level 42 played their last gig at the Albert Hall in London on 14 October 1994. According to Jakszyk, the band recorded tapes for a live album during the final 1994 shows at the Albert Hall and the Brighton Dome which &quot;sounded fantastic&quot;, but the album was never released.

===1996–2000: Mark King&#x27;s solo years===

In 1996, Mark King signed to Virgin Records and released a solo single &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; (with Lyndon Connah playing keyboards). This was followed up by his second solo album, &quot;One Man&quot;, featuring lyrics by Boon Gould. The album was not commercially successful.

King later toured as a solo act, playing both his own new compositions and some Level 42 songs. In 1999, he played some shows at The Jazz Café in London under the name of &quot;The Mark King Group&quot; with a band including Husband, Jakszyk and Lyndon Connah. Jakszyk left the band after the Jazz Café shows, to be replaced on guitar by Nathan King (Mark King&#x27;s younger brother). King continued to tour with this band, now renamed &quot;Grupo Mark King&quot;, over the next couple of years, augmenting the line-up with saxophone player Sean Freeman.

In August 1999, three-quarters of the original Level 42 line-up reunited for a private show. Phil Gould invited some musician friends to play at a party, including his brother Boon and Mike Lindup. In 2001, Mark King, Mike Lindup and Phil Gould played together at Lindup&#x27;s wedding for the first time in ten years.

===2001–2005: Return of Level 42 (seventh lineup)===

Although Mark King released two solo albums, his previous band&#x27;s music proved to be persistently popular and he found that he was playing more and more old Level 42 tracks at live shows. 

In late 2001, King came to a business agreement with Mike Lindup and bought the rights to the name Level 42. Although Lindup agreed to play on future albums, he did not want to tour. King announced the return of Level 42 with a new line-up which also happened to be the musicians from his current live band: himself, Husband, Connah, Freeman and Nathan King. On 12 July 2002, the first official Level 42 concert for six years was played at The Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex. While not recording any new material, for the next few years the band settled into a regular pattern of touring and playing old hits. 

On 13 February 2005 there was a brief one-night reunion with Mike Lindup (who joined the band onstage for a date at The Forum in London) and over the course of the year there was a burst of reissue activity. Two Rockpalast shows from 1983 and 1984 were released on DVD, followed by two CD releases: &quot;The River Sessions&quot; (a live show from 1983 recorded in Scotland) and a new compilation called &quot;The Ultimate Collection II&quot;. The latter included a new song called &quot;Genius Of Love&quot;, which was a Level 42 tribute/collaboration by the Italian-American dance producer Hardage, featuring Mark King on vocals and incorporating a sample of the Level 42 track &quot;I Want Eyes&quot;.

===2006–2012: &quot;Retroglide&quot; and further tours and lineup changes===

In February 2006, after twelve years without releasing a new studio album, Level 42 announced the release of &quot;Retroglide&quot;. While billed as a band album, it was chiefly recorded and produced by King at his home studio, with Gary Husband, Lyndon Connah, Sean Freeman and Nathan King all contributing. 

&quot;Retroglide&quot; also featured input from two previous Level 42 members. Erstwhile guitarist Boon Gould provided the album&#x27;s lyrics (as well as contributing a guitar solo on &quot;Ship&quot;) and the band was effectively expanded to a six-piece via extensive guest performances by Mike Lindup, who added prominent keyboard parts and vocals to many tracks. Although Phil Gould was uncredited on the album, the track &quot;Ship&quot; is the first song since 1986 worked on by all four original members, as Phil originally arranged the track with his brother Boon. However, &quot;Retroglide&quot; was also the first Level 42 album not to feature any contributions from Wally Badarou.

In May 2006, Level 42 announced that Mike Lindup would return full-time to replace Lyndon Connah on keyboards.

&quot;Retroglide&quot; was promoted via a supporting tour throughout the UK, Netherlands, Germany and several other European countries during October 2006. On 26 August 2007, Level 42 played an outdoor gig at the Arundel Festival in West Sussex: the band&#x27;s only UK show of the year. In 2008, Level 42 played a twenty-date UK tour.

In 2010, Husband stepped down as Level 42&#x27;s drummer for the second time, due to prior commitments with John McLaughlin. He was replaced by Pete Ray Biggin.

In 2012, Level 42 toured the UK and mainland Europe, in celebration of the 25th anniversary since the release of &quot;Running In The Family&quot;, by playing the whole album, with a whole array of other hits. Also included in the shows was an acoustic set, with Mike Lindup playing the accordion. In October 2012, on Mark King&#x27;s birthday during a gig in Bristol, Boon Gould joined the band on stage.

===2013–present: &quot;Sirens&quot; EP series and re-engagement with contemporary dance pop===
On 20 and 21 September 2013, Level 42 (joined by an expanded brass section), performed three new songs at London&#x27;s Indigo O2 Arena – &quot;Where&#x27;s Yo&#x27; Head At&quot;, &quot;Too Much Time&quot;, and &quot;Sirens&quot;. All of these appeared on the band&#x27;s first new release for seven years, the six-song studio EP &quot;Sirens&quot; (released on 31 October 2013, and the first output from the band&#x27;s new self-owned label Level 42 Records). Mixed by the American DJ John Morales, the EP also contained &quot;Mind On You&quot;, &quot;My Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Build Myself a Rocket&quot; (with King&#x27;s daughter Marlee providing the backing vocals on the last of these tracks). Musically, it built on the production approach of &quot;Retroglide&quot; while allying the band with contemporary developments in R&amp;B and dance electronica.

On 3 December 2013, the band announced &#x27;The Sirens Tour&#x27; – a 30 date tour, starting in October 2014 and taking in the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In the summer of 2014, the band performed at a number of festivals across Europe including headline performances at Let&#x27;s Rock Bristol and Rochester Castle. They also played at Rewind festivals. At a performance in Bournemouth, ex-drummer Gary Husband returned due to Pete Ray Biggin being unavailable.

In 2015, the band appeared at a number of UK and European festivals headlining at &#x27;Let&#x27;s Rock The Moor&#x27; and &#x27;Carfest&#x27; concerts. They also played two nights at the Indigo2 in London where the band once again featured a larger brass section consisting of Dan Carpenter (trumpet) and Nicol Thomson (trombone) as well as regular saxophonist Sean Freeman.

In 2016, Level 42 performed at a number of festivals across the UK and Europe as well as in Curaçao, Chile and Argentina before embarking on a UK, Netherlands and Scandinavian tour in order to promote the &quot;Sirens II&quot; EP.

On 1 May 2019, it was announced that Boon Gould had been found dead at his home in Dorset. He was 64.

On 4 July 2019, Level 42 made a rare North American incursion, being the band to perform the first concert to launch the week long Festival d&#x27;été de Québec (Quebec City Summer Festival).

<doc id="188479" wikidata="Q914874" url="?curid=188479" title="List of file formats">
<text>This is a list of file formats used by computers, organized by type. Filename extension is usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the file format&#x27;s name or abbreviation. Many operating systems do not limit filenames to one extension shorter than 4 characters, as was common with some operating systems that supported the File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. Examples of operating systems that do not impose this limit include Unix-like systems, and Microsoft Windows NT, 95-98, and ME which have no three character limit on extensions for 32-bit or 64-bit applications on file systems other than pre-Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 versions of the FAT file system. Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters. While MS-DOS and NT always treat the suffix after the last period in a file&#x27;s name as its extension, in UNIX-like systems, the final period does not necessarily mean that the text after the last period is the file&#x27;s extension.

Some file formats, such as codice_1 or codice_2, may be listed multiple times.

<text>The international community is a term used in geopolitics and international relations to refer to a broad group of people and governments of the world.

== Usage ==
Aside from its use as a general descriptor, the term is typically used to imply the existence of a common point of view towards such matters as specific issues of human rights. It is sometimes used in calling for action to be taken against an enemy, e.g., action against perceived political repression in a target country. The term is also commonly used to imply legitimacy and consensus for a point of view on a disputed issue, e.g., to enhance the credibility of a majority vote in the United Nations General Assembly.

==Criticism==
Several prominent legal figures and authors have argued that the term is more often used to describe a small minority of states, and not literally all nations or states in the world. According to International Criminal Court jurist Victor P. Tsilonis, it refers to &quot;the interests of the most powerful states&quot; or &quot;seven to ten states&quot;. President of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea Paik Jin-hyun and co-authors Lee Seokwoo and Kevin Tan argue that it could refer to &quot;some 20 affluent states&quot;, giving the example of those not members of the Non-Aligned Movement, while Professor Peter Burnell of the University of Warwick suggests that a number of very important states, such as China, Russia and those of the Arab and Islamic worlds, are often distant from the concept of the &quot;international community&quot; and do not necessarily endorse every initiative associated with it, for example, by abstaining from key votes in the United Nations Security Council. Noam Chomsky states that the term is used to refer to the United States and its allies and client states, as well as allies in the media of those states. British journalist Martin Jacques says: &quot;We all know what is meant by the term &#x27;international community&#x27;, don&#x27;t we? It&#x27;s the West, of course, nothing more, nothing less. Using the term &#x27;international community&#x27; is a way of dignifying the west, of globalising it, of making it sound more respectable, more neutral, and high-faluting.&quot; According to American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, the term is a euphemistic replacement for the earlier propaganda term &quot;Free World&quot;.

<text>ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed. The ZIP file format permits a number of compression algorithms, though DEFLATE is the most common. This format was originally created in 1989 and was first implemented in PKWARE, Inc.&#x27;s PKZIP utility, as a replacement for the previous ARC compression format by Thom Henderson. The ZIP format was then quickly supported by many software utilities other than PKZIP. Microsoft has included built-in ZIP support (under the name &quot;compressed folders&quot;) in versions of Microsoft Windows since 1998 via the &quot;Plus! 98&quot; addon for Windows 98. Native support was added as of the year 2000 in Windows ME. Apple has included built-in ZIP support in Mac OS X 10.3 (via BOMArchiveHelper, now Archive Utility) and later. Most free operating systems have built in support for ZIP in similar manners to Windows and macOS.

ZIP files generally use the file extensions or and the MIME media type . ZIP is used as a base file format by many programs, usually under a different name. When navigating a file system via a user interface, graphical icons representing ZIP files often appear as a document or other object prominently featuring a zipper.

== History ==
The file format was designed by Phil Katz of PKWARE and Gary Conway of Infinity Design Concepts. The format was created after Systems Enhancement Associates (SEA) filed a lawsuit against PKWARE claiming that the latter&#x27;s archiving products, named PKARC, were derivatives of SEA&#x27;s ARC archiving system. The name &quot;zip&quot; (meaning &quot;move at high speed&quot;) was suggested by Katz&#x27;s friend, Robert Mahoney. They wanted to imply that their product would be faster than ARC and other compression formats of the time. By distributing the zip file format within APPNOTE.TXT, compatibility with the zip file format proliferated widely on the public Internet during the 1990s.

PKWARE and Infinity Design Concepts made a joint press release on February 14, 1989, releasing the file format into the public domain.

=== Version history ===
The .ZIP File Format Specification has its own version number, which does not necessarily correspond to the version numbers for the PKZIP tool, especially with PKZIP 6 or later. At various times, PKWARE has added preliminary features that allow PKZIP products to extract archives using advanced features, but PKZIP products that create such archives are not made available until the next major release. Other companies or organizations support the PKWARE specifications at their own pace.

The .ZIP file format specification is formally named &quot;APPNOTE - .ZIP File Format Specification&quot; and it is published on the PKWARE.com website since the late 1990s. Several versions of the specification were not published. Specifications of some features such as BZIP2 compression, strong encryption specification and others were published by PKWARE a few years after their creation. The URL of the online specification was changed several times on the PKWARE website.

A summary of key advances in various versions of the PKWARE specification:
* 2.0: (1993) File entries can be compressed with DEFLATE and use traditional PKWARE encryption (ZipCrypto).
* 2.1: (1996) Deflate64 compression
* 4.5: (2001) Documented 64-bit zip format.
* 4.6: (2001) BZIP2 compression (not published online until the publication of APPNOTE 5.2)
* 5.0: (2002) SES: DES, Triple DES, RC2, RC4 supported for encryption (not published online until the publication of APPNOTE 5.2)
* 5.2: (2003) AES encryption support for SES (defined in APPNOTE 5.1 that was not published online) and AES from WinZip (&quot;AE-x&quot;); corrected version of RC2-64 supported for SES encryption.
* 6.1: (2004) Documented certificate storage.
* 6.2.0: (2004) Documented Central Directory Encryption.
* 6.3.0: (2006) Documented Unicode (UTF-8) filename storage. Expanded list of supported compression algorithms (LZMA, PPMd+), encryption algorithms (Blowfish, Twofish), and hashes.
* 6.3.1: (2007) Corrected standard hash values for SHA-256/384/512.
* 6.3.2: (2007) Documented compression method 97 (WavPack).
* 6.3.3: (2012) Document formatting changes to facilitate referencing the PKWARE Application Note from other standards using methods such as the JTC 1 Referencing Explanatory Report (RER) as directed by JTC 1/SC 34 N 1621.
* 6.3.4: (2014) Updates the PKWARE, Inc. office address.
* 6.3.5: (2018) Documented compression methods 16, 96 and 99, DOS timestamp epoch and precision, added extra fields for keys and decryption, as well as typos and clarifications.
* 6.3.6: (2019) Corrected typographical error.
* 6.3.7: (2020) Added Zstandard compression method ID 20.
* 6.3.8: (2020) Moved Zstandard compression method ID from 20 to 93, deprecating the former. Documented method IDs 94 and 95 (MP3 and XZ respectively).
* 6.3.9: (2020) Corrected a typo in Data Stream Alignment description.
* 6.3.10: (2022) Added several z/OS attribute values for APPENDIX B. Added several additional 3rd party Extra Field mappings.

WinZip, starting with version 12.1, uses the extension for ZIP files that use compression methods newer than DEFLATE; specifically, methods BZip, LZMA, PPMd, Jpeg and Wavpack. The last 2 are applied to appropriate file types when &quot;Best method&quot; compression is selected.

=== Standardization ===
In April 2010, ISO/IEC JTC 1 initiated a ballot to determine whether a project should be initiated to create an ISO/IEC International Standard format compatible with ZIP. The proposed project, entitled &quot;Document Packaging&quot;, envisaged a ZIP-compatible &#x27;minimal compressed archive format&#x27; suitable for use with a number of existing standards including OpenDocument, Office Open XML and EPUB.

In 2015, ISO/IEC 21320-1 &quot;Document Container File — Part 1: Core&quot; was published which states that &quot;Document container files are conforming Zip files&quot;. It requires the following main restrictions of the ZIP file format:
* Files in ZIP archives may only be stored uncompressed, or using the &quot;deflate&quot; compression (i.e. compression method may contain the value &quot;0&quot; - stored or &quot;8&quot; - deflated).
* The encryption features are prohibited.
* The digital signature features (from SES) are prohibited.
* The &quot;patched data&quot; features (from PKPatchMaker) are prohibited.
* Archives may not span multiple volumes or be segmented.

== Design ==
 files are archives that store multiple files. ZIP allows contained files to be compressed using many different methods, as well as simply storing a file without compressing it. Each file is stored separately, allowing different files in the same archive to be compressed using different methods. Because the files in a ZIP archive are compressed individually, it is possible to extract them, or add new ones, without applying compression or decompression to the entire archive. This contrasts with the format of compressed tar files, for which such random-access processing is not easily possible.

A directory is placed at the end of a ZIP file. This identifies what files are in the ZIP and identifies where in the ZIP that file is located. This allows ZIP readers to load the list of files without reading the entire ZIP archive. ZIP archives can also include extra data that is not related to the ZIP archive. This allows for a ZIP archive to be made into a self-extracting archive (application that decompresses its contained data), by prepending the program code to a ZIP archive and marking the file as executable. Storing the catalog at the end also makes possible to hide a zipped file by appending it to an innocuous file, such as a GIF image file.

The format uses a 32-bit CRC algorithm and includes two copies of each entry metadata to provide greater protection against data loss. The CRC-32 algorithm was contributed by David Schwaderer and can be found in his book &quot;C Programmers Guide to NetBIOS&quot; published by Howard W. Sams &amp; Co. Inc.

=== Structure ===
A ZIP file is correctly identified by the presence of an &quot;end of central directory record&quot; which is located at the end of the archive structure in order to allow the easy appending of new files. If the end of central directory record indicates a non-empty archive, the name of each file or directory within the archive should be specified in a &quot;central directory&quot; entry, along with other metadata about the entry, and an offset into the ZIP file, pointing to the actual entry data. This allows a file listing of the archive to be performed relatively quickly, as the entire archive does not have to be read to see the list of files. The entries within the ZIP file also include this information, for redundancy, in a &quot;local file header&quot;. Because ZIP files may be appended to, only files specified in the central directory at the end of the file are valid. Scanning a ZIP file for local file headers is invalid (except in the case of corrupted archives), as the central directory may declare that some files have been deleted and other files have been updated.

For example, we may start with a ZIP file that contains files A, B and C. File B is then deleted and C updated. This may be achieved by just appending a new file C to the end of the original ZIP file and adding a new central directory that only lists file A and the new file C. When ZIP was first designed, transferring files by floppy disk was common, yet writing to disks was very time-consuming. If you had a large zip file, possibly spanning multiple disks, and only needed to update a few files, rather than reading and re-writing all the files, it would be substantially faster to just read the old central directory, append the new files then append an updated central directory.

The order of the file entries in the central directory need not coincide with the order of file entries in the archive.

Each entry stored in a ZIP archive is introduced by a &quot;local file header&quot; with information about the file such as the comment, file size and file name, followed by optional &quot;extra&quot; data fields, and then the possibly compressed, possibly encrypted file data. The &quot;Extra&quot; data fields are the key to the extensibility of the ZIP format. &quot;Extra&quot; fields are exploited to support the ZIP64 format, WinZip-compatible AES encryption, file attributes, and higher-resolution NTFS or Unix file timestamps. Other extensions are possible via the &quot;Extra&quot; field. ZIP tools are required by the specification to ignore Extra fields they do not recognize.

The ZIP format uses specific 4-byte &quot;signatures&quot; to denote the various structures in the file. Each file entry is marked by a specific signature. The end of central directory record is indicated with its specific signature, and each entry in the central directory starts with the 4-byte &quot;central file header signature&quot;.

There is no BOF or EOF marker in the ZIP specification. Conventionally the first thing in a ZIP file is a ZIP entry, which can be identified easily by its &quot;local file header signature&quot;. However, this is not necessarily the case, as this is not required by the ZIP specification - most notably, a self-extracting archive will begin with an executable file header.

Tools that correctly read ZIP archives must scan for the end of central directory record signature, and then, as appropriate, the other, indicated, central directory records. They must not scan for entries from the top of the ZIP file, because (as previously mentioned in this section) only the central directory specifies where a file chunk starts and that it has not been deleted. Scanning could lead to false positives, as the format does not forbid other data to be between chunks, nor file data streams from containing such signatures. However, tools that attempt to recover data from damaged ZIP archives will most likely scan the archive for local file header signatures; this is made more difficult by the fact that the compressed size of a file chunk may be stored after the file chunk, making sequential processing difficult.

Most of the signatures end with the short integer 0x4b50, which is stored in little-endian ordering. Viewed as an ASCII string this reads &quot;PK&quot;, the initials of the inventor Phil Katz. Thus, when a ZIP file is viewed in a text editor the first two bytes of the file are usually &quot;PK&quot;. (DOS, OS/2 and Windows self-extracting ZIPs have an EXE before the ZIP so start with &quot;MZ&quot;; self-extracting ZIPs for other operating systems may similarly be preceded by executable code for extracting the archive&#x27;s content on that platform.)

The specification also supports spreading archives across multiple file-system files. Originally intended for storage of large ZIP files across multiple floppy disks, this feature is now used for sending ZIP archives in parts over email, or over other transports or removable media.

The FAT filesystem of DOS has a timestamp resolution of only two seconds; ZIP file records mimic this. As a result, the built-in timestamp resolution of files in a ZIP archive is only two seconds, though extra fields can be used to store more precise timestamps. The ZIP format has no notion of time zone, so timestamps are only meaningful if it is known what time zone they were created in.

In September 2006, PKWARE released a revision of the ZIP specification providing for the storage of file names using UTF-8, finally adding Unicode compatibility to ZIP.

=== File headers ===
All multi-byte values in the header are stored in little-endian byte order. All length fields count the length in bytes.

==== Local file header ====

The extra field contains a variety of optional data such as OS-specific attributes. It is divided into records, each with at minimum a 16-bit signature and a 16-bit length. A ZIP64 local file extra field record, for example, has the signature 0x0001 and a length of 16 bytes (or more) so that two 64-bit values (the uncompressed and compressed sizes) may follow. Another common local file extension is 0x5455 (or &quot;UT&quot;) which contains 32-bit UTC UNIX timestamps.

This is immediately followed by the compressed data.

==== Data descriptor ====

If the bit at offset 3 (0x08) of the general-purpose flags field is set, then the CRC-32 and file sizes are not known when the header is written. If the archive is in Zip64 format, the compressed and uncompressed size fields are 8 bytes long instead of 4 bytes long (see section 4.3.9.2). The equivalent fields in the local header (or in the Zip64 extended information extra field in the case of archives in Zip64 format) are filled with zero, and the CRC-32 and size are appended in a 12-byte structure (optionally preceded by a 4-byte signature) immediately after the compressed data:

==== Central directory file header (CDFH) ====

The central directory file header entry is an expanded form of the local header:
==== End of central directory record (EOCD) ====
After all the central directory entries comes the end of central directory (EOCD) record, which marks the end of the ZIP file:

This ordering allows a ZIP file to be created in one pass, but the central directory is also placed at the end of the file in order to facilitate easy removal of files from multiple-part &quot;(e.g. &quot;multiple floppy-disk&quot;)&quot; archives, as previously discussed.

=== Compression methods ===
The .ZIP File Format Specification documents the following compression methods: Store (no compression), Shrink (LZW), Reduce (levels 1–4; LZ77 + probabilistic), Implode, Deflate, Deflate64, bzip2, LZMA, Zstandard, WavPack, PPMd, and a LZ77 variant provided by IBM z/OS CMPSC instruction. The most commonly used compression method is DEFLATE, which is described in IETF .

Other methods mentioned, but not documented in detail in the specification include: PKWARE DCL Implode (old IBM TERSE), new IBM TERSE, IBM LZ77 z Architecture (PFS), and a JPEG variant. A &quot;Tokenize&quot; method was reserved for a third party, but support was never added.

The word &quot;Implode&quot; is overused by PKWARE: the DCL/TERSE Implode is distinct from the old PKZIP Implode, a predecessor to Deflate. The DCL Implode is undocumented partially due to its proprietary nature held by IBM, but Mark Adler has nevertheless provided a decompressor called &quot;blast&quot; alongside zlib.

=== Encryption ===
ZIP supports a simple password-based symmetric encryption system generally known as ZipCrypto. It is documented in the ZIP specification, and known to be seriously flawed. In particular, it is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, which are in some cases made worse by poor implementations of random-number generators. Computers running under native Microsoft Windows without third-party archivers can open, but not create, ZIP files encrypted with ZipCrypto, but cannot extract the contents of files using different encryption.

New features including new compression and encryption (e.g. AES) methods have been documented in the ZIP File Format Specification since version 5.2. A WinZip-developed AES-based open standard (&quot;AE-x&quot; in APPNOTE) is used also by 7-Zip and Xceed, but some vendors use other formats. PKWARE SecureZIP (SES, proprietary) also supports RC2, RC4, DES, Triple DES encryption methods, Digital Certificate-based encryption and authentication (X.509), and archive header encryption. It is, however, patented (see ).

File name encryption is introduced in .ZIP File Format Specification 6.2, which encrypts metadata stored in Central Directory portion of an archive, but Local Header sections remain unencrypted. A compliant archiver can falsify the Local Header data when using Central Directory Encryption. As of version 6.2 of the specification, the Compression Method and Compressed Size fields within Local Header are not yet masked.

=== ZIP64 ===
The original format had a 4 GB (232 bytes) limit on various things (uncompressed size of a file, compressed size of a file, and total size of the archive), as well as a limit of 65,535 (216-1) entries in a ZIP archive. In version 4.5 of the specification (which is not the same as v4.5 of any particular tool), PKWARE introduced the &quot;ZIP64&quot; format extensions to get around these limitations, increasing the limits to 16 EB (264 bytes). In essence, it uses a &quot;normal&quot; central directory entry for a file, followed by an optional &quot;zip64&quot; directory entry, which has the larger fields.

The format of the Local file header (LOC) and Central directory file header (CDFH) are the same in ZIP and ZIP64. However, ZIP64 specifies an extra field that may be added to those records at the discretion of the compressor, whose purpose is to store values that do not fit in the classic LOC or CDFH records. To signal that the actual values are stored in ZIP64 extra fields, they are set to 0xFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFF in the corresponding LOC or CDFH record. If one entry does not fit into the classic LOC or CDFH record, only that entry is required to be moved into a ZIP64 extra field. The other entries may stay in the classic record. Therefore, not all entries shown in the following table might be stored in a ZIP64 extra field. However, if they appear, their order must be as shown in the table.

On the other hand, the format of EOCD for ZIP64 is slightly different from the normal ZIP version.

It is also not necessarily the last record in the file. An End of Central Directory Locator follows (an additional 20 bytes at the end).

The File Explorer in Windows XP does not support ZIP64, but the Explorer in Windows Vista and later do. Likewise, some extension libraries support ZIP64, such as DotNetZip, QuaZIP and IO::Compress::Zip in Perl. Python&#x27;s built-in zipfile supports it since 2.5 and defaults to it since 3.4. OpenJDK&#x27;s built-in java.util.zip supports ZIP64 from version Java 7. Android Java API support ZIP64 since Android 6.0. Mac OS Sierra&#x27;s Archive Utility notably does not support ZIP64, and can create corrupt archives when ZIP64 would be required. However, the ditto command shipped with Mac OS will unzip ZIP64 files. More recent versions of Mac OS ship with info-zip&#x27;s zip and unzip command line tools which do support Zip64: to verify run zip -v and look for &quot;ZIP64_SUPPORT&quot;.

=== Combination with other file formats ===
The file format allows for a comment containing up to 65,535 (216−1) bytes of data to occur at the end of the file after the central directory. Also, because the central directory specifies the offset of each file in the archive with respect to the start, it is possible for the first file entry to start at an offset other than zero, although some tools might not process archive files that do not start with a file entry at offset zero. The program gzip, for example, happens to be able to extract an entry from a .ZIP file if it is at offset zero.

This allows arbitrary data to occur in the file both before and after the ZIP archive data, and for the archive to still be read by a ZIP application. A side-effect of this is that it is possible to author a file that is both a working ZIP archive and another format, provided that the other format tolerates arbitrary data at its end, beginning, or middle. Self-extracting archives (SFX), of the form supported by WinZip, take advantage of this, in that they are executable () files that conform to the PKZIP AppNote.txt specification, and can be read by compliant zip tools or libraries.

This property of the format, and of the JAR format which is a variant of ZIP, can be exploited to hide rogue content (such as harmful Java classes) inside a seemingly harmless file, such as a GIF image uploaded to the web. This so-called GIFAR exploit has been demonstrated as an effective attack against web applications such as Facebook.

=== Limits ===
The minimum size of a file is 22 bytes. Such an &quot;empty zip file&quot; contains only an End of Central Directory Record (EOCD):
The maximum size for both the archive file and the individual files inside it is 4,294,967,295 bytes (232−1 bytes, or 4 GB minus 1 byte) for standard ZIP. For ZIP64, the maximum size is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes (264−1 bytes, or 16 EB minus 1 byte).

=== Open extensions ===
==== Seek-optimized (SOZip) profile ====

A Seek-Optimized ZIP file (SOZip) profile has been proposed for the ZIP format. Such file contains one or several Deflate-compressed files that are organized and annotated such that a SOZip-aware reader can perform very fast random access (seek) within a compressed file. SOZip makes it possible to access large compressed files directly from a .zip file without prior decompression. It combines the use of ZLib block flushes issued at regular interval with a hidden index file mapping offsets of the uncompressed file to offsets in the compressed stream. ZIP readers that are not aware of that extension can read a SOZip-enabled file normally and ignore the extended features that support efficient seek capability.

=== Proprietary extensions ===
==== Extra field ====
 file format includes an extra field facility within file headers, which can be used to store extra data not defined by existing ZIP specifications, and which allow compliant archivers that do not recognize the fields to safely skip them. Header IDs 0–31 are reserved for use by PKWARE. The remaining IDs can be used by third-party vendors for proprietary usage.

==== Strong encryption controversy ====
When WinZip 9.0 public beta was released in 2003, WinZip introduced its own AES-256 encryption, using a different file format, along with the documentation for the new specification. The encryption standards themselves were not proprietary, but PKWARE had not updated APPNOTE.TXT to include Strong Encryption Specification (SES) since 2001, which had been used by PKZIP versions 5.0 and 6.0. WinZip technical consultant Kevin Kearney and StuffIt product manager Mathew Covington accused PKWARE of withholding SES, but PKZIP chief technology officer Jim Peterson claimed that certificate-based encryption was still incomplete.

In another controversial move, PKWare applied for a patent on 16 July 2003 describing a method for combining ZIP and strong encryption to create a secure file.

In the end, PKWARE and WinZip agreed to support each other&#x27;s products. On 21 January 2004, PKWARE announced the support of WinZip-based AES compression format. In a later version of WinZip beta, it was able to support SES-based ZIP files. PKWARE eventually released version 5.2 of the .ZIP File Format Specification to the public, which documented SES. The Free Software project 7-Zip also supports AES, but not SES in ZIP files (as does its POSIX port p7zip).

When using AES encryption under WinZip, the compression method is always set to 99, with the actual compression method stored in an AES extra data field. In contrast, Strong Encryption Specification stores the compression method in the basic file header segment of Local Header and Central Directory, unless Central Directory Encryption is used to mask/encrypt metadata.

== Implementation ==
There are numerous tools available, and numerous libraries for various programming environments; licenses used include proprietary and free software. WinZip, WinRAR, Info-ZIP, ZipGenius, 7-Zip, PeaZip and B1 Free Archiver are well-known tools, available on various platforms. Some of those tools have library or programmatic interfaces.

Some development libraries licensed under open source agreement are libzip, libarchive, and Info-ZIP. For Java: Java Platform, Standard Edition contains the package &quot;java.util.zip&quot; to handle standard files; the Zip64File library specifically supports large files (larger than 4 GB) and treats files using random access; and the Apache Ant tool contains a more complete implementation released under the Apache Software License.

The Info-ZIP implementations of the format adds support for Unix filesystem features, such as user and group IDs, file permissions, and support for symbolic links. The Apache Ant implementation is aware of these to the extent that it can create files with predefined Unix permissions. The Info-ZIP implementations also know how to use the error correction capabilities built into the compression format. Some programs do not, and will fail on a file that has errors.

The Info-ZIP Windows tools also support NTFS filesystem permissions, and will make an attempt to translate from NTFS permissions to Unix permissions or vice versa when extracting files. This can result in potentially unintended combinations, e.g. .exe files being created on NTFS volumes with executable permission denied.

Versions of Microsoft Windows have included support for compression in Explorer since the Microsoft Plus! pack was released for Windows 98. Microsoft calls this feature &quot;Compressed Folders&quot;. Not all features are supported by the Windows Compressed Folders capability. For example, encryption is not supported in Windows 10 Home edition, although it can decrypt. Unicode entry encoding is not supported until Windows 7, while split and spanned archives are not readable or writable by the Compressed Folders feature, nor is AES Encryption supported. Windows .zip support stemmed from an acquisition of &quot;VisualZip&quot; written by Dave Plummer.

OpenDocument Format (ODF) started using the zip archive format in 2005, ODF is an open format for office documents of all types, this is the default file format used in Collabora Online, LibreOffice and others. Microsoft Office started using the zip archive format in 2006 for their Office Open XML .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc. files, which became the default file format with Microsoft Office 2007.

=== Internationalization issues ===
Versions of the format prior to 6.3.0 did not support storing file names in Unicode. According to the standard, file names should be stored in the CP437 encoding, which is standard for the IBM PC, but in practice, DOS archivers used the system&#x27;s installed character encoding. The built-in archiver of Windows up to 11 also used the DOS encoding corresponding to the selected system language for backward compatibility when creating archives. Subsequently, the standard was updated to include two options for storing file names in Unicode: 1) when the 11th bit in the General purpose bit flag field is set, the file name in the &quot;File name&quot; field of the header should be considered as UTF-8 rather than a single-byte encoding, and 2) the Unicode Path Extra Field was added to store the file name in UTF-8 encoding. Some versions of archivers on the Windows platform have also used ANSI encoding in the past. Thus, to correctly extract files with names containing non-English characters, it is necessary:

# Check for the presence of the Unicode Path Extra Field, and if it exists, use the filename from it, encoded in UTF-8.
# Check for the presence of flag 11 in the General purpose bit flag field, and if it is set, consider the filename encoding in the &quot;File name&quot; field to be UTF-8.
# If the &quot;packing OS&quot; field contains the value 11 (NTFS, Windows), and the &quot;version of the packer&quot; field value is greater than or equal to 20, consider the filename encoding in the &quot;File name&quot; field to be the ANSI (Windows) encoding corresponding to the system locale if one can be determined; otherwise, use CP437.
# If the &quot;packing OS&quot; field contains the value 0 (FAT, DOS), and the &quot;version of the packer&quot; field value is between 25 and 40 inclusive, consider the filename encoding in the local header&#x27;s &quot;File name&quot; field to be ANSI (Windows) encoding, and in the central header&#x27;s &quot;File name&quot; field to be OEM (DOS) encoding, corresponding to the system locale if one can be determined; otherwise, use CP437.
# In other cases, if the &quot;OS packing&quot; field contains the value 0 (FAT, DOS), 6 (HPFS, OS/2), or 11 (NTFS, Windows), consider the filename encoding in the &quot;File name&quot; field to be OEM (DOS) encoding, corresponding to the system locale if one can be determined; otherwise, use CP437.

Some implementations of zip unpackers did not implement this algorithm or only partially implemented it, as a result, when viewing the contents of an archive or extracting it, users saw a chaotic set of characters, known as &quot;mojibake&quot;, instead of letters of the national alphabet. In 2016, this problem was solved in the far2l file and archive manager for Linux, BSD and Mac. In 2024, similar solution was added to the version of 7zip used in the Debian distribution and its derivatives, and to the version of unzip used in the Ubuntu distribution and its derivatives.

== Legacy ==
There are numerous other standards and formats using &quot;zip&quot; as part of their name. For example, zip is distinct from gzip, and the latter is defined in IETF . Both zip and gzip primarily use the DEFLATE algorithm for compression. Likewise, the ZLIB format (IETF ) also uses the DEFLATE compression algorithm, but specifies different headers for error and consistency checking. Other common, similarly named formats and programs with different native formats include 7-Zip, bzip2, and rzip.

== Concerns ==

The theoretical maximum compression factor for a raw DEFLATE stream is about 1032 to one, but by exploiting the ZIP format in unintended ways, ZIP archives with compression ratios of billions to one can be constructed. These zip bombs unzip to extremely large sizes, overwhelming the capacity of the computer they are decompressed on.

<doc id="188490" wikidata="Q2394249" url="?curid=188490" title="Gin Blossoms">
<text>Gin Blossoms is an American alternative rock band formed in 1987 in Tempe, Arizona. They rose to prominence following the 1992 release of their first major label album, &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, and the first single released from that album, &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot;. &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot; became a Top 25 hit and went gold, and &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; eventually went quadruple platinum; four other charting singles were released from the album. The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Congratulations I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; (1996), went platinum and the single &quot;As Long as It Matters&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award. Gin Blossoms broke up in 1997. Since reuniting in 2001, the band has released &quot;Major Lodge Victory&quot; in 2006, &quot;No Chocolate Cake&quot; in 2010, and &quot;Mixed Reality&quot; in 2018.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
During the band&#x27;s early years, its members included lead guitarist and songwriter Doug Hopkins, bassist Bill Leen, Jesse Valenzuela (lead vocalist at first, later rhythm guitarist and backing vocals), rhythm guitarist Richard Taylor, Taylor&#x27;s replacement Steven Severson, drummer Chris McCann, McCann&#x27;s replacement Dan Henzerling, and Severson&#x27;s replacement Robin Wilson (rhythm guitarist at first, later lead vocalist). The band&#x27;s name comes from a photo of W.C. Fields in Kenneth Anger&#x27;s book &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, which bore the caption &quot;W.C. Fields with gin blossoms&quot;, referring to the actor&#x27;s telangiectasia-spotted face and rhinophymic nose by the slang term for the skin condition known as rosacea.

Gin Blossoms became well known around the band&#x27;s hometown of Phoenix. The band&#x27;s frequent touring resulted in an increase in popularity. They independently recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Dusted&quot;, which was released in December 1989.

By the early 1990s, Wilson and Valenzuela had switched roles, with Wilson taking on lead vocal duties and Valenzuela concentrating on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. Along with Leen on bass and Hopkins on lead guitar, Phillip Rhodes became the new drummer. After being signed to A&amp;M Records, the band began to work on their first major-label album. Initial attempts faltered and the band released an EP, &quot;Up and Crumbling&quot;, instead.

=== Mainstream success ===
Gin Blossoms named their second album &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;. In February 1992, while still working to complete it, founding member and lead guitarist/songwriter Hopkins drank heavily and grew increasingly depressed. With the other members hesitant to fire Hopkins, A&amp;M forcefully removed him from the band and withheld $15,000 owed to Hopkins until he agreed to sign over half of his publishing royalties and relinquish his mechanical royalties. Hopkins reluctantly agreed to these demands because of his dire financial situation. Scott Johnson was chosen by the band later that month as Hopkins&#x27; stand-in on tour, and became a permanent member in 1994.

&quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; became the band&#x27;s breakthrough album. The first single released from the album was &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot;, which had been written by Hopkins. The song reached No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks and later went gold, largely fueling the success of &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;. Estranged from the band, Hopkins died by suicide on December 5, 1993, after a reported five previous attempts (including one for which he was hospitalized two weeks prior to his death). The following year, another song by Hopkins, &quot;Found Out About You&quot;, also reached No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and climbed to No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks. &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; eventually reached quadruple platinum status.

Between their first and second albums, Gin Blossoms contributed the single &quot;Til I Hear It from You&quot; for the soundtrack of the 1995 film &quot;Empire Records&quot;. It reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their second major album, &quot;Congratulations I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, was released in 1996. Yielding one top-ten hit (&quot;Follow You Down&quot;, which peaked at No. 9 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), the album went platinum. The song &quot;As Long as It Matters&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

With chart success came opportunities to appear as musical guests on late-night television. Between 1992 and 1996, Gin Blossoms appeared on shows such as &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (many times between 1992 and 1996), &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; (1993, 1994, 1996), &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; (1993), &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; (1996), and as a featured musical act on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1996). One appearance on the &quot;Late Show With David Letterman&quot; featured a joint performance with Gin Blossoms and the members of Kiss, performing the latter&#x27;s &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot;. Gin Blossoms became a favorite of &quot;Late Show&quot; musical director Paul Shaffer, and their music was often featured as the show cut to and from commercials. The band was also a featured performer in the closing credits of the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; (1993), performing &quot;Idiot Summer&quot; on-screen as part of the fictional concert &quot;Waynestock&quot;.

=== Breakup ===
Gin Blossoms broke up in early 1997. Wilson and Rhodes launched the Gas Giants while Leen formed a band called Rai and then retired from music to operate a rare book store. Valenzuela fronted a short-lived outfit called the Low Watts, released a solo album, and kept busy writing and producing. Johnson joined another Tempe-based band, Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers. Wilson ventured into producing as well, at his Mayberry Studios in Tempe, Arizona (now called Uranus Studios).
=== Reunion ===

The Gas Giants announced an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; in June 2001. On December 4, 2001, it was announced that Scott was leaving Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers to rejoin Gin Blossoms. The band regrouped and began playing together again in earnest in 2002, having done a couple of one-off shows in the interim. In Wilson&#x27;s words, &quot;We always said our breakup wasn&#x27;t forever and right now we&#x27;re all feeling like we want to be Gin Blossoms again. We make a noise together that we can&#x27;t make otherwise. We respect and appreciate that we need each other to create that sound. This time we hope to avoid being swallowed by the chaos.&quot;

In preparation for the band&#x27;s official reunion show, Rhodes suffered a breakdown due to his ongoing battle with alcohol. Shortly after entering rehab, he was formally dismissed from the band. Phil Leavitt of Dada originally took Rhodes&#x27;s place in the line up, and then Gary Smith (of The Pistoleros, another Tempe band) did. Scott Kusmirek took over drumming for the band from 2002 to 2004. In January 2005, it was announced that Rhodes, who had been sober for over two years, would rejoin the band. The re-entry of Rhodes was short-lived, however. Kusmirek returned to the band, taking Rhodes&#x27;s place until September 30, 2008, when a press release issued by the band explained that he and the group had parted ways. John Richardson joined as the new drummer.
The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Major Lodge Victory&quot;, was originally recorded at Wilson&#x27;s Mayberry Studios in Tempe. However, the album was re-recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis, where the band had recorded all of their previous albums. &quot;Major Lodge Victory&quot; was released by Hybrid Recordings on August 8, 2006, and &quot;Learning the Hard Way&quot; was the first single. &quot;Major Lodge Victory&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at number 159.
Gin Blossoms released a live album, &quot;Live In Concert&quot;, on May 15, 2009. This album contains live recordings of the band&#x27;s hits such as &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot; and &quot;Follow You Down&quot;, as well as more recent singles such as &quot;Learning the Hard Way&quot; and &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;, and a live cover version of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Man&quot;. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;No Chocolate Cake&quot;, was released on September 28, 2010. The first single, &quot;Miss Disarray&quot; was released to radio stations on August 2, 2010. Over the 2010 Thanksgiving holiday the band traveled to Iraq and played a series of shows for American troops stationed there.

The band announced on its website on March 4, 2012, that Richardson had left the band to pursue other recording and performing projects. The band stated in its news release, &quot;John is a great drummer and all of us support his passion for recording. We all wish him the very best and thank him for all his hard work and dedication.&quot; The band also announced that Scott Hessel would be its road drummer. Hessel had been a member of another Tempe band, Let Go. Gin Blossoms joined Everclear, Sugar Ray, Lit, and Marcy Playground on the Summerland Tour 2012, a 31-date nationwide tour that began on June 28 in Saratoga, California and ended on August 11 in Laughlin, Nevada.

From July 24, 2012, through October 13, 2012, Doug Swartz filled in for Scott Hessel during the Summerland Tour and other performances through the months into the middle of October.

In 2016, Johnson announced in an interview that the band was expected to begin recording its sixth studio album with producer Mitch Easter in the fall. Two years later, &quot;Mixed Reality&quot; was released on Cleopatra Records on June 15, 2018. The album was produced by Don Dixon.

The band toured in the summer of 2019 with Collective Soul.

In January 2022 the band announced a tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;. The tour was cut short in March 2022 due to an accident in which bassist Bill Leen broke his arm.

== Musical style ==
Gin Blossoms has been described as an alternative rock, jangle pop, power pop, and post-grunge band. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the band excels at &quot;marrying world-weary lyrics with ebullient melodies.&quot; In 2017, the Salina Journal described Gin Blossoms as a &quot;Tempe, Ariz.-based indie band [acclaimed] by critics and fans alike for its chiming guitars, introspective lyrics and catchy pop-rock melodies,&quot; adding that &quot;Gin Blossoms has maintained its longevity by being mostly a road band.&quot; The group is known for the &quot;Mill Avenue sound&quot;, or &quot;southwestern sound&quot;, similar to other bands from Arizona such as The Sidewinders, The Refreshments, The Meat Puppets, and Dead Hot Workshop.

<doc id="188494" wikidata="Q16343" url="?curid=188494" title="Clavicle">
<text>The clavicle, collarbone, or keybone is a slender, S-shaped long bone approximately long that serves as a strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone). There are two clavicles, one on each side of the body. The clavicle is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally. Together with the shoulder blade, it makes up the shoulder girdle. It is a palpable bone and, in people who have less fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible. It receives its name from Latin &quot;clavicula&quot; &#x27;little key&#x27; because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder is abducted. The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone. It can easily be fractured by impacts to the shoulder from the force of falling on outstretched arms or by a direct hit.

==Structure==
The collarbone is a thin doubly curved long bone that connects the arm to the trunk of the body. Located directly above the first rib, it acts as a strut to keep the scapula in place so that the arm can hang freely. At its rounded medial end (sternal end), it articulates with the manubrium of the sternum (breastbone) at the sternoclavicular joint. At its flattened lateral end (acromial end), it articulates with the acromion, a process of the scapula (shoulder blade), at the acromioclavicular joint.
The rounded medial region (sternal region) of the shaft has a long curve laterally and anteriorly along two-thirds of the entire shaft. The flattened lateral region (acromial region) of the shaft has an even larger posterior curve to articulate with the acromion of the scapula. The medial region is the longest clavicular region as it takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft. The lateral region is both the widest clavicular region and thinnest clavicular region. The lateral end has a rough inferior surface that bears a ridge, the trapezoid line, and a slight rounded projection, the conoid tubercle (above the coracoid process). These surface features are attachment sites for muscles and ligaments of the shoulder.

It can be divided into three parts: medial end, lateral end, and shaft.

===Medial end===
The medial end is also known as the sternal end. It is quadrangular and articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium of the sternum to form the sternoclavicular joint. The articular surface extends to the inferior aspect for articulation with the first costal cartilage.

===Lateral end===
The lateral end is also known as the acromial end. It is flat from above downward. It bears a facet that articulates with the shoulder to form the acromioclavicular joint. The area surrounding the joint gives an attachment to the joint capsule. The anterior border is concave forward and the posterior border is convex backward.

===Shaft===
The shaft is divided into two main regions, the medial region, and the lateral region. The medial region is also known as the sternal region, it is the longest clavicular region as it takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft. The lateral region is also known as the acromial region, it is both the widest clavicular region and thinnest clavicular region.
====Lateral region of the shaft====
The lateral region of the shaft has two borders and two surfaces.
* the anterior border is concave forward and gives origin to the deltoid muscle.
* the posterior border is convex and gives attachment to the trapezius muscle.
* the inferior surface has a ridge called the trapezoid line and a tubercle; the conoid tubercle for attachment with the trapezoid and the conoid ligament, part of the coracoclavicular ligament that serves to connect the collarbone with the coracoid process of the scapula.
===Development===
The collarbone is the first bone to begin the process of ossification (laying down of minerals onto a preformed matrix) during development of the embryo, during the fifth and sixth weeks of gestation. However, it is one of the last bones to finish ossification at about 21–25 years of age. Its lateral end is formed by intramembranous ossification while medially it is formed by endochondral ossification. It consists of a mass of cancellous bone surrounded by a compact bone shell. The cancellous bone forms via two ossification centres, one medial and one lateral, which fuse later on. The compact forms as the layer of fascia covering the bone stimulate the ossification of adjacent tissue. The resulting compact bone is known as a periosteal collar.

The collarbone has a medullary cavity (marrow cavity) in its medial two-thirds. It is made up of spongy cancellous bone with a shell of compact bone. It is a dermal bone derived from elements originally attached to the skull.

===Variation===
The shape of the clavicle varies more than most other long bones. It is occasionally pierced by a branch of the supraclavicular nerve. In males the clavicle is usually longer and larger than in females. A study measuring 748 males and 252 females saw a difference in collarbone length between age groups 18–20 and 21–25 of about for males and females respectively.

The left clavicle is usually longer and weaker than the right clavicle.

The collarbones are sometimes partly or completely absent in cleidocranial dysostosis.

The levator claviculae muscle, present in 2–3% of people, originates on the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae and is inserted in the lateral half of the clavicle.

==Functions==
The collarbone serves several functions:
* It serves as a rigid support from which the scapula and free limb are suspended; an arrangement that keeps the upper limb away from the thorax so that the arm has maximum range of movement. Acting as a flexible, crane-like strut, it allows the scapula to move freely on the thoracic wall.
* Covering the cervicoaxillary canal, it protects the neurovascular bundle that supplies the upper limb.
* Transmits physical impacts from the upper limb to the axial skeleton.

===Muscle===
Muscles and ligaments that attach to the collarbone include:

==Clinical significance==
*Acromioclavicular dislocation (&quot;AC Separation&quot;)
*Degeneration of the clavicle
*Osteolysis
*Sternoclavicular dislocations

A vertical line drawn from the mid-clavicle called the mid-clavicular line is used as a reference in describing cardiac apex beat during medical examination. It is also useful for evaluating an enlarged liver, and for locating the gallbladder which is between the mid-clavicular line and the transpyloric plane.

===Collarbone fracture===

Clavicle fractures (colloquially, a broken collarbone) occur as a result of injury or trauma. The most common type of fractures occur when a person falls horizontally on the shoulder or with an outstretched hand. A direct hit to the collarbone will also cause a break. In most cases, the direct hit occurs from the lateral side towards the medial side of the bone. The most common site of fracture is the junction between the two curvatures of the bone, which is the weakest point. This results in the sternocleidomastoid muscle lifting the medial aspect superiorly, which can result in perforation of the overlying skin.

==Other animals==
The clavicle first appears as part of the skeleton in primitive bony fish, where it is associated with the pectoral fin; they also have a bone called the cleithrum. In such fish, the paired clavicles run behind and below the gills on each side, and are joined by a solid symphysis on the fish&#x27;s underside. They are, however, absent in cartilaginous fish and in the vast majority of living bony fish, including all of the teleosts.

The earliest tetrapods retained this arrangement, with the addition of a diamond-shaped interclavicle between the base of the clavicles, although this is not found in living amphibians. The cleithrum disappeared early in the evolution of reptiles, and is not found in any living amniotes, but the interclavicle is present in most modern reptiles, and also in monotremes. In modern forms, however, there are a number of variations from the primitive pattern. For example, crocodilians and salamanders lack clavicles altogether (although crocodilians do retain the interclavicle), while in turtles, they form part of the armoured plastron.

The interclavicle is absent in marsupials and placental mammals. In many mammals, the clavicles are also reduced, or even absent, to allow the scapula greater freedom of motion, which may be useful in fast-running animals.

Though a number of fossil hominin (humans and chimpanzees) clavicles have been found, most of these are mere segments offering limited information on the form and function of the pectoral girdle. One exception is the clavicle of AL 333x6/9 attributed to &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; which has a well-preserved sternal end. One interpretation of this specimen, based on the orientation of its lateral end and the position of the deltoid attachment area, suggests that this clavicle is distinct from those found in extant apes (including humans), and thus that the shape of the human shoulder dates back to less than . However, analyses of the clavicle in extant primates suggest that the low position of the scapula in humans is reflected mostly in the curvature of the medial portion of the clavicle rather than the lateral portion. This part of the bone is similar in &quot;A. afarensis&quot; and it is thus possible that this species had a high shoulder position similar to that in modern humans.

===In dinosaurs===
In dinosaurs, the main bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder blade) and the coracoid, both of which directly articulated with the clavicle. The clavicle was present in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian dinosaurs. The place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus (upper bone of the forelimb) is the called the glenoid. The clavicles fused in some theropod dinosaurs to form a furcula, which is the equivalent to a wishbone.

In birds, the clavicles and interclavicle have fused to form a single Y-shaped bone, the furcula or &quot;wishbone&quot; which evolved from the clavicles found in coelurosaurian theropods.

<doc id="188496" wikidata="Q900929" url="?curid=188496" title="Reflective equilibrium">
<text>Reflective equilibrium is a state of balance or coherence among a set of beliefs arrived at by a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and particular judgements. Although he did not use the term, philosopher Nelson Goodman introduced the method of reflective equilibrium as an approach to justifying the &quot;principles&quot; of inductive logic (this is now known as Goodman&#x27;s method). The term &quot;reflective equilibrium&quot; was coined by John Rawls and popularized in his &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; as a method for arriving at the content of the principles of justice.

 has pointed out that there are many interpretations of reflective equilibrium that deviate from Rawls&#x27; method in ways that reduce the cogency of the idea. Among these misinterpretations, according to Hübner, are definitions of reflective equilibrium as &quot;(a) balancing theoretical accounts against intuitive convictions; (b) balancing general principles against particular judgements; (c) balancing opposite ethical conceptions or divergent moral statements&quot;.

==Overview==
Rawls argues that human beings have a &quot;sense of justice&quot; that is a source of both moral judgment and moral motivation. In Rawls&#x27;s theory, we begin with &quot;considered judgments&quot; that arise from the sense of justice. These may be judgments about general moral principles (of any level of generality) or specific moral cases. If our judgments conflict in some way, we proceed by adjusting our various beliefs until they are in &quot;equilibrium&quot;, which is to say that they are stable, not in conflict, and provide consistent practical guidance. Rawls argues that a set of moral beliefs in ideal reflective equilibrium describes or characterizes the underlying principles of the human sense of justice.

For example, suppose that Zachary believes in the general principle of always obeying the commands in the Bible. Suppose also that he thinks that it is not ethical to stone people to death merely for being Wiccan. These views may come into conflict (see Exodus 22:18 versus John 8:7). If they do, Zachary will then have several choices. He can discard his general principle in search of a better one, such as obeying only the Ten Commandments; or modify his general principle by choosing a different translation of the Bible, or letting Jesus&#x27; teaching from John 8:7 &quot;If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone&quot;, override the Old Testament command; or change his opinions about the point in question to conform with his theory, by deciding that witches really should be killed. Whatever the decision, he has moved toward reflective equilibrium.

==Use in Rawls&#x27;s political theory==
Reflective equilibrium serves an important justificatory function within Rawls&#x27;s political theory. The nature of this function, however, is disputed. The dominant view, best exemplified by the work of Norman Daniels and Thomas Scanlon, is that the method of reflective equilibrium is a kind of coherentist method for the epistemic justification of moral beliefs. However, in other writings, Rawls seems to argue that his theory bypasses traditional metaethical questions, including questions of moral epistemology, and is intended instead to serve a practical function. This provides some motivation for a different view of the justificatory role of reflective equilibrium. On this view, the method of reflective equilibrium serves its justificatory function by linking together the cognitive and motivational aspects of the human sense of justice in the appropriate way.

Rawls argues that candidate principles of justice cannot be justified unless they are shown to be stable. Principles of justice are stable if, among other things, the members of society regard them as authoritative and reliably comply with them. The method of reflective equilibrium determines a set of principles rooted in the human sense of justice, which is a capacity that both provides the material for the process of reflective equilibration and our motivation to adhere to principles we judge morally sound. The method of reflective equilibrium serves the aim of defining a realistic and stable social order by determining a practically coherent set of principles that are grounded in the right way in the source of our moral motivation, such that we will be disposed to comply with them. As Fred D&#x27;Agostino puts it, stable principles of justice will require considerable &quot;up-take&quot; by the members of society. The method of reflective equilibrium provides a way of settling on principles that will achieve the kind of &quot;up-take&quot; necessary for stability.

Reflective equilibrium is not static, though Rawls allows for provisional fixed points; it will change as the individual considers his opinions about individual issues or explores the consequences of his principles.

Rawls applied this technique to his conception of a hypothetical original position from which people would agree to a social contract. He arrived at the conclusion that the optimal theory of justice is the one to which people would agree from behind a veil of ignorance, not knowing their social positions.

==Wide reflective equilibrium==
Wide reflective equilibrium, first introduced by Rawls, has been described by Norman Daniels as &quot;a method that attempts to produce coherence in ordered triple sets of beliefs held by a particular person, namely: (a) a set of considered moral judgments, (b) a set of moral principles, and (c) a set of relevant (scientific and philosophical) background theories&quot;.

==Relation to constructivism==

Kai Nielsen has asserted that &quot;philosophers who are defenders of reflective equilibrium are also &quot;constructivists&quot;&quot;, in response to what he considered to be the misconception that reflective equilibrium works with some necessarily preexisting coherent system of moral beliefs and practices: 

==Criticism==
Paul Thagard has criticized the method of reflective equilibrium as &quot;only like a smokescreen for a relatively sophisticated form of logical and methodological relativism&quot; and &quot;at best incidental to the process of developing normative principles&quot;. Among the &quot;numerous problems&quot; of reflective equilibrium, Thagard counted &quot;undue reliance on intuition and the danger of arriving at stable but suboptimal sets of norms&quot;. In place of reflective equilibrium, Thagard recommended what he considered to be a more consequentialist method of justifying norms by identifying a domain of practices, identifying candidate norms for the practices, identifying the appropriate goals of the practices, evaluating the extent to which different practices accomplish these goals, and adopting as domain norms the practices that best accomplish these goals.

<doc id="188497" wikidata="Q176503" url="?curid=188497" title="Femur">
<text>The femur (; : femurs or femora ), or thigh bone, is the only bone in the thigh — the region of the lower limb between the hip and the knee. In many four-legged animals the femur is the upper bone of the hindleg.

The top of the femur fits into a socket in the pelvis called the hip joint, and the bottom of the femur connects to the shinbone (tibia) and kneecap (patella) to form the knee. In humans the femur is the largest and thickest bone in the body.

==Structure==
The femur is the only bone in the upper leg. The two femurs converge medially toward the knees, where they articulate with the proximal ends of the tibiae. The angle at which the femora converge is an important factor in determining the femoral-tibial angle. In females, thicker pelvic bones cause the femora to converge more than in males.

In the condition &quot;genu valgum&quot; (knock knee) the femurs converge so much that the knees touch. The opposite condition, &quot;genu varum&quot; (bow-leggedness), occurs when the femurs diverge. In the general population without these conditions, the femoral-tibial angle is about 175 degrees.

The femur is the largest and thickest bone in the human body. It is considered the strongest bone by some measures, though other studies suggest the temporal bone may be stronger. On average, the femur length accounts for 26.74% of a person&#x27;s height, a ratio found in both men and women across most ethnic groups with minimal variation. This ratio is useful in anthropology, as it provides a reliable estimate of a person&#x27;s height from an incomplete skeleton.

The femur is classified as a long bone, consisting of diaphysis (shaft or body) and two epiphyses (extremities) that articulate with the hip and knee bones.

===Upper part===
The upper or proximal extremity (close to the torso) contains the head, neck, the two trochanters and adjacent structures. The upper extremity is the thinnest femoral extremity, the lower extremity is the thickest femoral extremity.

The head of the femur, which articulates with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone, comprises two-thirds of a sphere. It has a small groove, or fovea, connected through the round ligament to the sides of the acetabular notch. The head of the femur is connected to the shaft through the neck or &quot;collum&quot;. The neck is 4–5 cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed at its middle. The collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees. This angle is highly variant. In the infant it is about 150 degrees and in old age reduced to 120 degrees on average. An abnormal increase in the angle is known as coxa valga and an abnormal reduction is called coxa vara. Both the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the hip musculature and can not be directly palpated. In skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated, the head of the femur can be felt deep as a resistance profound (deep) for the femoral artery.

The transition area between the head and neck is quite rough due to attachment of muscles and the hip joint capsule. Here the two trochanters, greater and lesser trochanter, are found. The greater trochanter is almost box-shaped and is the most lateral prominent of the femur. The highest point of the greater trochanter is located higher than the collum and reaches the midpoint of the hip joint. The greater trochanter can easily be felt. The trochanteric fossa is a deep depression bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest on the medial surface of the greater trochanter.
The lesser trochanter is a cone-shaped extension of the lowest part of the femur neck. The two trochanters are joined by the intertrochanteric crest on the back side and by the intertrochanteric line on the front.

A slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle of the intertrochanteric crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5 cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the linea quadrata (or quadrate line).

About the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds on the intertrochanteric crest is the quadrate tubercle located. The size of the tubercle varies and it is not always located on the intertrochanteric crest and that also adjacent areas can be part of the quadrate tubercle, such as the posterior surface of the greater trochanter or the neck of the femur. In a small anatomical study it was shown that the epiphyseal line passes directly through the quadrate tubercle.

===Body===
The body of the femur (or shaft) is large, thick and almost cylindrical in form. It is a little broader above than in the center, broadest and somewhat flattened from before backward below. It is slightly arched, so as to be convex in front, and concave behind, where it is strengthened by a prominent longitudinal ridge, the linea aspera which diverges proximally and distal as the medial and lateral ridge. Proximally the lateral ridge of the linea aspera becomes the gluteal tuberosity while the medial ridge continues as the pectineal line. Besides the linea aspera the shaft has two other bordes; a lateral and medial border. These three bordes separates the shaft into three surfaces: One anterior, one medial and one lateral. Due to the vast musculature of the thigh the shaft can not be palpated.

The third trochanter is a bony projection occasionally present on the proximal femur near the superior border of the gluteal tuberosity. When present, it is oblong, rounded, or conical in shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge. A structure of minor importance in humans, the incidence of the third trochanter varies from 17–72% between ethnic groups and it is frequently reported as more common in females than in males.

===Lower part===

The lower extremity of the femur (or distal extremity) is the thickest femoral extremity, the upper extremity is the shortest femoral extremity. It is somewhat cuboid in form, but its transverse diameter is greater than its antero-posterior (front to back). It consists of two oblong eminences known as the condyles.

Anteriorly, the condyles are slightly prominent and are separated by a smooth shallow articular depression called the patellar surface. Posteriorly, they project considerably and a deep notch, the Intercondylar fossa of femur, is present between them. The lateral condyle is the more prominent and is the broader both in its antero-posterior and transverse diameters. The medial condyle is the longer and, when the femur is held with its body perpendicular, projects to a lower level. When, however, the femur is in its natural oblique position the lower surfaces of the two condyles lie practically in the same horizontal plane. The condyles are not quite parallel with one another; the long axis of the lateral is almost directly antero-posterior, but that of the medial runs backward and medialward. Their opposed surfaces are small, rough, and concave, and form the walls of the intercondyloid fossa. This fossa is limited above by a ridge, the intercondyloid line, and below by the central part of the posterior margin of the patellar surface. The posterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint is attached to the lower and front part of the medial wall of the fossa and the anterior cruciate ligament to an impression on the upper and back part of its lateral wall.

The articular surface of the lower end of the femur occupies the anterior, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the condyles. Its front part is named the patellar surface and articulates with the patella; it presents a median groove which extends downward to the intercondyloid fossa and two convexities, the lateral of which is broader, more prominent, and extends farther upward than the medial.

Each condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the epicondyle. The medial epicondyle is a large convex eminence to which the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint is attached. At its upper part is the adductor tubercle and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of the gastrocnemius. The lateral epicondyle which is smaller and less prominent than the medial, gives attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint.

===Development===

The femur develops from the limb buds as a result of interactions between the ectoderm and the underlying mesoderm; formation occurs roughly around the fourth week of development.

By the sixth week of development, the first hyaline cartilage model of the femur is formed by chondrocytes. Endochondral ossification begins by the end of the embryonic period and primary ossification centers are present in all long bones of the limbs, including the femur, by the 12th week of development. The hindlimb development lags behind forelimb development by 1–2 days.

==Function==
As the femur is the only bone in the thigh, it serves as an attachment point for all the muscles that exert their force over the hip and knee joints. Some biarticular muscles – which cross two joints, like the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles – also originate from the femur. In all, 23 individual muscles either originate from or insert onto the femur.

In cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate fascial compartments divided by fascia, each containing muscles. These compartments use the femur as an axis, and are separated by tough connective tissue membranes (or septa). Each of these compartments has its own blood and nerve supply, and contains a different group of muscles. These compartments are named the anterior, medial and posterior fascial compartments.

==Clinical significance==

===Fractures===

A femoral fracture that involves the femoral head, femoral neck or the shaft of the femur immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a hip fracture, especially when associated with osteoporosis. Femur fractures can be managed in a pre-hospital setting with the use of a traction splint.

==Other animals==
In primitive tetrapods, the main points of muscle attachment along the femur are the internal trochanter and third trochanter, and a ridge along the ventral surface of the femoral shaft referred to as the adductor crest. The neck of the femur is generally minimal or absent in the most primitive forms, reflecting a simple attachment to the acetabulum. The greater trochanter was present in the extinct archosaurs, as well as in modern birds and mammals, being associated with the loss of the primitive sprawling gait. The lesser trochanter is a unique development of mammals, which lack both the internal and fourth trochanters. The adductor crest is also often absent in mammals or alternatively reduced to a series of creases along the surface of the bone. Structures analogous to the third trochanter are present in mammals, including some primates.

Some species of whales, snakes, and other non-walking vertebrates have vestigial femurs. In some snakes, the protruding end of a pelvic spur, a vestigial pelvis and femur remnant which is not connected to the rest of the skeleton, plays a role in mating. This role in mating is hypothesized to have possibly occurred in &quot;Basilosauridae&quot;, an extinct family of whales with well-defined femurs, lower legs and feet. Occasionally, the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature legs (atavism).

One of the earliest known vertebrates to have a femur is the &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot;, a prehistoric lobe-finned fish from the Late Devonian period.

===Viral metagenomics===
A recent study has revealed that bone is a significantly richer source of persistent DNA viruses than previously thought. In addition to Parvovirus B19 and Hepatitis B virus, ten other viruses were discovered, including several members of the herpesvirus and polyomavirus families, as well as human papillomavirus type 31 and torque teno virus.

===Invertebrates===

In invertebrate zoology the name &quot;femur&quot; appears in arthropodology. The usage is not homologous with that of vertebrate anatomy; the term &quot;femur&quot; simply has been adopted by analogy and refers, where applicable, to the most proximal of (usually) the two longest jointed segments of the legs of the Arthropoda. The two basal segments preceding the femur are the coxa and trochanter. This convention is not followed in carcinology but it applies in arachnology and entomology. In myriapodology, another segment, the prefemur, connects the trochanter and femur.

<text>The acetabulum (; : acetabula), also called the cotyloid cavity, is a surface of the pelvis. The head of the femur meets with the pelvis at the acetabulum, forming the hip joint.

==Structure==
There are three bones of the &quot;os coxae&quot; (hip bone) that come together to form the &quot;acetabulum&quot;. Contributing a little more than two-fifths of the structure is the ischium, which provides lower and side boundaries to the acetabulum. The ilium forms the upper boundary, providing a little less than two-fifths of the structure of the acetabulum. The rest is formed by the pubis, near the midline.

It is bounded by a prominent uneven rim, thick and strong on top, which serves as the point of attachment for the acetabular labrum. The acetabular labrum reduces the size of the opening of the acetabulum and deepens the surface of the hip joint. At the lower part of the acetabulum is the acetabular notch, which is continuous with a circular depression, the acetabular fossa, at the bottom of the cavity of the acetabulum. The rest of the acetabulum is formed by a curved, crescent-moon shaped surface, the lunate surface, where the joint is made with the head of the femur. Its counterpart in the pectoral girdle is the glenoid fossa.

The acetabulum is also home to the acetabular fossa, an attachment site for the &quot;ligamentum teres&quot;, a triangular, somewhat flattened band implanted by its apex into the antero-superior part of the fovea capitis femoris. The notch is converted into a foramen by the transverse acetabular ligament; through the foramen nutrient vessels and nerves enter the joint. This is what holds the head of the femur securely in the acetabulum.

The well-fitting surfaces of the femoral head and acetabulum, which face each other, are lined with a layer of slippery tissue called articular cartilage, which is lubricated by a thin film of synovial fluid. Friction inside a normal hip is less than one-tenth that of ice gliding on ice.

===Blood supply===
The acetabular branch of the obturator artery supplies the &quot;acetabulum&quot; through the acetabular notch. The pubic branches supply the pelvic surface of the &quot;acetabulum&quot;. Deep branches of the superior gluteal artery supply the superior region and the inferior gluteal artery supplies the postero-inferior region.

===Reptiles and birds===

In reptiles and birds, the &quot;acetabula&quot; are deep sockets. Organisms in the dinosauria clade are defined by a perforate &quot;acetabulum&quot;, which can be thought of as a &quot;hip-socket&quot;. The perforate &quot;acetabulum&quot; is a cup-shaped opening on each side of the pelvic girdle formed where the ischium, ilium, and pubis all meet, and into which the head of the femur inserts. The orientation and position of the &quot;acetabulum&quot; is one of the main morphological traits that caused dinosaurs to walk in an upright posture with their legs directly underneath their bodies. In a relatively small number of dinosaurs, particularly ankylosaurians (e.g. &quot;Texasetes pleurohalio&quot;), an imperforate &quot;acetabulum&quot; is present, which is not an opening, but instead resembles a shallow concave depression on each side of the pelvic girdle.

==Development==
In infants and children, a Y-shaped epiphyseal plate called the triradiate cartilage joins the ilium, ischium, and pubis. This cartilage ossifies as the child grows.

==History==
The word &quot;acetabulum&quot; literally means &quot;little vinegar cup&quot;. It was the Latin word for a small vessel for serving vinegar. The word was later also used as a unit of volume.

<text>Brighton is a town and census-designated place in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 37,137 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Brighton, located on the southeastern border of the city of Rochester, is located on the traditional homelands of the Onöndowa&#x27;ga:&#x27; (Seneca), part of the Ho-de-no-sau-nee-ga (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy, the People of the Long House, called Iroquois by the French. The first Europeans in the area were French trappers in the seventeenth century, who visited frequently but did not settle there. English colonists built permanent structures in approximately 1790, and formally established the town in 1814—earning it recognition as one of the oldest towns in Monroe County. Named for Brighton, England, it remained a farming and brick-making community until the 20th century, when the town began its evolution into an upscale suburban residential area, occupying some . 

During the Civil War the men of Brighton helped form Company D of the 140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment in September 1862, which included Rochester. The total population of Brighton at the time was approximately 3,100. The 140th New York Regiment served in the XII Corps and then the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac. They saw battle during the battles of Gettysburg, the Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House, as well as the Appomattox campaign during the war. The 140th New York was disbanded from service on June 3, 1865.

The Alcoa Care-free Home and Stone-Tolan House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1999, the town purchased with the intention of developing a central park.

==Geography==
Brighton is in central Monroe County, bordered to the north and northwest by the city of Rochester. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town of Brighton has a total area of , of which , or 1.23%, are water.

Brighton has lacked a central village since the city of Rochester annexed the area around East Avenue and Winton Road, formerly the village of Brighton, in 1905. The central entertainment and commercial hub is the Twelve Corners, so named because three intersecting roads, Winton Road, Monroe Avenue and Elmwood Avenue, define twelve distinct corners. Residents tend to gravitate to nearby Pittsford Plaza for shopping, as well as Eastview Mall and Commons, in bordering Pittsford and nearby Victor.The town&#x27;s high school (Brighton High School) and middle school (Twelve Corners Middle School) are located at Twelve Corners. Brighton is bordered by the city of Rochester to the northwest, by the town of Irondequoit for a very short distance to the north, the town of Henrietta to the south, the Genesee River and Chili to the west, the town of Pittsford to the southeast, and the town of Penfield to the east. Brighton is located some east of Buffalo and west of Syracuse. The Erie Canal courses through Brighton, accompanied by the acclaimed Erie Canal Heritage Trail, one of the longest continuous stretches of maintained off-road trail in the United States.

The Pinnacle Hill Range, a line of glacially-formed hills of unique habitat including old-growth oak woodland, is largely leveled or otherwise destroyed, but does have degraded remnants on Pinnacle Hill and the east side of Cobbs Hill. The latter is dedicated as Washington Grove and very popularly used; the former is the highest (though eroded) peak in Rochester and mainly used for unregulated mountain biking with an extensive and wide network of trails on its steep, sandy slopes. The largest wetland in Brighton is a former clay-mining operation filled with lesser cattails along the Brickyard Trail, recently made a park in 2017. A fairly large area of west Brighton is undeveloped and wooded, including Lynch Woods Nature Park, from which one can access the Lehigh Valley Trail, which extends to Victor in the east and Rush to the west, and connects to the Genesee Valley Greenway, Auburn Trail, and Erie Canal trails. Most of Brighton however is completely developed, consisting of asphalt and lawn geography.

==Demographics==

For statistical purposes, the entire town is listed by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Brighton census-designated place. As of the 2020 census, there were 37,137 people residing in the coterminous town-CDP.

As of the census of 2000, there were 35,588 people, 15,854 households, and 8,687 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 16,705 housing units at an average density of 417.2 persons/km2 (1,080.8 persons/sq mi). The racial makeup of the town was 86.09% White, 8.13% Asian, 3.70% African American, 1.33% from two or more races, 0.10% Native American, 0.03% Pacific Islander and 0.63% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.34% of the population.

There were 15,854 households, out of which 24.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.9% were married couples living together, 6.8% have a woman whose husband does not live with her, and 45.2% were non-families. 36.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.14 and the average family size was 2.86.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 20.0% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 29.9% from 25 to 44, 23.4% from 45 to 64, and 19.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $91,345 and the median income for a family was $112,125. Males had a median income of $75,670 versus $49,299 for females. The per capita income for the town was $40,500. 6.1% of the population and 3.0% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total people living in poverty, 4.9% are under the age of 18 and 5.2% are 65 or older.

==Education==

Much of the town of Brighton is served by the Brighton Central School District, which frequently earns high positions in &quot;Newsweek&quot; national rankings (5th in 1998). Very recently, the ratings have gone down, possibly because some of the school teachers in Brighton have retired or because of increased emphasis on APs in other schools. In 2007, Brighton placed higher (87th) than its cross-town rival, Pittsford Mendon High School (94th) for the first time in several years.

Brighton was recently ranked #56 out of over 18,000 in the inaugural &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking of U.S. high schools (2007), which is generally regarded as having more breadth of analysis than the Newsweek rankings. (The former rankings are formed based upon numerous quantifiable factors, whereas the Newsweek rankings solely examine the raw number of students enrolled in AP classes per capita.) No other school in Monroe County placed in the top 1,000, including, most notably, cross-town rival Pittsford Mendon High School. In 2019, Brighton High School was ranked #786 nationally by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report.&quot; 

In 2006, Twelve Corners Middle School received the &quot;Schools to Watch&quot; award, and again was recertified in 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018. It is one of only ten Middle Schools in New York to receive the &quot;Schools to Watch&quot; award.

Other portions of Brighton are served by other school districts:

*Most of the northeastern part of the town is served by the Penfield Central School District.
*Some of the northeastern and eastern part of the town is served by the Pittsford Central School District.
*Most of the western part of the town is served by the Rush–Henrietta Central School District.
*The extreme western part of the town is served by the Wheatland–Chili Central School District.

Private schools located in Brighton include the Harley School, McQuaid Jesuit High School, Our Lady of Mercy School for Young Women, St. Thomas More School, and Seton Catholic School. Former schools include the Allen Creek School (annexed by Pittsford Central School District in 1958), Brighton Common School No. 4 (annexed by Rush–Henrietta Central School District in 1954 and later renamed Austin Crittenden School), Indian Landing School (annexed by Penfield Central School District in 1954), and St. Agnes High School (1954–1982).

Brighton is also home to the main campus of Monroe Community College and auxiliary campuses of Empire State College, Medaille College, and the University of Rochester.

==Library==
The Brighton Memorial Library, located on 2300 Elmwood Avenue in the town hall campus, serves Brighton, New York.

==Government==

Brighton is governed by an elected town board, consisting of a supervisor and four town board members. The supervisor is elected to a two-year term and serves as the chief financial officer of the municipality and chairperson of the town board. The board members serve four-year terms. Voters also elect two town justices and a town clerk. Town justices serve four-year terms, and the clerk is elected to a two-year term.

<doc id="188506" wikidata="Q37425" url="?curid=188506" title="Knee">
<text>In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.

It is often termed a &quot;compound joint&quot; having tibiofemoral and patellofemoral components. (The fibular collateral ligament is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)
==Structure==

The knee is a modified hinge joint, a type of synovial joint, which is composed of three functional compartments: the patellofemoral articulation, consisting of the patella, or &quot;kneecap&quot;, and the patellar groove on the front of the femur through which it slides; and the medial and lateral tibiofemoral articulations linking the femur, or thigh bone, with the tibia, the main bone of the lower leg. The joint is bathed in synovial fluid which is contained inside the synovial membrane called the joint capsule. The posterolateral corner of the knee is an area that has recently been the subject of renewed scrutiny and research.

The knee is the largest joint and one of the most important joints in the body. It plays an essential role in movement related to carrying the body weight in horizontal (running and walking) and vertical (jumping) directions.

At birth, the kneecap is just formed from cartilage, and this will ossify (change to bone) between the ages of three and five years. Because it is the largest sesamoid bone in the human body, the ossification process takes significantly longer.

===Articular bodies===
The main articular bodies of the femur are its lateral and medial condyles. These diverge slightly distally and posteriorly, with the lateral condyle being wider in front than at the back while the medial condyle is of more constant width. The radius of the condyles&#x27; curvature in the sagittal plane becomes smaller toward the back. This diminishing radius produces a series of involute midpoints (i.e. located on a spiral). The resulting series of transverse axes permit the sliding and rolling motion in the flexing knee while ensuring the collateral ligaments are sufficiently lax to permit the rotation associated with the curvature of the medial condyle about a vertical axis.

The pair of tibial condyles are separated by the intercondylar eminence composed of a lateral and a medial tubercle.

The patella also serves an articular body, and its posterior surface is referred to as the trochlea of the knee. It is inserted into the thin anterior wall of the joint capsule. On its posterior surface is a lateral and a medial articular surface, both of which communicate with the patellar surface which unites the two femoral condyles on the anterior side of the bone&#x27;s distal end.

===Articular capsule===

The articular capsule has a synovial and a fibrous membrane separated by fatty deposits. Anteriorly, the synovial membrane is attached on the margin of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia, but on the femur, it communicates with the suprapatellar bursa or recess and extends the joint space proximally. The suprapatellar bursa is prevented from being pinched during extension by the articularis genus muscle. Behind, the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions (semimembranosus bursa under medial head of the gastrocnemius and popliteal bursa under lateral head of the gastrocnemius) similar to the suprapatellar bursa. Between these two extensions, the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments at the center of the joint, thus forming a pocket direct inward.

Synovium lining the capsule and its bursae. The synovium also lines infrapatellar fat pad, the fat pad that lies below the ligamentum patellae. Synovium projecting into the fat pad as two foldings.

===Nerves===
From an anterior perspective, the superolateral quadrant of the knee is innervated by the nerves to the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, the sciatic nerve, and by the superior lateral genicular and common fibular nerves; in the inferolateral quadrant, the inferior lateral genicular nerve and recurrent fibular nerves predominate; the superomedial quadrant is innervated by the nerves to the vastus medialis and vastus intermedius, the obturator and sciatic nerves, and by the superior medial genicular nerve; and the inferomedial quadrant has innervation by the inferior medial genicular nerve and the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve.

The articular branches from the obturator and tibial nerves supply the posterior knee capsule, with additional supply from the common fibular nerve and sciatic nerve; the tibial nerve innervates the entire posterior capsule; the posterior division of the obturator nerve and the tibial nerve supply the superomedial aspect of the posterior capsule; the superolateral aspect of the posterior capsule is innervated by the tibial nerve, and by the common fibular and sciatic nerves.

===Bursae===

Numerous bursae surround the knee joint. The largest communicative bursa is the suprapatellar bursa described above. Four considerably smaller bursae are located on the back of the knee. Two non-communicative bursae are located in front of the patella and below the patellar tendon, and others are sometimes present.

===Cartilage===
Cartilage is a thin, elastic tissue that protects the bone and makes certain that the joint surfaces can slide easily over each other. Cartilage ensures supple knee movement. There are two types of joint cartilage in the knees: fibrous cartilage (the meniscus) and hyaline cartilage. Fibrous cartilage has tensile strength and can resist pressure. Hyaline cartilage covers the surface along which the joints move. Collagen fibres within the articular cartilage have been described by Benninghoff as arising from the subchondral bone in a radial manner, building so called Gothic arches. On the surface of the cartilage, these fibres appear in a tangential orientation and increase the abrasion resistance. There are no blood vessels inside of the hyaline cartilage, the alimentation is performed per diffusion. Synovial fluid and the subchondral bone marrow serve both as nutrition sources for the hyaline cartilage. Lack of at least one source induces a degeneration. Cartilage will wear over the years. Cartilage has a very limited capacity for self-restoration. The newly formed tissue will generally consist of a large part of fibrous cartilage of lesser quality than the original hyaline cartilage. As a result, new cracks and tears will form in the cartilage over time.

=== Menisci ===

The articular disks of the knee-joint are called menisci because they only partly divide the joint space. These two disks, the medial meniscus and the lateral meniscus, consist of connective tissue with extensive collagen fibers containing cartilage-like cells. Strong fibers run along the menisci from one attachment to the other, while weaker radial fibers are interlaced with the former. The menisci are flattened at the center of the knee joint, fused with the synovial membrane laterally, and can move over the tibial surface. The upper and lower surfaces of the menisci are free. Each meniscus have anterior and posterior horns that meet in the intercondylar area of the tibia.

Medial meniscus is bigger, less curved, and thinner. Its posterior horn is thicker (14mm) than the anterior horn (6mm).

The lateral meniscus is smaller, more curved (nearly circular), and has more uniform thickness than medial meniscus (10mm). The lateral meniscus is less attached to the joint capsule, because its posterolateral surface is grooved by the popliteus tendon, separating the meniscus from the capsule. The popliteus tendon is not attached to the lateral meniscus.

===Ligaments===
The ligaments surrounding the knee joint offer stability by limiting movements and, together with the menisci and several bursae, protect the articular capsule.

====Intracapsular====
The knee is stabilized by a pair of cruciate ligaments. These ligaments are both extrasynovial, intracapsular ligaments. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) stretches from the lateral condyle of femur to the anterior intercondylar area. The ACL prevents the tibia from being pushed too far anterior relative to the femur. It is often torn during twisting or bending of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stretches from medial condyle of femur to the posterior intercondylar area. This ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur. Injury to this ligament is uncommon but can occur as a direct result of forced trauma to the ligament.

The transverse ligament stretches from the lateral meniscus to the medial meniscus. It passes in front of the menisci. It is divided into several strips in 10% of cases. The two menisci are attached to each other anteriorly by the ligament. The posterior (of Wrisberg) and anterior meniscofemoral ligaments (of Humphrey) stretch from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle. They pass anterior and posterior to the posterior cruciate ligament respectively. The meniscotibial ligaments (or &quot;coronary&quot;) stretches from inferior edges of the menisci to the periphery of the tibial plateaus.

====Extracapsular====
The patellar ligament connects the patella to the tuberosity of the tibia. It is also occasionally called the patellar tendon because there is no definite separation between the quadriceps tendon (which surrounds the patella) and the area connecting the patella to the tibia. This very strong ligament helps give the patella its mechanical leverage and also functions as a cap for the condyles of the femur. Laterally and medially to the patellar ligament, the lateral and medial retinacula connect fibers from the vasti lateralis and medialis muscles to the tibia. Some fibers from the iliotibial tract radiate into the lateral retinaculum and the medial retinaculum receives some transverse fibers arising on the medial femoral epicondyle.

The medial collateral ligament (MCL a.k.a. &quot;tibial&quot;) stretches from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial tibial condyle. It is composed of three groups of fibers, one stretching between the two bones, and two fused with the medial meniscus. The MCL is partly covered by the pes anserinus and the tendon of the semimembranosus passes under it. It protects the medial side of the knee from being bent open by a stress applied to the lateral side of the knee (a valgus force).

The lateral collateral ligament (LCL a.k.a. &quot;fibular&quot;) stretches from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of fibula. It is separate from both the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus. It protects the lateral side from an inside bending force (a varus force). The anterolateral ligament (ALL) is situated in front of the LCL.

Lastly, there are two ligaments on the dorsal side of the knee. The oblique popliteal ligament is a radiation of the tendon of the semimembranosus on the medial side, from where it is direct laterally and proximally. The arcuate popliteal ligament originates on the apex of the head of the fibula to stretch proximally, crosses the tendon of the popliteus muscle, and passes into the capsule.

==Muscles==
The most muscles responsible for the movement of the knee joint belong to either the anterior, medial or posterior compartment of the thigh. The extensors generally belong to the anterior compartment and the flexors to the posterior. The two exceptions to this is gracilis, a flexor, which belongs to the medial compartment and sartorius, a flexor, in the anterior compartment. Additionally, some muscles in the lower leg provide weak knee flexion, namely the gastrocnemius, in addition to their primary function of moving the foot.

===Blood supply===

The femoral artery and the popliteal artery help form the arterial network or plexus, surrounding the knee joint. There are six main branches: two superior genicular arteries, two inferior genicular arteries, the descending genicular artery and the recurrent branch of anterior tibial artery.

The medial genicular arteries penetrate the knee joint.

==Function==
The knee permits flexion and extension about a virtual transverse axis, as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation about the axis of the lower leg in the flexed position. The knee joint is called &quot;mobile&quot; because the femur and lateral meniscus move over the tibia during rotation, while the femur rolls and glides over both menisci during extension-flexion.

The center of the transverse axis of the extension/flexion movements is located where both collateral ligaments and both cruciate ligaments intersect. This center moves upward and backward during flexion, while the distance between the center and the articular surfaces of the femur changes dynamically with the decreasing curvature of the femoral condyles. The total range of motion is dependent on several parameters such as soft-tissue restraints, active insufficiency, and hamstring tightness.
===Extended position===
With the knee extended, both the lateral and medial collateral ligaments, as well as the anterior part of the anterior cruciate ligament, are taut. During extension, the femoral condyles glide and roll into a position which causes the complete unfolding of the tibial collateral ligament. During the last 10° of extension, an obligatory terminal rotation is triggered in which the knee is rotated medially 5°. The final rotation is produced by a lateral rotation of the tibia in the non-weight-bearing leg, and by a medial rotation of the femur in the weight-bearing leg. This terminal rotation is made possible by the shape of the medial femoral condyle, assisted by contraction of the popliteus muscle and the iliotibial tract and is caused by the stretching of the anterior cruciate ligament. Both cruciate ligaments are slightly unwound and both lateral ligaments become taut.

===Flexed position===
In the flexed position, the collateral ligaments are relaxed while the cruciate ligaments are taut. Rotation is controlled by the twisted cruciate ligaments; the two ligaments get twisted around each other during medial rotation of the tibia—which reduces the amount of rotation possible—while they become unwound during lateral rotation of the tibia. Because of the oblique position of the cruciate ligaments, at least a part of one of them is always tense and these ligaments control the joint as the collateral ligaments are relaxed. Furthermore, the dorsal fibers of the tibial collateral ligament become tensed during extreme medial rotation and the ligament also reduces the lateral rotation to 45–60°.

==Clinical significance==

Knee pain is caused by trauma, misalignment, degeneration, and conditions producing arthritis. The most common knee disorder is generally known as patellofemoral syndrome. The majority of minor cases of knee pain can be treated at home with rest and ice, but more serious injuries do require surgical care.

One form of patellofemoral syndrome involves a tissue-related problem that creates pressure and irritation in the knee between the patella and the trochlea (patellar compression syndrome), which causes pain. The second major class of knee disorder involves a tear, slippage, or dislocation that impairs the structural ability of the knee to balance the leg (patellofemoral instability syndrome). Patellofemoral instability syndrome may cause either pain, a sense of poor balance, or both.

Prepatellar bursitis also known as &quot;housemaid&#x27;s knee&quot; is painful inflammation of the prepatellar bursa (a frontal knee bursa) often brought about by occupational activity such as roofing.

Age also contributes to disorders of the knee. Particularly in older people, knee pain frequently arises due to osteoarthritis. In addition, weakening of tissues around the knee may contribute to the problem. Patellofemoral instability may relate to hip abnormalities or to tightness of surrounding ligaments.

Cartilage lesions can be caused by:
*Accidents (fractures)
*Injuries
*The removal of a meniscus
*Anterior cruciate ligament injury
*Posterior cruciate ligament injury
*Posterolateral corner injury
*Medial knee injuries
*Considerable strain on the knee.

Any kind of work during which the knees undergo heavy stress may also be detrimental to cartilage. This is especially the case in professions in which people frequently have to walk, lift, or squat. Other causes of pain may be excessive on, and wear off, the knees, in combination with such things as muscle weakness and overweight.

Common complaints:
*A painful, blocked, locked or swollen knee.
*Sufferers sometimes feel as if their knees are about to give way, or may feel uncertain about their movement.

===Overall fitness and knee injury===
Physical fitness is related integrally to the development of knee problems. The same activity such as climbing stairs may cause pain from patellofemoral compression for someone who is physically unfit, but not for someone else (or even for that person at a different time). Obesity is another major contributor to knee pain. For instance, a 30-year-old woman who weighed at age 18 years, before her three pregnancies, and now weighs , had added of force across her patellofemoral joint with each step.

===Common injuries due to physical activity===

In sports that place great pressure on the knees, especially with twisting forces, it is common to tear one or more ligaments or cartilages. Some of the most common knee injuries are those to the medial side: medial knee injuries.

===Anterior cruciate ligament injury===

The anterior cruciate ligament is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee. The injury is common during sports. Twisting of the knee is a common cause of over-stretching or tearing the ACL. When the ACL is injured a popping sound may be heard, and the leg may suddenly give out. Besides swelling and pain, walking may be painful and the knee will feel unstable. Minor tears of the anterior cruciate ligament may heal over time, but a torn ACL requires surgery. After surgery, recovery is prolonged and low impact exercises are recommended to strengthen the joint.

===Torn meniscus injury===
The menisci act as shock absorbers and separate the two ends of bone in the knee joint. There are two menisci in the knee, the medial (inner) and the lateral (outer). When there is torn cartilage, it means that the meniscus has been injured. Meniscus tears occur during sports often when the knee is twisted. Menisci injury may be innocuous and one may be able to walk after a tear, but soon swelling and pain set in. Sometimes the knee will lock while bending. Pain often occurs when one squats. Small meniscus tears are treated conservatively but most large tears require surgery.

===Fractures===

Knee fractures are rare but do occur, especially as a result of a road accident. Knee fractures include a patella fracture, and a type of avulsion fracture called a Segond fracture. There is usually immediate pain and swelling, and a difficulty or inability to stand on the leg. The muscles go into spasm and even the slightest movements are painful. X-rays can easily confirm the injury and surgery will depend on the degree of displacement and type of fracture.

===Ruptured tendon===

Tendons usually attach muscle to bone. In the knee the quadriceps and patellar tendon can sometimes tear. The injuries to these tendons occur when there is forceful contraction of the knee. If the tendon is completely torn, bending or extending the leg is impossible. A completely torn tendon requires surgery but a partially torn tendon can be treated with leg immobilization followed by physical therapy.

===Overuse===
Overuse injuries of the knee include tendonitis, bursitis, muscle strains, and iliotibial band syndrome. These injuries often develop slowly over weeks or months. Activities that induce pain usually delay healing. Rest, ice and compression do help in most cases. Once the swelling has diminished, heat packs can increase blood supply and promote healing. Most overuse injuries subside with time but can flare up if the activities are quickly resumed. Individuals may reduce the chances of overuse injuries by warming up prior to exercise, by limiting high impact activities and keep their weight under control.

===Varus or valgus deformity===

There are two disorders relating to an abnormal angle in the coronal plane at the level of the knee:
*&quot;Genu valgum&quot; is a valgus deformity in which the tibia is turned outward in relation to the femur, resulting in a knock-kneed appearance.
*&quot;Genu varum&quot; is a varus deformity in which the tibia is turned inward in relation to the femur, resulting in a bowlegged deformity.
The degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the &quot;hip-knee-ankle angle&quot;, which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint. It is normally between 1.0° and 1.5° of varus in adults. Normal ranges are different in children.
===Chronic pain from osteoarthritis===

Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of pain and disability worldwide, with prevalence estimated at about 4% of the population, particularly among the elderly. Radiofrequency ablation of certain knee nerves is an outpatient procedure to reduce chronic arthritic pain. Using radiofrequency energy delivered via small electrodes positioned at target genicular nerves, the treatment achieves partial sensory denervation of the joint capsule. Despite the extensive innervation of the knee, specifically targeting the superior lateral, superior medial, and inferior medial genicular nerves has proved to be an effective ablation method for reducing chronic knee pain. In clinical research, such treatment has been shown to produce about 50% less knee pain for up to two years after the procedure.

===Surgical interventions===

Before the advent of arthroscopy and arthroscopic surgery, patients having surgery for a torn ACL required at least nine months of rehabilitation, having initially spent several weeks in a full-length plaster cast. With current techniques, such patients may be walking without crutches in two weeks, and playing some sports in a few months.

In addition to developing new surgical procedures, ongoing research is looking into underlying problems which may increase the likelihood of an athlete suffering a severe knee injury. These findings may lead to effective preventive measures, especially in female athletes, who have been shown to be especially vulnerable to ACL tears from relatively minor trauma.

Articular cartilage repair treatment:
*Arthroscopic debridement of the knee (arthroscopic lavage)
* Mosaïc-plasty
*Microfracture (Ice-picking)
*Autologous chondrocyte implantation
*Osteochondral Autograft and Allografts
*PLC Reconstruction

==Imaging==
===MRI===
Both anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligaments (PCL) are hypointense on both T1 and T2 weighted images of MRI. However, some high signal striations are often seen at the distal part of the ACL, making ACL higher intensity than PCL on MRI scans.

==Other animals==

In humans, the term &quot;knee&quot; refers to the joints between the femur, tibia, and patella, in the leg.

In quadrupeds such as dogs, horses, and mice, the homologous joints between the femur, tibia, and patella, in the hind leg, are known as the stifle joint. Also in quadrupeds, particularly horses, ungulates, and elephants, the layman&#x27;s term &quot;knee&quot; also commonly refers to the forward-facing joint in the foreleg, the carpus, which is homologous to the human wrist.

In birds, the &quot;knee&quot; is the joint between the femur and tibiotarsus, and also the patella (when present). The layman&#x27;s term &quot;knee&quot; may also refer to the (lower and often more visible due to not being covered by feathers) joint between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus, which is homologous to the human ankle.

In insects and other animals, the term knee widely refers to any hinge joint.

<text>Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1989 in Huntington Beach, California. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers.

==Band history==

===Formation===
The members of Guttermouth began playing music in various parts of Orange County, California in the early 1980s. Singer Mark Adkins performed in the La Habra punk rock band Republic in 1982 with guitarist and classmate Scott Sheldon. Adkins has remained the sole permanent member of Guttermouth over all its iterations; some of the songs written by Sheldon and Adkins at this time would later be used in Guttermouth and would remain in their live set throughout their career. Republic broke up in 1984 and the two moved on to other projects: Sheldon played in a band with drummer James Nunn while Adkins tried various other musical projects, including one with Nunn. Adkins joined guitarists Eric &quot;Derek&quot; Davis and Barry Burnham, bassist Paul &quot;Fang&quot; Denis, and drummer Tim Baulch in their band Critical Noise. Baulch suggested the name Guttermouth for the new lineup, and this early incarnation of the band played shows, parties and skateboard demo&#x27;s during 1988 until Davis relocated to nearby Huntington Beach in 1989, effectively dissolving the group. About a year later Adkins and Nunn also moved there. Adkins approached Burnham and Baulch about starting the band back up but the two declined. Adkins and Davis recruited Sheldon to replace Burnham and Nunn to replace Baulch. They also recruited an early fan of the band, bassist Clint Weinrich to join them. This solidified the &quot;original&quot; lineup of the band with Mark Adkins on vocals, Scott Sheldon and Eric Davis on guitars, Clint Weinrich on bass and James Nunn on drums, a lineup which would remain consistent over the next six years and two albums.

===First album===
By the summer of 1989, Guttermouth began performing in Huntington Beach and Orange County, building a small but enthusiastic local following. Their music was heavily influenced by the Los Angeles and Orange County punk rock scenes of the 1980s which included bands like the Adolescents, The Vandals, Social Distortion, Fear, the Descendents, Angry Samoans, Bad Religion and Black Flag. From these influences Guttermouth developed their own style of fast punk tempos with humorously sarcastic and offensive lyrics coupled with equally outrageous and offensive behavior, developing a reputation for chaotic live shows. In 1991, they were approached by local record label Dr. Strange about putting out an album, and entered Westbeach Recorders to record and release their first 7-inch record, &quot;Puke&quot;. Later that year they released another 7-inch, &quot;Balls&quot;, and finally their first LP, aptly titled &quot;Full Length LP&quot;.

&quot;Full Length&quot; proved to be a success for the band, expanding their fan base and giving them opportunities to perform throughout southern California alongside other popular punk rock bands. The album was soon re-released in CD format by Dr. Strange and an animated music video was made for the song &quot;1, 2, 3…Slam!&quot; to be played on local punk rock and skateboarding video programs. The band continued to play locally, developing friendships with fellow Orange County punk bands such as The Offspring and the Vandals. They played a show opening for the Vandals at the Ice House in Fullerton which was filmed for the Vandals live album &quot;Sweatin’ to the Oldies&quot;. Guttermouth continued to promote &quot;Full Length&quot; over the next few years and also released 7-inch vinyl singles for the new songs &quot;Veggicide&quot; and &quot;P.C.&quot; In 1993, they recorded the 7-inch EP &quot;11oz.&quot; as the first release put out by newly formed label Hopeless Records.

===&quot;Friendly People&quot; and tours===
By 1994, &quot;Full Length&quot; had been available for almost four years and the members of Guttermouth were preparing to write a second album. They originally considered releasing the album themselves, but were soon approached with an offer from Offspring singer Dexter Holland, who in the wake of his own band&#x27;s success was starting an independent record label and wanted to put out Guttermouth&#x27;s next album as his first release. They agreed and recorded the album &quot;Friendly People&quot; as the first release on Holland&#x27;s new label Nitro Records, and filmed an independent music video for the song &quot;End on 9.&quot; Guttermouth would remain with Nitro over the next five years, releasing an album each year on the label.

1994 also found the band playing to a much larger audience. The success that year of The Offspring&#x27;s album &quot;Smash&quot; and Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot; had brought the southern California punk rock scene into the national spotlight. Thanks to their friendship with The Offspring and their new record deal with Nitro, Guttermouth found themselves embarking on their first national and world tours opening for larger punk bands. However, their typically outrageous behavior would often find them at odds with the other bands, audiences, and venues at which they played. After about six months of touring with this reputation the band found themselves banned from performing in numerous cities and clubs and blacklisted by many of the bands with whom they had hoped to tour. To the band, however, this behavior was typical and in keeping with the anarchic ideals that were at the core of the punk movement.

At one point, the band found themselves ejected from a tour while in South Carolina, where they booked themselves at a club and recorded a performance which would later be released as &quot;Live From the Pharmacy&quot;. Adkins was arrested and briefly jailed in 1995 on charges of inciting a riot during a Guttermouth show at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in San Bernardino, but evidence was insufficient to file charges.

===Lineup change===
The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve &quot;Stever&quot; Rapp, a college friend of Nunn&#x27;s who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band&#x27;s permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album &quot;Teri Yakimoto&quot;. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song &quot;Whiskey.&quot; With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released &quot;Full Length&quot; in CD format with bonus tracks under the title &quot;The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP&quot;.

In 1997, the band recorded &quot;Musical Monkey&quot;, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their &quot;classic&quot; sound, and songs such as &quot;Lucky the Donkey,&quot; &quot;Do the Hustle,&quot; &quot;Lipstick&quot; and &quot;Perfect World&quot; became staples in their live set. The following year they released &quot;Live From the Pharmacy&quot;, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band&#x27;s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: &quot;oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.&quot; Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system, no record remains on file.

Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William &quot;Ty&quot; Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released &quot;Gorgeous&quot;, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro.

===Move to Epitaph===
In 2000, Guttermouth appeared performing in the Kung Fu Films movie &quot;That Darn Punk&quot;, an appearance which stemmed from their longtime friendship with the Vandals. That year the band also signed to Epitaph Records, the label operated by Bad Religion&#x27;s Brett Gurewitz which had grown throughout the 1990s into one of the largest independent labels in the country. For their 2001 album &quot;Covered With Ants&quot; the band combined their punk rock sound with instruments they had not used on albums before, including organ, banjo and fiddle. A music video was filmed for the song &quot;She&#x27;s Got the Look&quot; and the band continued to tour.

As the band prepared to work on their next album in 2002, founding member James Nunn left the group. While original bassist Clint Weinrich filled in on tours, guitarists Eric Davis and Scott Sheldon played bass for the album&#x27;s recording along with studio bassist Hedge. The musical direction shifted to territory the band had not hitherto explored, and the resulting album &quot;Gusto&quot; was substantially different from their previous efforts, with a slower speed and more melody and pop influence. Though the band&#x27;s irreverent sense of humor remained intact, the music was much less characteristically &quot;punk&quot; than anything the band had played before. Response to the album was mixed, and the band members would later look back on it as something of a failed experiment. In 2003 Weinrich again rejoined the band for a series of shows including a performance at the House of Blues in Anaheim which was filmed and released by Kung Fu Records as a live concert CD and DVD package. The show&#x27;s closing performance of &quot;Perfect World&quot; was removed from the DVD release of the show because a minor could be seen drinking alcohol on stage with the band. However, on the packaging of the DVD itself it is said that it was edited due to a frenzied crowd that damaged equipment, although the audio portion was preserved on the CD.

The band&#x27;s next album &quot;Eat Your Face&quot;, released jointly through Epitaph and Volcom Entertainment in 2004, was hailed as a return to form. Founding guitarist Eric Davis had left the band and been replaced by Donald &quot;Don&quot; Horne, while former Slick Shoes bassist Kevin Clark filled the vacant bass position. Musically the album returned to the fast, loud punk rock style the band was known for, with many of the songs recorded in just a few takes. Lyrically it retained the band&#x27;s sense of biting sarcasm and expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. electoral system and the current state of punk rock in the mainstream, amongst other topics.

===Warped Tour controversy===
In the summer of 2004, Guttermouth embarked on the Vans Warped Tour, playing on the Volcom side stage. In keeping with their reputation for outrageous and offensive behavior, Adkins would often openly insult other acts from onstage, declaring that bands such as Simple Plan and My Chemical Romance cared more about their fashionable clothing and popularity than about the quality of their music. The band members also mocked what they saw as an uninformed political display of many bands on the tour by selling T-shirts and displaying banners that jokingly proclaimed support for President George W. Bush (many of the bands and media booths supported an anti-Republican stance in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election). After several weeks on the tour Guttermouth was &quot;politely&quot; asked to leave, fueling rumors that other performers had petitioned to have them ejected. Eventually, however, Adkins issued a statement apologizing to Warped Tour manager Kevin Lyman and admitting that the band had left the tour voluntarily, due in part to his distaste for the political atmosphere surrounding it.

===Recent activity===
In 2005, drummer Ty Smith left Guttermouth and was replaced by Ryan Farrell. Bass player Kevin Clark departed the following year and founding member Clint Weinrich returned to the group. This lineup recorded the band&#x27;s tenth album &quot;Shave the Planet&quot;, released in 2006 by Volcom Entertainment. The album found the band once again using their brand of humorous punk rock to poke fun at a number of subjects. Although Weinrich remains a member of the band, Clark has since rejoined the group and handles most of the touring. In June 2008, Farrell announced that Sheldon had left the band to focus on his family, having recently had a fourth child. The band&#x27;s official Myspace profile lists Sheldon&#x27;s replacement as Dave Luckett, with Donald Horne being replaced by Hunter Munich. In December 2008, Adkins announced that the band had returned to Hopeless Records, one of their first record labels, in celebration of their 20th Anniversary, and that Guttermouth is working on a new album. A further line-up change occurred in 2009, when Munich was replaced by Brandon Zinkil.

After a hiatus and further controversy on a 2013 tour, singer Adkins moved to Mexico and reformed the band in 2015.

Guttermouth with Bird Attack Records and Rude Records released Got it Made, a six-song EP, on July 15, 2016. The band followed up with another studio EP titled &quot;New Car Smell&quot; in 2017, along with a live recording titled &quot;The Whole Enchilada&quot;. Those two releases were also under the Bird Attack Records and Rude Records labels.

Guttermouth completed a successful tours of Australia in 2023 and 2024, and returned to touring in Florida and both Northern and Southern California.

<text>Gusto is the seventh album by California pop punk band Guttermouth, released in 2002 by Epitaph Records. It found the band taking their style of fast, abrasive punk rock in new directions, experimenting with elements of pop and other styles. Their usual tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics remain intact, but the album&#x27;s overall sound is quite different from any of their others. This was due partly to a lineup change: founding member and frequent songwriter James Nunn had left the group the previous year, leaving guitarists Scott Sheldon and Eric Davis to fill in on bass, along with studio bassist Hedge. The album received generally poor reviews from both critics and longtime fans, and would later be regarded by the band as somewhat of a failed experiment.

<text>Bryan Keith &quot;Dexter&quot; Holland (born December 29, 1965) is an American musician, best known as the co-founder, lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, main songwriter and composer, and only constant member of the punk rock band the Offspring. He co-founded with former bandmate Greg K. the record label Nitro Records, which he previously owned. He also has a PhD in molecular biology.

== Early life ==
Bryan Keith Holland was born in Garden Grove, California, on December 29, 1965. He attended Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, graduating as class valedictorian in 1984. He was the best student in his year at mathematics, which he found &quot;just as exciting as punk rock&quot;. He acquired the nickname &quot;Dexter&quot; for his academic prowess, taken from the slang term &quot;Poindexter&quot;.

Holland attended the University of Southern California, where he earned a BSc in biology and an MSc in molecular biology. He suspended his studies to focus on music when the Offspring found success in 1994, but later resumed and earned a PhD in molecular biology in May 2017. He defended his thesis, &quot;Discovery of mature microRNA sequences within the protein-coding regions of global HIV-1 genomes: predictions of novel mechanisms for viral infection and pathogenicity&quot;, under doctoral advisors Suraiya Rasheed and Bob Baker.

== Career ==
===Music===
Holland started a punk band named Manic Subsidal in 1984 with his friend and cross-country teammate Greg K. Holland played the drums. The band was formed when they failed to get into a Social Distortion concert. After James Lilja was hired as their drummer, Holland switched to vocals and guitars. Noodles then joined on guitar, and Manic Subsidal changed their name to the Offspring in 1986. After recording a demo in 1988, the Offspring signed a deal with a small-time independent record label, Nemesis Records, for whom they recorded their first full-length album, &quot;The Offspring&quot;, in March 1989. This album would eventually be re-issued in 1995, by Holland&#x27;s own record label, Nitro Records.

In 1991, the Offspring signed with Epitaph Records (home of Bad Religion, L7, NOFX, Pennywise and other similar bands). Their first release on the label was &quot;Ignition&quot;, which was released in 1992. Their last album for that label was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot;, which still holds the world record for most sales of an album on an independent label. The band then signed with Columbia Records in 1996 (after Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph and guitarist for Bad Religion, sold the contract to Columbia, Holland claims) for whom they released their next six albums, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; (1997), &quot;Americana&quot; (1998), &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; (2000), &quot;Splinter&quot; (2003), &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; (2008) and &quot;Days Go By&quot; (2012). The albums &quot;Let The Bad Times Roll&quot; (2021) and &quot;Supercharged&quot; (2024) were released on Concord Records. Holland is one of the two members (along with Noodles) to appear on all of The Offspring&#x27;s albums, and as of Greg K.&#x27;s split from the band in November 2018, he is the only remaining original member left.

Holland sometimes plays the piano during live shows. Occasionally the band plays &quot;Gone Away&quot;, with only Holland playing the song on piano. Holland sings in the tenor range.

He is also one of the co-founders of the record label Nitro Records, which he operated from 1994 to 2013, along with former bandmate Greg K.

=== Science ===
In a 1995 interview, Holland said that he would rather be a professor at a university than play music by the time he turns 40.

Holland was a doctoral student at the Laboratory of Viral Oncology and Proteomics Research, Keck School of Medicine, where he was supervised by Professor Suraiya Rasheed. In March 2013, Holland and co-authors published a paper in &quot;PLoS One&quot; regarding microRNA in HIV genomes, titled &quot;Identification of Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within the Protein-Encoding Genes of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus&quot;. The original academic paper describes the use of computational molecular biological (&quot;in silico&quot;) approaches to identify microRNA-like sequences in HIV. These sequences are suggested to have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading its immune responses and thus influence the persistence, replication, and pathogenicity of HIV. Holland was awarded his Ph.D. in molecular biology during the USC Commencement on May 12, 2017.

=== Business ===
In 2004, Holland launched his own brand of hot sauce called Gringo Bandito. The label depicts Holland with bandoliers, revolvers, a sombrero and shades, a design that OC Weekly magazine described as parodying the logo for Tapatío hot sauce or Pancho Villa. Holland, who grew up in Southern California where Mexican cuisine is considered a &quot;part of the way of life&quot;, wondered &quot;if [he] could do [a hot sauce] better&quot;.

On the conception of the hot sauce, Holland states that in the early 2000s, while eating Mexican food, he began to read the label of a bottle of Tapatío; &quot;It just clicked that I had to make one. People who like hot sauce are a certain type of people. They&#x27;re passionate. They&#x27;ll have a bottle with them wherever they go. I&#x27;m one of those people. And when I&#x27;m into something, I really get into it. It&#x27;s like my music—I liked records, so I learned how to play a guitar. After that? A band.&quot;

It has sold over a million bottles and is available in over 500 restaurants and 7,000 stores, including being a top-ranked hot sauce on Amazon.

The headquarters for Gringo Bandito are located in a Huntington Beach industrial park, next to the Offspring&#x27;s recording studio.

== Philanthropy ==
In 1997, Holland and former Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra teamed up to form the FSU Foundation, which raised funds through charity concerts. The foundation organized benefit shows to raise money for various charities including AIDS Project Los Angeles, Poor People&#x27;s United Fund, Trees Foundation, and Amnesty International.

Holland participated in the Los Angeles Marathon in 2006 and 2008 with his charity of choice being the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal clinic that handles legal cases where post-conviction DNA testing can yield conclusive proof of innocence.

== Artistry ==
Holland&#x27;s early musical influences include Aerosmith, the Beatles, the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, KISS, Bob Marley, Queen, and the Rolling Stones. 

All of Holland&#x27;s Ibanez RG body guitars are made out of mahogany and fitted with DiMarzio Super Distortion bridge pickups. During their latest recordings, Holland used a vintage Gibson SG Junior. He plays through a Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier.

== Personal life ==
Holland met hair stylist Kristine Luna in 1992, and they were married in 1995. She co-wrote the Offspring song &quot;Session&quot; and appeared in the music video for &quot;I Choose&quot;. They divorced in 2012. He married Amber Sasse in 2013. His daughter from a previous relationship, Alexa (born 1986), is also a musician and goes by the stage name Lex Land. Holland also has two children from his current marriage.

A licensed aircraft pilot, Holland completed a 10-day solo flight around the world in November 2004. He also enjoys surfing and collecting postage stamps from the Isle of Man.

<doc id="188515" wikidata="Q259138" url="?curid=188515" title="ECMAScript">
<text>ECMAScript (; ES) is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. It is best known as a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262.

ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for server-side applications and services using runtime environments such as Node.js, Deno and Bun.

== ECMAScript, ECMA-262, JavaScript ==
ECMA-262, or the &quot;ECMAScript Language Specification&quot;, defines the &quot;ECMAScript Language&quot;, or just ECMAScript. ECMA-262 specifies only language syntax and the semantics of the core application programming interface (API), such as , , and , while valid implementations of JavaScript add their own functionality such as input/output and file system handling.

== History==
The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape; initially named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. In December 1995, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release. In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the Ecma International standards organization to advance the standardization of JavaScript. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly in June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then. The name &quot;ECMAScript&quot; was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft, whose disputes dominated the early standards sessions. Eich commented that &quot;ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease.&quot; ECMAScript has been formalized through operational semantics by work at Stanford University and the Department of Computing, Imperial College London for security analysis and standardization.
&quot;ECMA&quot; stood for &quot;European Computer Manufacturers Association&quot; until 1994.

===Evolution===

Ecma&#x27;s Technical Committee 39 (TC39) is responsible for the maintenance of ECMAScript. New proposals to the language go through a staged process, with each stage representing the completeness of the proposal&#x27;s specification. Consensus must be reached within the committee to advance a proposal to the next stage. Proposals that reach stage 4, the final stage, will be included into the next version of the standard. Since the release of version 6 in June 2015, new major versions have been finalized and published every June.

== Features ==
The ECMAScript language includes structured, dynamic, functional, and prototype-based features.

=== Imperative and structured ===
ECMAScript JavaScript supports C-style structured programming. Previously, JavaScript only supported function scoping using the keyword codice_1, but ECMAScript 2015 added the keywords codice_2 and codice_3, allowing JavaScript to support both block scoping and function scoping. JavaScript supports automatic semicolon insertion, meaning that semicolons that normally terminate a statement in C may be omitted in JavaScript.

Like C-style languages, control flow is done with the , , / , / , and statements. Functions are weakly typed and may accept and return any type. Arguments not provided default to .

=== Weakly typed ===
ECMAScript is weakly typed. This means that certain types are assigned implicitly based on the operation being performed. However, there are several quirks in JavaScript&#x27;s implementation of the conversion of a variable from one type to another. These quirks have been the subject of a talk entitled &quot;Wat&quot;.

=== Dynamic ===
ECMAScript is dynamically typed. Thus, a type is associated with a value rather than an expression. ECMAScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.

=== Transpiling ===

Since ES 2015, transpiling JavaScript has become very common. Transpilation is a source-to-source compilation in which newer versions of JavaScript are used, and a transpiler rewrites the source code so that it is supported by older browsers. Usually, transpilers transpile down to ES3 to maintain compatibility with all versions of browsers. The settings to transpile to a specific version can be configured according to need. Transpiling adds an extra step to the build process and is sometimes done to avoid needing polyfills. Polyfills create new features for older environments that lack them. Polyfills do this at runtime in the interpreter, such as the user&#x27;s browser or on the server. Instead, transpiling rewrites the ECMA code itself during the build phase of development before it reaches the interpreter.

== Conformance ==
In 2010, Ecma International started developing a standards test for Ecma 262 ECMAScript.
Test262 is an ECMAScript conformance test suite that can be used to check how closely a JavaScript implementation follows the ECMAScript Specification. The test suite contains thousands of individual tests, each of which tests some specific requirement(s) of the ECMAScript specification. The development of Test262 is a project of the Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39). The testing framework and the individual tests are contributed to Ecma by member organizations of TC39.

Important contributions were made by Google (Sputnik test suite) and Microsoft, who both contributed thousands of tests.
The Test262 test suite consisted of tests . ECMAScript specifications through ES7 are well-supported in major web browsers. The table below shows the conformance rate for current versions of software with respect to the most recent editions of ECMAScript.

<doc id="188517" wikidata="Q2354624" url="?curid=188517" title="Micropsia">
<text>Micropsia is a condition affecting human visual perception in which objects are perceived to be smaller than they actually are. Micropsia can be caused by optical factors (such as wearing glasses), by distortion of images in the eye (such as optically, via swelling of the cornea or from changes in the shape of the retina such as from retinal edema, macular degeneration, or central serous retinopathy), by changes in the brain (such as from traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, migraines, or drugs), and from psychological factors. Dissociative phenomena are linked with micropsia, which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance.

Micropsia is also commonly reported when the eyes are fixating at (convergence), or focusing at (accommodation), a distance closer than that of the object in accord with Emmert&#x27;s law. Specific types of micropsia include hemimicropsia, a form of micropsia that is localized to one half of the visual field and can be caused by brain lesions in one of the cerebral hemispheres.

Related visual distortion conditions include macropsia, a less common condition with the reverse effect, and Alice in Wonderland syndrome, a condition that has symptoms that can include both micropsia and macropsia.

==Signs and symptoms==
Micropsia causes affected individuals to perceive objects as being smaller or more distant than they actually are.

The majority of individuals with micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients with micropsia to be able to indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite having micropsia.

Individuals experiencing hemimicropsia often complain that objects in their left or right visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed. They may also have difficulty appreciating the symmetry of pictures. When drawing, patients often have a tendency to compensate for their perceptual asymmetry by drawing the left or right half of objects slightly larger than the other. In a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects, the size of the picture on the left half was on average 16% larger than the corresponding right half.

==Diagnosis==

EEG testing can diagnose patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp waves in the medial temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition, which can in turn be the cause of an epileptic patient&#x27;s micropsia.

The Amsler grid test can be used to diagnose macular degeneration. For this test, patients are asked to look at a grid, and distortions or blank spots in the patient&#x27;s central field of vision can be detected. A positive diagnosis of macular degeneration may account for a patient&#x27;s micropsia.

A controlled size comparison task can be employed to evaluate objectively whether a person is experiencing hemimicropsia. For each trial, a pair of horizontally aligned circles is presented on a computer screen, and the person being tested is asked to decide which circle is larger. After a set of trials, the overall pattern of responses should display a normal distance effect where the more similar the two circles, the higher the number of errors. This test is able to effectively diagnose micropsia and confirm which hemisphere is being distorted.

Due to the large range of causes that lead to micropsia, diagnosis varies among cases. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may find lesions and hypodense areas in the temporal and occipital lobes. MRI and CT techniques are able to rule out lesions as the cause for micropsia, but are not sufficient to diagnose the most common causes.

===Definition===
Micropsia is the most common visual distortion, or dysmetropsia. It is categorized as an illusion in the positive phenomena grouping of abnormal visual distortions.
* Convergence-accommodative micropsia is a physiologic phenomenon in which an object appears smaller as it approaches the subject.
* Psychogenic micropsia can present itself in individuals with certain psychiatric disorders.
* Retinal micropsia is characterized by an increase in the distance between retinal photoreceptors and is associated with decreased visual acuity.
* Cerebral micropsia is a rare form of micropsia that can arise in children with chronic migraines.
* Hemimicropsia is a type of cerebral micropsia that occurs within one half of the visual field.

===Differential diagnosis===
Of all of the visual distortions, micropsia has the largest variety of causes.

====Migraines====
Micropsia can occur during the aura phase of a migraine attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. Micropsia, along with hemianopsia, quadrantopsia, scotoma, phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, diplopia, dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, is a type of aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache. The symptom usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the migraine headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with migraine headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as micropsia are most common in children with migraines.

====Seizures====
The most frequent neurological origin of micropsia is a result of temporal lobe seizures. These seizures affect the entire visual field of the patient. More rarely, micropsia can be part of purely visual seizures. This in turn only affects one half of the visual field and is accompanied by other cerebral visual disturbances. The most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is medial temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex. Micropsia often occurs as an aura signalling a seizure in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Most auras last for a very short period, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes.

====Drug use====
Micropsia can result from the action of mescaline and other hallucinogenic drugs. Although drug-induced changes in perception usually subside as the chemical leaves the body, long-term cocaine use can result in the chronic residual effect of micropsia. Micropsia can be a symptom of Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, or HPPD, in which a person can experience hallucinogenic flashbacks long after ingesting a hallucinogen. A majority of these flashbacks are visual distortions which include micropsia, and 15-80% of hallucinogen users may experience these flashbacks. Micropsia can also be a rare side effect of zolpidem, a prescription medication used to temporarily treat insomnia.

====Psychological factors====
Psychiatric patients may experience micropsia in an attempt to distance themselves from situations involving conflict. Micropsia may also be a symptom of psychological conditions in which patients visualize people as small objects as a way to control others in response to their insecurities and feelings of weakness. In some adults who experienced loneliness as children, micropsia may arise as a mirror of prior feelings of separation from people and objects.

====Epstein-Barr virus infection====
Micropsia can be caused by swelling of the cornea due to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and can therefore present as an initial symptom of EBV mononucleosis, a disease caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection.

====Retinal edema====
Micropsia can result from retinal edema causing a dislocation of the receptor cells. Photoreceptor misalignment seems to occur following the surgical re-attachment for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. After surgery, patients may experience micropsia as a result of larger photoreceptor separation by edematous fluid.

====Macular degeneration====
Macular degeneration typically produces micropsia due to the swelling or bulging of the macula, an oval-shaped yellow spot near the center of the retina in the human eye. The main factors leading to this disease are age, smoking, heredity, and obesity. Some studies show that consuming spinach or collard greens five times a week cuts the risk of macular degeneration by 43%.

====Central serous chorioretinopathy====
CSCR is a disease in which a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The most common symptoms that result from the disease are a deterioration of visual acuity and micropsia.

====Brain lesions====
Micropsia is sometimes seen in individuals with brain infarctions. The damaged side of the brain conveys size information that contradicts the size information conveyed by the other side of the brain. This causes a contradiction to arise between the true perception of an object&#x27;s size and the smaller perception of the object, and micropsic bias ultimately causes the individual to experience micropsia. Lesions affecting other parts of the extracerebral visual pathways can also cause micropsia.

==Treatment==
Treatment varies for micropsia due to the large number of different causes for the condition.

Treatments involving the occlusion of one eye and the use of a prism fitted over an eyeglass lens have both been shown to provide relief from micropsia.

Micropsia that is induced by macular degeneration can be treated in several ways. A study called AREDS (age-related eye disease study) determined that taking dietary supplements containing high-dose antioxidants and zinc produced significant benefits with regard to disease progression. This study was the first ever to prove that dietary supplements can alter the natural progression and complications of a disease state. Laser treatments also look promising but are still in clinical stages.

==Epidemiology==
Episodes of micropsia or macropsia occur in 9% of adolescents.

10-35% of those with migraines experience auras, with 88% of these patients experiencing both visual auras (which include micropsia) and neurological auras.

Micropsia seems to be slightly more common in boys than in girls among children who experience migraines.

Approximately 80% of temporal lobe seizures produce auras that may lead to micropsia or macropsia. They are a common feature of simple partial seizures and usually precede complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin.

Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which can produce micropsia predominantly affects persons between the ages of 20 and 50. Women appear to be affected more than men by a factor of almost 3 to 1.

==Society and culture==

=== Comparison with &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; ===
Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, a neurological condition associated with both micropsia and macropsia, is named after Lewis Carroll&#x27;s famous 19th century novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In the story, the title character, Alice, experiences numerous situations similar to those of micropsia and macropsia. Speculation has arisen that Carroll may have written the story using his own direct experience with episodes of micropsia resulting from the numerous migraines he was known to have. It has also been suggested that Carroll may have had temporal lobe epilepsy.

=== Comparison with &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; ===
Micropsia has also been related to Jonathan Swift&#x27;s novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. It has been referred to as &quot;Lilliput sight&quot; and &quot;Lilliputian hallucination,&quot; a term coined by British physician Raoul Leroy in 1909, based on the small people that inhabited the island of Lilliput in the novel.

==Research==
Current experimental evidence focuses on the involvement of the occipitotemporal pathway in both the perceptual equivalence of objects across translations of retinal position and also across size modifications. Recent evidence points to this pathway as a mediator for an individual&#x27;s perception of size. Even further, numerous cases suggest that size perception may be dissociated from other aspects of visual perception such as color and movement. However, more research is called for to correctly relate the condition to defined physiological conditions.

Current research is being done on macular degeneration which could help prevent cases of micropsia. A variety of drugs that block vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are being evaluated as a treatment option. These treatments for the first time have produced actual improvements in vision, rather than simply delaying or arresting the continued loss of vision characteristic of macular degeneration. A number of surgical treatments are also being investigated for macular degeneration lesions that may not qualify for laser treatment, including macular translocation to a healthier area of the eye, displacement of submacular blood using gas, and removing membranes by surgery.
