<text>The nuclear fuel cycle, also called nuclear fuel chain, is the progression of nuclear fuel through a series of differing stages. It consists of steps in the &quot;front end&quot;, which are the preparation of the fuel, steps in the &quot;service period&quot; in which the fuel is used during reactor operation, and steps in the &quot;back end&quot;, which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either reprocess or dispose of spent nuclear fuel. If spent fuel is not reprocessed, the fuel cycle is referred to as an &quot;open fuel cycle&quot; (or a &quot;once-through fuel cycle&quot;); if the spent fuel is reprocessed, it is referred to as a &quot;closed fuel cycle&quot;.

==Basic concepts==

Nuclear power relies on fissionable material that can sustain a chain reaction with neutrons. Examples of such materials include uranium and plutonium. Most nuclear reactors use a moderator to lower the kinetic energy of the neutrons and increase the probability that fission will occur. This allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of fissile isotopes than are needed for nuclear weapons. Graphite and heavy water are the most effective moderators, because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them. Reactors using heavy water or graphite as the moderator can operate using natural uranium.

A light water reactor (LWR) uses water in the form that occurs in nature, and requires fuel enriched to higher concentrations of fissile isotopes. Typically, LWRs use uranium enriched to 3–5% U-235, the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature. One alternative to this low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel is mixed oxide (MOX) fuel produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium, and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus weapons-grade plutonium. Another type of MOX fuel involves mixing LEU with thorium, which generates the fissile isotope U-233. Both plutonium and U-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by irradiating fertile materials in a reactor, in particular the common uranium isotope U-238 and thorium, respectively, and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in reprocessing plants.

Some reactors do not use moderators to slow the neutrons. Like nuclear weapons, which also use unmoderated or &quot;fast&quot; neutrons, these fast-neutron reactors require much higher concentrations of fissile isotopes in order to sustain a chain reaction. They are also capable of breeding fissile isotopes from fertile materials; a breeder reactor is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes.

During the nuclear reaction inside a reactor, the fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel are consumed, producing more and more fission products, most of which are considered radioactive waste. The buildup of fission products and consumption of fissile isotopes eventually stop the nuclear reaction, causing the fuel to become a spent nuclear fuel. When 3% enriched LEU fuel is used, the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1% U-235, 95% U-238, 1% plutonium and 3% fission products. Spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous, although nuclear reactors produce orders of magnitude smaller volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel. Safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power, including their storage and disposal, is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power.

==Front end==
===Exploration===
A deposit of uranium, such as uraninite, discovered by geophysical techniques, is evaluated and sampled to determine the amounts of uranium materials that are extractable at specified costs from the deposit. Uranium reserves are the amounts of ore that are estimated to be recoverable at stated costs.

Naturally occurring uranium consists primarily of two isotopes U-238 and U-235, with 99.28% of the metal being U-238 while 0.71% is U-235, and the remaining 0.01% is mostly U-234. The number in such names refers to the isotope&#x27;s atomic mass number, which is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus.

The atomic nucleus of U-235 will nearly always fission when struck by a free neutron, and the isotope is therefore said to be a &quot;fissile&quot; isotope. The nucleus of a U-238 atom on the other hand, rather than undergoing fission when struck by a free neutron, will nearly always absorb the neutron and yield an atom of the isotope U-239. This isotope then undergoes natural radioactive decay to yield Pu-239, which, like U-235, is a fissile isotope. The atoms of U-238 are said to be fertile, because, through neutron irradiation in the core, some eventually yield atoms of fissile Pu-239.

===Mining===

Uranium ore can be extracted through conventional mining in open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other metals. In-situ leach mining methods also are used to mine uranium in the United States. In this technology, uranium is leached from the in-place ore through an array of regularly spaced wells and is then recovered from the leach solution at a surface plant. Uranium ores in the United States typically range from about 0.05 to 0.3% uranium oxide (U3O8). Some uranium deposits developed in other countries are of higher grade and are also larger than deposits mined in the United States. Uranium is also present in very low-grade amounts (50 to 200 parts per million) in some domestic phosphate-bearing deposits of marine origin. Because very large quantities of phosphate-bearing rock are mined for the production of wet-process phosphoric acid used in high analysis fertilizers and other phosphate chemicals, at some phosphate processing plants the uranium, although present in very low concentrations, can be economically recovered from the process stream.

===Milling===
When Uranium is mined out of the ground it does not contain enough pure uranium per pound to be used. The process of milling is how the cycle extracts the usable uranium from the rest of the materials, also known as tailings. To begin the milling process the ore is either ground into fine dust with water or crushed into dust without water. Once the Materials have been physically treated, they then begin the process of being chemically treated by being doused in acids. Acids used include hydrochloric and nitrous acids but the most common acids are sulfuric acids. Alternatively if the material that the ore is made of is particularly resistant to acids then an alkali is used instead. After being treated chemically the uranium particles are dissolved into the solution used to treat them. This solution is then filtered until what solids remain are separated from the liquids that contain the uranium. The undesirable solids are disposed of as tailings. Once the solution has had the tailings removed the uranium is extracted from the rest of the liquid solution, in one of two ways, solvent exchange or ion exchange. In the first of these a solvent is mixed into the solution. The dissolved uranium binds to the solvent and floats to the top while the other dissolved materials remain in the mixture. During ion exchange a different material is mixed into the solution and the uranium binds to it. Once filtered the material is panned out and washed off. The solution will repeat this process of filtration to pull as much usable uranium out as possible. The filtered uranium is then dried out into U3O8 uranium. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, &quot;yellowcake&quot;, which is sold on the uranium market as U3O8. Note that the material is not always yellow.

===Uranium conversion===
Usually milled uranium oxide, U3O8 (triuranium octoxide) is then processed into either of two substances depending on the intended use.

For use in most reactors, U3O8 is usually converted to uranium hexafluoride (UF6), the input stock for most commercial uranium enrichment facilities. A solid at room temperature, uranium hexafluoride becomes gaseous at 57 °C (134 °F). At this stage of the cycle, the uranium hexafluoride conversion product still has the natural isotopic mix (99.28% of U-238 plus 0.71% of U-235).

There are two ways to convert uranium oxide into its usable forms uranium dioxide and uranium hexafluoride; the wet option and the dry option. In the wet option the yellowcake is dissolved in nitric acid then extracted using tributyl phosphate. The resulting mixture is then dried and washed resulting in uranium trioxide. The uranium trioxide is then mixed with pure hydrogen resulting in uranium dioxide and dihydrogen monoxide or water. After that the uranium dioxide is mixed with four parts hydrogen fluoride resulting in more water and uranium tetrafluoride. Finally the end product of uranium hexafluoride is created by simply adding more fluoride to the mixture.

For use in reactors such as CANDU which do not require enriched fuel, the U3O8 may instead be converted to uranium dioxide (UO2) which can be included in ceramic fuel elements.

In the current nuclear industry, the volume of material converted directly to UO2 is typically quite small compared to that converted to UF6.

===Enrichment===

The natural concentration (0.71%) of the fissile isotope U-235 is less than that required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in light water reactor cores. Accordingly, UF6 produced from natural uranium sources must be enriched to a higher concentration of the fissionable isotope before being used as nuclear fuel in such reactors. The level of enrichment for a particular nuclear fuel order is specified by the customer according to the application they will use it for: light-water reactor fuel normally is enriched to 3.5% U-235, but uranium enriched to lower concentrations is also required. Enrichment is accomplished using any of several methods of isotope separation. Gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge are the commonly used uranium enrichment methods, but new enrichment technologies are currently being developed.

The bulk (96%) of the byproduct from enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), which can be used for armor, kinetic energy penetrators, radiation shielding and ballast. As of 2008 there are vast quantities of depleted uranium in storage. The United States Department of Energy alone has 470,000 tonnes. About 95% of depleted uranium is stored as uranium hexafluoride (UF6).

===Fabrication===

For use as nuclear fuel, enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted into uranium dioxide (UO2) powder that is then processed into pellet form. The pellets are then fired in a high temperature sintering furnace to create hard, ceramic pellets of enriched uranium. The cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size. The pellets are stacked, according to each nuclear reactor core&#x27;s design specifications, into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy. The tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor.

The alloy used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor. Stainless steel was used in the past, but most reactors now use a zirconium alloy. For the most common types of reactors, boiling water reactors (BWR) and pressurized water reactors (PWR), the tubes are assembled into bundles with the tubes spaced precise distances apart. These bundles are then given a unique identification number, which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal.

==Service period==

===Transport of radioactive materials===
Transport is an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle. There are nuclear power reactors in operation in several countries but uranium mining is viable in only a few areas. Also, in the course of over forty years of operation by the nuclear industry, a number of specialized facilities have been developed in various locations around the world to provide fuel cycle services and there is a need to transport nuclear materials to and from these facilities. Most transports of nuclear fuel material occur between different stages of the cycle, but occasionally a material may be transported between similar facilities. With some exceptions, nuclear fuel cycle materials are transported in solid form, the exception being uranium hexafluoride (UF6) which is considered a gas. Most of the material used in nuclear fuel is transported several times during the cycle. Transports are frequently international, and are often over large distances. Nuclear materials are generally transported by specialized transport companies.

Since nuclear materials are radioactive, it is important to ensure that radiation exposure of those involved in the transport of such materials and of the general public along transport routes is limited. Packaging for nuclear materials includes, where appropriate, shielding to reduce potential radiation exposures. In the case of some materials, such as fresh uranium fuel assemblies, the radiation levels are negligible and no shielding is required. Other materials, such as spent fuel and high-level waste, are highly radioactive and require special handling. To limit the risk in transporting highly radioactive materials, containers known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks are used which are designed to maintain integrity under normal transportation conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions.

While transport casks vary in design, material, size, and purpose, they are typically long tubes made of stainless steel or concrete with the ends sealed shut to prevent leaks. Frequently the casks&#x27; shell will have at least one layer of radiation-resistant material, such as lead. The inside of the tube will also vary depending on what is being transported. For example casks that are transporting depleted or unused fuel rods will have sleeves that keep the rods separate, while casks that transport uranium hexafluoride typically have no internal organization. Depending on the purpose and radioactivity of the materials some casks have systems of ventilation, thermal protection, impact protection, and other features more specific to the route and cargo.

===In-core fuel management===
A nuclear reactor core is composed of a few hundred &quot;assemblies&quot;, arranged in a regular array of cells, each cell being formed by a fuel or control rod surrounded, in most designs, by a moderator and coolant, which is water in most reactors.

Because of the fission process that consumes the fuels, the old fuel rods must be replaced periodically with fresh ones (this is called a (replacement) cycle). During a given replacement cycle only some of the assemblies (typically one-third) are replaced since fuel depletion occurs at different rates at different places within the reactor core. Furthermore, for efficiency reasons, it is not a good policy to put the new assemblies exactly at the location of the removed ones. Even bundles of the same age will have different burn-up levels due to their previous positions in the core. Thus the available bundles must be arranged in such a way that the yield is maximized, while safety limitations and operational constraints are satisfied. Consequently, reactor operators are faced with the so-called optimal fuel reloading problem, which consists of optimizing the rearrangement of all the assemblies, the old and fresh ones, while still maximizing the reactivity of the reactor core so as to maximise fuel burn-up and minimise fuel-cycle costs.

This is a discrete optimization problem, and computationally infeasible by current combinatorial methods, due to the huge number of permutations and the complexity of each computation. Many numerical methods have been proposed for solving it and many commercial software packages have been written to support fuel management. This is an ongoing issue in reactor operations as no definitive solution to this problem has been found. Operators use a combination of computational and empirical techniques to manage this problem.

====The study of used fuel====

Used nuclear fuel is studied in Post irradiation examination, where used fuel is examined to know more about the processes that occur in fuel during use, and how these might alter the outcome of an accident. For example, during normal use, the fuel expands due to thermal expansion, which can cause cracking. Most nuclear fuel is uranium dioxide, which is a cubic solid with a structure similar to that of calcium fluoride. In used fuel the solid state structure of most of the solid remains the same as that of pure cubic uranium dioxide. SIMFUEL is the name given to the simulated spent fuel which is made by mixing finely ground metal oxides, grinding as a slurry, spray drying it before heating in hydrogen/argon to 1700 °C. In SIMFUEL, 4.1% of the volume of the solid was in the form of metal nanoparticles which are made of molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium and palladium. Most of these metal particles are of the ε phase (hexagonal) of Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd alloy, while smaller amounts of the α (cubic) and σ (tetragonal) phases of these metals were found in the SIMFUEL. Also present within the SIMFUEL was a cubic perovskite phase which is a barium strontium zirconate (BaxSr1−xZrO3).

Uranium dioxide is minimally soluable in water, but after oxidation it can be converted to uranium trioxide or another uranium(VI) compound which is much more soluble. Uranium dioxide (UO2) can be oxidised to an oxygen rich hyperstoichiometric oxide (UO2+x) which can be further oxidised to U4O9, U3O7, U3O8 and UO3.2H2O.

Because used fuel contains alpha emitters (plutonium and the minor actinides), the effect of adding an alpha emitter (238Pu) to uranium dioxide on the leaching rate of the oxide has been investigated. For the crushed oxide, adding 238Pu tended to increase the rate of leaching, but the difference in the leaching rate between 0.1 and 10% 238Pu was very small.

The concentration of carbonate in the water which is in contact with the used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion, because uranium(VI) forms soluble anionic carbonate complexes such as [UO2(CO3)2]2− and [UO2(CO3)3]4−. When carbonate ions are absent, and the water is not strongly acidic, the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of uranium dioxide often form insoluble hydrated uranium trioxide phases.

Thin films of uranium dioxide can be deposited upon gold surfaces by ‘sputtering’ using uranium metal and an argon/oxygen gas mixture. These gold surfaces modified with uranium dioxide have been used for both cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance experiments, and these offer an insight into the likely leaching behaviour of uranium dioxide.

====Fuel cladding interactions====
The study of the nuclear fuel cycle includes the study of the behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions. For example, there has been much work on how uranium dioxide based fuel interacts with the zirconium alloy tubing used to cover it. During use, the fuel swells due to thermal expansion and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy, forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium (from the cladding). Then, on the fuel side of this mixed layer, there is a layer of fuel which has a higher caesium to uranium ratio than most of the fuel. This is because xenon isotopes are formed as fission products that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding. After diffusing into these voids, it decays to caesium isotopes. Because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use, the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area. Below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal, uranium nitride and uranium dioxide as a function of distance from the centre of a 20 mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 °C. The uranium dioxide (because of its poor thermal conductivity) will overheat at the centre of the pellet, while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points.

====Normal and abnormal conditions====

The nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas; one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (&quot;more rarely&quot;) an accident is occurring.

The releases of radioactivity from normal operations are the small planned releases from uranium ore processing, enrichment, power reactors, reprocessing plants and waste stores. These can be in different chemical/physical form from releases which could occur under accident conditions. In addition the isotope signature of a hypothetical accident may be very different from that of a planned normal operational discharge of radioactivity to the environment.

Just because a radioisotope is released it does not mean it will enter a human and then cause harm. For instance, the migration of radioactivity can be altered by the binding of the radioisotope to the surfaces of soil particles. For example, caesium (Cs) binds tightly to clay minerals such as illite and montmorillonite, hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass). Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of 137Cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain. But 137Cs is not able to migrate quickly through most soils and thus is unlikely to contaminate well water. Colloids of soil minerals can migrate through soil so simple binding of a metal to the surfaces of soil particles does not completely fix the metal.

According to Jiří Hála&#x27;s text book, the distribution coefficient Kd is the ratio of the soil&#x27;s radioactivity (Bq g−1) to that of the soil water (Bq ml−1). If the radioisotope is tightly bound to the minerals in the soil, then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and grass growing on the soil.

* Cs-137 Kd = 1000
* Pu-239 Kd = 10000 to 100000
* Sr-90 Kd = 80 to 150
* I-131 Kd = 0.007 to 50

In dairy farming, one of the best countermeasures against 137Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the 137Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long-term gamma dose to humans due to 137Cs, as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.

Even after the radioactive element arrives at the roots of the plant, the metal may be rejected by the biochemistry of the plant. The details of the uptake of 90Sr and 137Cs into sunflowers grown under hydroponic conditions has been reported. The caesium was found in the leaf veins, in the stem and in the apical leaves. It was found that 12% of the caesium entered the plant, and 20% of the strontium. This paper also reports details of the effect of potassium, ammonium and calcium ions on the uptake of the radioisotopes.

In livestock farming, an important countermeasure against 137Cs is to feed animals a small amount of Prussian blue. This iron potassium cyanide compound acts as an ion-exchanger. The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of Prussian blue per day. The Prussian blue reduces the biological half-life (different from the nuclear half-life) of the caesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of 137Cs is about 30 years. This is a constant which can not be changed but the biological half-life is not a constant. It will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed. Caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the Prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the droppings is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled. The form of Prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade. Attempts to use the pigment grade used in paints have not been successful. Note that a source of data on the subject of caesium in Chernobyl fallout exists at (&quot;Ukrainian Research Institute for Agricultural Radiology&quot;).

====Release of radioactivity from fuel during normal use and accidents====

The IAEA assume that under normal operation the coolant of a water-cooled reactor will contain some radioactivity but during a reactor accident the coolant radioactivity level may rise. The IAEA states that under a series of different conditions different amounts of the core inventory can be released from the fuel, the four conditions the IAEA consider are &quot;normal operation&quot;, a spike in coolant activity due to a sudden shutdown/loss of pressure (core remains covered with water), a cladding failure resulting in the release of the activity in the fuel/cladding gap (this could be due to the fuel being uncovered by the loss of water for 15–30 minutes where the cladding reached a temperature of 650–1250 °C) or a melting of the core (the fuel will have to be uncovered for at least 30 minutes, and the cladding would reach a temperature in excess of 1650 °C).

Based upon the assumption that a Pressurized water reactor contains 300 tons of water, and that the activity of the fuel of a 1 GWe reactor is as the IAEA predicts, then the coolant activity after an accident such as the Three Mile Island accident (where a core is uncovered and then recovered with water) can be predicted.

=====Releases from reprocessing under normal conditions=====

It is normal to allow used fuel to stand after the irradiation to allow the short-lived and radiotoxic iodine isotopes to decay away. In one experiment in the US, fresh fuel which had not been allowed to decay was reprocessed (the Green run ) to investigate the effects of a large iodine release from the reprocessing of short cooled fuel. It is normal in reprocessing plants to scrub the off gases from the dissolver to prevent the emission of iodine. In addition to the emission of iodine the noble gases and tritium are released from the fuel when it is dissolved. It has been proposed that by voloxidation (heating the fuel in a furnace under oxidizing conditions) the majority of the tritium can be recovered from the fuel.

A paper was written on the radioactivity in oysters found in the Irish Sea. These were found by gamma spectroscopy to contain 141Ce, 144Ce, 103Ru, 106Ru, 137Cs, 95Zr and 95Nb. Additionally, a zinc activation product (65Zn) was found, which is thought to be due to the corrosion of magnox fuel cladding in spent fuel pools. It is likely that the modern releases of all these isotopes from the Windscale event is smaller.

===On-load reactors===
Some reactor designs, such as RBMKs or CANDU reactors, can be refueled without being shut down. This is achieved through the use of many small pressure tubes to contain the fuel and coolant, as opposed to one large pressure vessel as in pressurized water reactor (PWR) or boiling water reactor (BWR) designs. Each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine, typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in CANDU reactors. On-load refueling allows for the optimal fuel reloading problem to be dealt with continuously, leading to more efficient use of fuel. This increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of pressure tubes and the fueling machines to service them.

===Interim storage===
After its operating cycle, the reactor is shut down for refueling. The fuel discharged at that time (spent fuel) is stored either at the reactor site (commonly in a spent fuel pool) or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites. If on-site pool storage capacity is exceeded, it may be desirable to store the now cooled aged fuel in modular dry storage facilities known as Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) at the reactor site or at a facility away from the site. The spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid, which provides both cooling (the spent fuel continues to generate decay heat as a result of residual radioactive decay) and shielding to protect the environment from residual ionizing radiation, although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to dry cask storage.

===Transportation===
===Reprocessing===

Spent fuel discharged from reactors contains appreciable quantities of fissile (U-235 and Pu-239), fertile (U-238), and other radioactive materials, including reaction poisons, which is why the fuel had to be removed. These fissile and fertile materials can be chemically separated and recovered from the spent fuel. The recovered uranium and plutonium can, if economic and institutional conditions permit, be recycled for use as nuclear fuel. This is currently not done for civilian spent nuclear fuel in the United States, however it is done in Russia and France . Russia aims to maximise recycling of fissile materials from used fuel. Hence reprocessing used fuel is a basic practice, with reprocessed uranium being recycled and plutonium used in MOX, at present only for fast reactors.

Mixed oxide, or MOX fuel, is a blend of reprocessed uranium and plutonium and depleted uranium which behaves similarly, although not identically, to the enriched uranium feed for which most nuclear reactors were designed. MOX fuel is an alternative to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate nuclear power generation.

Currently, plants in Europe are reprocessing spent fuel from utilities in Europe and Japan. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel is currently not permitted in the United States due to the perceived danger of nuclear proliferation. The Bush Administration&#x27;s Global Nuclear Energy Partnership proposed that the U.S. form an international partnership to see spent nuclear fuel reprocessed in a way that renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for nuclear weapons.

===Partitioning and transmutation===
As an alternative to the disposal of the PUREX raffinate in glass or Synroc matrix, the most radiotoxic elements could be removed through advanced reprocessing. After separation, the minor actinides and some long-lived fission products could be converted to short-lived or stable isotopes by either neutron or photon irradiation. This is called transmutation. Strong and long-term international cooperation, and many decades of research and huge investments remain necessary before to reach a mature industrial scale where the safety and the economical feasibility of partitioning and transmutation (P&amp;T) could be demonstrated.

===Waste disposal===
A current concern in the nuclear power field is the safe disposal and isolation of either spent fuel from reactors or, if the reprocessing option is used, wastes from reprocessing plants. These materials must be isolated from the biosphere until the radioactivity contained in them has diminished to a safe level. In the U.S., under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended, the Department of Energy has responsibility for the development of the waste disposal system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Current plans call for the ultimate disposal of the wastes in solid form in a licensed deep, stable geologic structure called a deep geological repository. The Department of Energy chose Yucca Mountain as the location for the repository. Its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Since 1999 thousands of nuclear waste shipments have been stored at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.

Fast-neutron reactors can fission all actinides, while the thorium fuel cycle produces low levels of transuranics. Unlike LWRs, in principle these fuel cycles could recycle their plutonium and minor actinides and leave only fission products and activation products as waste. The highly radioactive medium-lived fission products Cs-137 and Sr-90 diminish by a factor of 10 each century; while the long-lived fission products have relatively low radioactivity, often compared favorably to that of the original uranium ore.

Horizontal drillhole disposal describes proposals to drill over one kilometer vertically, and two kilometers horizontally in the Earth&#x27;s crust, for the purpose of disposing of high-level waste forms such as spent nuclear fuel, Caesium-137, or Strontium-90. After the emplacement and the retrievability period, drillholes would be backfilled and sealed. A series of tests of the technology were carried out in November 2018 and then again publicly in January 2019 by a U.S. based private company. The test demonstrated the emplacement of a test-canister in a horizontal drillhole and retrieval of the same canister. There was no actual high-level waste used in this test.

==Fuel cycles==
Although the most common terminology is &quot;fuel cycle,&quot; some argue that the term &quot;fuel chain&quot; is more accurate, because the spent fuel is never fully recycled. Spent fuel includes fission products, which generally must be treated as waste, as well as uranium, plutonium, and other transuranic elements. Where plutonium is recycled, it is normally reused once in light water reactors, although fast reactors could lead to more complete recycling of plutonium.

===Once-through nuclear fuel cycle===

Not a cycle &quot;per se&quot;, fuel is used once and then sent to storage without further processing save additional packaging to provide for better isolation from the biosphere. This method is favored by six countries: the United States, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Spain and South Africa. Some countries, notably Finland, Sweden and Canada, have designed repositories to permit future recovery of the material should the need arise, while others plan for permanent sequestration in a geological repository like the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in the United States.

===Plutonium cycle===


Several countries, including Japan, Switzerland, and previously Spain and Germany, are using or have used the reprocessing services offered by Areva NC and previously THORP. Fission products, minor actinides, activation products, and reprocessed uranium are separated from the reactor-grade plutonium, which can then be fabricated into MOX fuel. Because the proportion of the non-fissile even-mass isotopes of plutonium rises with each pass through the cycle, there are currently no plans to reuse plutonium from used MOX fuel for a third pass in a thermal reactor. If fast reactors become available, they may be able to burn these, or almost any other actinide isotopes.

The use of a medium-scale reprocessing facility onsite, and the use of pyroprocessing rather than the present day aqueous reprocessing, is claimed to potentially be able to considerably reduce the nuclear proliferation potential or possible diversion of fissile material as the processing facility is in-situ. Similarly as plutonium is not separated on its own in the pyroprocessing cycle, rather all actinides are &quot;electro-won&quot; or &quot;refined&quot; from the spent fuel, the plutonium is never separated on its own, instead it comes over into the new fuel mixed with gamma and alpha emitting actinides, species that &quot;self-protect&quot; it in numerous possible thief scenarios.

Beginning in 2016 Russia has been testing and is now deploying Remix Fuel in which the spent nuclear fuel is put through a process like Pyroprocessing that separates the reactor Grade Plutonium and remaining Uranium from the fission products and fuel cladding. This mixed metal is then combined with a small quantity of medium enriched Uranium with approximately 17% U-235 concentration to make a new combined metal oxide fuel with 1% Reactor Grade plutonium and a U-235 concentration of 4%. These fuel rods are suitable for use in standard PWR reactors as the Plutonium content is no higher than that which exists at the end of cycle in the spent nuclear fuel. As of February 2020 Russia was deploying this fuel in some of their fleet of VVER reactors.

===Minor actinides recycling===
It has been proposed that in addition to the use of plutonium, the minor actinides could be used in a critical power reactor. Tests are already being conducted in which americium is being used as a fuel.

A number of reactor designs, like the Integral Fast Reactor, have been designed for this rather different fuel cycle. In principle, it should be possible to derive energy from the fission of any actinide nucleus. With a careful reactor design, all the actinides in the fuel can be consumed, leaving only lighter elements with short half-lives. Whereas this has been done in prototype plants, no such reactor has ever been operated on a large scale.

It so happens that the neutron cross-section of many actinides decreases with increasing neutron energy, but the ratio of fission to simple activation (neutron capture) changes in favour of fission as the neutron energy increases. Thus with a sufficiently high neutron energy, it should be possible to destroy even curium without the generation of the transcurium metals. This could be very desirable as it would make it significantly easier to reprocess and handle the actinide fuel.

One promising alternative from this perspective is an accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor / subcritical reactor. Here a beam of either protons (United States and European designs) or electrons (Japanese design) is directed into a target. In the case of protons, very fast neutrons will spall off the target, while in the case of the electrons, very high energy photons will be generated. These high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides.

Such reactors compare very well to other neutron sources in terms of neutron energy:

* Thermal 0 to 100 eV
* Epithermal 100 eV to 100 keV
* Fast (from nuclear fission) 100 keV to 3 MeV
* DD fusion 2.5 MeV
* DT fusion 14 MeV
* Accelerator driven core 200 MeV (lead driven by 1.6 GeV protons)
* Muon-catalyzed fusion 7 GeV.

As an alternative, the curium-244, with a half-life of 18 years, could be left to decay into plutonium-240 before being used in fuel in a fast reactor.

====Fuel or targets for this actinide transmutation====
To date the nature of the fuel (targets) for actinide transformation has not been chosen.

If actinides are transmuted in a Subcritical reactor, it is likely that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel. Due to current particle accelerators not being optimized for long continuous operation at least the first generation of accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor, and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down.

On the other hand, if actinides are destroyed using a fast reactor, such as an Integral Fast Reactor, then the fuel will most likely not be exposed to many more thermal cycles than in a normal power station.

Depending on the matrix the process can generate more transuranics from the matrix. This could either be viewed as good (generate more fuel) or can be viewed as bad (generation of more &quot;radiotoxic&quot; transuranic elements). A series of different matrices exists which can control this production of heavy actinides.

Fissile nuclei (such as 233U, 235U, and 239Pu) respond well to delayed neutrons and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable; this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor. As a consequence, it is important that the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system, it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that does not produce additional long-lived isotopes. Having a low fraction of delayed neutrons is not only not a problem in a subcritical reactor, it may even be slightly advantageous as criticality can be brought closer to unity, while still staying subcritical.

=====Actinides in an inert matrix=====
The actinides will be mixed with a metal which will not form more actinides; for instance, an alloy of actinides in a solid such as zirconia could be used.

The raison d’être of the Initiative for Inert Matrix Fuel (IMF) is to contribute to Research and Development studies on inert matrix fuels that could be used to utilise, reduce and dispose both weapon- and light water reactor-grade plutonium excesses. In addition to plutonium, the amounts of minor actinides are also increasing. These actinides have to be consequently disposed in a safe, ecological and economical way. The promising strategy that consists of utilising plutonium and minor actinides using a once-through fuel approach within existing commercial nuclear power reactors e.g. US, European, Russian or Japanese Light Water Reactors (LWR), Canadian Pressured Heavy Water Reactors, or in future transmutation units, has been emphasised since the beginning of the initiative. The approach, which makes use of inert matrix fuel is now studied by several groups in the world. This option has the advantage of reducing the plutonium amounts and potentially minor actinide contents prior to geological disposal. The second option is based on using a uranium-free fuel leachable for reprocessing and by following a multi-recycling strategy. In both cases, the advanced fuel material produces energy while consuming plutonium or the minor actinides. This material must, however, be robust. The selected material must be the result of a careful system study including inert matrix – burnable absorbent – fissile material as minimum components and with the addition of stabiliser. This yields a single-phase solid solution or more simply if this option is not selected a composite inert matrix–fissile component. In screening studies pre-selected elements were identified as suitable. In the 90s an IMF once through strategy was adopted considering the following properties:
*neutron properties i.e. low absorption cross-section, optimal constant reactivity, suitable Doppler coefficient,
*phase stability, chemical inertness, and compatibility,
*acceptable thermo-physical properties i.e. heat capacity, thermal conductivity,
*good behaviour under irradiation i.e. phase stability, minimum swelling,
*retention of fission products or residual actinides, and
*optimal properties after irradiation with insolubility for once through then out.
This once-through then out strategy may be adapted as a last cycle after multi-recycling if the fission yield is not large enough, in which case the following property is required good leaching properties for reprocessing and multi-recycling.

=====Actinides in a thorium matrix=====
Upon neutron bombardment, thorium can be converted to uranium-233. 233U is fissile, and has a larger fission cross section than both 235U and 238U, and thus it is far less likely to produce higher actinides through neutron capture.

=====Actinides in a uranium matrix=====
If the actinides are incorporated into a uranium-metal or uranium-oxide matrix, then the neutron capture of 238U is likely to generate new plutonium-239. An advantage of mixing the actinides with uranium and plutonium is that the large fission cross sections of 235U and 239Pu for the less energetic delayed neutrons could make the reaction stable enough to be carried out in a critical fast reactor, which is likely to be both cheaper and simpler than an accelerator driven system.

=====Mixed matrix=====
It is also possible to create a matrix made from a mix of the above-mentioned materials. This is most commonly done in fast reactors where one may wish to keep the breeding ratio of new fuel high enough to keep powering the reactor, but still low enough that the generated actinides can be safely destroyed without transporting them to another site. One way to do this is to use fuel where actinides and uranium is mixed with inert zirconium, producing fuel elements with the desired properties.

===Uranium cycle in renewable mode===
To fulfill the conditions required for a nuclear renewable energy concept, one has to explore a combination of processes going from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle to the fuel production and the energy conversion using specific fluid fuels and reactors, as reported by Degueldre et al. (2019). Extraction of uranium from a diluted fluid ore such as seawater has been studied in various countries worldwide. This extraction should be carried out parsimoniously, as suggested by Degueldre (2017). An extraction rate of kilotons of U per year over centuries would not modify significantly the equilibrium concentration of uranium in the oceans (3.3 ppb). This equilibrium results from the input of 10 kilotons of U per year by river waters and its scavenging on the sea floor from the 1.37 exatons of water in the oceans. For a renewable uranium extraction, the use of a specific biomass material is suggested to adsorb uranium and subsequently other transition metals. The uranium loading on the biomass would be around 100 mg per kg. After contact time, the loaded material would be dried and burned ( neutral) with heat conversion into electricity. The uranium ‘burning’ in a molten salt fast reactor helps to optimize the energy conversion by burning all actinide isotopes with an excellent yield for producing a maximum amount of thermal energy from fission and converting it into electricity. This optimisation can be reached by reducing the moderation and the fission product concentration in the liquid fuel/coolant. These effects can be achieved by using a maximum amount of actinides and a minimum amount of alkaline/earth alkaline elements yielding a harder neutron spectrum. Under these optimal conditions the consumption of natural uranium would be 7 tons per year and per gigawatt (GW) of produced electricity. The coupling of uranium extraction from the sea and its optimal utilisation in a molten salt fast reactor should allow nuclear energy to gain the label renewable. In addition, the amount of seawater used by a nuclear power plant to cool the last coolant fluid and the turbine would be ~2.1 giga tons per year for a fast molten salt reactor, corresponding to 7 tons of natural uranium extractable per year. This practice justifies the label renewable.

===Thorium cycle===

In the thorium fuel cycle thorium-232 absorbs a neutron in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 beta decays to protactinium-233 and then to uranium-233, which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like uranium-238, thorium-232 is a fertile material.
:&lt;chem&gt;\overset{neutron}{n} + ^{232}_{90}Th -&gt; ^{233}_{90}Th -&gt;[\beta^-] ^{233}_{91}Pa -&gt;[\beta^-] \overset{fuel}{^{233}_{92}U}&lt;/chem&gt;
After starting the reactor with existing U-233 or some other fissile material such as U-235 or Pu-239, a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient than that with U-238 and plutonium can be created. The Th-232 absorbs a neutron to become Th-233 which quickly decays to protactinium-233. Protactinium-233 in turn decays with a half-life of 27 days to U-233. In some molten salt reactor designs, the Pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons (which could transform it to Pa-234 and then to U-234), until it has decayed to U-233. This is done in order to improve the breeding ratio which is low compared to fast reactors.

Thorium is at least 4-5 times more abundant in nature than all of uranium isotopes combined; thorium is fairly evenly spread around Earth with a lot of countries having huge supplies of it; preparation of thorium fuel does not require difficult and expensive enrichment processes; the thorium fuel cycle creates mainly Uranium-233 contaminated with Uranium-232 which makes it harder to use in a normal, pre-assembled nuclear weapon which is stable over long periods of time (unfortunately drawbacks are much lower for immediate use weapons or where final assembly occurs just prior to usage time); elimination of at least the transuranic portion of the nuclear waste problem is possible in MSR and other breeder reactor designs.

One of the earliest efforts to use a thorium fuel cycle took place at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s. An experimental reactor was built based on molten salt reactor technology to study the feasibility of such an approach, using thorium fluoride salt kept hot enough to be liquid, thus eliminating the need for fabricating fuel elements. This effort culminated in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment that used 232Th as the fertile material and 233U as the fissile fuel. Due to a lack of funding, the MSR program was discontinued in 1976.

Thorium was first used commercially in the Indian Point Unit 1 reactor which began operation in 1962. The cost of recovering U-233 from the spent fuel was deemed uneconomical, since less than 1% of the thorium was converted to U-233. The plant&#x27;s owner switched to uranium fuel, which was used until the reactor was permanently shut down in 1974.

===Current industrial activity===
Currently the only isotopes used as nuclear fuel are uranium-235 (U-235), uranium-238 (U-238) and plutonium-239, although the proposed thorium fuel cycle has advantages. Some modern reactors, with minor modifications, can use thorium. Thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the Earth&#x27;s crust than uranium (and 550 times more abundant than uranium-235). There has been little exploration for thorium resources, and thus the proven reserves are comparatively small. Thorium is more plentiful than uranium in some countries, notably India. The main thorium-bearing mineral, monazite is currently mostly of interest due to its content of rare earth elements and most of the thorium is simply dumped on spoils tips similar to uranium mine tailings. As mining for rare earth elements occurs mainly in China and as it is not associated in the public consciousness with the nuclear fuel cycle, Thorium-containing mine tailings - despite their radioactivity - are not commonly seen as a nuclear waste issue and are not treated as such by regulators.

Virtually all ever deployed heavy water reactors and some graphite-moderated reactors can use natural uranium, but the vast majority of the world&#x27;s reactors require enriched uranium, in which the ratio of U-235 to U-238 is increased. In civilian reactors, the enrichment is increased to 3-5% U-235 and 95% U-238, but in naval reactors there is as much as 93% U-235. The fissile content in spent fuel from most light water reactors is high enough to allow its use as fuel for reactors capable of using natural uranium based fuel. However, this would require at least mechanical and/or thermal reprocessing (forming the spent fuel into a new fuel assembly) and is thus not currently widely done.

The term &quot;nuclear fuel&quot; is not normally used in respect to fusion power, which fuses isotopes of hydrogen into helium to release energy.

<text>Flint glass is optical glass that has relatively high refractive index and low Abbe number (high dispersion). Flint glasses are arbitrarily defined as having an Abbe number of 50 to 55 or less. The currently known flint glasses have refractive indices ranging between 1.45 and 2.00.

Traditionally, flint glasses were lead glasses containing around 4–60% lead(II) oxide; however, the manufacture and disposal of these glasses were sources of pollution.

In many modern flint glasses, lead oxides are replaced with other metal oxides such as titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide without significantly altering the optical properties of the glass.

==Applications==

A concave lens of flint glass is commonly combined with a convex lens of crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet lens because of their compensating optical properties, which reduces chromatic aberration (colour defects).

==History==
With respect to glass, the term &quot;flint&quot; derives from the flint nodules found in the chalk deposits of southeast England that were used as a source of high purity silica by George Ravenscroft, , to produce a potash lead glass that was the precursor to English lead crystal.

<text>Miss America is an annual competition that is open to women from the United States between the ages of 18 and 28. Originating in 1921 as a &quot;bathing beauty revue&quot;, the contest is judged on competition segments with scoring percentages: &quot;Private Interview&quot; (30%) – a 10-minute press conference-style interview with a panel of judges, &quot;On Stage Question&quot; (10%) – answering a judge&#x27;s question onstage, &quot;Talent or HER Story&quot; (20%) – a performance talent or 90 second speech, &quot;Health and Fitness&quot; (20%) – demonstrated physical fitness onstage dressed in athletic wear, and &quot;Evening Gown&quot; (20%) – modeling evening-wear onstage.

The previous year&#x27;s titleholder crowns the winner. Miss America 2025 is Abbie Stockard of Alabama, who was crowned on January 5, 2025. She will crown her successor at Miss America 2026.

== Overview ==
On February 1, 1919, a beauty pageant was held at the Chu Chin Chow Ball at the Hotel des Artistes in New York City. The winner, Edith Hyde Robbins Macartney, was called &quot;Miss America.&quot; Neither the title nor this pageant was related to the current &quot;Miss America Pageant&quot; which would develop a year later in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Rather, the origins of the &quot;Miss America Pageant&quot; lie in an event entitled &quot;The Fall Frolic&quot; held on September 25, 1920, in Atlantic City. This event was designed to bring business to the Boardwalk: &quot;three hundred and fifty gaily decorated rolling wicker chairs were pushed along the parade route. Three hundred and fifty men pushed the chairs. However, the main attractions were the young &#x27;maidens&#x27; who sat in the rolling chairs, headed by a Miss Ernestine Cremona, who was dressed in a flowing white robe and represented &#x27;Peace.&#x27;&quot;

The event was so successful that &quot;The Businessmen&#x27;s League&quot; planned to repeat it the following year as a beauty pageant or a &quot;bather&#x27;s revue&quot; (to capitalize on the popularity of newspaper-based beauty contests that used photo submissions). The event was scheduled to take place the weekend following Labor Day, to encourage summer visitors to stay in Atlantic City. Thus, &quot;newspapers from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C., were asked to sponsor local beauty contests. The winners would participate in the Atlantic City contest. If the local newspaper would pay for the winner&#x27;s wardrobe, the Atlantic City Businessmen&#x27;s League would pay for the contestant&#x27;s travel to compete in the Inter-City Beauty Contest.&quot; Herb Test, a &quot;newspaperman&quot;, coined the term for the winner: &quot;Miss America.&quot; On September 8, 1921, 100,000 people gathered at the Boardwalk to watch the contestants from Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Ocean City, Camden, Newark, New York City, and Philadelphia. Out of the nine contestants, the two frontrunners were Virginia Lee and Margaret Gorman. A conflict ensued when the judges disqualified 22-year-old Lee at the last minute because she was deemed a professional rather than an amateur like the other contestants because she was 1) a working actress, 2) married, and 3) a friend of the competition&#x27;s chief judge. The 16-year-old winner from Washington, D.C., Margaret Gorman, was crowned the &quot;Golden Mermaid&quot; and won $100.

The pageant continued consistently over the next eight decades except for the years 1928–1932, when it was temporarily shut down due to financial problems associated with the Great Depression and suggestions that it promoted &quot;loose morals.&quot; With its revival in 1933, 15-year-old Marian Bergeron won, prompting future contestants to be between the ages of 18 and 26. In 1935, Lenora Slaughter was hired to &quot;re-invent&quot; the pageant and served for 32 years as its director. By 1938, a talent section was added to the competition, and contestants were required to have a chaperone. In 1940, the title officially became &quot;The Miss America Pageant&quot; and the pageant was held in Atlantic City&#x27;s Convention Hall. In 1944, compensation for &quot;Miss America&quot; switched from &quot;furs and movie contracts&quot; to college scholarships, an idea generally credited to Jean Bartel, Miss America 1943.

During the early years of the pageant, under the directorship of Lenora Slaughter, it became racially segregated via rule number seven that stated: &quot;contestants must be of good health and of the white race.&quot; Rule seven was abolished in 1950. Miss New York 1945, Bess Myerson, the only Jewish American winner to date, became Miss America 1945 and faced antisemitism during her time as Miss America, leading to a cutback in her official duties. Although there were Native American, Latina, and Asian-American contestants, there were no African-American contestants for fifty years (African-Americans appeared in musical numbers as far back as 1923, however, when they were cast as slaves).

In 1970, Cheryl Browne, Miss Iowa 1970, competed as the first African-American contestant in the Miss America 1971 pageant. She also participated in one of the last USO-Miss America tours in Vietnam. A decade later in 1983, Miss New York (and Miss Syracuse) 1983, Vanessa Williams (the first African-American woman to win the competition as Miss America 1984), resigned under pressure due to a scandal involving nude photographs. Three decades after these events, Miss New York (and Miss Syracuse) 2013, Nina Davuluri, the first Indian-American woman to win the crown as Miss America 2014, faced xenophobic and racist comments on social media when she won. Two years later, at the Miss America 2016 pageant, then Miss America CEO Sam Haskell apologized to Vanessa Williams (who was serving as head judge) for what was said to her during the events of 1984.

In 2018, the pageant adopted a new format, referred to as &quot;Miss America 2.0&quot;, as part of an effort under new chairwoman Gretchen Carlson to &quot;[evolve Miss America] in this cultural revolution.&quot; Under the new format, competitors were no longer judged on their physical appearance (resulting in the highly publicized announcement that the event would no longer include a swimsuit competition). In 2023, many of the &quot;Miss America 2.0&quot; changes (including the ban on judging personal appearance) were reversed under the advent of new leadership.

== History ==
=== 1921–1967 ===
Margaret Gorman, Miss District of Columbia, was declared &quot;The Most Beautiful Bathing Girl in America&quot; in 1921 at the age of 16 and was recognized as the first &quot;Miss America&quot; when she returned to compete the next year. The contest that year was won by Mary Katherine Campbell (Miss Ohio), who won again in 1923. She returned to compete a third time in 1924 but placed as first runner-up that year, and pageant rules were then amended to prevent anyone from winning more than once.
Alta Sterling, competing as Miss Sioux City, was the first to represent the state of Iowa at the 1924 Miss America pageant. Sterling had the distinction of being the first Jewish contestant to compete for Miss America – one of some very notable &quot;firsts&quot; by Miss Iowa contestants.

Beginning in 1940, Bob Russell served as the first official host of the pageant. In 1941, Mifaunwy Shunatona, Miss Oklahoma, became the first Native American contestant.

In 1945, Bess Myerson became the first Jewish-American and the first Miss New York (competing as Miss New York City, a competition organized by a local radio station) to win the Miss America pageant as Miss America 1945. As the only Jewish contestant, Myerson was encouraged by the pageant directors to change her name to &quot;Bess Meredith&quot; or &quot;Beth Merrick&quot;, but she refused. After winning the title (and as a Jewish Miss America), Myerson received few endorsements and later recalled that &quot;I couldn&#x27;t even stay in certain hotels […] there would be signs that read no coloreds, no Jews, no dogs. I felt so rejected. Here I was chosen to represent American womanhood and then America treated me like this.&quot; She thus cut short her Miss America tour and instead traveled with the Anti-Defamation League. In this capacity, she spoke against discrimination in a talk entitled, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Beautiful and Hate.&quot;

In 1948, Irma Nydia Vasquez, the first Miss Puerto Rico, became the first Latina contestant. In addition, in 1948, Yun Tau Chee, the first Miss Hawaii, was also the first Asian-American contestant. Miss America 1949, Jacque Mercer, was married and divorced during her reign; after this, a rule was enacted requiring Miss America contestants to sign a certification that they have never been married or pregnant.
Starting in 1950, although the pageant continued to be in September, the organization that hosted the pageant changed the Miss America title to &quot;post-dated&quot;; thus, that year&#x27;s pageant winner, Yolande Betbeze, became Miss America 1951, and there was no Miss America 1950. The pageant was first televised nationally in 1954, hosted by Bob Russell. Future television star Lee Meriwether was crowned Miss America 1955. It would also be the last time Russell served as host. He recommended, and was replaced by, Bert Parks, who served as the host for the second televised pageant in 1955 and stayed as host until 1979. Television viewership peaked during the early 1960s, when it was the highest-rated program on American television.

=== 1968–2016 ===

With the rise of second-wave feminism and the civil rights movement during the 1960s, the Miss America pageant became the subject of a series of protests that attacked it as sexist, racist, and part of U.S. militarism. The first such demonstration took place during the Miss America 1969 pageant held on September 7, 1968 (won by Miss Illinois 1968, Judith Ford), when about 200 members of the group New York Radical Women demonstrated as part of the Miss America protest. Bev Grant&#x27;s photographs of this event have become iconic. In addition, a pamphlet distributed at the protest by Robin Morgan, &quot;No More Miss America!&quot;, became a source for feminist scholarship. The protest was co-sponsored by Florynce Kennedy&#x27;s Media Workshop, an activist group she founded in 1966 to protest the media&#x27;s representation of African-Americans, along with the feminist Jeannette Rankin Brigade and the ACLU. Morgan later stated that the Miss America pageant &quot;was chosen as a target for a number of reasons: it has always been a lily-white, racist contest; the winner tours Vietnam, entertaining the troops as a &#x27;Murder Mascot&#x27;; the whole gimmick is one commercial shillgame to sell the sponsor&#x27;s products. Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values—racism, militarism, sexism—all packaged in one ‘ideal symbol,’ a woman.&quot; The protesters compared the pageant to a county fair where livestock are judged. They thus crowned a sheep as Miss America and symbolically destroyed a number of feminine products, including false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, girdles, corsets, and bras. Burning the contents of a trash can was suggested, but a permit was unobtainable; news media seized on the similarity between draft resisters burning draft cards and women burning their bras. In fact, there was no bra burning, nor did anyone remove her bra. The Women&#x27;s Liberation Front later demonstrated at the Miss America 1971 pageant.

Miss Iowa 1970, Cheryl Browne, became the first African-American contestant in the competition&#x27;s history during the Miss America 1971 pageant (September 12, 1970). She drew attention from reporters and from security personnel in Atlantic City who maintained a visible presence during pageant rehearsals. Browne was not a finalist, however, losing to future media personality, Miss Texas 1970, Phyllis George. In August 1971, Browne traveled to Vietnam with George; Miss Nevada 1970, Vicky Jo Todd; Miss New Jersey 1970, Hela Yungst; Miss Arizona 1970, Karen Shields; Miss Arkansas 1970, Donna Connelly; and Miss Texas 1970 (George&#x27;s replacement), Belinda Myrick. They participated in a 22-day United Service Organizations tour for American troops that began in Saigon. Browne later commented that she thought &quot;it was one of the last Miss America groups to go to Vietnam.&quot; Miss Arkansas 1980, Lencola Sullivan, finished the Miss America 1981 pageant (September 6, 1980) as fourth runner-up, making her the first African American contestant to place in the top five.

A few years later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won the title of Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown. Williams later commented that she was one of five minority contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham &quot;had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [1983].&quot; She also pointed out that &quot;Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial. But when the press started, when I would go out on the – on the tour and do my appearances, and people would come up and say they never thought they&#x27;d see the day that it would happen; when people would want to shake my hand, and you&#x27;d see tears in their eyes, and they&#x27;d say, I never thought I&#x27;d see it in my lifetime – that&#x27;s when, you know, it was definitely a very special honor.&quot; Williams&#x27; reign as Miss America was not without its challenges and controversies, however. For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and hate mail. Williams was forced to resign seven weeks prior to the end of her time as Miss America, however, after the unauthorized publication of nude photos in &quot;Penthouse.&quot; First runner-up, Miss New Jersey 1983, Suzette Charles replaced her for the final weeks of Williams&#x27; reign. Thirty-two years after she resigned however, Vanessa Williams returned to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although &quot;none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today&#x27;s organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.&quot; Suzette Charles (Williams&#x27; replacement) said in an interview with &quot;Inside Edition&quot; that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings.

In 1985, Miss Utah 1984, Sharlene Wells Hawkes, became the first foreign-born, bilingual Miss America, as she was born in Asunción, Paraguay. Miss Alabama 1994, Heather Whitestone, won the 1995 pageant becoming the first deaf Miss America (she lost most of her hearing at the age of 18 months). At the Miss America 1999 pageant held on September 19, 1998, Nicole Johnson (Miss Virginia 1998) became the first Miss America with diabetes and the first contestant to publicize an insulin pump. Around the same time, Miss America officials announced they had lifted the ban on contestants who were divorced or had had an abortion. This rule change, however, was rescinded and Miss America CEO Robert L. Beck, who had suggested it, was fired. Angela Perez Baraquio, Miss Hawaii 2000, was crowned Miss America 2001, thereby becoming the first Asian-American, the first Filipino-American, as well as the first teacher ever to win the pageant.

A few years later, the Miss America 2005 pageant held on September 18, 2004, would be the last one televised live on ABC (which dropped the pageant after this broadcast, as it &quot;drew a record-low 9.8 million viewers&quot;) and the last one held in Atlantic City for ten years. Miss Alabama 2004, Deidre Downs, reigned as Miss America four months longer than usual as the Miss America 2006 pageant was moved to a January broadcast at the Las Vegas Strip&#x27;s Theatre for the Performing Arts (Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino). It was broadcast live on Country Music Television. After two years, the pageant moved to the TLC network. The Miss America 2011 pageant held on January 15, 2011, showcased Miss New York 2010, Claire Buffie, (the first Miss America contestant to advocate a gay-rights platform) and Miss Delaware 2010, Kayla Martell, (the first bald contestant). ABC also resumed broadcasting the pageant with the 2011 competition. The Miss America 2013 pageant, held on January 12, 2013, was the last one to take place in Las Vegas. Miss New York 2012, Mallory Hagan, won the competition but only served for eight months as the pageant moved back to its former broadcast slot in September 2013 Miss Montana 2012, Alexis Wineman, (&quot;America&#x27;s Choice&quot; winner) was the pageant&#x27;s first autistic contestant.

With the Miss America 2014 pageant, held on September 15, 2013, the competition returned to Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey. Miss New York (Nina Davuluri) won the title of Miss America. Davuluri was also the first Indian-American and second Asian-American to win the crown. Shortly after her win, however, Davuluri became the target of xenophobic and racist comments on social media relating the proximity of the event date to the 9/11 anniversary and to anti-Indian sentiment. News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab, associated her with groups such as Al-Qaeda, and questioned why she was chosen over Miss Kansas 2013, Theresa Vail (a soldier who won the &quot;America&#x27;s Choice&quot; award and was the first contestant to display tattoos during the swimsuit competition). Davuluri said that she was prepared for this backlash because &quot;as Miss New York, I was called a terrorist and very similar remarks&quot;, and Vail denounced the social media backlash, offering her support to Davuluri. Torn ligaments forced Miss Florida 2013, Myrrhanda Jones, to perform her baton routine with a decorated leg brace, while Nicole Kelly (Miss Iowa 2013) was the first contestant without a forearm to compete in the pageant.

Amanda Longacre, then Miss Delaware 2014, who was preparing to compete in Miss America 2015, was stripped of the title and the crown because she was deemed to be too old. Longacre filed a $3 million lawsuit, and Miss America officials later blamed the error on state pageant officials who they said &quot;missed the age discrepancy in Longacre&#x27;s submitted paperwork.&quot; Miss New York 2014 (Kira Kazantsev) eventually won the title of Miss America 2015, making New York the first state to produce a winner for three consecutive years.

In September 2014, comedian John Oliver ran a segment on his show, &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;, that investigated the Miss America Organization&#x27;s claim that it is &quot;the world&#x27;s largest provider of scholarships for women.&quot; Oliver&#x27;s team, which included four researchers with journalism backgrounds, collected and analyzed the organization&#x27;s state and federal tax forms to find that the organization&#x27;s scholarship program only distributes a small fraction of its claimed &quot;$45 million made available annually&quot;. Oliver said that at the national level, the Miss America Organization and Miss America Foundation together spent only $482,000 in cash scholarships in 2012. Oliver found that at the state level, the Miss Alabama pageant claimed that it had provided $2,592,000 in scholarships to Troy University despite not actually distributing any such scholarships. The pageant appeared to multiply the value of a single available scholarship by the number of contestants theoretically eligible for it, while using the term &quot;provided&quot; in a way that did not mean &quot;distributed.&quot; The Miss America Organization responded by stating that Oliver affirmed that it provides the most scholarships to women and that the $45 million figure was based on all scholarships made available whether or not they are accepted.

In February 2015, Sharon Pearce announced that she was stepping down from her role as President of the Miss America Organization. At that time, former CEO Sam Haskell was named Executive Chairman of the Miss America Organization, retained the title of CEO, and assumed all of Pearce&#x27;s responsibilities. In addition, Miss America 2014, Nina Davuluri, was appointed one of the new trustees to the Miss America Foundation. In September 2015, Miss America officials announced that the organization granted $5.5 million in scholarships, a number that included all offers of in-kind tuition waivers from multiple schools when a contestant could accept one at most. In 2019, a lawyer for the Miss America Foundation put the number at $1.3-1.4 million and said that 85% of the money is raised by contestants themselves, through solicitations from friends, family, and businesses.

On March 24, 2016, the Miss America Organization announced a contract renewal with ABC to continue carrying the pageant for the next three years to the 2019 edition.

In June 2016, Erin O&#x27;Flaherty was crowned Miss Missouri, becoming the first openly lesbian Miss America contestant.

===2017–2022 (Miss America 2.0 Era)===
In late December 2017, &quot;HuffPost&quot; published an article exposing derogatory emails sent and received by CEO Sam Haskell, board members Tammy Haddad and Lynn Weidner, and lead writer Lewis Friedman. The emails, sent between 2014 and 2017, featured instances of expletive name-calling and unprofessional comments. The comments were often sexual or violent in nature and targeted former Miss America winners, notably Mallory Hagan and Katherine Shindle, both of whom joined 47 other former Miss Americas (including all Miss Americas from 1988 to 2017) in signing a joint open letter calling for the firing or resignation of all involved. On December 22, the Miss America Organization (MAO) released statements to &quot;USA Today&quot;, saying that it was made aware of concerns several months prior. They stated that the organization does not &quot;condone the use of inappropriate language&quot; and reported that its investigation had determined that Haskell was under &quot;unreasonable distress resulting from intense attacks on his family from disgruntled stakeholders&quot;. The organization also reported that its relationship with Friedman had been terminated. Haskell explained that attacks on his character impaired his judgment when responding to the emails. Miss America&#x27;s board of directors also suspended Haskell, who released a statement labeling the HuffPost article &quot;unkind and untrue&quot;. Hagan and Shindle criticized the decision to suspend Haskell, rather than fire him, as inadequate. The following day, the President of Miss America, Josh Randle; executive chairwoman Lynn Weidner; and Haskell all resigned. The scandal prompted the pageant&#x27;s producer, Dick Clark Productions, to cut ties, and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) announced that it was reconsidering its contract with Miss America, with its executive director Chris Howard describing the scandal as &quot;troubling&quot;, and both Frank Gilliam, incoming mayor of Atlantic City, and State Senator Colin Bell called for CRDA to end its relationship with Miss America. On December 24, Haddad also resigned.

In January 2018, Gretchen Carlson, who won the Miss America pageant in 1989, was elected as the new chairwoman of the organization, becoming the first former Miss America to serve as its leader. Katherine Shindle, Miss America 1998, was also appointed to the board alongside fellow Miss America winners, Heather French Henry (2000) and Laura Kaeppeler (2012). This move led to a number of changes. In June 2018, there was an announcement that Miss America contestants would no longer be judged based on their physical appearance. Thus, the national Miss America event would be considered a competition, rather than a beauty pageant, and the titleholders would now be candidates, rather than contestants. The swimsuit competition was replaced with state titleholders participating in a live interactive session with the judges. The evening gown competition was dropped; the contestants chose clothing &quot;that makes them feel confident, expresses their personal style, and shows how they hope to advance the role of Miss America.&quot; In interviews, Carlson emphasized the organization&#x27;s desire to be more welcoming, &quot;open, transparent, [and] inclusive to women,&quot; and to prioritize displaying the talent and scholarship in the contestants. The new board of directors increased the maximum age of titleholders to 25 years old, from 24. Therefore, contestants could not be older than 25 years old on December 31 in the calendar year of their state competition. These new organizational changes under Carlson were referred to as the &quot;Miss America 2.0&quot; format.

In August 2018, Miss America 2018 Cara Mund gave an interview to The Press of Atlantic City in which she stated that it had &quot;been a tough year.&quot; She then wrote an open letter to former Miss Americas a few weeks later, in order to explain her comments. In the letter she states that the current leadership had &quot;silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America.&quot; She also stated that her &quot;voice is not heard nor wanted by our current leadership …nor do they have any interest in knowing who I am and how my experiences relate to positioning the organization for the future.&quot; Carlson denied Mund&#x27;s claims. However, at the time the Miss America 2019 competition began, 46 of 51 state organizations (as well as 23 former Miss America winners) had signed a petition calling for the resignation of Carlson and CEO, Regina Hopper, from the Miss America Organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATD 9/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The states who had not signed were Arkansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, and Vermont.

On September 5, 2018, Fox Rothschild LLP, a law firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a breach-of-contract suit against the MAO for failing to pay nearly $100,000 for legal services. Court fillings from October 26, 2018, ordered MAO to pay Fox Rothschild LLP $98,206.90 with interest for their unpaid legal bills. The Miss America Organization reported in December 2018 that a settlement had been made with Fox Rothschild LLP. From 2011 to 2016 (with the exception of 2014), MAO&#x27;s tax fillings reveal that the organization was operating with a negative net income.

In the fall of 2018, MAO terminated licenses from Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. The leadership of the Miss Colorado organization quit in protest. With license termination the state organization cannot &quot;claim to be affiliated with the Miss America Organization and must...turn over bank accounts with scholarship money to the national organization.&quot; On December 22, 2018; MAO awarded the license for the Miss Georgia organization to Trina Pruitt. On December 26, 2018; MAO also reinstated the license for the Miss New Jersey organization for one year, contingent on leadership changes and recruitment of new sponsors and board members.

In December 2018, state organizations from Georgia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia, along with Jennifer Vaden Barth (former titleholder and former MAO board member), filed a lawsuit requesting the actions of Carlson and Hopper be voided, citing an &quot;illegal and bad-faith takeover of the MAO, beginning in January 2018.&quot; The court date for this suit is set for January 25, 2019.

On June 5, 2019, Miss South Dakota 1997 and former South Dakota Secretary of State, Shantel Krebs, was unanimously elected to chairwoman of the Miss America Organization Board of Directors, succeeding Carlson. Krebs had been a member of the organization&#x27;s board since October 2018. Carlson will &quot;remain involved as an advisor to the Miss America Organization Board.&quot;
In Summer 2019, Miss America announced the contest would move out of Atlantic City. The December 19, 2019, event took place at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. The broadcast moved from ABC to NBC, and was live streamed for the first time. On May 8, 2020, the organization announced its next competition, originally slated for December 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The postponement will also include revised eligibility to be coordinated with state qualifying organizations to allow competitors who would usually age out to remain in consideration and ultimately there was no Miss America 2021 pageant and Miss America 2022 was held on December 17, 2021.

In November 2022, Brían Nguyen was crowned Miss Greater Derry in New Hampshire, becoming the first transgender titleholder under the Miss America organization.

=== 2023–present ===
Beginning in January 2023, major changes were made to the competition format following the &quot;advent of...new Miss America Opportunity&quot; of Robin Fleming as new Owner/CEO of the Miss America organization. Fleming is an entrepreneur, dress designer, and television producer and she formerly spent over 9 years directing state level Miss USA pageants. The new administration under Fleming has reversed some of the Miss America 2.0 changes including terminology (as of 2023, a competition participant will once again be referred to as a &#x27;contestant&#x27; rather than the Miss America 2.0 term &#x27;candidate&#x27;) and the decision to not judge contestants based on their physical appearance (which occurred with the elimination of the swimsuit competition in 2018). Instead of a swimsuit competition, contestants will now be judged on physical fitness while modeling activewear. In addition, the performance talent competition, which has been part of the Miss America competition since 1938, has added a new category; contestants may now choose to present a “personal narrative in storytelling” as their talent in a category named &quot;HER Story&quot;. The contestant age limit was also raised from 18–25 to 18–28.

On July 10, 2023, A&amp;E premiered a four-part documentary series, &quot;Secrets of Miss America&quot;, which interviewed past winners, contestants and staff members about historical issues with the Miss America organization related to body-shaming, racism and &quot;psychological warfare&quot; against contestants and winners.

In November 2024, Miss America&#x27;s operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In December 2024, Miss America Competition LLC asked to dismiss its bankruptcy.

<text>Lindley Armstrong &quot;Spike&quot; Jones (December 14, 1911 – May 1, 1965) was an American musician, bandleader and conductor specializing in spoof arrangements of popular songs and classical music. Ballads receiving the Jones treatment were punctuated with gunshots, whistles, cowbells, hiccups, burps, and outlandish and comedic vocals. Jones and his band recorded under the title Spike Jones and His City Slickers from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, and they toured the United States and Canada as &quot;The Musical Depreciation Revue&quot;.

== Early years ==

Lindley Armstrong Jones was born in Long Beach, California, the son of Ada (Armstrong) and Lindley Murray Jones, a Southern Pacific railroad agent. Young Lindley Jones was given the nickname &#x27;Spike&#x27; for being so thin that he was compared to a railroad spike. At the age of 11 he got his first set of drums. As a teenager he played in bands that he formed himself; Jones&#x27; first band was called Spike Jones and his Five Tacks. A railroad restaurant chef taught him how to use pots and pans, forks, knives and spoons as musical instruments. Jones frequently played in theater pit orchestras. In the 1930s, he joined the Victor Young orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including Al Jolson&#x27;s &quot;Lifebuoy Program&quot;, &quot;Burns and Allen&quot;, and Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;.

== Spike Jones and His City Slickers ==
Jones became bored playing the same music each night with the orchestras. He found other like-minded musicians and they began playing parodies of standard songs for their own entertainment. The musicians wanted their wives to share their enjoyment, so they recorded their weekly performances. One of the recordings made its way into the hands of an RCA Victor executive, who offered the musicians a recording contract. One of the City Slickers&#x27; early recordings for the label was a Del Porter arrangement of &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;. The record&#x27;s success inspired Jones to become the band&#x27;s leader. He initially thought the popularity the record brought them would fade. However, audiences kept asking for more, so Jones started working on more comic arrangements.

From 1937 to 1942, Jones was the percussionist for the John Scott Trotter Orchestra, which played on Bing Crosby&#x27;s first recording of &quot;White Christmas&quot;. He was part of a backing band for songwriter Cindy Walker during her early recording career with Decca Records and Standard Transcriptions. Her song &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Stomp Them City Slickers Down&quot; provided the inspiration for the name of Jones&#x27;s future band.

The City Slickers developed from the Feather Merchants, a band led by vocalist-clarinetist Del Porter, who took a back seat to Jones during the group&#x27;s embryonic years. They made experimental records for the Cinematone Corporation and performed publicly in Los Angeles, gaining a small following. Original members included vocalist-violinist Carl Grayson, banjoist Perry Botkin, trombonist King Jackson, and pianist Stan Wrightsman.

The band&#x27;s early records were issued on RCA Victor&#x27;s budget-priced Bluebird label, but were soon moved to the more-prestigious Victor label. They recorded extensively for the company until 1955. They also starred in various radio programs (1945–1949) and in their own NBC and CBS television shows from 1954 to 1961.

=== Orchestra members ===
During the 1940s, prominent band members included:

*George Rock (trumpet, and vocals from 1944 to 1960)
*Mickey Katz (clarinet, vocals)
*Doodles Weaver (vocals – specialized in playing sports commentators and absentminded singers who persistently scrambled their lyrics into malapropisms and digressed into stand-up comedy)
*Red Ingle (sax, vocals)
*Frank Rehak (trombone)
*Del Porter (clarinet, vocals)
*Carl Grayson (violin, vocals)
*Perry Botkin (banjo)
*Country Washburne (tuba)
*Luther &quot;Red&quot; Roundtree (banjo)
*Earl Bennett, a.k.a. Sir Frederick Gas (vocals)
*Joe Siracusa (drums)
*Joe Colvin (trombone)
*Roger Donley (tuba)
*Dick Gardner (baritone sax, clarinet, violin)
*Paul Leu (piano)
*Jack Golly (alto sax, clarinet)
*John Stanley (trombone)
*Don Anderson (trumpet)
*Charlotte Tinsley (harp)
*Eddie Metcalfe (saxophone)
*Dick Morgan (banjo), a.k.a. I. W. Harper
*Freddy Morgan (banjo, vocals)
*George Lescher (piano)
*A. Purvis Pullen, a.k.a. Dr. Horatio Q. Birdbath (bird calls, dog barks)
* Russ &quot;Candy&quot; Hall (bass, tuba)

The band&#x27;s 1950s personnel included:
*Helen Grayco (vocals)
*Earl Bennett, as Sir Frederick Gas
*Billy Barty (standing 3&#x27; 9&quot;, vocals and comedy routines, including impersonations of Liberace)
*Lock Martin (standing 7&#x27;, comedy routines)
*Freddy Morgan (banjo)
*Peter James (vocals; sometimes billed as Bobby Pinkus)
*Jad Paul (banjo)
*Gil Bernal (sax, vocals)
*Paul Garner (vocals)
*Bernie Jones (sax, vocals)
*Phil Gray (trombone)
*Marilyn Olsen Oliveri (vocals, harp)

The liner notes for at least two RCA compilation albums claimed that the two Morgans were brothers (the 1949 radio shows actually billed them as &quot;Dick and Freddy Morgan&quot;), but this was not true; Freddy&#x27;s real name was Morgenstern. 

Peter James (born Peter James Accardy, sometimes billed as Bobby Pinkus) and Paul &quot;Mousie&quot; Garner were former members of Ted Healy&#x27;s stage act on Broadway. James joined Healy for a two-year run in the Shubert revue &quot;A Night in Spain&quot; (1927–1928) where he worked alongside Shemp Howard and Larry Fine. Mousie joined Healy as a replacement stooge in the 1930s, after the original Three Stooges left Healy for movie work.

Spike Jones&#x27;s second wife, singer Helen Grayco, performed in his stage and television shows.

== Record hits ==
=== &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; ===
A strike by the American Federation of Musicians in 1942 prevented Jones from making commercial recordings for over two years. He could, however, make records for radio broadcasts. These were released on the Standard Transcriptions label (1941–1946) and have been reissued on a CD compilation called &quot;(Not) Your Standard Spike Jones Collection&quot;.

Recorded just days before the recording ban, Jones scored a huge broadcast hit late in 1942 with &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;, a song ridiculing Adolf Hitler, which followed every use of the word &quot;Heil&quot; with a derisive raspberry sound, as in the repeated phrase &quot; Heil, (raspberry), Heil (raspberry), right in Der Fuehrer&#x27;s face!&quot;.

=== More spoof songs ===

The romantic ballad &quot;Cocktails for Two&quot;, originally written to evoke an intimate romantic rendezvous, was re-recorded by Spike Jones in 1944 as a raucous, horn-honking, voice-gurgling, hiccuping hymn to the cocktail hour. The Jones version was a huge hit.

Other Jones spoofs followed: &quot;Hawaiian War Chant&quot;, &quot;Chloe&quot;, &quot;Holiday for Strings&quot;, &quot;You Always Hurt the One You Love&quot;, &quot;My Old Flame&quot; and &quot;Laura&quot;

=== &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; ===
Spike&#x27;s 1949 parody of Vaughn Monroe&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; was performed as if sung by a drunkard and ridiculed Monroe by name in its final stanza: 
CHORUS: ...&#x27;cause all we hear is &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; sung by Vaughn Monroe.
I.W. HARPER: I can do without his singing.
SIR FREDERICK GAS: But I wish I had his dough!
The official American release edited out the dig at Monroe, because Monroe, a popular RCA Victor recording artist and also a major RCA stockholder, demanded it. The original version was released in the European market. (A limited number of original 78-rpm pressings containing the first ending were mistakenly released on the West Coast and are a prized rarity today.) The original recording with the unedited ending was later issued on a German RCA LP collection and on some CD and audio tape releases containing the song.

=== &quot;Trailer Annie&quot; ===
In the 1940s, Spike also recorded a comedic song titled &quot;Trailer Annie&quot;, about a woman who tries to find a job in the United States military.

=== &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; ===
Jones&#x27;s recording, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot;, with a piping vocal by George Rock, was recorded in 1947, too late for that year&#x27;s shopping season; the record was withheld and was finally released in the fall of 1948, becoming a number-one hit. (Dora Bryan recorded a 1963 variation, &quot;All I Want For Christmas is a Beatle&quot;.)

=== Murdering the Classics ===
Among the recordings Spike Jones and his City Slickers made in the 1940s were many humorous takes on classical music such as the adaptation of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Liebestraum No. 3&quot;, played at a breakneck pace on unusual instruments. Others followed: Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell Overture&quot; was rendered on kitchen implements using a horse race as a backdrop, with one of the &quot;horses&quot; in the &quot;race&quot; likely to have inspired the nickname of the lone chrome yellow-painted SNJ aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels aerobatic team&#x27;s shows in the late 1940s, &quot;Beetle Bomb&quot;. In live shows Spike would acknowledge the applause with complete solemnity, saying &quot;Thank you, music lovers.&quot; An LP collection of twelve of these &quot;homicides&quot; was released by RCA (on its prestigious Red Seal label) in 1971 as &quot;Spike Jones Is Murdering the Classics.&quot; They include such &quot;tours de force&quot; as &quot;Pal-Yat-Chee&quot; (&quot;Pagliacci&quot;), sung by the hillbilly humorists Homer and Jethro, Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot;, Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Blue Danube&quot; waltz, and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;.

In 1944, RCA Victor released &quot;Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies&quot; version of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;, in three 10-inch, 78- rpm records, P-143, arrangement credited to Joe &quot;Country&quot; Washburne with lyrics by Foster Carling. The set was also issued by RCA Victor on three 7-inch vinyl 45-rpm records in 1949 as WP-143 and on one 45rpm &quot;extended play&quot; record, EPA-143 in 1952. An abridged and re-sequenced version of the recording is also included in the aforementioned RCA Red Seal &#x27;classics&#x27; album, with the complete original version available on the CD collection &quot;Spiked: The Music of Spike Jones&quot;.

== Radio ==
After appearing as the house band on &quot;The Bob Burns Show,&quot; Spike got his own radio show on NBC, &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Program&quot;, as Edgar Bergen&#x27;s summer replacement in 1945. Frances Langford was co-host and Groucho Marx was among the guests. The guest list for Jones&#x27;s 1947–49 CBS program for Coca-Cola (originally &quot;The Spotlight Revue&quot;, retitled &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot; for its final season) included Frankie Laine, Mel Torme, Peter Lorre, Don Ameche and Burl Ives. Frank Sinatra appeared on the show twice (October 1, 1948 and December 3, 1948) and Lassie in May 1949. Jones&#x27;s resident &quot;girl singer&quot; during this period was Dorothy Shay, &quot;The Park Avenue Hillbillie.&quot; One of the announcers on Jones&#x27;s CBS show was the young Mike Wallace. Writers included Eddie Maxwell, Eddie Brandt, and Jay Sommers. The final program in the series was broadcast in June 25, 1949.

== Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra ==
While Jones enjoyed the fame and prosperity, he was annoyed that nobody seemed to see beyond the craziness. Determined to show the world that he was capable of producing legitimate &quot;pretty&quot; music, he formed a second group in 1946. Spike Jones and His Other Orchestra played lush arrangements of dance hits. This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band&#x27;s expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of &quot;serious,&quot; accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.

The one outstanding recording by the Other Orchestra is &quot;Laura&quot;, which features a serious first half (played exquisitely by the Other Orchestra) and a manic second half (played for laughs by the City Slickers).

Jones&#x27;s son, Spike Jones Jr., called attention to the precision of his father&#x27;s most outlandish musical arrangements: &quot;One of the things that people don&#x27;t realize about Dad&#x27;s kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.&quot;

== Movies ==
In 1940, Jones had an uncredited bandleading part in the Dead End Kids film &quot;Give Us Wings&quot;, appearing on camera for about four seconds.

As the band&#x27;s fame grew, Hollywood producers hired the Slickers as a specialty act for feature films, including &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), &quot;Meet the People&quot; (1944), &quot;Bring on the Girls&quot; (1945), &quot;Breakfast in Hollywood&quot; (1946) and &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947). Jones was set to team with Abbott and Costello for a 1954 Universal Pictures comedy, but when Lou Costello withdrew for medical reasons, Universal replaced the comedy team with look-alikes Hugh O&#x27;Brian and Buddy Hackett, and promoted Jones to the leading role. The finished film, &quot;Fireman Save My Child&quot;, turned out to be Spike Jones&#x27;s only top-billed theatrical movie.

== Soundies ==
In 1942, the Jones gang worked on numerous soundies, musical shorts similar to later music videos which were shown on coin-operated projectors in small nightclubs, arcades, malt shops, and taverns. The band appeared on camera under their own name in four of the Soundies (&quot;Clink! Clink! Another Drink&quot;, &quot;Pass the Biscuits, Mirandy&quot;, &quot;The Sheik of Araby&quot;, and &quot;Blacksmith Song&quot;), and, according to musicologist Mark Cantor, provided background music for at least thirteen others. Mel Blanc, the voice of Bugs Bunny and other Warner Brothers cartoon characters, performed a drunken, hiccuping verse for 1942&#x27;s &quot;Clink! Clink! Another Drink&quot; (reissued in 1949 as &quot;The Clink! Clink! Polka&quot;).

== Television ==

Jones saw the potential of television and filmed two half-hour pilot films, &quot;Foreign Legion&quot; and &quot;Wild Bill Hiccup&quot;, in the summer of 1950. Veteran comedy director Eddie Cline worked on both, but neither was successful. The band fared much better on live television, where their spontaneous antics and crazy visual gags guaranteed the viewers a good time. Spike usually dressed in a suit with an enormous check pattern and was seen dashing around playing a washboard, cowbells, a suite of klaxons and foghorns, then xylophone, then shooting a pistol. The band starred in variety shows, such as &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; (1951, 1955) and their &quot;All Star Revue&quot; (1952) before being given his own slot by NBC, &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot;, which aired early in 1954, and Club Oasis on NBC, in the summer of 1958; and by CBS, as &quot;The Spike Jones Show,&quot; in the summers of 1957, 1960, and 1961. Jones and his City Slickers also appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot; in the episode which aired on November 15, 1956. In 1990, BBC2 screened six compilation shows from these broadcasts; they were subsequently aired on PBS stations.

== Later years ==
The virtual disappearance of big bands immediately following the end of World War II and the rise of rock and roll in the early 1950s had a marked effect on Spike Jones&#x27;s repertoire. Early rock songs were &quot;already&quot; novelties, and Jones could not spoof them the same way he had lampooned &quot;Cocktails for Two&quot;, &quot;Laura&quot; or &quot;Chloe&quot;. He played rock music for laughs when he presented &quot;for the first time on television, the bottom half of Elvis Presley!&quot; This was the cue for a pair of pants—inhabited by dwarf actor Billy Barty—to scamper across the stage.

Jones was always prepared to adapt to changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically looking back at the 1920s, Jones recorded a tongue-in-cheek album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953, he responded to the growing market for children&#x27;s records, with tunes aimed directly at kids (like &quot;Socko, the Smallest Snowball&quot;). Over the years, Jones had become increasingly unhappy at RCA Victor due to management censoring his recordings and other matters, and he left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by Verve, Liberty and Warner Bros. In 1956, Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of Lawrence Welk and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun. The last record credited to the City Slickers was the LP &quot;Dinner Music for People Who Aren&#x27;t Very Hungry&quot;. By the late 1950s spoken-word comedy (Bob Newhart, Mort Sahl, Stan Freberg, Shelley Berman) was the current trend in comedy records. Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup &quot;Spike Jones in Stereo&quot; (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in &quot;Omnibust&quot; (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones&#x27;s New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including &quot;Washington Square&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot;). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of &quot;Dominique&quot;, a recent hit by The Singing Nun, in which the arrangement not only plays part of the melody on a banjo but melds the melody successfully with &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;

== Personal life ==
Jones had four children: Linda (by his first wife, Patricia), Spike Jr., Leslie Ann, and Gina, with Helen Grayco. Spike Jr. is a producer of live events and television broadcasts. Leslie Ann is the Director of Music and Film Scoring at George Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Ranch in Marin County.

Jones was a lifelong heavy smoker, reportedly 4-5 packs a day, and eventually he developed breathing problems, including emphysema. Never the picture of health, his emphysema advanced to the point where he used an oxygen tank both on and offstage, and he was confined to a seat behind his drum set while performing. In spite of his illness, he continued smoking until his death on May 1, 1965, at the age of 53. He is interred in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California.

His second wife, Helen Grayco, died as a result of cancer in Los Angeles on August 20, 2022, at the age of 97.

== Influence and legacy ==
There is a clear line of influence from Harry Reser&#x27;s 1920s hot-comic &quot;Six Jumping Jacks&quot; band (whose drummer and vocalist was the distinctive Tom Stacks, &quot;The Voice With a Smile&quot;), the Hoosier Hot Shots, Freddie Fisher and his Schnickelfritzers, and the Marx Brothers to Spike Jones — and to Stan Freberg, Gerard Hoffnung, Peter Schickele&#x27;s P.D.Q. Bach, The Goons, Joe Raposo, Mr. Bungle, Frank Zappa, George Maciunas, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. According to David Wild&#x27;s review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Elvis Costello&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Spike&quot; was named partly in tribute to Jones.

Syndicated radio personality Dr. Demento regularly features Jones&#x27; records on his program of comedy and novelty tracks. Jones is mentioned in The Band&#x27;s song, &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;. (The song&#x27;s protagonist&#x27;s paramour states of Jones: &quot;I can&#x27;t take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.&quot;) Novelist Thomas Pynchon is an admirer and wrote the liner notes for a 1994 CD reissue, &quot;Spiked!&quot; (BMG Catalyst). A scene in the romantic comedy &quot;I.Q.&quot; shows a man demonstrating the sound of his new stereo to Meg Ryan&#x27;s character by playing a Jones recording.

In the 1948 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies animated short &quot;Back Alley Oproar&quot;, a caterwauling Sylvester the Cat does a Spike Jones-inspired solo finale cover of &quot;Angel in Disguise&quot; by opening with a brief, serious-sounding introduction before immediately breaking into a jazzy rendition featuring a collection of crazy sound effects produced by firing guns, breaking bottles and exploding firecrackers among other sounds, much to Elmer Fudd&#x27;s annoyance.

Spike Jones is referenced several times in the American TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. In season 2, episode 5, &quot;Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde&quot;, an exhausted Hawkeye sings a line of &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot; in reference to the great songs that came out of World War II; in the season 8 episode &quot;&quot;Good-Bye, Radar: Part 1&quot;, when Radar returns from leave in Tokyo to a generator-less 4077th, he calls up Sparky to unsuccessfully bargain for a new one with a variety of items, which included some Spike Jones records; and in the season 11 episode &quot;Foreign Affairs,&quot; visiting French Red Cross nurse Martine LeClerc (Melinda Mullins), who develops a warm if brief affair with Charles Emerson Winchester III, tells him that she&#x27;s a huge fan of Spike Jones, which inspires him to admit, in a rare confession, secretly loving &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons.

In 1974, Tony Levin (future bass player for King Crimson), recording under the name, The Clams, released a Spike Jones tribute of him giving the songs &quot;Close to You&quot; by The Carpenters and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; by Roberta Flack, the Jones treatment.

In 1986, the Belgian synthpop group Telex paid homage to Spike Jones in their album &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, with a song named after him. The intro of that song is a part of the intro from &quot;Camptown Races&quot;.

In 1997, singers Artie Schroeck and Linda November directed a production in Atlantic City titled &quot;The New City Slickers Present a Tribute to Spike Jones&quot;, with a band that attempted to re-create the style and humor of Jones&#x27;s music.

Both Spike Milligan and Spike Jonze were nick-named in reference to Jones.

<text>Raymond Clevie Carver Jr. (May 25, 1938 – August 2, 1988) was an American short story writer and poet. He published his first collection of stories, &quot;Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?&quot;, in 1976. His breakout collection, &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&quot; (1981), received immediate acclaim and established Carver as an important figure in the literary world. It was followed by &quot;Cathedral&quot; (1983), which Carver considered his watershed and is widely regarded as his masterpiece. The definitive collection of his stories, &quot;Where I&#x27;m Calling From&quot;, was published shortly before his death in 1988. In their 1989 nomination of Carver for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the jury concluded, &quot;The revival in recent years of the short story is attributable in great measure to Carver&#x27;s mastery of the form.&quot;

== Early life ==
Carver was born in Clatskanie, Oregon, a mill town on the Columbia River, and grew up in Yakima, Washington, the son of Ella Beatrice Carter (née Casey) and Clevie Raymond Carver. His father, a sawmill worker from Arkansas, was a fisherman and a heavy drinker. Carver&#x27;s mother worked on and off as a waitress and a retail clerk. His brother, James Franklin Carver, was born in 1943.

Carver was educated at local schools in Yakima. In his spare time, he read mostly novels by Mickey Spillane or publications such as &quot;Sports Afield&quot; and &quot;Outdoor Life&quot;, and hunted and fished with friends and family.

After graduating from Yakima High School in 1956, Carver worked with his father at a sawmill in California. In June 1957, at age 19, he married 16-year-old Maryann Burk, who had just graduated from a private Episcopal school for girls. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December 1957. Their second child, a boy named Vance Lindsay, was born a year later. Carver worked as a delivery man, janitor, library assistant, and sawmill laborer, while Maryann worked as an administrative assistant, high school English teacher, salesperson, and waitress.

== Writing career ==
Carver moved to Paradise, California, with his family in 1958 to be close to his mother-in-law. He became interested in writing while attending Chico State College and enrolled in a creative writing course taught by the novelist John Gardner, then a recent doctoral graduate of the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, who became a mentor and had a major influence on Carver&#x27;s life and career. In 1961, Carver&#x27;s first published story, &quot;The Furious Seasons&quot;, appeared. More florid than his later work, the story strongly bore the influence of William Faulkner. &quot;Furious Seasons&quot; was later used as a title for a collection of stories published by Capra Press, and is part of the collection, &quot;No Heroics, Please&quot; and &quot;Call If You Need Me&quot;.

Carver continued his studies under the short story writer Richard Cortez Day (alumnus of the Iowa program) beginning in autumn 1960 at Humboldt State College in Arcata. He chose not to take the foreign language courses required by the English program and received a B.A. in general studies in 1963. During this period he was first published and served as editor for &quot;Toyon,&quot; the college&#x27;s literary magazine, in which he published several of his own pieces under his own name as well as the pseudonym John Vale.

With his B-minus average, exacerbated by his penchant to forsake coursework for literary endeavors, ballasted by a sterling recommendation from Day, Carver was accepted into the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop on a $1,000 fellowship for the 1963–1964 academic year. Homesick for California and unable to fully adjust to the program&#x27;s upper middle class milieu, he only completed 12 credits out of the 30 required for a M.A. degree or 60 for the M.F.A. degree. Although program director Paul Engle awarded him a fellowship for a second year of study after Maryann Carver personally interceded and compared her husband&#x27;s plight to Tennessee Williams&#x27; deleterious experience in the program three decades earlier, Carver decided to leave the University of Iowa at the end of the semester. According to biographer Carol Sklenicka, Carver falsely claimed to have received an M.F.A. from Iowa in 1966 on later curricula vitae. Maryann, who postponed completing her education to support her husband&#x27;s educational and literary endeavors, eventually graduated from San Jose State College in 1970 and taught English at Los Altos High School until 1977. After completing graduate work at Stanford, she briefly enrolled in the University of California, Santa Barbara&#x27;s English doctoral program when Carver taught at the institution as a visiting lecturer in 1974.

In the mid-1960s, Carver and his family resided in Sacramento, where he briefly worked at a bookstore before taking a position as a night custodian at Mercy Hospital. He did all of the janitorial work in the first hour and then wrote through the rest of his shift. He audited classes at what was then Sacramento State College, including workshops with poet Dennis Schmitz. Carver and Schmitz soon became friends, and Carver wrote and published his first book of poems, &quot;Near Klamath&quot;, under Schmitz&#x27;s guidance.

1967 was a landmark year for Carver with the appearance of &quot;Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?&quot; in Martha Foley&#x27;s annual &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; anthology and the impending publication of &quot;Near Klamath&quot; by the English Club of Sacramento State College. He briefly enrolled in the library science graduate program at the University of Iowa that summer but returned to California following the death of his father. Shortly thereafter, the Carvers relocated to Palo Alto, California, so he could take his first white-collar job, at Science Research Associates, a subsidiary of IBM in nearby Menlo Park, California, where he worked intermittently as a textbook editor and public relations director through 1970.

Following a 1968 sojourn to Israel, the Carvers relocated to San Jose, California; as Maryann finished her undergraduate degree, he continued his graduate studies in library science at San Jose State through the end of 1969 before failing once again to take a degree. During this period, he established vital literary connections with Gordon Lish, who worked across the street from Carver as director of linguistic research at Behavioral Research Laboratories, and the poet/publisher George Hitchcock.

After the publication of &quot;Neighbors&quot; in the June 1971 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; at the instigation of Lish (by now ensconced as the magazine&#x27;s fiction editor), Carver began to teach at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the behest of provost James B. Hall, an Iowa alumnus and early mentor to Ken Kesey at the University of Oregon, commuting from his new home in Sunnyvale, California.

Having endured a succession of failed applications to the Stegner Fellowship, Carver was admitted to the prestigious non-degree Stanford University graduate creative writing program for the 1972–1973 term, where he cultivated friendships with Kesey-era luminaries Ed McClanahan and Gurney Norman in addition to contemporaneous fellows Chuck Kinder, Max Crawford, and William Kittredge. The $4,000 stipend enabled the Carvers to buy a house in Cupertino, California. He also took on another teaching job at the University of California, Berkeley that year and briefly rented a pied-à-terre in the city; this development was precipitated by his initiation of an extramarital affair with Diane Cecily, a University of Montana administrator and mutual friend of Kittredge who would subsequently marry Kinder.

During his years of working at miscellaneous jobs, rearing children, and trying to write, Carver started abusing alcohol. By his own admission, he gave up writing and took to full-time drinking. In the fall semester of 1973, Carver was a visiting lecturer in the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop with John Cheever, but Carver stated that they did less teaching than drinking and almost no writing. With the assistance of Kinder and Kittredge, he attempted to simultaneously commute to Berkeley and maintain his lectureship at Santa Cruz; after missing all but a handful of classes due to the inherent logistical hurdles of this arrangement and various alcohol-related illnesses, Hall gently enjoined Carver to resign his position. The next year, after leaving Iowa City, Carver went to a treatment center to attempt to overcome his alcoholism, but continued drinking for another three years.

His first short story collection, &quot;Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?&quot;, was published in 1976. The collection itself was shortlisted for the National Book Award, though it sold fewer than 5,000 copies that year.

== Personal life and death ==
=== Decline of first marriage ===
The following excerpt from Scott Driscoll&#x27;s review of Maryann Burk Carver&#x27;s 2006 memoir describes the decline of her and Raymond&#x27;s marriage.

After being hospitalized three times between June 1976 and February or March 1977, Carver began his &quot;second life&quot; and stopped drinking on June 2, 1977, with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. While he continued to regularly smoke cannabis and later experimented with cocaine at the behest of Jay McInerney during a 1980 visit to New York City, Carver believed he would have died of alcoholism at the age of 40 had he not overcome his drinking.

=== Second marriage ===
In November 1977, Carver met the poet Tess Gallagher at a writers&#x27; conference in Dallas, Texas. Gallagher later remembered feeling &quot;as if my life until then had simply been a rehearsal for meeting him.&quot; Beginning in January 1979, Carver and Gallagher lived together in El Paso, Texas, in a borrowed cabin near Port Angeles, Washington, and in Tucson, Arizona.

In 1980, the two moved to Syracuse, New York, where Gallagher had been appointed the coordinator of the creative writing program at Syracuse University; Carver taught as a professor in the English department. He and Gallagher jointly purchased a house in Syracuse, at 832 Maryland Avenue. In ensuing years, the house became so popular that the couple had to hang a sign outside that read &quot;Writers At Work&quot; in order to be left alone. 
In 1982, he and his first wife, Maryann, were divorced.

On June 17, 1988, six weeks prior to his death, Carver and Gallagher married in Reno, Nevada.

=== Death ===
On August 2, 1988, Carver died in Port Angeles from lung cancer at the age of 50. In the same year, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Port Angeles, Washington. The inscription on his tombstone reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
LATE FRAGMENT
And did you get what
you wanted from this life, even so?
I did.
And what did you want?
To call myself beloved, to feel myself
beloved on the earth.
&lt;/poem&gt;

His poem &quot;Gravy&quot; is also inscribed.

As Carver&#x27;s will directed, Tess Gallagher assumed the management of his literary estate.

==Awards and memorials==

Carver was nominated for the National Book Award for his first major-press collection, &quot;Will You Please Be Quiet, Please&quot; in 1977 and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his third major-press collection, &quot;Cathedral&quot; (1983), the volume generally perceived as his best. Included in the latter collection are the award-winning stories &quot;A Small, Good Thing&quot;, and &quot;Where I&#x27;m Calling From&quot;. John Updike selected the latter for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Short Stories of the Century.&quot; For his part, Carver perceived &quot;Cathedral&quot; as a watershed in his career for its shift toward a more optimistic and confidently poetic style amid the diminution of Lish&#x27;s literary influence.
Carver won five O. Henry Awards with &quot;Are These Actual Miles&quot; (originally titled &quot;What Is It?&quot;) (1972), &quot;Put Yourself in My Shoes&quot; (1974), &quot;Are You A Doctor?&quot; (1975), &quot;A Small, Good Thing&quot; (1983), and &quot;Errand&quot; (1988).

In Carver&#x27;s birth town of Clatskanie, Oregon, a memorial park and statue are at the corner of Lillich and Nehalem streets, across from the library. A block away is the building where Carver was born.

==Legacy and posthumous publications==
In December 2006, Gallagher published an essay in &quot;The Sun magazine&quot;, titled &quot;Instead of Dying&quot;, about alcoholism and Carver&#x27;s having maintained his sobriety. The essay is an adaptation of a talk she initially delivered at the Welsh Academy&#x27;s Academi Intoxication Conference in 2006. The first lines read: &quot;Instead of dying from alcohol, Raymond Carver chose to live. I would meet him five months after this choice, so I never knew the Ray who drank, except by report and through the characters and actions of his stories and poems.&quot;

Chuck Kinder&#x27;s &quot;Honeymooners: A Cautionary Tale&quot; (2001) is a roman à clef about his friendship with Carver in the 1970s. Carver&#x27;s high school sweetheart and first wife, Maryann Burk Carver, wrote a memoir of her years with Carver, &quot;What it Used to be Like: A Portrait of My Marriage to Raymond Carver&quot; (2006).

In 2009, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; named Carol Sklenicka&#x27;s unauthorized biography, &quot;Raymond Carver: A Writer&#x27;s Life&quot; (2009), published by Scribner, one of the Best Ten Books of that year; and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; deemed it: &quot;exhaustively researched and definitive biography&quot;. Carver&#x27;s widow, Tess Gallagher, refused to engage with Sklenicka.

His final (incomplete) collection of seven stories, titled &quot;Elephant and Other Stories&quot; in Britain (included in &quot;Where I&#x27;m Calling From: New and Selected Stories&quot;) was composed in the five years before his death. The nature of these stories, especially &quot;Errand&quot;, have led to some speculation that Carver was preparing to write a novel. Only one piece of this work has survived – the fragment &quot;The Augustine Notebooks&quot;, first printed in &quot;No Heroics, Please&quot;.

Tess Gallagher fought with Knopf for permission to republish the stories in &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&quot; as they were originally written by Carver, as opposed to the heavily edited and altered versions that appeared in 1981 under the editorship of Gordon Lish. On October 1, 2009, the book, entitled &quot;Beginners&quot;, was released in hardback in Great Britain, followed by its publication in the Library of America edition which collected all of Carver&#x27;s short fiction in a single volume.

The Raymond Carver Reading Series at Syracuse University is a reading series program which annually brings 12 to 14 prominent writers to the campus. It is presented by the &quot;Creative Writing Program&quot; in SU&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences.

==Literary characteristics==
Carver&#x27;s career emphasized short stories and poetry. He described himself as &quot;inclined toward brevity and intensity&quot; and &quot;hooked on writing short stories&quot; (in the foreword of &quot;Where I&#x27;m Calling From: New and Selected Stories&quot;, a collection published in 1988 and a recipient of an honorable mention in the 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article citing the best works of fiction of the previous 25 years). Another stated reason for his brevity was &quot;that the story [or poem] can be written and read in one sitting.&quot; This was not simply a preference but, particularly at the beginning of his career, a practical consideration as he juggled writing with work. His subject matter was often focused on blue-collar experience, and was clearly reflective of his own life.

Characteristics of minimalism are generally seen as one of the hallmarks of Carver&#x27;s work, although, as reviewer David Wiegand notes:

Carver never thought of himself as a minimalist or in any category, for that matter.

&quot;He rejected categories generally,&quot; Sklenicka says. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he had an abstract mind at all. He just wasn&#x27;t built that way, which is why he&#x27;s so good at picking the right details that will stand for many things.&quot;

Carver&#x27;s editor at &quot;Esquire&quot;, Gordon Lish, was instrumental in shaping his prose in this direction – where his earlier tutor John Gardner had advised Carver to use fifteen words instead of twenty-five, Lish instructed Carver to use five in place of fifteen. Objecting to the &quot;surgical amputation and transplantation&quot; of Lish&#x27;s heavy editing, Carver eventually broke with him. During this time, Carver also submitted poetry to James Dickey, then poetry editor of &quot;Esquire&quot;.

Carver&#x27;s style has also been described as dirty realism, which connected him with a group of writers in the 1970s and 1980s that included Richard Ford and Tobias Wolff with both of whom Carver was closely acquainted, as well as others such as Ann Beattie, Frederick Barthelme, and Jayne Anne Phillips. With the exception of Beattie, who wrote about upper-middle-class people, these were writers who focused on sadness and loss in the everyday lives of ordinary people—often lower-middle class or isolated and marginalized people.

In his essay &quot;On Influence&quot;, Carver states that, while he was an admirer of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s fiction, he never saw him as an influence, citing instead the work of Lawrence Durrell.

<text>Jonathan Jakob Jørgen Otto Motzfeldt (25 September 1938 – 28 October 2010) was a Greenlandic priest and politician. He is considered one of the leading figures in the establishment of Greenland Home Rule. Jonathan Motzfeldt was the first prime minister of Greenland. He was Greenland&#x27;s prime minister from 1979 until 1991 and again from 1997 until 2002. He was Greenland&#x27;s longest serving prime minister and won the most elections of any prime minister of Greenland. He is considered a centre-left politician and Greenland became a recognized country during his tenure.

==Personal life==
Jonathan &quot;Junnuk&quot; Motzfeldt was born in 1938 in the settlement of Qassimiut in southern Greenland as son to the hunter Søren Motzfeldt (1902-1984) and his wife Kirsten Klemmensen (1904-1979).

After his teacher&#x27;s exam at &quot;Ilinniarfissuaq&quot; (Greenland College) in Nuuk in 1960, he studied theology at the University of Copenhagen until 1966, subsequently working as a pastor in Qaqortoq, Greenland until 1979.

In 1992, Jonathan Motzfeldt married Kristjana Guðrún Guðmundsdóttir (born 1951) from Iceland. They had no children. However, from a previous partnership with Margit Kock Petersen, he had two children: Karen Motzfeldt (born 1966) and Claus Motzfeldt (born 1969). Greenlandic handball player Hans Peter Motzfeldt-Kyed is Motzfeldt&#x27;s nephew.

==Political career==
Already in the mid-1950s, Jonathan Motzfeldt started his battle for Greenland&#x27;s autonomy with a group of young Inuit activists. In the early 1970s Motzfeldt became involved in the social democratic independence movement Siumut. After having placed himself at the forefront of the political emancipation process that Greenland&#x27;s population began in earnest in the early 1970s, Motzfeldt became synonymous with the Greenland Home Rule. He secured almost absolute power through a series of political purges, where old comrades like Lars Emil Johansen, Moses Olsen, Lars Chemnitz and Emil Abelsen were sidelined.
In 1977 he was elected Chairman of Siumut party for the first time. In addition, he served as Speaker of the Greenland Landsting from 1979 to 1988, in 1997 and from 2002 to 2008. 

On 1 May 1979, Jonathan Motzfeldt became the first Prime Minister of Greenland. He led the government for almost twelve years until 18 March 1991, when he was forced to resign and leave politics because of a drinking problem. However, he was awarded a number of key positions in the publicly owned portion of Greenland&#x27;s economy. The post of Prime Minister thereafter went to Lars Emil Johansen. Due in part, but not exclusively, to the latter&#x27;s own alcoholism, Motzfeldt took the post of Prime Minister again in 1997. He held this post until 2002, when he was forced to call new elections because of serious criticism from the parliament (the Landsting) of management of the Home Rule&#x27;s economy. Unilingual party fellow Hans Enoksen was elected Prime Minister of Greenland on December 14, 2002. Josef &quot;Tuusi&quot; Motzfeldt, the leader of IA, became deputy prime minister in the new government.

Jonathan Motzfeldt was then again elected chairman of the Greenlandic parliament. His last political year were marked by renewed alcohol abuse and uncontrolled expenses on travel and representation.

Mr. Motzfeldt resigned as speaker of Greenland&#x27;s Parliament on 18 January 2008 amid allegations that he had groped a female civil servant who reported him to the police. Motzfeldt denied wrongdoing. The case was subsequently dropped, without charges. Fellow party member Ruth Heilmann became his successor as speaker of the parliament.

In the spring 2009 Motzfeldt was hit by a major scandal involving the abuse of public funds for private purposes. The newspaper AG documented that up to 2008 he had let the government pay for private dinners. Also, it was the public purse that paid when the former Prime Minister consumed large amounts of alcohol. The scandal culminated when he briefly before parliamentary elections in June 2009 was denied boarding a helicopter in Qaqortoq due to intoxication. He was not re-elected in the parliamentary elections on 2 June 2009. 

==Death==
Motzfeldt died on 28 October 2010, aged 72, from a cerebral hemorrhage. At the time of his death Motzfeldt was the president of the West Nordic Council.

<doc id="194039" wikidata="Q1292174" url="?curid=194039" title="Edward F. Cline">
<text>Edward Francis Cline (November 4, 1891 – May 22, 1961) was an American screenwriter, actor, writer and director best known for his work with comedians W.C. Fields and Buster Keaton. He was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin and died in Hollywood, California.

==Career==

Cline began working for Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone Studios in 1914 and supported Charlie Chaplin in some of the shorts he made at the studio. At one time he claimed credit for having come up with the idea for the Sennett Bathing Beauties. When Buster Keaton began making his own shorts, after having worked with Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle for years, he hired Cline as his co-director. In Keaton&#x27;s short films Cline and Keaton himself were the only two regular gag men. For Keaton&#x27;s 1921 short &quot;Hard Luck&quot;, Cline is credited with originating Keaton&#x27;s personal favorite gag from his films. At the end of the film, Keaton dives into a swimming pool which has been emptied of water. Years later, he emerges from the hole which his fall created, accompanied by a Chinese wife and two small Chinese-American children. Besides working on most of Keaton&#x27;s early shorts, Cline co-directed Keaton&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Three Ages&quot; (1923).

Although he worked mostly in comedy, Cline directed some melodramas and the musical &quot;Leathernecking&quot; (1930), Irene Dunne&#x27;s film debut.

Cline began his association with W.C. Fields in the 1932 Paramount film &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;. The film had several veterans of Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone films, including Andy Clyde, Ben Turpin, and Hank Mann. Producer Herman J. Mankiewicz recalled of Cline, &quot;He was very much of the old, old comedy school. He didn&#x27;t know what was happening in &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;. At all. But he enjoyed doing it, because he had Andy Clyde. And Ben Turpin. And Bill Fields.&quot;

During troubles with the shooting of Fields&#x27;s 1939 film &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot;, largely resulting from Fields&#x27;s clashes with director George Marshall, Fields managed to put Cline in the director&#x27;s chair. Co-star Constance Moore remembered &quot;Before Mr. Fields did the famous Ping-Pong scene he wanted Mr. Cline. He said &#x27;I&#x27;ve worked with Cline. He knows my work.&#x27; He first put out his feelers. Then he started asking for Cline. Then he demanded him...&quot; Cline&#x27;s work on the film lasted 10 days during which he shot the party scene containing the ping pong game.

As director of &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; (1940), Cline&#x27;s desire that the actors follow the script caused some difficulties with Fields until Cline finally submitted to Fields&#x27;s tendency to ad-lib. Cline objected to the ad-libbing because it caused the crew to laugh, and Cline&#x27;s own laughter necessitated a quick cut at the end of one of Fields&#x27;s barroom scenes.

Cline directed Fields&#x27;s last two starring films, &quot;The Bank Dick&quot; (1940) and &quot;Never Give a Sucker an Even Break&quot; (1941). Recalling their work together, Cline said that Fields chose him to direct his films because he was the only person in Hollywood who knew &quot;less about making movies&quot; than Fields himself.
Assistant director Edward Montagne remembered, &quot;Fields and Cline were basically the same type. They both had great comedy sense... With actors, if he thought they were on the right track, he&#x27;d let them go.&quot;

Universal Pictures, which had hired Cline to direct Fields, released Fields in 1941 but retained Cline, signing him to a new contract. Cline directed many of the studio&#x27;s musical comedies, starring Gloria Jean, The Ritz Brothers, and Olsen and Johnson. He was dismissed, along with other directors, producers, and actors, when new owners took over the studio in 1945. Cline moved over to Monogram Pictures, directing and/or writing the studio&#x27;s &quot;Jiggs and Maggie&quot; comedies. The last one, in 1950, was co-directed by veteran William Beaudine.

== Television ==

Cline became a pioneer in television when his old crony, Buster Keaton, became one of the first movie comedians to succeed in the new medium. Keaton and Cline collaborated on two of Keaton&#x27;s series.

Comic bandleader Spike Jones was famous for using wild visual gags in his band&#x27;s performances, and his television show required even more material. Jones found an ideal resource in Eddie Cline, whose knack for comedy (and long memory for old sight gags) made him a valuable assistant. Cline remained in Jones&#x27;s employ well into the 1950s.

==Personal life==
In 1913, Cline became engaged to Minnie Elizabeth Matheis, aged 18, who previously had been engaged three times in three months. They married on March 6, 1916. In 1918, they had a daughter, named Elizabeth Normand; Minnie contracted an infection in childbirth and died four days later.

In 1919, Cline married Beatrice Altman. They had no children. She died in 1949.

Cline died of cirrhosis in 1961.

==In popular culture==
One of the two detective characters in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot;, is named after him. Just like how the title of the episode itself is named after Clyde Bruckman.

==Partial filmography==
Cline is credited as director unless noted. He directed nearly 60 Mack Sennett comedies between 1914 and 1933.

<doc id="194041" wikidata="Q140435" url="?curid=194041" title="Conidae">
<text>Conidae, with the current common name of &quot;cone snails&quot;, is a taxonomic family (previously subfamily) of predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Conoidea.

The 2014 classification of the superfamily Conoidea groups only cone snails in the family Conidae. Some previous classifications grouped the cone snails in a subfamily, Coninae.

As of March 2015 Conidae contained over 800 recognized species, varying widely in size from lengths of 1.3 cm to 21.6 cm. Working in 18th-century Europe, Carl Linnaeus knew of only 30 species that are still considered valid.

The snails within this family are sophisticated predatory animals. They hunt and immobilize prey using a modified radular tooth along with a venom gland containing neurotoxins; the tooth is launched out of the snail&#x27;s mouth in a harpoon-like action.

Because all cone snails are venomous and capable of stinging humans, live ones should be handled with great care or preferably not at all.

==Current taxonomy==
In the &quot;Journal of Molluscan Studies&quot;, in 2014, Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera &amp; Bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus &quot;Conus&quot;. Using 329 species, the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results suggested that the authors should place all living cone snails in a single family, Conidae, containing the following genera:
* &quot;Californiconus&quot; 
* &quot;Conasprella&quot; 
* † &quot;Conilithes&quot; 
* † &quot;Contraconus&quot; 
* &quot;Conus&quot; 
* † &quot;Eoconus&quot; 
* † &quot;Hemiconus&quot; 
* † &quot;Herndliconus&quot; 
* &quot;Kenyonia&quot; 
* &quot;Lilliconus&quot; 
* &quot;Malagasyconus&quot; 
* † &quot;Papilliconus&quot; 
* &quot;Profundiconus&quot; 
* &quot;Pseudolilliconus&quot; 
* &quot;Pygmaeconus&quot; 
* † &quot;Tequestaconus&quot; †

The authors grouped 85% of all known cone snail species under &quot;Conus&quot;. They recognized 57 subgenera within &quot;Conus&quot;, and 11 subgenera within the genus &quot;Conasprella&quot;.

==History of the taxonomy==
===Overview===
Prior to 1993, the family Conidae contained only &quot;Conus&quot; species. In 1993 significant taxonomic changes were proposed by Taylor, et al.,: the family Conidae was redefined as several subfamilies. The subfamilies included many subfamilies that had previously been classified in the family Turridae, and the &quot;Conus&quot; species were moved to the subfamily Coninae.

In further taxonomic changes that took place in 2009 and 2011, based upon molecular phylogeny (see below), the subfamilies that were previously in the family Turridae were elevated to the status of families in their own right. This left the family Conidae once again containing only those species that were traditionally placed in that family: the cone snail species.

===1993, Taylor et al., Bouchet &amp; Rocroi===
According to Taylor, et al. (1993), and the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005, this family consisted of seven subfamilies.
* Coninae Fleming, 1822 — synonyms: Conulinae Rafinesque, 1815 (inv.); Textiliinae da Motta, 1995 (n.a.)
* Clathurellinae H. Adams &amp; A. Adams, 1858 — synonyms: Defranciinae Gray, 1853 (inv.); Borsoniinae A. Bellardi, 1875; Pseudotominae A. Bellardi, 1888; Diptychomitrinae L. Bellardi, 1888; Mitrolumnidae Sacco, 1904; Mitromorphinae Casey, 1904; Lorinae Thiele, 1925
* Conorbiinae de Gregorio, 1880—synonym: Cryptoconinae Cossmann, 1896
* Mangeliinae P. Fischer, 1883—synonym: Cytharinae Thiele, 1929
* Oenopotinae Bogdanov, 1987—synonym: Lorinae Thiele, 1925 sensu Thiele
* Raphitominae A. Bellardi, 1875—synonyms: Daphnellinae Casey, 1904; Taraninae Casey, 1904; Thatcheriidae Powell, 1942; Pleurotomellinae F. Nordsieck, 1968; Andoniinae Vera-Pelaez, 2002
* † Siphopsinae Le Renard, 1995

===2009, Tucker &amp; Tenorio===
In 2009 John K. Tucker and Manuel J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the cone shells and their allies (which resorb their inner walls during growth) was based upon a cladistical analysis of anatomical characters including the radular tooth, the morphology (i.e., shell characters), as well as an analysis of prior molecular phylogeny studies, all of which were used to construct phylogenetic trees. In their phylogeny, Tucker and Tenorio noted the close relationship of the cone species within the various clades, corresponding to their proposed families and genera; this also corresponded to the results of prior molecular studies by Puillandre &quot;et al.&quot; and others. This 2009 proposed classification system also outlined the taxonomy for the other clades of Conoidean gastropods (that do &quot;not&quot; resorb their inner walls), also based upon morphological, anatomical, and molecular studies, and removes the turrid snails (which are a distinct large and diverse group) from the cone snails, and creates a number of new families. Tucker and Tenorio’s proposed classification system for the cone shells and their allies (and the other clades of Conoidean gastropods ) is shown in Tucker &amp; Tenorio cone snail taxonomy 2009.

===2011, Bouchet et al.===
In 2011 Bouchet et al. proposed a new classification in which several subfamilies were raised to the rank of family:
* Clathurellinae was split into three families: Borsoniidae (also including species from Turridae), Mitromorphidae and Clathurellidae (all previously lumped under the Turridae).
* Conorbiinae was raised to the rank of family Conorbidae, consisting of three genera: &quot;Artemidiconus&quot; da Motta, 1991, &quot;Benthofascis&quot; Iredale, 1936, and &quot;Conorbis&quot; Swainson, 1840.
* Mangeliinae and Oenopotinae were combined and raised to the rank of family Mangeliidae, which had previously been lumped in the Turridae).
* Raphitominae was raised to the rank of family Raphitomidae (also previously lumped in the Turridae).

The classification by Bouchet et al. (2011) was based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA testing, and built on the prior work by J.K. Tucker &amp; M.J. Tenorio (2009), but did not include fossil taxa.

Molecular phylogeny, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to the mDNA testing (testing in the Conidae initially began by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn), is continuing on the Conidae.

===1993 to 2011 list of genera===
Following Taylor et al., from 1993 to 2011, the family Conidae was defined as including not only the cone snails, but also a large number of other genera which are commonly known as &quot;turrids&quot;. However, as a result of molecular phylogeny studies in 2011, many of those genera were moved back to the Turridae, or were placed in new &quot;turrid&quot; families within the superfamily Conoidea. The following list of genera that used to be included in Conidae is retained as a historical reference:

==Distribution and habitat==
Species in the family Conidae are found in the tropical and subtropical seas of the world, in four biogeographic regions, including: the Indo-Pacific (with 60% of all species), the Tropical Eastern Pacific, the Western Tropical Atlantic, and the Eastern Tropical Atlantic, plus 10 species in the warm temperate Agulhas bioregion on the southern coast of South Africa. Fewer than one percent of fossil species have been found in more than one of the above regions.

==Paleontology==
The oldest known fossil of Conidae is from the lower Eocene, about 55 million years ago. Analysis of nucleotide sequences indicate that all living species of Conidae belong to one of two clades that diverged about 33 million years ago. One clade includes most of the species in the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic regions, which were connected by the Central American Seaway until the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama less than three million years ago. The other clade includes most of the species in the eastern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, which were connected by the Neo-Tethys Sea until 21 to 24 million years ago.

==Cone snail reproduction==
Most cone snails appear to reproduce sexually, with separate sexes and internal fertilization. varying numbers of eggs in egg capsules laid in substrate by cone snails. hatchlings are of two types, the veligers (larvae that swim freely) and veliconcha (baby snail).

==Cone snail venom characteristics and biotech==

There are approximately 30 records of humans killed by cone snails. Human victims suffer little pain, because the venom contains an analgesic component. Some species reportedly can kill a human in under five minutes, thus the name &quot;cigarette snail&quot; as supposedly one only has time to smoke a cigarette before dying. Cone snails can sting through a wetsuit with their harpoon-like radular tooth, which resembles a transparent needle.

Normally, cone snails (and many species in the superfamily Conoidea) use their venom to immobilize prey before engulfing it. The venom consists of a mixture of peptides, called conopeptides. The venom is typically made up of 10 to 30 amino acids, but in some species as many as 60. The venom of each cone snail species may contain as many as 200 pharmacologically active components. It is estimated that more than 50,000 conopeptides can be found, because every species of cone snail is thought to produce its own specific venom.

Cone-snail venom has come to interest biotechnologists and pharmacists because of its potential medicinal properties. Production of synthetic conopeptides has started, using solid-phase peptide synthesis.

A component of the venom of &quot;Conus magus&quot;, ω-conotoxin, is now marketed as the analgesic ziconotide, which is used as a last resort in chronic and severe pain. Conopeptides are also being looked at as anti-epileptic agents and to help stop nerve-cell death after a stroke or head injury. Conopeptides also have potential in helping against spasms due to spinal cord injuries, and may be helpful in diagnosing and treating small cell carcinomas in the lung.

The biotechnology surrounding cone snails and their venom has promise for medical breakthroughs; with more than 50,000 conopeptides to study, the possibilities are numerous.

<text>Trang (, ; ), also called &quot;Mueang Thap Thiang&quot;, is one of the southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand, on the west side of the Malay Peninsula facing the Strait of Malacca. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, and Satun.

Trang was formerly a port involved in foreign trade. It was the first place where rubber was planted in Thailand. Phraya Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi brought rubber saplings from Malaya and planted them here in 1899, and rubber is now an important export of the country. The Trang River flows through the province from its origin in the Khao Luang mountain range, and the Palian River flows from the Banthat mountains. The province of Trang has an area of approximately 5,000 square km and 199 km of Strait of Malacca shoreline.

==Geography==
The province is on the coast of the Strait of Malacca, and contains 46 islands together with the mainland area. There are only few plains, and most of the area is hills. The Khao Luang and the Banthat mountain range are the sources of the two main rivers of the province, the Trang River and the Palian River.

The southern coast of the province is protected in the Mu Ko Phetra National Park. The estuary of the Trang River together with the Hat Chao Mai Marine National Park and Ko Libong Non-hunting Area are also registered Ramsar wetlands. The total forest area is or 23.1 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are a total of three national parks, two of which, along with eighteen other national parks, make up region 5 (Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Khao Pu–Khao Ya is in region 6 (Songkhla) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Khao Pu–Khao Ya National Park, 
* Mu Ko Phetra National Park, 
* Hat Chao Mai National Park, 

==History==
Trang was an important seaport in southern Thailand. Legend says that ships always arrived in the morning, which led to the town&#x27;s name. &quot;Trang&quot; derives from the Malay word for light or dawn (&quot;terang&quot;). But in another explanation it says that it comes from Sanskrit (&quot;tarangque&quot;) which means wave or gallop. In addition, the landscape of Trang is characterized by mounds interspersed with plains that look like waves. Thus, the provincial seal features sea waves and a lighthouse bridge.

The province was once a part of the Srivijaya empire, an ancient Hindu-Buddhist Melayu Kingdom and the Malay Sultanate of Kedah until 1810.

According to cultural records Trang was one of 12 satellite towns that existed about 900 years ago, but it was during the reign of King Rama II in 1811 that Trang got its first governor. The first Westerner to arrive in Trang was Captain James Low, who came in 1824 to negotiate commercial benefits.

The original town was in Khuanthani (now a tambon in Kantang district). In 1893, the governor, Phraya Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi, also known as Khaw Sim Bee na Ranong, decided to make Trang an important seaport and relocated the town to Kantang district on the Trang River delta. It was moved again to its present location 26 km inland in 1916 by King Rama VI because of repeated flooding.

Trang was the first area of Thailand where rubber trees were planted, brought there by governor Phraya Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi from British Malaya in 1899.

==Symbols==
The seal of the province shows a lighthouse bridge above a sea of waves. The lighthouse bridge refers to Trang as a seaport trading with foreign countries.

The provincial symbolic flower and tree is the green ebony (&quot;Jacaranda filicifolia&quot;). The plant was imported from Australia by the same governor who imported the rubber tree, and it quickly got the name &quot;si trang&quot; by the citizens.

Trang&#x27;s streams and waterfalls are habitat to the lambchop rasbora (&quot;Trigonostigma espei&quot;), the minnow that are popularly kept as ornamental fish, Some of the population is the wild caught, and on the ground, this species of fish is the provincial aquatic life.

The provincial slogan เมืองพระยารัษฏา ชาวประชาใจกว้าง ถิ่นกำเนิดยางพารา เด่นสง่าดอกศรีตรัง ปะการังใต้ทะเล เสน่ห์หาดทรายงาม น้ำตกสวยตระการตา translates as &quot;Phraya Rasda&#x27;s town, generous people, delicious roast pork, the first city where para rubber was planted, the Si Trang provincial flower, underwater coral reefs, scenic beaches and waterfalls.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
Trang is divided into 10 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 87 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 697 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

<text>Wet Wet Wet is a Scottish soft rock band formed in 1982. They scored a number of hits on the UK charts and around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. They are best known for their 1994 cover of the Troggs&#x27; 1960s hit &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, which was used on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. The song was an international success, and spent 15 weeks at the top the UK Singles Chart. The band is currently composed of founding member Graeme Clark (bass, vocals) and lead vocalist Kevin Simm, who replaced founding member Marti Pellow in 2018 after he left during the previous year. Graeme Duffin (lead guitar, vocals) has also been with the band as a touring musician since 1983. The band were named Best British Newcomer at the 1988 Brit Awards.

==History==
===Formation and early years: 1982–1987===
The quartet formed at Clydebank High School in Clydebank, Scotland, in 1982, under the name &quot;Vortex Motion&quot;, mostly playing covers of The Clash and Magazine. &quot;It was either crime, the dole, football, or music — and we chose music,&quot; said Tommy Cunningham. The original line-up consisted of Neil Mitchell (keyboards), Tommy Cunningham (drums), Graeme Clark (bass), Mark McLachlan (a.k.a. Marti Pellow) (vocals) and Lindsey McCauley (guitar).

Clark and Cunningham met on the school bus and became close friends. Mutual friend Neil Mitchell, prompted by his pals&#x27; positive attitude, promised to supply keyboards when he could scrape together enough money from his paper round. To complete the quartet, Clark approached Mark McLachlan, who at the time was training to be a painter and decorator. He said, &quot;At break we all went behind the kitchen for a fly smoke, and there in the corner was this quiet kid who said very little, but when he sang, everyone listened.&quot; It was sometime in 1983 that Graeme Duffin joined Wet Wet Wet, after the departure of co-founder Lindsey McCauley. Duffin had previously been in a Glasgow-based band called New Celeste and recorded two albums with them &quot;High Sands and the Liquid Lake&quot; (1977) in Holland (with sleeve notes by Billy Connolly) on the Universe label and &quot;On the Line&quot; (1979) in Berlin on the Hansa Records label. The band combined folk, rock and jazz players.

With the line-up complete, rehearsals took place in Mrs. Clark&#x27;s kitchen. They rehearsed for about two years, working on song producing and writing skills. They eventually made their live debut at Glasgow&#x27;s Nightmoves venue. At this gig they met Elliot Davis, who would become the band&#x27;s manager. The band name Wet Wet Wet was chosen from a line in the 1982 Scritti Politti song &quot;Gettin&#x27; Havin&#x27; &amp; Holdin&#x27;&quot; (&quot;it&#x27;s tired of joking... wet, wet with tears&quot;), and McLachlan changed his name to stage name &quot;Marti Pellow&quot;. Their first professional gig was a New Year&#x27;s Eve show at Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowlands.

David Bates signed the band to PolyGram in 1985. One of the first demo songs they did was &quot;Wishing I Was Lucky&quot;. When the band took the demo to Bates in late 1986, he discarded it as a poor effort. The band decided at this point that they could no longer work with him. Six months later, the band and their new A&amp;R Manager, Nick Angel, released the single, and it reached number six in the UK singles chart. &quot;I was in a queue in a fish and chip shop in Glasgow when it came on Radio Clyde,&quot; Cunningham remembers. &quot;I felt like shouting to everybody, &#x27;That&#x27;s me and my mates!&#x27; It was an incredible feeling I&#x27;ve not forgotten.&quot; The parent album, &quot;Popped In Souled Out&quot;, also became a hit and produced three more hit singles, namely &quot;Sweet Little Mystery&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot;, and &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;. They supported Lionel Richie on his UK tour.

===Commercial success: 1988–1996===
In 1988, Wet Wet Wet scored their first Number 1 hit with a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, recorded for the charity ChildLine. Another Beatles song, &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;, was equally-billed on the flip side, performed by Billy Bragg. In the same year, an album - entitled &quot;The Memphis Sessions&quot; - was released from their spell in the United States prior to hitting the big time. It was produced and mixed by Willie Mitchell. It was recorded at his Royal Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The following year the band released their third album, &quot;Holding Back the River&quot;, which was also a success and produced the hit single &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;. The album was well-received, relying more on strings and other classical arrangements. At the end of 1989, the band appeared on the Band Aid II charity single.

In 1992, the band released a fourth studio album, entitled &quot;High on the Happy Side&quot;, which spawned the Number 1 hit single &quot;Goodnight Girl&quot; – the only self-penned chart-topping single they have had to date. The song proved something of a saviour, as the previous two single releases from the album had failed in the singles charts, although the album reached the top of the UK Albums Chart. In total, five singles were released from it. The following day saw the release of a special-edition album, &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot;, released under the alias &quot;Maggie Pie &amp; The Impostors&quot;. &quot;Maggie Pie&quot; was Marti Pellow, and the &quot;impostors&quot; were (on album cover, clockwise from top left) Neil Mitchell, Graeme Duffin, Tommy Cunningham, and Graeme Clark. The band&#x27;s first greatest-hits package, &quot;End of Part One&quot;, was released towards the end of 1993. The eighteen-song selection included &quot;Shed a Tear&quot; and &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;, which were recorded with Nile Rodgers in New York City especially for the album and released as singles.

In 1994, Wet Wet Wet had their biggest hit, a cover version of the Troggs&#x27; single &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, which was used on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. It was a huge international success and spent 15 weeks atop the British charts. The week before it could have equalled the record for the longest-standing number-one single, held by Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;, Pellow insisted on its deletion because he wanted to focus on getting their next album, &quot;Picture This&quot;, finished. However, even after its deletion, there were still enough copies in the shops to get the song to number 2 in its 16th week, finally knocked off the top spot by Whigfield&#x27;s debut single &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. In any event, it remained in the Top 40 for the remainder of the year. In the official UK best-selling singles list issued in 2002 (the 50th anniversary of the chart), it was placed 12th. &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; also featured on the 1995 album &quot;Picture This&quot;, their sixth, which also spawned the hit single &quot;Julia Says&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Forgive Me Now&quot;. The album, although well received by critics, would ultimately live in the shadow of &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;. In 1995, they became the shirt sponsors of their hometown football club, Clydebank F.C.

===Subsequent releases and break-up activities: 1997–2003===
During the rest of the 1990s the band maintained a strong UK following, although success in the singles charts became more sporadic. Their seventh studio album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;, celebrated the group&#x27;s decade at the top. After the tour in support of &quot;10&quot;, things turned sour over a dispute about royalty-sharing. Revenue from the group&#x27;s songwriting had been a four-way equal split. Cunningham turned up for a routine band meeting, only to discover that the other three members wanted to revise the policy, paying him a lesser amount. Cunningham instantly resigned from the group saying that the band had run its course and that the band was no longer a healthy place to be. In 1999 Pellow also left the band, to focus on getting himself healthy again after succumbing to a debilitating alcohol and drug addiction. Pellow succeeded in kicking his habits, and returned to the public eye in 2001 with his debut solo album, &quot;Smile&quot;.

===Reformation: 2004–2017===
In March 2004, the band cautiously reformed in order to work on an eighth album. A single entitled &quot;All I Want&quot; was released in November 2004 from the band&#x27;s second &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, released a week later. They undertook a successful tour of the UK the following month. In July 2005, Wet Wet Wet played at the Summer Weekender festival in England, and were one of the headline acts at Live 8 Edinburgh in Scotland. On 31 December 2006, Wet Wet Wet were the headline act for Aberdeen&#x27;s Hogmanay celebrations when the celebrations in all other Scottish cities was held off because of strong winds and heavy rain. They performed thirteen songs in an hour-long set. A single, &quot;Too Many People&quot;, was released on 5 November 2007, and its parent album, &quot;Timeless&quot;, on 12 November. These preceded a sold-out December tour, a taste of which was given at their Newmarket concert in August. In preparation for the tour, the band also announced that they will be playing two intimate dates at zavvi stores in Glasgow and London in November. &quot;Weightless&quot;, the second single from the album, was released on 4 February and charted at Number 10, giving them their first top-ten hit in eleven years.

In March 2012, it was announced that the band would perform its first concert in over five years, at Glasgow Green on 20 July, to celebrate their 25th anniversary of the release of their debut album, &quot;Popped In, Souled Out&quot;. In May 2013, UK music promoter Stuart Galbraith of Kilimanjaro Live confirmed a ten date UK tour for Wet Wet Wet commencing in December 2013. On 8 October 2013, Wet Wet Wet announced via their Twitter page that they would be releasing a new Greatest Hits album, &quot;Step by Step: The Greatest Hits&quot;, on 25 November 2013. The album features three new tracks as well as songs from their back catalogue. On 28 July 2017, it was announced that Pellow had quit Wet Wet Wet to focus on his solo career.

===New line up and &quot;The Journey&quot;: 2018–present===
On 25 September 2018, the band announced that Kevin Simm (formerly of Liberty X) was their new singer. Simm started singing with the band at two shows: St Lukes in Calton, Glasgow, and 229 The Venue in London in November 2018. Following on from their sold-out shows, they announced a nationwide 18-date tour, starting in April 2019.

In November 2020, the band announced the 2021 release of new album &quot;The Journey&quot;, their first studio album since 2007 and the first including vocals from former &quot;The Voice UK&quot; winner Kevin Simm, who also re-recorded the vocals on a number of their hits for the bonus CD (which comes with the 2CD/DVD version of album). In May 2022, drummer Tommy Cunningham announced that he quit the band due to his hearing problem, and keyboard player Neil Mitchell also left the band. In May 2023 it was announced the band would unite with Go West for a co-headline UK tour called the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; starting in January 2024.

<doc id="194049" wikidata="Q1104936" url="?curid=194049" title="Coba">
<text>Coba () is an ancient Maya city on the Yucatán Peninsula, located in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. The site is the nexus of the largest network of stone causeways of the ancient Maya world, and it contains many engraved and sculpted stelae that document ceremonial life and important events of the Late Classic Period (AD 600–900) of Mesoamerican civilization. The adjacent modern village bearing the same name, reported a population of 1,278 inhabitants in the 2010 Mexican federal census.
The ruins of Coba lie 47 km (approx. 29 mi) northwest of Tulum, in the State of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The geographical coordinates of Coba Group (main entrance for tourist area of the archaeological site) are North 19° 29.6’ and West 87° 43.7’. The archaeological zone is reached by a two-kilometer branch from the asphalt road connecting Tulum with Nuevo Xcán (a community of Lázaro Cárdenas, another municipality of Quintana Roo) on the Valladolid to Cancún highway.

Coba is located around two lagoons, Lake Coba and Lake Macanxoc. A series of elevated stone and plaster roads radiate from the central site to various smaller sites near and far. These are known by the Maya term &quot;sacbe&quot; (plural &quot;sacbeob&quot;) or white road. Some of these causeways go east, and the longest runs over westward to the site of Yaxuna. The site contains a group of large temple pyramids known as the &quot;Nohoch Mul&quot;, the tallest of which, Ixmoja, is some in height. Ixmoja is among the tallest pyramids on the Yucatán peninsula, exceeded by Calakmul at .

Coba was estimated to have had some 50,000 inhabitants (and possibly significantly more) at its peak of civilization, and the built up area extends over some 80 km2. The site was occupied by a sizable agricultural population by the first century. The bulk of Coba&#x27;s major construction seems to have been made in the middle and late Classic period, about 500 to 900 AD, with most of the dated hieroglyphic inscriptions from the 7th century (see Mesoamerican Long Count calendar). However, Coba remained an important site in the Post-Classic era and new temples were built and old ones kept in repair until at least the 14th century, possibly as late as the arrival of the Spanish.

Cobá lies in the tropics, subject to alternating wet and dry seasons which, on average, differ somewhat from those in the rest of the northern peninsula, where the rainy season generally runs from June through October and the dry season from November through May. At Cobá, rain can occur in almost any time of the year, but there is a short dry period in February and March, and a concentration of rain from September through November.

== Sakbe&#x27;ob ==
Sakbe&#x27;ob (Maya plural of sacbe), or sacbes, are very common at Coba. They are raised pathways lined with stones on each side and filled with smaller stones and lined with sand, shell, and/or plaster on top. These paths were the connecting points to most areas of Coba. Although the Maya used wheels in artifacts such as toys, anthropologists note that without indigenous animals suitable for draft, they did not implement the wheel for transportation of goods or people.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates that Cobá was first settled between 50 BC and 100 AD. At that time, there was a town with buildings of wood and palm fronds and flat platforms. The only archaeological evidence of the time are fragments of pottery. After 100 AD, the area around Coba evidenced strong population growth, and with it an increase in its social and political status among Maya city states which would ultimately make Coba one of the biggest and most powerful city states in the northern Yucatán area. Between 201 and 601 AD, Coba must have dominated a vast area, including the north of the state of Quintana Roo and areas in the east of the state of Yucatán. This power resided in its control of large swaths of farmland, control over trading routes, and — critically for a Maya city — control over ample water resources. Among the trading routes, Coba probably controlled ports like Xel Há.

Coba maintained close contacts with the large city states of Guatemala and the south of Campeche like Tikal, Dzibanche, or Calakmul. To maintain its influence, Coba established military alliances and arranged marriages among their elites. It is quite noteworthy that Coba shows traces of Teotihuacan architecture, like a platform in the Paintings group that was explored in 1999, which would attest of the existence of contacts with the central Mexican cultures and its powerful city of the early Classic epoch. Stelae uncovered at Coba are believed to document that Coba had many women as rulers, Ajaw.

After 600 AD, the emergence of powerful city states of the Puuc culture and the emergence of Chichén Itzá altered the political spectrum in the Yucatán peninsula and began eroding the dominance of Coba. Beginning around 900 or 1000 AD, Coba must have begun a lengthy power struggle with Chichén Itzá, with the latter dominating at the end as it gained control of key cities such as Yaxuná. After 1000 AD, Coba lost much of its political weight among city states, although it maintained some symbolic and religious importance. This allowed it to maintain or recover some status, which is evidenced by the new buildings dating to the time 1200-1500 AD, now built in the typical Eastern coastal style. However, power centers and trading routes had moved to the coast, forcing cities like Coba into a secondary status, although somewhat more successful than its more ephemeral enemy Chichén Itzá. Coba was abandoned at the time the Spanish conquered the peninsula around 1550.

===Rulers===

The names of fourteen leaders, including a woman named Yopaat, who ruled Cobá between AD 500 and 780, were ascertained in 2020.

==Exploration and artifacts==

The first mention of Coba in print is due to John Lloyd Stephens where he mentioned hearing reports of the site in 1842 from the cura (priest or vicar in Spanish) of Chemax, but it was so distant from any known modern road or village that he decided the difficulty in trying to get there was too daunting and returned to his principal target of exploring Tulum instead. For much of the rest of the 19th century the area could not be visited by outsiders due to the Caste War of Yucatán, the notable exception was Juan Peón Contreras (also used the nom de plume Contreras Elizalde) who was then director of the Museum of Yucatán. He made the arduous journey in September 1882, and is now remembered for the four naive pen-and-ink sketches that he made at the ruins (prints made from them exist in the Peabody Museum and in the collection of Raúl Pavón Abreu in Campeche). Teoberto Maler paid Coba a short visit in 1893 and took at least one photograph, but did not publish at the time and the site remained unknown to the archeological community.

Amateur explorer (and successful writer of popular books wherein he described his adventures and discoveries among Maya ruins) Dr. Thomas Gann was brought to the site by some local Maya hunters in February 1926. Gann published the first first-hand description of the ruins later the same year. Dr. Gann gave a short description to the archeologists of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW) project at Chichen Itza, he spoke of the large mounds he had sighted, but not visited for lack of time, lying to the northeast of the main group. It was to examine these that Alfred Kidder and J. Eric S. Thompson went for a two-day inspection of the site in March. Two months later Thompson was again at Coba, forming with Jean Charlot the third CIW expedition. On this trip their guide, Carmen Chai, showed them the &quot;Macanxoc Group&quot;, a discovery that led to the departure of a fourth expedition, since Sylvanus Morley wanted Thompson to show him the new stelae. Eric Thompson made a number of return visits to the site through 1932, the same year he published a detailed description.

In 1932, H. B. Roberts opened a number of trenches in Group B to collect sherds.

In 1948, two graduate students in archaeology, William and Michael Coe, visited Coba, intent on seeking the terminus of Sacbe 15. They were unaware that E. Wyllys Andrews IV already reported it ten years prior. In an editor&#x27;s note following their report, Thompson blames himself as editor for failing to detect the repetition of prior work in their contribution, while excusing the young authors for ignorance of a paper published in a foreign journal. But the Coes reported the previously unknown Sacbes 18 and 19 and mapped the large mound at the terminus of Sacbe 17, which they named Pech Mul (they were unlucky again in failing to complete their circuit of its platform, or they might have discovered the sacbe leading out of it, no. 21).

The site remained little visited due to its remoteness until the first modern road was opened up to Coba in the early 1970s. As a major resort was planned for Cancún, it was realized that clearing and restoring some of the large site could make it an important tourist attraction. The Mexican National Institute of Anthropology &amp; History (INAH) began some archeological excavations in 1972 directed by Carlos Navarrete, and consolidated a couple of buildings. Expectations of new discoveries were borne out when El Cono (Structure D-6) and Grupo Las Pinturas came to light, among other features. In the same year, much of Grupo Coba was cleared on the instructions of Raúl Pavón Abreu; not even its tall ramón trees were spared.

In 1975, a branch road from the asphalted highway being built from Tulum to Nuevo X-Can reached Coba (the road engineers heeded objections by archaeologists and abandoned their original plan of incorporating Sacbe 3 in the roadbed). A project camp was built in 1973, and in 1974 the Project Coba proper, under the auspices of the Regional Center of the Southeast of INAH was able to begin its operations. During the three-year existence of the project, portions of the site were cleared and structures excavated and consolidated, (the Castillo and the Pinturas Group by Peniche; the Iglesia by Benavides and Jaime Garduño; El Cono by Benavides and Fernando Robles); the sacbes were investigated by Folan and by Benavides, who added 26 to the list of 19 previously known; the ceramics from test pits and trenches were studied by Robles; and Jaime Garduño surveyed two transects of the site, one of 10 km north–south and another of 5 km east–west.

At the start of the 1980s, another road to Coba was opened up and paved, and a regular bus service begun. Coba became a tourist destination shortly thereafter, with many visitors flocking to the site on day trips from Cancún and the Riviera Maya. Only a small portion of the site has been cleared from the jungle and restored by archaeologists.

, the resident population of Coba pueblo was 1,167. It grew to 1,278 by the 2010 census.

== Economy ==
In the past, the people of Coba had traded extensively with other Mayan communities, particularly the ones further south along the Caribbean coast in what is now Belize and Honduras. It utilized the ports of Xcaret, Xel-Há, Tankah, Muyil, and Tulum as well as the many sacbeob that sprout from this cultural center. Typical items of trade of the Maya of this area were: salt, fish, squash, yams, corn, honey, beans, turkey, vegetables, chocolate drinks and raw materials such as limestone, marble, and jade. There was specialization in different areas on the site which were because of who was living and working where and what their trade was. Almost all of the commerce was controlled by wealthy merchants. These merchants used cacao beans for currency. Today&#x27;s economy is based on the rising popularity of tourism to the archaeological site.

==Tourism==
The archaeological site of Coba received 702,749 visitors in 2017. One of Coba&#x27;s main attractions is the Ancient Pyramid which, unlike Chichen Itza&#x27;s Kukulkan Pyramid, was still open for the public to climb its 130 steps up to the top of the site (prior to being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

There are also three hotels, one campsite and seven restaurants scattered throughout the site and there is a small pueblo near the ruins, with some restaurants and small shops selling local crafts.

The following are the important artifacts and structures that can be viewed and experienced within the ruins of Coba:
* Nohoch Mul Pyramid - A 42 meters tall (137 feet) pyramid that boasts a remarkable view of the Yucatán and non-public areas of Coba including both lagoons; Macanxoc Lagoon to the east and Cobá Lagoon to the southwest. However, climbing Nohoch Mul is no longer allowed as of 2020.
* Coba Group - This is a series of structures close to the entrance that include the Iglesia and one of two ball courts located in this site.
* Conjunto de Pinturas - The focus of this area is the Pyramid of the Painted Lintel where visitors can see from afar actual paintings on the top temple.
* Macanxoc Group - Past the Conjunto de Pinturas is the Macanxoc Group that is found following one of the sacbes. This area has 8 stelae and numerous altars. The vast number of stelae show that this area was of spiritual significance to later occupants.
* Coba Stelae - These monuments give insight into various aspects of the formal life of Cobá, including dress, ritual processes, and the roles and power of both men and women in the city&#x27;s ceremonial and political activities. Women are the figures of authority in many of the scenes depicted on the stelae. The hieroglyphic inscriptions contain additional information about the city&#x27;s sociopolitical organization as well as dates and accounts of major historical events.
* Sacbe - Cobá was an urban hub of many settlements that were joined by roads called sacbes. These roads range in width from 2 to 10 meters. The longest is almost 100km, and connects Cobá to the site of Yaxuná to the west. Such construction is believed to be more difficult than that invested into stone buildings and temples.

<text>Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), known as computer-aided instruction (CAI) in British English and computer-aided language instruction (CALI) in American English, Levy (1997: p. 1) briefly defines it as &quot;the exploration and study of computer applications in language teaching and learning.&quot; CALL embraces a wide range of information and communications technology &quot;applications and approaches to teaching and learning foreign languages, ranging from the traditional drill-and-practice programs that characterized CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent manifestations of CALL, such as those utilized virtual learning environment and Web-based distance learning. It also extends to the use of corpora and concordancers, interactive whiteboards, computer-mediated communication (CMC), language learning in virtual worlds, and mobile-assisted language learning (MALL).

The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was used before CALL, originating as a subset of the broader term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favor among language teachers, however, because it seemed to emphasize a teacher-centered instructional approach. Language teachers increasingly favored a student-centered approach focused on learning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s (Davies &amp; Higgins, 1982: p. 3). and it is now incorporated into the names of the growing number of professional associations worldwide.

An alternative term, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL), also emerged around the early 1990s: e.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.

The current philosophy of CALL emphasizes student-centered materials that empower learners to work independently. These materials can be structured or unstructured but typically incorporate two key features: interactive and individualized learning. CALL employs tools that assist teachers in facilitating language learning, whether reinforcing classroom lessons or providing additional support to learners. The design of CALL materials typically integrates principles from language pedagogy and methodology, drawing from various learning theories such as behaviourism, cognitive theory, constructivism, and second-language acquisition theories like Stephen Krashen&#x27;s. monitor hypothesis.

A combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as blended learning. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential and is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p. 27).

See Davies &quot;et al.&quot; (2011: Section 1.1, &quot;What is CALL?&quot;). See also Levy &amp; Hubbard (2005), who raise the question &quot;Why call CALL &quot;CALL&quot;?&quot;

==History==

CALL dates back to the 1960s, when it was first introduced on university mainframe computers. The PLATO project, initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960, is an important landmark in the early development of CALL (Marty 1981). The advent of the microcomputer in the late 1970s brought computing within the range of a wider audience, resulting in a boom in the development of CALL programs and a flurry of publications of books on CALL in the early 1980s.

Dozens of CALL programs are currently available on the internet, at prices ranging from free to expensive, and other programs are available only through university language courses.

There have been several attempts to document the history of CALL. Sanders (1995) covers the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, focusing on CALL in North America. Delcloque (2000) documents the history of CALL worldwide, from its beginnings in the 1960s to the dawning of the new millennium. Davies (2005) takes a look back at CALL&#x27;s past and attempts to predict where it is going. Hubbard (2009) offers a compilation of 74 key articles and book excerpts, originally published in the years 1988–2007, that give a comprehensive overview of the wide range of leading ideas and research results that have exerted an influence on the development of CALL or that show promise in doing so in the future. A published review of Hubbard&#x27;s collection can be found in &quot;Language Learning &amp; Technology&quot; 14, 3 (2010).

Butler-Pascoe (2011) looks at the history of CALL from a different point of view, namely the evolution of CALL in the dual fields of educational technology and second/foreign language acquisition and the paradigm shifts experienced along the way.

See also Davies et al. (2011: Section 2, &quot;History of CALL&quot;).

==Typology and phases==

During the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to establish a CALL typology. A wide range of different types of CALL programs was identified by Davies &amp; Higgins (1985), Jones &amp; Fortescue (1987), Hardisty &amp; Windeatt (1989) and Levy (1997: pp. 118ff.). These included gap-filling and Cloze programs, multiple-choice programs, free-format (text-entry) programs, adventures and simulations, action mazes, sentence-reordering programs, exploratory programs—and &quot;total Cloze&quot;, a type of program in which the learner has to reconstruct a whole text. Most of these early programs still exist in modernised versions.

Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly difficult to categorise CALL as it now extends to the use of blogs, wikis, social networking, podcasting, Web 2.0 applications, language learning in virtual worlds and interactive whiteboards (Davies et al. 2010: Section 3.7).

Warschauer (1996) and Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998) took a different approach. Rather than focusing on the typology of CALL, they identified three historical phases of CALL, classified according to their underlying pedagogical and methodological approaches:

* Behavioristic CALL: conceived in the 1950s and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s.
* Communicative CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Integrative CALL: embracing Multimedia and the Internet: 1990s.

Most CALL programs in Warschauer &amp; Healey&#x27;s first phase, Behavioristic CALL (1960s to 1970s), consisted of drill-and-practice materials in which the computer presented a stimulus and the learner provided a response. At first, both could be done only through text. The computer would analyse students&#x27; input and give feedback, and more sophisticated programs would react to students&#x27; mistakes by branching to help screens and remedial activities. While such programs and their underlying pedagogy still exist today, behaviouristic approaches to language learning have been rejected by most language teachers, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has led CALL to other possibilities.

The second phase described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Communicative CALL, is based on the communicative approach that became prominent in the late 1970s and 1980s (Underwood 1984). In the communicative approach the focus is on using the language rather than analysis of the language, and grammar is taught implicitly rather than explicitly. It also allows for originality and flexibility in student output of language. The communicative approach coincided with the arrival of the PC, which made computing much more widely available and resulted in a boom in the development of software for language learning. The first CALL software in this phase continued to provide skill practice but not in a drill format—for example: paced reading, text reconstruction and language games—but the computer remained the tutor. In this phase, computers provided context for students to use the language, such as asking for directions to a place, and programs not designed for language learning such as Sim City, &quot;Sleuth&quot; and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? were used for language learning. Criticisms of this approach include using the computer in an ad hoc and disconnected manner for more marginal aims rather than the central aims of language teaching.

The third phase of CALL described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Integrative CALL, starting from the 1990s, tried to address criticisms of the communicative approach by integrating the teaching of language skills into tasks or projects to provide direction and coherence. It also coincided with the development of multimedia technology (providing text, graphics, sound and animation) as well as Computer-mediated communication (CMC). CALL in this period saw a definitive shift from the use of the computer for drill and tutorial purposes (the computer as a finite, authoritative base for a specific task) to a medium for extending education beyond the classroom. Multimedia CALL started with interactive laser videodiscs such as &quot;Montevidisco&quot; (Schneider &amp; Bennion 1984) and &quot;A la rencontre de Philippe&quot; (Fuerstenberg 1993), both of which were simulations of situations where the learner played a key role. These programs later were transferred to CD-ROMs, and new role-playing games (RPGs) such as &quot;Who is Oscar Lake?&quot; made their appearance in a range of different languages.

In a later publication Warschauer changed the name of the first phase of CALL from Behavioristic CALL to Structural CALL and also revised the dates of the three phases (Warschauer 2000):

* Structural CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Communicative CALL: 1980s to 1990s.
* Integrative CALL: 2000 onwards.

Bax (2003) took issue with Warschauer &amp; Haley (1998) and Warschauer (2000) and proposed these three phases:

* Restricted CALL – mainly behaviouristic: 1960s to 1980s.
* Open CALL – i.e. open in terms of feedback given to students, software types and the role of the teacher, and including simulations and games: 1980s to 2003 (i.e. the date of Bax&#x27;s article).
* Integrated CALL – still to be achieved. Bax argued that at the time of writing language teachers were still in the Open CALL phase, as true integration could only be said to have been achieved when CALL had reached a state of &quot;normalisation&quot; – e.g. when using CALL was as normal as using a pen.

See also Bax &amp; Chambers (2006) and Bax (2011), in which the topic of &quot;normalisation&quot; is revisited.

==Flashcards==

A basic use of CALL is in vocabulary acquisition using flashcards, which requires quite simple programs. Such programs often make use of spaced repetition, a technique whereby the learner is presented with the vocabulary items that need to be committed to memory at increasingly longer intervals until long-term retention is achieved. This has led to the development of a number of applications known as spaced repetition systems (SRS), including the generic Anki or SuperMemo package and programs such as BYKI and phase-6, which have been designed specifically for learners of foreign languages.

==Software design and pedagogy==

Above all, careful consideration must be given to pedagogy in designing CALL software, but publishers of CALL software tend to follow the latest trend, regardless of its desirability. Moreover, approaches to teaching foreign languages are constantly changing, dating back to grammar-translation, through the direct method, audio-lingualism and a variety of other approaches, to the more recent communicative approach and constructivism (Decoo 2001).

Designing and creating CALL software is an extremely demanding task, calling upon a range of skills. Major CALL development projects are usually managed by a team of people:

* A subject specialist (also known as a content provider) – usually a language teacher – who is responsible for providing the content and pedagogical input. More than one subject specialist is required for larger CALL projects.
* A programmer who is familiar with the chosen programming language or authoring tool.
* A graphic designer, to produce pictures and icons, and to advise on fonts, colour, screen layout, etc.
* A professional photographer or, at the very least, a very good amateur photographer. Graphic designers often have a background in photography too.
* A sound engineer and a video technician will be required if the package is to contain substantial amounts of sound and video.
* An instructional designer. Developing a CALL package is more than just putting a text book into a computer. An instructional designer will probably have a background in cognitive psychology and media technology, and will be able to advise the subject specialists in the team on the appropriate use of the chosen technology (Gimeno &amp; Davies 2010).

CALL inherently supports learner autonomy, the final of the eight conditions that Egbert et al. (2007) cite as &quot;Conditions for Optimal Language Learning Environments&quot;. Learner autonomy places the learner firmly in control so that he or she &quot;decides on learning goals&quot; (Egbert et al., 2007, p. 8).

It is all too easy when designing CALL software to take the comfortable route and produce a set of multiple-choice and gap-filling exercises, using a simple authoring tool (Bangs 2011), but CALL is much more than this; Stepp-Greany (2002), for example, describes the creation and management of an environment incorporating a constructivist and whole language philosophy. According to constructivist theory, learners are active participants in tasks in which they &quot;construct&quot; new knowledge derived from their prior experience. Learners also assume responsibility for their learning, and the teacher is a facilitator rather than a purveyor of knowledge. Whole language theory embraces constructivism and postulates that language learning moves from the whole to the part, rather than building sub-skills to lead towards the higher abilities of comprehension, speaking, and writing. It also emphasises that comprehending, speaking, reading, and writing skills are interrelated, reinforcing each other in complex ways. Language acquisition is, therefore, an active process in which the learner focuses on cues and meaning and makes intelligent guesses. Additional demands are placed upon teachers working in a technological environment incorporating constructivist and whole language theories. The development of teachers&#x27; professional skills must include new pedagogical as well as technical and management skills. Regarding the issue of teacher facilitation in such an environment, the teacher has a key role to play, but there could be a conflict between the aim to create an atmosphere for learner independence and the teacher&#x27;s natural feelings of responsibility. In order to avoid learners&#x27; negative perceptions, Stepp-Greany points out that it is especially important for the teacher to continue to address their needs, especially those of low-ability learners.

==Multimedia==

Language teachers have been avid users of technology for a very long time. Gramophone records were among the first technological aids to be used by language teachers in order to present students with recordings of native speakers&#x27; voices, and broadcasts from foreign radio stations were used to make recordings on reel-to-reel tape recorders. Other examples of technological aids that have been used in the foreign language classroom include slide projectors, film-strip projectors, film projectors, videocassette recorders and DVD players. In the early 1960s, integrated courses (which were often described as multimedia courses) began to appear. Examples of such courses are &quot;Ecouter et Parler&quot; (consisting of a coursebook and tape recordings) and &quot;Deutsch durch die audiovisuelle Methode&quot; (consisting of an illustrated coursebook, tape recordings and a film-strip – based on the Structuro-Global Audio-Visual method).

During the 1970s and 1980s standard microcomputers were incapable of producing sound and they had poor graphics capability. This represented a step backwards for language teachers, who by this time had become accustomed to using a range of different media in the foreign language classroom. The arrival of the multimedia computer in the early 1990s was therefore a major breakthrough as it enabled text, images, sound and video to be combined in one device and the integration of the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing (Davies 2011: Section 1).

Examples of CALL programs for multimedia computers that were published on CD-ROM and DVD from the mid-1990s onwards are described by Davies (2010: Section 3). CALL programs are still being published on CD-ROM and DVD, but Web-based multimedia CALL has now virtually supplanted these media.

Following the arrival of multimedia CALL, multimedia language centres began to appear in educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to individualise learning but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of multimedia centres has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1). There is therefore a danger that multimedia centres may go the same way as the language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p. 28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.

Managing a multimedia language centre requires not only staff who have a knowledge of foreign languages and language teaching methodology but also staff with technical know-how and budget management ability, as well as the ability to combine all these into creative ways of taking advantage of what the technology can offer. A centre manager usually needs assistants for technical support, for managing resources and even the tutoring of students. Multimedia centres lend themselves to self-study and potentially self-directed learning, but this is often misunderstood. The simple existence of a multimedia centre does not automatically lead to students learning independently. Significant investment of time is essential for materials development and creating an atmosphere conducive to self-study. Unfortunately, administrators often have the mistaken belief that buying hardware by itself will meet the needs of the centre, allocating 90% of its budget to hardware and virtually ignoring software and staff training needs (Davies et al. 2011: &quot;Foreword&quot;). Self-access language learning centres or independent learning centres have emerged partially independently and partially in response to these issues. In self-access learning, the focus is on developing learner autonomy through varying degrees of self-directed learning, as opposed to (or as a complement to) classroom learning. In many centres learners access materials and manage their learning independently, but they also have access to staff for help. Many self-access centres are heavy users of technology and an increasing number of them are now offering online self-access learning opportunities. Some centres have developed novel ways of supporting language learning outside the context of the language classroom (also called &#x27;language support&#x27;) by developing software to monitor students&#x27; self-directed learning and by offering online support from teachers. Centre managers and support staff may need to have new roles defined for them to support students&#x27; efforts at self-directed learning: v. Mozzon-McPherson &amp; Vismans (2001), who refer to a new job description, namely that of the &quot;language adviser&quot;.

==Internet==

The emergence of the World Wide Web (now known simply as &quot;the Web&quot;) in the early 1990s marked a significant change in the use of communications technology for all computer users. Email and other forms of electronic communication had been in existence for many years, but the launch of Mosaic, the first graphical Web browser, in 1993 brought about a radical change in the ways in which we communicate electronically. The launch of the Web in the public arena immediately began to attract the attention of language teachers. Many language teachers were already familiar with the concept of hypertext on stand-alone computers, which made it possible to set up non-sequential structured reading activities for language learners in which they could point to items of text or images on a page displayed on the computer screen and branch to any other pages, e.g. in a so-called &quot;stack&quot; as implemented in the HyperCard program on Apple Mac computers. The Web took this one stage further by creating a worldwide hypertext system that enabled the user to branch to different pages on computers anywhere in the world simply by pointing and clicking at a piece of text or an image. This opened up access to thousands of authentic foreign-language websites to teachers and students that could be used in a variety of ways. A problem that arose, however, was that this could lead to a good deal of time-wasting if Web browsing was used in an unstructured way (Davies 1997: pp. 42–43), and language teachers responded by developing more structured activities and online exercises (Leloup &amp; Ponterio 2003). Davies (2010) lists over 500 websites, where links to online exercises can be found, along with links to online dictionaries and encyclopaedias, concordancers, translation aids and other miscellaneous resources of interest to the language teacher and learner.

The launch of the (free) &quot;Hot Potatoes&quot; (Holmes &amp; Arneil) authoring tool, which was first demonstrated publicly at the EUROCALL 1998 conference, made it possible for language teachers to create their own online interactive exercises. Other useful tools are produced by the same authors.

In its early days the Web could not compete seriously with multimedia CALL on CD-ROM and DVD. Sound and video quality was often poor, and interaction was slow. But now the Web has caught up. Sound and video are of high quality and interaction has improved tremendously, although this does depend on sufficient bandwidth being available, which is not always the case, especially in remote rural areas and developing countries. One area in which CD-ROMs and DVDs are still superior is in the presentation of listen/respond/playback activities, although such activities on the Web are continually improving.

Since the early 2000s there has been a boom in the development of so-called Web 2.0 applications. Contrary to popular opinion, Web 2.0 is not a new version of the Web, rather it implies a shift in emphasis from Web browsing, which is essentially a one-way process (from the Web to the end-user), to making use of Web applications in the same way as one uses applications on a desktop computer. It also implies more interaction and sharing. Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 2.1) list the following examples of Web 2.0 applications that language teachers are using:

* Image storage and sharing
* Social bookmarking
* Discussion lists, blogs, wikis, social networking
* Chat rooms, MUDs, MOOs and MUVEs (virtual worlds)
* Podcasting
* Audio tools
* Video sharing applications and screen capture tools (referring to both video screen capture tools and screenshot tools)
* Animation tools – comic strips, movies, etc.
* Mashups
* Blog assisted language learning (BALL)
There is no doubt that the Web has proved to be a main focus for language teachers, who are making increasingly imaginative use of its wide range of facilities: see Dudeney (2007) and Thomas (2008). Above all, the use of Web 2.0 tools calls for a careful reexamination of the role of the teacher in the classroom (Richardson 2006).

==Corpora and concordancers==

Corpora have been used for many years as the basis of linguistic research and also for the compilation of dictionaries and reference works such as the Collins Cobuild series, published by HarperCollins. Tribble &amp; Barlow (2001), Sinclair (2004) and McEnery &amp; Wilson (2011) describe a variety of ways in which corpora can be used in language teaching.

An early reference to the use of electronic concordancers in language teaching can be found in Higgins &amp; Johns (1984: pp. 88–94), and many examples of their practical use in the classroom are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2010).

It was Tim Johns (1991), however, who raised the profile of the use of concordancers in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL). DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2011).

Robb (2003) shows how it is possible to use Google as a concordancer, but he also points out a number of drawbacks, for instance there is no control over the educational level, nationality, or other characteristics of the creators of the texts that are found, and the presentation of the examples is not as easy to read as the output of a dedicated concordancer that places the key words (i.e. the search terms) in context.

==Virtual worlds==

Virtual worlds date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example Colossal Cave Adventure, a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. Language teachers discovered that it was possible to exploit these text-only programs by using them as the basis for discussion. Jones G. (1986) describes an experiment based on the Kingdom simulation, in which learners played roles as members of a council governing an imaginary kingdom. A single computer in the classroom was used to provide the stimulus for discussion, namely simulating events taking place in the kingdom: crop planting time, harvest time, unforeseen catastrophes, etc.

The early adventure games and simulations led on to multi-user variants, which were known as MUDs (Multi-user domains). Like their predecessors, MUDs were text-only, with the difference that they were available to a wider online audience. MUDs then led on to MOOs (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding: see Donaldson &amp; Kötter (1999) and (Shield 2003).

The next major breakthrough in the history of virtual worlds was the graphical user interface. Lucasfilm&#x27;s Habitat (1986), was one of the first virtual worlds that was graphically based, albeit only in a two-dimensional environment. Each participant was represented by a visual avatar who could interact with other avatars using text chat.

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as Traveler and Active Worlds, both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. Traveler included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars who were represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of Active Worlds as an arena for constructivist learning.

The 3D world of Second Life was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another role-playing game (RPG), it began to attract the interest of language teachers with the launch of the first of the series of SLanguages conferences in 2007. Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 14.2.1) and Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2010) describe a number of experiments and projects that focus on language learning in Second Life. See also the Wikipedia article Virtual world language learning.

To what extent Second Life and other virtual worlds will become established as important tools for teachers of foreign languages remains to be seen. It has been argued by Dudeney (2010) in his &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; blog that Second Life is &quot;too demanding and too unreliable for most educators&quot;. The subsequent discussion shows that this view is shared by many teachers, but many others completely disagree.

Regardless of the pros and cons of Second Life, language teachers&#x27; interest in virtual worlds continues to grow. The joint EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group was set up in 2009, and there are now many areas in Second Life that are dedicated to language learning and teaching, for example the commercial area for learners of English, which is managed by Language Lab, and free areas such as the region maintained by the Goethe-Institut and the EduNation Islands. There are also examples of simulations created specifically for language education, such as those produced by the EC-funded NIFLAR and AVALON projects. NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in Opensim.

==Human language technologies==

Human language technologies (HLT) comprise a number of areas of research and development that focus on the use of technology to facilitate communication in a multilingual information society. Human language technologies are areas of activity in departments of the European Commission that were formerly grouped under the heading language engineering (Gupta &amp; Schulze 2011: Section 1.1).

The parts of HLT that is of greatest interest to the language teacher is natural language processing (NLP), especially parsing, as well as the areas of speech synthesis and speech recognition.

Speech synthesis has improved immeasurably in recent years. It is often used in electronic dictionaries to enable learners to find out how words are pronounced. At word level, speech synthesis is quite effective, the artificial voice often closely resembling a human voice. At phrase level and sentence level, however, there are often problems of intonation, resulting in speech production that sounds unnatural even though it may be intelligible. Speech synthesis as embodied in text to speech (TTS) applications is invaluable as a tool for unsighted or partially sighted people. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 4.1) list several examples of speech synthesis applications.

Speech recognition is less advanced than speech synthesis. It has been used in a number of CALL programs, in which it is usually described as automatic speech recognition (ASR). ASR is not easy to implement. Ehsani &amp; Knodt (1998) summarise the core problem as follows:

&quot;Complex cognitive processes account for the human ability to associate acoustic signals with meanings and intentions. For a computer, on the other hand, speech is essentially a series of digital values. However, despite these differences, the core problem of speech recognition is the same for both humans and machines: namely, of finding the best match between a given speech sound and its corresponding word string. Automatic speech recognition technology attempts to simulate and optimize this process computationally.&quot;

Programs embodying ASR normally provide a native speaker model that the learner is requested to imitate, but the matching process is not 100% reliable and may result in a learner&#x27;s perfectly intelligible attempt to pronounce a word or phrase being rejected (Davies 2010: Section 3.4.6 and Section 3.4.7).

Parsing is used in a number of ways in CALL. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 5) describe how parsing may be used to analyse sentences, presenting the learner with a tree diagram that labels the constituent parts of speech of a sentence and shows the learner how the sentence is structured.

Parsing is also used in CALL programs to analyse the learner&#x27;s input and diagnose errors. Davies (2002) writes:

&quot;Discrete error analysis and feedback were a common feature of traditional CALL, and the more sophisticated programs would attempt to analyse the learner&#x27;s response, pinpoint errors, and branch to help and remedial activities. ... Error analysis in CALL is, however, a matter of controversy. Practitioners who come into CALL via the disciplines of computational linguistics, e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Language Technologies (HLT), tend to be more optimistic about the potential of error analysis by computer than those who come into CALL via language teaching. [...] An alternative approach is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to parse the learner&#x27;s response – so-called &quot;intelligent CALL&quot; (ICALL) – but there is a gulf between those who favour the use of AI to develop CALL programs (Matthews 1994) and, at the other extreme, those who perceive this approach as a threat to humanity (Last 1989:153)&quot;.

Underwood (1989) and Heift &amp; Schulze (2007) present a more positive picture of AI.

Research into speech synthesis, speech recognition and parsing and how these areas of NLP can be used in CALL are the main focus of the NLP Special Interest Group within the EUROCALL professional association and the ICALL Special Interest Group within the CALICO professional association. The EUROCALL NLP SIG also maintains a Ning.

==Impact==

The question of the impact of CALL in language learning and teaching has been raised at regular intervals ever since computers first appeared in educational institutions (Davies &amp; Hewer 2011: Section 3). Recent large-scale impact studies include the study edited by Fitzpatrick &amp; Davies (2003) and the EACEA (2009) study, both of which were produced for the European Commission.

A distinction needs to be made between the impact and the effectiveness of CALL. Impact may be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the uptake and use of ICT in teaching foreign languages, issues of availability of hardware and software, budgetary considerations, Internet access, teachers&#x27; and learners&#x27; attitudes to the use of CALL, changes in the ways in which languages are learnt and taught, and paradigm shifts in teachers&#x27; and learners&#x27; roles. Effectiveness, on the other hand, usually focuses on assessing to what extent ICT is a more effective way of teaching foreign languages compared to using traditional methods – and this is more problematic as so many variables come into play. Worldwide, the picture of the impact of CALL is extremely varied. Most developed nations work comfortably with the new technologies, but developing nations are often beset with problems of costs and broadband connectivity. Evidence on the effectiveness of CALL – as with the impact of CALL – is extremely varied and many research questions still need to be addressed and answered. Hubbard (2002) presents the results of a CALL research survey that was sent to 120 CALL professionals from around the world asking them to articulate a CALL research question they would like to see answered. Some of the questions have been answered but many more remain open. Leakey (2011) offers an overview of current and past research in CALL and proposes a comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of CALL platforms, programs and pedagogy.

A crucial issue is the extent to which the computer is perceived as taking over the teacher&#x27;s role. Warschauer (1996: p. 6) perceived the computer as playing an &quot;intelligent&quot; role, and claimed that a computer program &quot;should ideally be able to understand a user&#x27;s spoken input and evaluate it not just for correctness but also for appropriateness. It should be able to diagnose a student&#x27;s problems with pronunciation, syntax, or usage and then intelligently decide among a range of options (e.g. repeating, paraphrasing, slowing down, correcting, or directing the student to background explanations).&quot; Jones C. (1986), on the other hand, rejected the idea of the computer being &quot;some kind of inferior teacher-substitute&quot; and proposed a methodology that focused more on what teachers could do with computer programs rather than what computer programs could do on their own: &quot;in other words, treating the computer as they would any other classroom aid&quot;. Warschauer&#x27;s high expectations in 1996 have still not been fulfilled, and currently there is an increasing tendency for teachers to go down the route proposed by Jones, making use of a variety of new tools such as corpora and concordancers, interactive whiteboards and applications for online communication.

Since the advent of the Web there has been an explosion in online learning, but to what extent it is effective is open to criticism. Felix (2003) takes a critical look at popular myths attached to online learning from three perspectives, namely administrators, teachers and students. She concludes: &quot;That costs can be saved in this ambitious enterprise is clearly a myth, as are expectations of saving time or replacing staff with machines.&quot;

As for the effectiveness of CALL in promoting the four skills, Felix (2008) claims that there is &quot;enough data in CALL to suggest positive effects on spelling, reading and writing&quot;, but more research is needed in order to determine its effectiveness in other areas, especially speaking online. She claims that students&#x27; perceptions of CALL are positive, but she qualifies this claim by stating that the technologies need to be stable and well supported, drawing attention to concerns that technical problems may interfere with the learning process. She also points out that older students may not feel comfortable with computers and younger students may not possess the necessary meta-skills for coping effectively in the challenging new environments. Training in computer literacy for both students and teachers is essential, and time constraints may pose additional problems. In order to achieve meaningful results she recommends &quot;time-series analysis in which the same group of students is involved in experimental and control treatment for a certain amount of time and then switched – more than once if possible&quot;.

Types of technology training in CALL for language teaching professionals certainly vary. Within second language teacher education programs, namely pre-service course work, we can find &quot;online courses along with face-to-face courses&quot;, computer technology incorporated into a more general second language education course, &quot;technology workshops&quot;,&quot;a series of courses offered throughout the teacher education programs, and even courses specifically designed for a CALL certificate and a CALL graduate degree&quot; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has identified four levels of courses with only components, namely &quot;web-supplemented, web-dependent, mixed mod and fully online&quot;.

There is a rapidly growing interest in resources about the use of technology to deliver CALL. Journals that have issues that &quot;deal with how teacher education programs help prepare language teachers to use technology in their own classrooms&quot; include &quot;Language Learning and Technology&quot; (2002), &quot;Innovations in Language Learning and Teaching&quot; (2009) and the TESOL international professional association&#x27;s publication of technology standards for TESOL includes a chapter on preparation of teacher candidates in technology use, as well as the upgrading of teacher educators to be able to provide such instruction. Both CALICO and EUROCALL have special interest groups for teacher education in CALL.

<doc id="194056" wikidata="Q542827" url="?curid=194056" title="Rollie Fingers">
<text>Roland Glen Fingers (born August 25, 1946) is an American former right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for three teams between 1968 and 1985. His effectiveness helped to redefine the value of relievers within baseball and to usher in the modern closer role. A seven-time All-Star, he led the major leagues in saves three times, and was named Rolaids Relief Man of the Year four times. He first gained prominence as a member of the Oakland Athletics championship teams of the early 1970s, when his flamboyant handlebar mustache made him perhaps the most identifiable member of The Mustache Gang, which led Oakland to become the only non-New York Yankees team ever to win three consecutive World Series titles. Fingers was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1974 World Series after earning a win in the opener and saves in the last three games to secure the title.

Fingers joined the San Diego Padres as a free agent after the 1976 season, and led the major leagues with 35 saves in 1977 before tying the National League (NL) single-season record with 37 saves the following year. Traded to the Milwaukee Brewers after the 1980 season, he led that team to its first playoff appearance in 1981, receiving the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award and Cy Young Award after earning 28 saves in the strike-shortened season with an earned run average (ERA) of only 1.04, allowing just 9 runs in 78 innings pitched. He also helped them reach the World Series in 1982, the team&#x27;s only appearance to date.

Having surpassed Hoyt Wilhelm&#x27;s major league record for career saves in 1980, Fingers was the first pitcher to reach 300 saves, and retired after the 1985 season with 341 saves, which remained the record until surpassed by Jeff Reardon in 1992. He set franchise records for career saves for all three of his teams, holding the Athletics mark from 1973 to 1990, the Padres record from 1977 to 1997, and the Brewers record from 1984 to 1989. He is also particularly remembered for his &quot;long saves&quot; of two or more innings, for which he still holds the record of 135. At the end of his career he also ranked third in major league history in career games pitched (944), relief wins (107) and relief innings pitched (), and second in strikeouts in relief (1,183); he held the Padres franchise record for career games pitched from 1980 to 1989. His career ERA of 2.90 ranked eighth among pitchers with at least 1,500 innings pitched after 1930. Fingers was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992, making him just the second reliever elected after Wilhelm. Both the Athletics and Brewers retired his uniform number following his induction.

==Early life==
Fingers was born in Steubenville, Ohio, to George Michael Fingers and Edna Pearl (née Stafford) Fingers. His father (who had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and roomed with Stan Musial), worked in a Steubenville steel mill. One day, George Fingers came home from work fed up and said, &quot;That&#x27;s it, we&#x27;re moving to California.&quot; His father then sold the house for $1,500, bought a car, and took the family to Cucamonga (San Bernardino County), a town which was later incorporated (together with 3 others) as the city of Rancho Cucamonga. They could not afford hotels, so they slept in sleeping bags beside the highway. After arriving in California, George Fingers eventually had to go back to being a steelworker at the nearby Kaiser Steel mill.

Fingers attended Upland High School in nearby Upland.

==College career==
Fingers attended one semester at Chaffey Junior College.-also in Upland (subsequently a new campus was built in Alta Loma).

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
The Los Angeles Dodgers offered Fingers a signing bonus of $20,000, but Fingers thought he had no chance to reach the major leagues for years because the Dodgers had a solid pitching staff including Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, they were already winning pennants, and their farm system appeared to be full of talented players. He turned down the Dodgers&#x27; offer and signed with the Kansas City Athletics for less money (a $13,000 signing bonus) on Christmas Eve 1964. At first, the Athletics did not know whether to make him a pitcher or outfielder, but after deciding to play him as a pitcher, he was assigned to the Leesburg A&#x27;s of the Class A Florida State League for the 1965 season. In 1966, he played for the Modesto Reds of the Class A California League, and he played for two seasons (1968 and 1969) for the Birmingham A&#x27;s of the Class AA Southern League.

On minor league opening day 1967 in Birmingham—just nine days after he married his high school sweetheart Jill, the Upland High School team statistician—a hit baseball struck Fingers in the face, breaking his cheekbone, jaw, and knocking out some teeth. His jaw was wired shut for five weeks, and when he returned to action, Fingers jumped every time the ball was hit; it took him about half the remaining season to get used to being on the mound again.

Fingers was a starting pitcher throughout his minor league career.

===Oakland Athletics (1968–1976)===
He joined the Athletics late in the 1968 season, their first after relocating to Oakland, and made his major league debut in relief on September 15 in a road game against the Detroit Tigers. It was a disastrous beginning, as he allowed four hits including a Bill Freehan home run, walked one batter and hit another, and threw a wild pitch, allowing four runs while getting just four outs en route to a 13–0 loss; it was his only appearance of the year. The 1969 season was a dramatic improvement; he picked up his first career win with a complete game shutout on April 22, a 7-0 road win against the Minnesota Twins, and earned his first save on May 13 against the Boston Red Sox. Fingers started 19 games in 1970; however, a May 15, 1971 road start against the Kansas City Royals was his last in regular rotation. During that game, he gave up one run on four hits in five full innings. On April 29, he recorded a career-high 10 strikeouts in a 3–2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, a pitching duel with Jim Palmer; it was the last complete game he would pitch. Fingers was called upon as a reliever in a game on May 21, entering in the first inning against the Twins in Oakland after starter Blue Moon Odom gave up three runs and three walks in just eight batters. Fingers pitched innings, allowing three hits and two runs. Late that month, Athletics manager Dick Williams decided that Fingers would be the late-inning closer. Beginning with that game and continuing until July 15, Fingers recorded consecutive scoreless innings, with 11 scoreless appearances in between including a win and six saves, as well as a 7-inning relief stint on July 9 against the California Angels.

During the 1972 season, Fingers entered games in the fifth inning on four occasions, but mostly entered in the sixth inning or later. He did start two games in 1973—April 21 at home versus the Angels and May 7 on the road against the Orioles, the latter being the final start of his career. Other than those two games, for the remainder of his career, his earliest entrance into a game was in the sixth inning, which happened on three more occasions. He usually entered in the seventh, eighth, or ninth innings. During the 1973 season, Fingers broke John Wyatt&#x27;s record of 73 career saves with the Athletics.

Fingers was part of the Oakland Athletics team that accomplished the first modern-day &quot;three-peat,&quot; winning the World Series in 1972, 1973, and 1974. For the third of those championships, he won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, earning three saves and one win during the Series.

Just prior to the start of the 1974 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Fingers and Odom got into a fight in the A&#x27;s locker room after Odom made a comment about Fingers&#x27;s wife. Though the incident lasted less than a minute, Fingers required six stitches on his head, and Odom sprained his ankle and had a noticeable limp.

With the end of baseball&#x27;s reserve clause, all players not under a multi-year contract were set to become free agents after the 1976 season. Believing he would not be able to afford to re-sign his key players, Athletics&#x27; owner Charlie Finley attempted to sell Fingers and Joe Rudi to the Boston Red Sox for $1 million each and Vida Blue to the New York Yankees for $1.5 million in June. Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball, nullified the sale, saying that the transactions were &quot;not in the best interests of baseball&quot;. Finley sued Kuhn, and he benched Fingers, Rudi and Blue, saying that they belonged to other teams. Members of the Athletics threatened to strike against Finley if they did not play, and Finley relented.

===San Diego Padres (1977–1980)===
After the season, Fingers signed with the San Diego Padres as a free agent.

Fingers won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in 1977, 1978, and 1980 with the Padres. He was the Sporting News Reliever of the Year in those same years. In his first season with the club, he easily passed the young franchise&#x27;s record of 16 career saves, shared by Vicente Romo and Butch Metzger, and in 1978 he tied Clay Carroll&#x27;s NL single-season record of 37 saves; the mark was again tied the following year by Bruce Sutter, who eventually shattered the record with 45 saves in 1984. Near the end of his time with the Padres, Fingers passed teammate Randy Jones to become the club&#x27;s career leader with 265 games pitched.

===Milwaukee Brewers (1981–1982, 1984–1985)===
After the 1980 season, on December 8, the Padres traded Fingers, Gene Tenace, Bob Shirley, and a player to be named later (later selected to be Bob Geren) to the St. Louis Cardinals for Terry Kennedy, John Littlefield, Al Olmsted, Mike Phillips, Kim Seaman, Steve Swisher, and John Urrea. A few days later, the Cardinals traded Fingers, Ted Simmons, and Pete Vuckovich to the Milwaukee Brewers for Sixto Lezcano, Lary Sorensen, David Green, and Dave LaPoint. In 1981, Fingers won the Sporting News Reliever of the Year, Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award, the American League Most Valuable Player Award (a first for an American League relief pitcher), and the AL Cy Young Award, as the Brewers reached the playoffs for the first time in their 13-year history. He saved 29 games for the 1982 Brewers, but pitched most of the season in pain and was forced to miss the Brewers&#x27; first (and to date, only) trip to the World Series, where they were beaten in seven games by the Cardinals. Fingers missed the 1983 season with injury, and had a laminectomy to remove a herniated disk from his back in August 1984. During the 1984 season he passed Ken Sanders&#x27; career record of 61 saves for the Brewers.

On September 4, 1985, Fingers broke Sparky Lyle&#x27;s American League record of 232 career saves, retiring the side in the 9th inning of an 11-10 road win against the Twins. His last major league appearance was on September 17 against the Orioles at Memorial Stadium; he pitched in relief of Teddy Higuera in the bottom of the eighth inning, facing two batters. He allowed a home run to Gary Roenicke, but struck out Rick Dempsey to end the inning as the Orioles won 6–0.

At the end of his career, after being released by the Brewers the previous season, he was offered a contract by Pete Rose to play for the Cincinnati Reds for 1986, but owner Marge Schott had a &quot;clean cut&quot; policy for her players, mandating that all players must be clean shaven. Fingers&#x27;s reply to Reds general manager Bill Bergesch was: &quot;Well, you tell Marge Schott to shave her Saint Bernard, and I&#x27;ll shave my moustache&quot;.

Largely because of changes in relief pitching and the increased use of closers which he had helped popularize, Fingers&#x27;s various team and league records were surpassed in the years following his retirement. Dan Quisenberry broke his AL record of 233 career saves in 1987, and Jeff Reardon broke his major league mark of 341 in 1992. His team records for career saves also fell, with his 97 saves with the Brewers passed by Dan Plesac in 1989, his 136 saves with the Athletics broken by Dennis Eckersley in 1990, and his 108 saves with the Padres broken by Trevor Hoffman in 1997. Eric Show broke his Padres record of 265 games pitched in 1989.

When Fingers reached the major leagues, the role of relief pitchers was limited, as starting pitchers rarely left games while holding a lead; but as team offense increased following the 1968 season, and especially with the American League&#x27;s introduction of the designated hitter in 1973, managers became more willing to replace starters in the late innings with a lead in order to forestall any late rallies by opponents. Through the 1960s, both leagues&#x27; annual saves leaders tended toward totals of 20–25 saves; few pitchers remained in the role more than two or three years, with significant exceptions such as Roy Face and knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm. But in the 1970s—in an era allowing for greater opportunities for closers than had previously been available—Fingers&#x27;s excellence in relief allowed him to gradually increase his annual saves totals past 30. In 1980 he broke Wilhelm&#x27;s record of 227 saves, and he eventually finished with 341—a record that stood until Jeff Reardon passed it in 1992.

Fingers is regarded as a pioneer of modern relief pitching, defining the role of the closer for years to come. As had generally been true in baseball through the 1960s, Fingers was moved to the bullpen—and eventually to his role as a closer—because of struggles with starting. Before Fingers&#x27;s time, a former starter&#x27;s renewed success in the bullpen led back to a spot in the starting rotation. However, with the successes of Fingers and contemporaries such as Sparky Lyle and Goose Gossage, it has been widely accepted that an excellent pitcher might actually provide a greater benefit to his team as a closer than as a third or fourth starter. (Gossage, for example, was moved to the starting rotation after first serving as a reliever for a few seasons. As a starter, he pitched 17 complete games, but was clobbered and eventually was moved back to the bullpen permanently.) As a result, later teams have been more willing to move successful starters—notably Dennis Eckersley, Dave Righetti, and John Smoltz—to the &quot;permanent&quot; role of closer, with no plans to bring them back to the rotation. (Smoltz bucked that trend by successfully returning to the rotation in 2005.) In 2006, Bruce Sutter became the first pitcher in baseball history elected to the Hall of Fame who never started a game in his major league career.

==Moustache==
Baseball-Reference.com ranks Fingers&#x27;s moustache as the best in history. In addition to his pitching ability, Fingers was noted for his waxed handlebar moustache, which he originally grew to get a $300 bonus from Athletics owner Charles O. Finley. On the first day of spring training for the 1972 season, Reggie Jackson showed up with a beard. In protest—and believing the Athletics&#x27; management would want Jackson to shave—Fingers and a few other players started going without shaving to force Jackson to shave off his beard. Instead, Finley, ever the showman who would do almost anything to sell tickets, then offered prize money to the player who could best grow and maintain their facial hair until Opening Day—April 15 versus Minnesota. Fingers went all out for the monetary incentive offered by Finley and patterned his moustache after the images of the players of the late 19th century. Taking it even further, Finley came up with &quot;Moustache Day&quot; at the ballpark, where any fan with a moustache could get in free.

Catfish Hunter and Ken Holtzman also went for the bonus, but Fingers with his Snidely Whiplash took the prize. Fingers later said, &quot;Most of us would have grown one anywhere on our bodies for $300.&quot; The players became known as the &quot;Moustache Gang.&quot; Prior to the disbandment of the original core, many Hall of Famers acknowledged the strength of not only their arms but also their mustaches. Willie Mays, prior to his retirement, acknowledged seeing Fingers&#x27;s mustache as a proper send-off for his career. Bill Buckner said, &quot;the only thing stronger than my swing was the beauty of his mustache.&quot; Lastly, Johnny Bench noted that as a catcher, seeing Fingers&#x27;s mustache prepared him en route to winning two World Series with the Cincinnati Reds. Although most former Athletics players shaved off their moustaches after the team traded most of their players in 1975–76, Fingers maintained his after signing with the Padres as a free agent in 1977, and he still has the mustache today.

==Honors and later life==

In 1992, Fingers was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, joining Wilhelm to become only the second reliever inducted. Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Mariano Rivera, and Lee Smith have since followed, as has Dennis Eckersley (who was a starter for the first half of his career and a reliever for the second half).

In 1999, Fingers ranked 96th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Fingers later pitched a season in the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association.

Fingers is one of only ten players who have had their numbers retired from more than one team.

In 2000, Fingers was inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions, honoring that city&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

In December 2020, Fingers&#x27;s World Series championship ring was sold at auction for $75,330.

===Income tax controversy===
&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported on January 2, 2007, that Fingers owed the state of Wisconsin more than $1.4 million in income taxes dating back to his time with the Brewers (including $1.1 million in interest) and was at the time the seventh biggest tax delinquent in the state. Fingers disputed the claim, saying he was shocked when he learned of it in 2005 and that taxes had been properly withheld from his Brewers paychecks.

On August 15, the Associated Press reported that Fingers&#x27;s name had been removed from Wisconsin&#x27;s delinquent tax list the previous month. &quot;That&#x27;s all been taken care of,&quot; he told the AP. &quot;I&#x27;ve had more people try to tell me, &#x27;You know, you owe $1.4 million.&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, I don&#x27;t.&#x27; We got all that squared away. I had to go all the way back to 1981 on my income taxes. That&#x27;s all been taken care of, and I did pay my taxes back then, so there&#x27;s no problem. The revenue department&#x27;s happy with me right now, so it&#x27;s all been resolved.&quot;

==In media==
===Books===
On April 1, 2009, Rollie Fingers and co-author Christopher &quot;Yellowstone&quot; Ritter released:

* &quot;Rollie&#x27;s Follies: A Hall of Fame Revue of Baseball Lists and Lore, Stats and Stories&quot;, Cincinnati, Ohio: Clerisy Press. .

The work is a non-fiction baseball book that combines elements of humor, anecdotal storytelling, odd lists and historical trivia.

The first book inspired a sequel, released March 16, 2010, by Fingers and Ritter:

* &quot;The Rollie Fingers Baseball Bible: Lists and Lore, Stories and Stats&quot;, Cincinnati, Ohio: Clerisy Press. .

===Television appearances===
Fingers and four other members of his family appeared on a 1983 episode of the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;. After the opening theme, to honor Fingers, host Richard Dawson led the crowd in a chorus of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. Fingers also appeared in a pair of commercials for Pepsi Max, playing himself in a Field of Dreams setting along with other legendary players. In one commercial, when the Pepsi Max delivery man replenishes an empty vending machine, Fingers appears to take his moustache off and give it to the delivery man, saying, &quot;Great save, kid. You deserve this.&quot;

===Radio===
In 1994/1995 a comedy segment entitled &quot;Rollie TV&quot;, concerning a fictitious cable television channel devoted solely to the life of Rollie Fingers and helmed by a Fingers-obsessed host named Greg Shuttlecock, aired once a week on &quot;The Steve Dahl Radio Show&quot; on WMVP 1000 AM in Chicago. The idea and segment were created and performed by Jeffery C. Johnson and Jim Toth. A &quot;Rollie TV&quot; skit had originally aired in 1993 on Toth and Johnson&#x27;s Chicago cable TV show &quot;Color TV&quot; and was then adapted into segments for radio.

<text>Leik Myrabo is an aerospace engineering professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who retired from there in 2011. He made the first demonstrations of the use of ground-based lasers to propel objects, lifting them hundreds of feet. His goal was to use ground-based lasers to propel objects into orbit; possibly reducing orbit-flight costs by large factors.

==Research==
Professor Myrabo first had the idea for laser-propelled Lightcraft in the early 1980s, while working on &quot;Star Wars&quot; anti-missile technology. In 1985 he co-wrote, with SF author Dean Ing, a popularization of this and other unconventional propulsion concepts in &quot;The Future of Flight&quot;, published by Baen. Myrabo&#x27;s &quot;lightcraft&quot; design is a reflective funnel-shaped craft that channels heat from the laser, towards the center, causing it to literally explode the air underneath it, generating lift. This method, however is dependent entirely on the laser&#x27;s power, and even the most powerful models currently can only serve for modest test purposes. To keep the craft stable, a small jet of pressurized nitrogen spins the craft at 6,000 revolutions per minute. Lightcraft were limited to paper studies until about 1996, when Myrabo and Air Force scientist Franklin Mead began trying them out.

The first tests succeeded in reaching over 100 feet, which compares to Robert Goddard&#x27;s first test flight of his rocket design. In 2000, a new flight record was set with a flight lasting 10.5 seconds and reaching 72 meters (236 feet).

<doc id="194060" wikidata="Q1198376" url="?curid=194060" title="Cohomology">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in homology theory and algebraic topology, cohomology is a general term for a sequence of abelian groups, usually one associated with a topological space, often defined from a cochain complex. Cohomology can be viewed as a method of assigning richer algebraic invariants to a space than homology. Some versions of cohomology arise by dualizing the construction of homology. In other words, cochains are functions on the group of chains in homology theory.

From its start in topology, this idea became a dominant method in the mathematics of the second half of the twentieth century. From the initial idea of homology as a method of constructing algebraic invariants of topological spaces, the range of applications of homology and cohomology theories has spread throughout geometry and algebra. The terminology tends to hide the fact that cohomology, a contravariant theory, is more natural than homology in many applications. At a basic level, this has to do with functions and pullbacks in geometric situations: given spaces formula_1 and formula_2, and some function formula_3 on formula_2, for any mapping formula_5, composition with formula_6 gives rise to a function formula_7 on formula_1. The most important cohomology theories have a product, the cup product, which gives them a ring structure. Because of this feature, cohomology is usually a stronger invariant than homology.

==Singular cohomology==
Singular cohomology is a powerful invariant in topology, associating a graded-commutative ring with any topological space. Every continuous map formula_5 determines a homomorphism from the cohomology ring of formula_2 to that of formula_1; this puts strong restrictions on the possible maps from formula_1 to formula_2. Unlike more subtle invariants such as homotopy groups, the cohomology ring tends to be computable in practice for spaces of interest.

For a topological space formula_1, the definition of singular cohomology starts with the singular chain complex:
formula_15
By definition, the singular homology of formula_1 is the homology of this chain complex (the kernel of one homomorphism modulo the image of the previous one). In more detail, formula_17 is the free abelian group on the set of continuous maps from the standard formula_18-simplex to formula_1 (called &quot;singular formula_18-simplices in formula_1&quot;), and formula_22 is the formula_18-th boundary homomorphism. The groups formula_17 are zero for formula_18 negative.

Now fix an abelian group formula_26, and replace each group formula_17 by its dual group formula_28 and formula_22 by its dual homomorphism
formula_30

This has the effect of &quot;reversing all the arrows&quot; of the original complex, leaving a cochain complex
formula_31

For an integer formula_18, the formula_18th cohomology group of formula_1 with coefficients in formula_26 is defined to be formula_36 and denoted by formula_37. The group formula_37 is zero for formula_18 negative. The elements of formula_40 are called singular formula_18-cochains with coefficients in formula_26. (Equivalently, an formula_18-cochain on formula_1 can be identified with a function from the set of singular formula_18-simplices in formula_1 to formula_26.) Elements of formula_48 and formula_49 are called cocycles and coboundaries, respectively, while elements of formula_50 are called cohomology classes (because they are equivalence classes of cocycles).

In what follows, the coefficient group formula_26 is sometimes not written. It is common to take formula_26 to be a commutative ring formula_53; then the cohomology groups are formula_53-modules. A standard choice is the ring formula_55 of integers.

Some of the formal properties of cohomology are only minor variants of the properties of homology:

* A continuous map formula_56 determines a pushforward homomorphism formula_57 on homology and a pullback homomorphism formula_58 on cohomology. This makes cohomology into a contravariant functor from topological spaces to abelian groups (or formula_53-modules).
* Two homotopic maps from formula_1 to formula_2 induce the same homomorphism on cohomology (just as on homology).
* The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an important computational tool in cohomology, as in homology. Note that the boundary homomorphism increases (rather than decreases) degree in cohomology. That is, if a space formula_1 is the union of open subsets formula_63 and formula_64, then there is a long exact sequence: formula_65
* There are relative cohomology groups formula_66 for any subspace formula_2 of a space formula_1. They are related to the usual cohomology groups by a long exact sequence: formula_69
* The universal coefficient theorem describes cohomology in terms of homology, using Ext groups. Namely, there is a short exact sequence formula_70 A related statement is that for a field formula_3, formula_72 is precisely the dual space of the vector space formula_73.
* If formula_1 is a topological manifold or a CW complex, then the cohomology groups formula_37 are zero for formula_18 greater than the dimension of formula_1. If formula_1 is a compact manifold (possibly with boundary), or a CW complex with finitely many cells in each dimension, and formula_53 is a commutative Noetherian ring, then the formula_53-module formula_81 is finitely generated for each formula_18.

On the other hand, cohomology has a crucial structure that homology does not: for any topological space formula_1 and commutative ring formula_53, there is a bilinear map, called the cup product:
formula_85
defined by an explicit formula on singular cochains. The product of cohomology classes formula_86 and formula_87 is written as formula_88 or simply as formula_89. This product makes the direct sum
formula_90
into a graded ring, called the cohomology ring of formula_1. It is graded-commutative in the sense that:
formula_92

For any continuous map formula_93 the pullback formula_94 is a homomorphism of graded formula_53-algebras. It follows that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent, then their cohomology rings are isomorphic.

Here are some of the geometric interpretations of the cup product. In what follows, manifolds are understood to be without boundary, unless stated otherwise. A closed manifold means a compact manifold (without boundary), whereas a closed &quot;submanifold&quot; &quot;N&quot; of a manifold &quot;M&quot; means a submanifold that is a closed subset of &quot;M&quot;, not necessarily compact (although &quot;N&quot; is automatically compact if &quot;M&quot; is).

* Let &quot;X&quot; be a closed oriented manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;. Then Poincaré duality gives an isomorphism &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;X&quot; ≅ &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;i&quot;&quot;X&quot;. As a result, a closed oriented submanifold &quot;S&quot; of codimension &quot;i&quot; in &quot;X&quot; determines a cohomology class in &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;X&quot;, called [&quot;S&quot;]. In these terms, the cup product describes the intersection of submanifolds. Namely, if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are submanifolds of codimension &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; that intersect transversely, then formula_96 where the intersection &quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot; is a submanifold of codimension &quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot;, with an orientation determined by the orientations of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;X&quot;. In the case of smooth manifolds, if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; do not intersect transversely, this formula can still be used to compute the cup product [&quot;S&quot;][&quot;T&quot;], by perturbing &quot;S&quot; or &quot;T&quot; to make the intersection transverse. More generally, without assuming that &quot;X&quot; has an orientation, a closed submanifold of &quot;X&quot; with an orientation on its normal bundle determines a cohomology class on &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; is a noncompact manifold, then a closed submanifold (not necessarily compact) determines a cohomology class on &quot;X&quot;. In both cases, the cup product can again be described in terms of intersections of submanifolds. Note that Thom constructed an integral cohomology class of degree 7 on a smooth 14-manifold that is not the class of any smooth submanifold. On the other hand, he showed that every integral cohomology class of positive degree on a smooth manifold has a positive multiple that is the class of a smooth submanifold. Also, every integral cohomology class on a manifold can be represented by a &quot;pseudomanifold&quot;, that is, a simplicial complex that is a manifold outside a closed subset of codimension at least 2.
* For a smooth manifold &quot;X&quot;, de Rham&#x27;s theorem says that the singular cohomology of &quot;X&quot; with real coefficients is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of &quot;X&quot;, defined using differential forms. The cup product corresponds to the product of differential forms. This interpretation has the advantage that the product on differential forms is graded-commutative, whereas the product on singular cochains is only graded-commutative up to chain homotopy. In fact, it is impossible to modify the definition of singular cochains with coefficients in the integers formula_55 or in formula_98 for a prime number &quot;p&quot; to make the product graded-commutative on the nose. The failure of graded-commutativity at the cochain level leads to the Steenrod operations on mod &quot;p&quot; cohomology.

Very informally, for any topological space &quot;X&quot;, elements of formula_99 can be thought of as represented by codimension-&quot;i&quot; subspaces of &quot;X&quot; that can move freely on &quot;X&quot;. For example, one way to define an element of formula_99 is to give a continuous map &quot;f&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to a manifold &quot;M&quot; and a closed codimension-&quot;i&quot; submanifold &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; with an orientation on the normal bundle. Informally, one thinks of the resulting class formula_101 as lying on the subspace formula_102 of &quot;X&quot;; this is justified in that the class formula_103 restricts to zero in the cohomology of the open subset formula_104 The cohomology class formula_103 can move freely on &quot;X&quot; in the sense that &quot;N&quot; could be replaced by any continuous deformation of &quot;N&quot; inside &quot;M&quot;.

==Examples==
In what follows, cohomology is taken with coefficients in the integers Z, unless stated otherwise. 
*The cohomology ring of a point is the ring Z in degree 0. By homotopy invariance, this is also the cohomology ring of any contractible space, such as Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot;.
*For a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the cohomology ring of the sphere formula_106 is Z[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2) (the quotient ring of a polynomial ring by the given ideal), with &quot;x&quot; in degree &quot;n&quot;. In terms of Poincaré duality as above, &quot;x&quot; is the class of a point on the sphere.
*The cohomology ring of the torus formula_107 is the exterior algebra over Z on &quot;n&quot; generators in degree 1. For example, let &quot;P&quot; denote a point in the circle formula_108, and &quot;Q&quot; the point (&quot;P&quot;,&quot;P&quot;) in the 2-dimensional torus formula_109. Then the cohomology of (&quot;S&quot;1)2 has a basis as a free Z-module of the form: the element 1 in degree 0, &quot;x&quot; := [&quot;P&quot; × &quot;S&quot;1] and &quot;y&quot; := [&quot;S&quot;1 × &quot;P&quot;] in degree 1, and &quot;xy&quot; = [&quot;Q&quot;] in degree 2. (Implicitly, orientations of the torus and of the two circles have been fixed here.) Note that &quot;yx&quot; = −&quot;xy&quot; = −[&quot;Q&quot;], by graded-commutativity.
*More generally, let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring, and let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be any topological spaces such that &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) is a finitely generated free &quot;R&quot;-module in each degree. (No assumption is needed on &quot;Y&quot;.) Then the Künneth formula gives that the cohomology ring of the product space &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is a tensor product of &quot;R&quot;-algebras: formula_110
* The cohomology ring of real projective space RP&quot;n&quot; with Z/2 coefficients is Z/2[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1), with &quot;x&quot; in degree 1. Here &quot;x&quot; is the class of a hyperplane RP&quot;n&quot;−1 in RP&quot;n&quot;; this makes sense even though RP&quot;j&quot; is not orientable for &quot;j&quot; even and positive, because Poincaré duality with Z/2 coefficients works for arbitrary manifolds. With integer coefficients, the answer is a bit more complicated. The Z-cohomology of RP2&quot;a&quot; has an element &quot;y&quot; of degree 2 such that the whole cohomology is the direct sum of a copy of Z spanned by the element 1 in degree 0 together with copies of Z/2 spanned by the elements &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot;=1...,&quot;a&quot;. The Z-cohomology of RP2&quot;a&quot;+1 is the same together with an extra copy of Z in degree 2&quot;a&quot;+1.
*The cohomology ring of complex projective space CP&quot;n&quot; is Z[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1), with &quot;x&quot; in degree 2. Here &quot;x&quot; is the class of a hyperplane CP&quot;n&quot;−1 in CP&quot;n&quot;. More generally, &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the class of a linear subspace CP&quot;n&quot;−&quot;j&quot; in CP&quot;n&quot;.
*The cohomology ring of the closed oriented surface &quot;X&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; ≥ 0 has a basis as a free Z-module of the form: the element 1 in degree 0, &quot;A&quot;1...,&quot;A&quot;&quot;g&quot; and &quot;B&quot;1...,&quot;B&quot;&quot;g&quot; in degree 1, and the class &quot;P&quot; of a point in degree 2. The product is given by: &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot; = 0 if &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;, and &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;P&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;. By graded-commutativity, it follows that .
*On any topological space, graded-commutativity of the cohomology ring implies that 2&quot;x&quot;2 = 0 for all odd-degree cohomology classes &quot;x&quot;. It follows that for a ring &quot;R&quot; containing 1/2, all odd-degree elements of &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) have square zero. On the other hand, odd-degree elements need not have square zero if &quot;R&quot; is Z/2 or Z, as one sees in the example of RP2 (with Z/2 coefficients) or RP4 × RP2 (with Z coefficients).

==The diagonal==
The cup product on cohomology can be viewed as coming from the diagonal map formula_111, formula_112. Namely, for any spaces formula_1 and formula_2 with cohomology classes formula_115 and formula_116, there is an external product (or cross product) cohomology class formula_117. The cup product of classes formula_115 and formula_119 can be defined as the pullback of the external product by the diagonal:
formula_120

Alternatively, the external product can be defined in terms of the cup product. For spaces formula_1 and formula_2, write formula_123 and formula_124 for the two projections. Then the external product of classes formula_115 and formula_116 is:
formula_127

==Poincaré duality==

Another interpretation of Poincaré duality is that the cohomology ring of a closed oriented manifold is self-dual in a strong sense. Namely, let formula_1 be a closed connected oriented manifold of dimension formula_129, and let formula_3 be a field. Then formula_131 is isomorphic to formula_3, and the product
:formula_133
is a perfect pairing for each integer formula_18. In particular, the vector spaces formula_72 and formula_136 have the same (finite) dimension. Likewise, the product on integral cohomology modulo torsion with values in formula_137 is a perfect pairing over formula_55.

==Characteristic classes==

An oriented real vector bundle &quot;E&quot; of rank &quot;r&quot; over a topological space &quot;X&quot; determines a cohomology class on &quot;X&quot;, the Euler class χ(&quot;E&quot;) ∈ &quot;H&quot;&quot;r&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,Z). Informally, the Euler class is the class of the zero set of a general section of &quot;E&quot;. That interpretation can be made more explicit when &quot;E&quot; is a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold &quot;X&quot;, since then a general smooth section of &quot;X&quot; vanishes on a codimension-&quot;r&quot; submanifold of &quot;X&quot;.

There are several other types of characteristic classes for vector bundles that take values in cohomology, including Chern classes, Stiefel–Whitney classes, and Pontryagin classes.

==Eilenberg–MacLane spaces==

For each abelian group &quot;A&quot; and natural number &quot;j&quot;, there is a space formula_139 whose &quot;j&quot;-th homotopy group is isomorphic to &quot;A&quot; and whose other homotopy groups are zero. Such a space is called an Eilenberg–MacLane space. This space has the remarkable property that it is a classifying space for cohomology: there is a natural element &quot;u&quot; of formula_140, and every cohomology class of degree &quot;j&quot; on every space &quot;X&quot; is the pullback of &quot;u&quot; by some continuous map formula_141. More precisely, pulling back the class &quot;u&quot; gives a bijection
:formula_142
for every space &quot;X&quot; with the homotopy type of a CW complex. Here formula_143 denotes the set of homotopy classes of continuous maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;.

For example, the space formula_144 (defined up to homotopy equivalence) can be taken to be the circle formula_108. So the description above says that every element of formula_146 is pulled back from the class &quot;u&quot; of a point on formula_108 by some map formula_148.

There is a related description of the first cohomology with coefficients in any abelian group &quot;A&quot;, say for a CW complex &quot;X&quot;. Namely, formula_149 is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of Galois covering spaces of &quot;X&quot; with group &quot;A&quot;, also called principal &quot;A&quot;-bundles over &quot;X&quot;. For &quot;X&quot; connected, it follows that formula_149 is isomorphic to formula_151, where formula_152 is the fundamental group of &quot;X&quot;. For example, formula_153 classifies the double covering spaces of &quot;X&quot;, with the element formula_154 corresponding to the trivial double covering, the disjoint union of two copies of &quot;X&quot;.

==Cap product==

For any topological space &quot;X&quot;, the cap product is a bilinear map
:formula_155
for any integers &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; and any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;. The resulting map
:formula_156
makes the singular homology of &quot;X&quot; into a module over the singular cohomology ring of &quot;X&quot;.

For &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot;, the cap product gives the natural homomorphism
:formula_157
which is an isomorphism for &quot;R&quot; a field.

For example, let &quot;X&quot; be an oriented manifold, not necessarily compact. Then a closed oriented codimension-&quot;i&quot; submanifold &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; (not necessarily compact) determines an element of &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;R&quot;), and a compact oriented &quot;j&quot;-dimensional submanifold &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;X&quot; determines an element of &quot;H&quot;&quot;j&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;R&quot;). The cap product [&quot;Y&quot;] ∩ [&quot;Z&quot;] ∈ &quot;H&quot;&quot;j&quot;−&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) can be computed by perturbing &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; to make them intersect transversely and then taking the class of their intersection, which is a compact oriented submanifold of dimension &quot;j&quot; − &quot;i&quot;.

A closed oriented manifold &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; has a fundamental class [&quot;X&quot;] in &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;R&quot;). The Poincaré duality isomorphism
formula_158
is defined by cap product with the fundamental class of &quot;X&quot;.

==Brief history of singular cohomology==
Although cohomology is fundamental to modern algebraic topology, its importance was not seen for some 40 years after the development of homology. The concept of &quot;dual cell structure&quot;, which Henri Poincaré used in his proof of his Poincaré duality theorem, contained the beginning of the idea of cohomology, but this was not seen until later.

There were various precursors to cohomology. In the mid-1920s, J. W. Alexander and Solomon Lefschetz founded intersection theory of cycles on manifolds. On a closed oriented &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; an &quot;i&quot;-cycle and a &quot;j&quot;-cycle with nonempty intersection will, if in the general position, have as their intersection a (&quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot; − &quot;n&quot;)-cycle. This leads to a multiplication of homology classes
:formula_159
which (in retrospect) can be identified with the cup product on the cohomology of &quot;M&quot;.

Alexander had by 1930 defined a first notion of a cochain, by thinking of an &quot;i&quot;-cochain on a space &quot;X&quot; as a function on small neighborhoods of the diagonal in &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1.

In 1931, Georges de Rham related homology and differential forms, proving de Rham&#x27;s theorem. This result can be stated more simply in terms of cohomology.

In 1934, Lev Pontryagin proved the Pontryagin duality theorem; a result on topological groups. This (in rather special cases) provided an interpretation of Poincaré duality and Alexander duality in terms of group characters.

At a 1935 conference in Moscow, Andrey Kolmogorov and Alexander both introduced cohomology and tried to construct a cohomology product structure.

In 1936, Norman Steenrod constructed Čech cohomology by dualizing Čech homology.

From 1936 to 1938, Hassler Whitney and Eduard Čech developed the cup product (making cohomology into a graded ring) and cap product, and realized that Poincaré duality can be stated in terms of the cap product. Their theory was still limited to finite cell complexes.

In 1944, Samuel Eilenberg overcame the technical limitations, and gave the modern definition of singular homology and cohomology.

In 1945, Eilenberg and Steenrod stated the axioms defining a homology or cohomology theory, discussed below. In their 1952 book, &quot;Foundations of Algebraic Topology&quot;, they proved that the existing homology and cohomology theories did indeed satisfy their axioms.

In 1946, Jean Leray defined sheaf cohomology.

In 1948 Edwin Spanier, building on work of Alexander and Kolmogorov, developed Alexander–Spanier cohomology.

==Sheaf cohomology==

Sheaf cohomology is a rich generalization of singular cohomology, allowing more general &quot;coefficients&quot; than simply an abelian group. For every sheaf of abelian groups &quot;E&quot; on a topological space &quot;X&quot;, one has cohomology groups &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) for integers &quot;i&quot;. In particular, in the case of the constant sheaf on &quot;X&quot; associated with an abelian group &quot;A&quot;, the resulting groups &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) coincide with singular cohomology for &quot;X&quot; a manifold or CW complex (though not for arbitrary spaces &quot;X&quot;). Starting in the 1950s, sheaf cohomology has become a central part of algebraic geometry and complex analysis, partly because of the importance of the sheaf of regular functions or the sheaf of holomorphic functions.

Grothendieck elegantly defined and characterized sheaf cohomology in the language of homological algebra. The essential point is to fix the space &quot;X&quot; and think of sheaf cohomology as a functor from the abelian category of sheaves on &quot;X&quot; to abelian groups. Start with the functor taking a sheaf &quot;E&quot; on &quot;X&quot; to its abelian group of global sections over &quot;X&quot;, &quot;E&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). This functor is left exact, but not necessarily right exact. Grothendieck defined sheaf cohomology groups to be the right derived functors of the left exact functor &quot;E&quot; ↦ &quot;E&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

That definition suggests various generalizations. For example, one can define the cohomology of a topological space &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in any complex of sheaves, earlier called hypercohomology (but usually now just &quot;cohomology&quot;). From that point of view, sheaf cohomology becomes a sequence of functors from the derived category of sheaves on &quot;X&quot; to abelian groups.

In a broad sense of the word, &quot;cohomology&quot; is often used for the right derived functors of a left exact functor on an abelian category, while &quot;homology&quot; is used for the left derived functors of a right exact functor. For example, for a ring &quot;R&quot;, the Tor groups Tor&quot;i&quot;&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;N&quot;) form a &quot;homology theory&quot; in each variable, the left derived functors of the tensor product &quot;M&quot;⊗&quot;R&quot;&quot;N&quot; of &quot;R&quot;-modules. Likewise, the Ext groups Ext&quot;i&quot;&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;N&quot;) can be viewed as a &quot;cohomology theory&quot; in each variable, the right derived functors of the Hom functor Hom&quot;R&quot;(&quot;M&quot;,&quot;N&quot;).

Sheaf cohomology can be identified with a type of Ext group. Namely, for a sheaf &quot;E&quot; on a topological space &quot;X&quot;, &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) is isomorphic to Ext&quot;i&quot;(Z&quot;X&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), where Z&quot;X&quot; denotes the constant sheaf associated with the integers Z, and Ext is taken in the abelian category of sheaves on &quot;X&quot;.

== Cohomology of varieties ==
There are numerous machines built for computing the cohomology of algebraic varieties. The simplest case being the determination of cohomology for smooth projective varieties over a field of characteristic formula_160. Tools from Hodge theory, called Hodge structures, help give computations of cohomology of these types of varieties (with the addition of more refined information). In the simplest case the cohomology of a smooth hypersurface in formula_161 can be determined from the degree of the polynomial alone.

When considering varieties over a finite field, or a field of characteristic formula_162, more powerful tools are required because the classical definitions of homology/cohomology break down. This is because varieties over finite fields will only be a finite set of points. Grothendieck came up with the idea for a Grothendieck topology and used sheaf cohomology over the étale topology to define the cohomology theory for varieties over a finite field. Using the étale topology for a variety over a field of characteristic formula_162 one can construct formula_164-adic cohomology for formula_165. This is defined as the projective limit

:formula_166

If we have a scheme of finite type

:formula_167

then there is an equality of dimensions for the Betti cohomology of formula_168 and the formula_164-adic cohomology of formula_170 whenever the variety is smooth over both fields. In addition to these cohomology theories there are other cohomology theories called Weil cohomology theories which behave similarly to singular cohomology. There is a conjectured theory of motives which underlie all of the Weil cohomology theories.
Another useful computational tool is the blowup sequence. Given a codimension formula_171 subscheme formula_172 there is a Cartesian square

:formula_173

From this there is an associated long exact sequence

:formula_174

If the subvariety formula_175 is smooth, then the connecting morphisms are all trivial, hence

:formula_176
==Axioms and generalized cohomology theories==
There are various ways to define cohomology for topological spaces (such as singular cohomology, Čech cohomology, Alexander–Spanier cohomology or sheaf cohomology). (Here sheaf cohomology is considered only with coefficients in a constant sheaf.) These theories give different answers for some spaces, but there is a large class of spaces on which they all agree. This is most easily understood axiomatically: there is a list of properties known as the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms, and any two constructions that share those properties will agree at least on all CW complexes. There are versions of the axioms for a homology theory as well as for a cohomology theory. Some theories can be viewed as tools for computing singular cohomology for special topological spaces, such as simplicial cohomology for simplicial complexes, cellular cohomology for CW complexes, and de Rham cohomology for smooth manifolds.

One of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms for a cohomology theory is the dimension axiom: if &quot;P&quot; is a single point, then &quot;Hi&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; ≠ 0. Around 1960, George W. Whitehead observed that it is fruitful to omit the dimension axiom completely: this gives the notion of a generalized homology theory or a generalized cohomology theory, defined below. There are generalized cohomology theories such as K-theory or complex cobordism that give rich information about a topological space, not directly accessible from singular cohomology. (In this context, singular cohomology is often called &quot;ordinary cohomology&quot;.)

By definition, a generalized homology theory is a sequence of functors &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; (for integers &quot;i&quot;) from the category of CW-pairs (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) (so &quot;X&quot; is a CW complex and &quot;A&quot; is a subcomplex) to the category of abelian groups, together with a natural transformation called the boundary homomorphism (here &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1(&quot;A&quot;) is a shorthand for &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1(&quot;A&quot;,∅)). The axioms are:

# Homotopy: If formula_177 is homotopic to formula_178, then the induced homomorphisms on homology are the same.
# Exactness: Each pair (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) induces a long exact sequence in homology, via the inclusions and : formula_179
# Excision: If &quot;X&quot; is the union of subcomplexes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, then the inclusion &quot;f&quot;: (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) induces an isomorphism formula_180 for every &quot;i&quot;.
# Additivity: If (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) is the disjoint union of a set of pairs (&quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;A&quot;&quot;α&quot;), then the inclusions (&quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;A&quot;&quot;α&quot;) → (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) induce an isomorphism from the direct sum: formula_181 for every &quot;i&quot;.

The axioms for a generalized cohomology theory are obtained by reversing the arrows, roughly speaking. In more detail, a generalized cohomology theory is a sequence of contravariant functors &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; (for integers &quot;i&quot;) from the category of CW-pairs to the category of abelian groups, together with a natural transformation called the boundary homomorphism (writing &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) for &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;A&quot;,∅)). The axioms are:

# Homotopy: Homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism on cohomology.
# Exactness: Each pair (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) induces a long exact sequence in cohomology, via the inclusions &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;X&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: (&quot;X&quot;,∅) → (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;): formula_182
# Excision: If &quot;X&quot; is the union of subcomplexes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, then the inclusion &quot;f&quot;: (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;) → (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) induces an isomorphism formula_183 for every &quot;i&quot;.
# Additivity: If (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) is the disjoint union of a set of pairs (&quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;A&quot;&quot;α&quot;), then the inclusions (&quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;A&quot;&quot;α&quot;) → (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) induce an isomorphism to the product group: formula_184 for every &quot;i&quot;.

A spectrum determines both a generalized homology theory and a generalized cohomology theory. A fundamental result by Brown, Whitehead, and Adams says that every generalized homology theory comes from a spectrum, and likewise every generalized cohomology theory comes from a spectrum. This generalizes the representability of ordinary cohomology by Eilenberg–MacLane spaces.

A subtle point is that the functor from the stable homotopy category (the homotopy category of spectra) to generalized homology theories on CW-pairs is not an equivalence, although it gives a bijection on isomorphism classes; there are nonzero maps in the stable homotopy category (called phantom maps) that induce the zero map between homology theories on CW-pairs. Likewise, the functor from the stable homotopy category to generalized cohomology theories on CW-pairs is not an equivalence. It is the stable homotopy category, not these other categories, that has good properties such as being triangulated.

If one prefers homology or cohomology theories to be defined on all topological spaces rather than on CW complexes, one standard approach is to include the axiom that every weak homotopy equivalence induces an isomorphism on homology or cohomology. (That is true for singular homology or singular cohomology, but not for sheaf cohomology, for example.) Since every space admits a weak homotopy equivalence from a CW complex, this axiom reduces homology or cohomology theories on all spaces to the corresponding theory on CW complexes.

Some examples of generalized cohomology theories are:
* Stable cohomotopy groups formula_185 The corresponding homology theory is used more often: stable homotopy groups formula_186
* Various different flavors of cobordism groups, based on studying a space by considering all maps from it to manifolds: unoriented cobordism formula_187 oriented cobordism formula_188 complex cobordism formula_189 and so on. Complex cobordism has turned out to be especially powerful in homotopy theory. It is closely related to formal groups, via a theorem of Daniel Quillen.
* Various different flavors of topological K-theory, based on studying a space by considering all vector bundles over it: formula_190 (real periodic K-theory), formula_191 (real connective K-theory), formula_192 (complex periodic K-theory), formula_193 (complex connective K-theory), and so on.
* Brown–Peterson cohomology, Morava K-theory, Morava E-theory, and other theories built from complex cobordism.
* Various flavors of elliptic cohomology.
Many of these theories carry richer information than ordinary cohomology, but are harder to compute.

A cohomology theory &quot;E&quot; is said to be multiplicative if formula_194 has the structure of a graded ring for each space &quot;X&quot;. In the language of spectra, there are several more precise notions of a ring spectrum, such as an &quot;E&quot;∞ ring spectrum, where the product is commutative and associative in a strong sense.

<text>Francesco Bernardi (; 31 October 1686 – 27 November 1758), known as Senesino ( ), was an Italian contralto castrato, particularly remembered today for his long collaboration with the composer George Frideric Handel. He was also involved in a public scandal with the soprano Anastasia Robinson in 1724 which was circulated widely by the satirist Jonathan Swift, and inspired a number of anonymously written obscene, misogynistic, and at times sexually subversive epistles written between 1724 and 1736 which have become a topic of study among scholars of Restoration literature.

==Early life and career==
Senesino was the son of a barber from Siena (hence his stage-name). He joined the cathedral choir there in 1695 and was castrated at the comparatively late age of thirteen. His debut was at Venice in 1707, and during the next decade he acquired a European reputation and, by the time he sang in Lotti&#x27;s &quot;Giove in Argo&quot; in 1717 at Dresden, a commensurately enormous salary.

As with many castrati, reports of Senesino&#x27;s acting were not always positive, to say the least. The impresario Count Francesco Zambeccari wrote of his performance in Naples in 1715: &quot;Senesino continues to comport himself badly enough; he stands like a statue, and when occasionally he does make a gesture, he makes one directly the opposite of what is wanted.&quot; Of the singer&#x27;s vocal abilities, however, there was no doubt. In 1719, the composer Quantz heard him in Lotti&#x27;s &quot;Teofane&quot; at Dresden, and stated: &quot;He had a powerful, clear, equal and sweet contralto voice, with a perfect intonation and an excellent shake. His manner of singing was masterly and his elocution unrivalled. … he sang allegros with great fire, and marked rapid divisions, from the chest, in an articulate and pleasing manner. His countenance was well adapted to the stage, and his action was natural and noble. To these qualities he joined a majestic figure; but his aspect and deportment were more suited to the part of a hero than of a lover.&quot;

==Senesino and Handel==
Following a dispute with the court composer Johann David Heinichen in 1720, over an aria in the opera &quot;Flavio Crispo&quot;, which led to his dismissal, Senesino was engaged by Handel as &quot;primo uomo&quot; (lead male singer) in his company, the Royal Academy of Music. He made his first appearance in a revival of &quot;Radamisto&quot; on 28 December, and his salary was variously reported as between £2000 and 3000 guineas: both vast sums. Senesino remained in London for much of the succeeding sixteen years. He became a friend and associate of many in the highest levels of society. He became friendly with, among others, the Duke of Chandos, Lord Burlington and the landscape designer William Kent, while amassing a fine collection of paintings, rare books, scientific instruments, and other treasures, including a service of silver made by the famous Paul de Lamerie.

Though creating seventeen leading roles for Handel (including &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, &quot;Orlando&quot;, and Bertarido in &quot;Rodelinda&quot;), his relationship with the composer was frequently stormy: &quot;The one was perfectly refractory; the other was equally outrageous,&quot; according to the contemporary historian Mainwaring. After the break-up of Handel&#x27;s Royal Academy in 1728, Senesino sang in Paris (1728) and Venice (1729), but was re-engaged by Handel in 1730, singing in four more new operas and in the oratorios &quot;Esther&quot;, &quot;Deborah&quot;, and, in its 1732 bilingual version, &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;. His antipathy to Handel eventually became so great that, in 1733, Senesino joined the rival Opera of the Nobility. Thus he came to sing alongside the great soprano castrato Farinelli, and their meeting on stage (in the pasticcio &quot;Artaserse&quot;) led to a famous anecdote of Senesino breaking character, as reported by the music historian Charles Burney. 

Both Senesino and Farinelli also appeared in Nicola Porpora&#x27;s opera &quot;Polifemo&quot; in 1735.

==Senesino and scandal with Anastasia Robinson==
In February 1724 a scandal involving Senesino and the soprano Anastasia Robinson erupted which had long-lasting impact on the singers, but most especially Robinson. While the exact details of the initial incident are not known, scholars suspect that the incident occurred during a performance of Attilio Ariosti&#x27;s &quot;Vespasiano e Artaserse&quot; which had its world premiere earlier on January 14, 1724. In this opera, Robinson&#x27;s character Gesilla embraces Senesino&#x27;s character Titus while they share mutual sentiments of love. The incident in question involved a public altercation of some kind in which Robinson accused Senesino of being too sexually forward in his acting, and Senesino responding with some sort of insulting remarks that attacked her virtue and beauty. This in turn led to Robinson&#x27;s husband, Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough, to come to her defense. The Earl, however, was not publicly known to be Robinson&#x27;s husband, as they had secretly married in c. 1722–1723, and given Robinson&#x27;s lower social status as a stage performer he refused to publicly acknowledge her as his wife. Thus society widely believed Robinson was the Earl&#x27;s mistress.

The event of this public exchange between Senesino, Robinson, and the Earl became topical fodder for the Irish satirist Jonathan Swift who circulated the story. The subject was widely gossiped about in English society, and Robinson in particular was labeled a hypocrite for complaining of sexual impropriety while simultaneously being the Earl&#x27;s mistress. Swift&#x27;s writing in turn inspired the creation of a number of obscene, misogynistic, and at times sexually subversive epistles written about Robinson, Senesino, the Earl of Peterborough, and the castrato Farinelli between 1724 and 1736. These satyrical epistles were penned by anonymous authors, and were written from the perspective of one of the individuals involved in the scandal. The first of these was &quot;An Epistle from Senesino to Anastasia Robinson&quot; which was dated 17 February 1724. Soon after, the dramatist Aaron Hill in his literary periodical &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; published a response to this letter entitled &quot;An Answer from Mrs. Robinson&quot;. Thus began a chain of literary epistles that extended over a twelve year period. These epistles have become a subject of study by scholars of Restoration literature.

==Return to Italy and retirement==
Senesino left England in 1736, and appeared in a few more productions in Italy: he sang at Florence from 1737 to 1739, and then in Naples until 1740, making his final appearance in Porpora&#x27;s &quot;Il trionfo di Camilla&quot; at the Teatro San Carlo. By this time his singing style was regarded by the public as rather old-fashioned. He retired to the city of his birth, building a fine town-house there, filled with English furniture and effects - he enjoyed tea (he ran, or at least tried to run his whole household on English lines), and kept a black servant, a pet monkey and a parrot. A somewhat eccentric and difficult personality, the latter years of his life were plagued by disputes with members of his family, particularly his nephew and heir, Giuseppe.

<text>Theodore von Kármán ( , May 11, 1881May 6, 1963) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, aerospace engineer, and physicist who worked in aeronautics and astronautics. He was responsible for crucial advances in aerodynamics characterizing supersonic and hypersonic airflow. The human-defined threshold of outer space is named the &quot;Kármán line&quot; in recognition of his work. Kármán is regarded as an outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Theodore von Kármán was born into a Jewish family in Budapest, then part of Austria-Hungary, as Kármán Tódor, the son of Helene (Konn or Kohn, ) and . Among his ancestors were Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, who was said to be the creator of the Golem of Prague, and Rabbi , who wrote about Zohar. His father, Mór, was a well-known educator, who reformed the Hungarian school system and founded Minta Gymnasium in Budapest. He became an influential figure and became a commissioner of the Ministry of Education, and was responsible for &quot;planning an education of a young archduke, the Emperor&#x27;s cousin&quot;. In 1907 Mór Karman was ennobled, Theodore later described it:

To receive a predicate of nobility, my father had to be landed. Fortunately he owned a small vineyard near Budapest, so the Emperor bestowed upon him the predicate &quot;von Szőllőskislaki&quot; (small grape). I have shortened it to von, for even to me, a Hungarian, the full title is almost unpronounceable.

Theodore had three brothers (among them ) and one sister, Josephine. At age six, he could &quot;perform large mental calculations&quot;, for example multiplication of six-digit numbers. Father discouraged Theodore&#x27;s mathematical education, he was afraid that his son would be a child prodigy and a freak. He was tutored by his father and his father&#x27;s former student; later he entered the Minta Gymnasium in Budapest. He won Eötvös Prize &quot;for the best student in mathematics and science in the whole of Hungary&quot; in his last year at Minta.

He studied engineering at the city&#x27;s Royal Joseph Technical University (Budapest University of Technology and Economics). He graduated in 1902 with a degree in mechanical engineering, his thesis was &quot;The motion of a heavy rod supported on its rounded end by a horizontal plane&quot;. He then served a year as an artillery cadet in the Austro-Hungarian army. In 1903-1906 he worked as an assistant at the Royal Joseph Technical University. In 1906 he moved to the German Empire and joined Ludwig Prandtl at the University of Göttingen, where he received his doctorate in 1908, for his research on &quot;mathematical models for the buckling of large structures&quot;. He taught at Göttingen for four years. In 1913 he accepted a position as director of the Aeronautical Institute at RWTH Aachen University, a leading German university. His time at RWTH Aachen was interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army from 1915 to 1918, during World War I, when he designed the Petróczy-Kármán-Žurovec, an early helicopter.

After the war, in 1919, he returned to Aachen with his mother and sister Josephine. Some of his students took an interest in gliding and saw the competitions of the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft as an opportunity to advance in aeronautics. Kármán engaged Wolfgang Klemperer to design a competitive glider.

Josephine encouraged her brother Theodore to expand his science beyond national boundaries. They organized the first international conference in mechanics held in September 1922 in Innsbruck. Subsequent conferences were organized as the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.

In 1926, Karman was first invited to the USA by the California Institute of Technology to build a wind tunnel. In 1930 he was invited for a position of a full-time director of the Aeronautical Laboratory at California Institute of Technology; his mother and sister, Josephine, also moved to California.

== Emigration and JPL ==

Apprehensive about developments in Europe regarding Nazism, in 1930 Kármán accepted the directorship of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT). The directorship included provision for a research assistant, and he selected Frank Wattendorf, an American who had been studying for three years in Aachen.

Another student Ernest Edwin Sechler took up the problem of making reliable airframes for aircraft, and with Kármán&#x27;s support, developed an understanding of aeroelasticity.

In 1936, Kármán engaged the legal services of Andrew G. Haley to form the Aerojet Corporation, with his graduate student Frank Malina and their experimental rocketry collaborators Jack Parsons and Edward Forman to manufacture JATO rocket motors. Kármán later became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 1940, Kármán was selected by John M. Carmody, Administrator of the Federal Works Agency to be on the Board of Engineers tasked with investigating the November 7, 1940, collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge outside Tacoma, Washington. His expertise was instrumental in discovering the effect of aerodynamic forces on the bridge, causing its unusual &quot;galloping&quot; behavior and eventual collapse. Along with Civil Engineers Othmar Amman and Glenn B. Woodruff, he published the report &quot;The Failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge&quot; on March 28, 1941.

German activity during World War II increased US military interest in rocket research. In early 1943, the Experimental Engineering Division of the United States Army Air Forces Material Command forwarded to Kármán reports from British intelligence sources describing German rockets capable of travelling more than 100 miles (160 km). In a letter dated August 2, 1943, Kármán provided the Army with his analysis of and comments on the German program.

In 1944 he and others affiliated with GALCIT founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is now a federally funded research and development center managed and operated by Caltech under a contract from NASA. In 1946 he became the first chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group which studied aeronautical technologies for the United States Army Air Forces. He also helped found AGARD, the NATO aerodynamics research oversight group (1951), the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences (1956), the International Academy of Astronautics (1960), and the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Sint-Genesius-Rode, south of Brussels (1956).

He eventually became an important figure in supersonic motion, noting in a seminal paper that aeronautical engineers were &quot;pounding hard on the closed door leading into the field of supersonic motion.&quot;

== Last years ==
In June 1944, von Kármán underwent surgery for intestinal cancer in New York City. The surgery caused two hernias, and Kármán&#x27;s recovery was slow. Early in September, while still in New York, he met US Army Air Forces Commanding General Henry H. Arnold on a runway at LaGuardia Airport, and Arnold then proposed that Kármán should move to Washington, D.C., to lead the Scientific Advisory Group and become a long-range planning consultant to the military. Kármán returned to Pasadena around mid-September, was appointed to the SAG position on October 23, 1944, and left Caltech in December 1944.

At the age of 81 Kármán was the recipient of the first National Medal of Science, bestowed in a White House ceremony by President John F. Kennedy. He was recognized, &quot;For his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics; for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics, for his distinguished counsel to the Armed Services, and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering.&quot;

Kármán never married. He died on a trip to Aachen, West Germany, in 1963, five days short of his 82nd birthday, and his body was returned to the United States to be entombed in the Beth Olam Mausoleum at what is now the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. He has sometimes been described as one of The Martians.

Kármán&#x27;s fame was in the use of mathematical tools to study fluid flow, and the interpretation of those results to guide practical designs. He was instrumental in recognizing the importance of swept-back wings ubiquitous in modern jet aircraft.

== Selected contributions ==
Specific contributions include theories of non-elastic buckling, unsteady wakes in circum-cylinder flow, stability of laminar flow, turbulence, airfoils in steady and unsteady flow, boundary layers, and supersonic aerodynamics. He made additional contributions in other fields, including elasticity, vibration, heat transfer, and crystallography. His name also appears in a number of concepts, for example:

===Autobiography===
Four years after Kármán died his autobiography &quot;The Wind and Beyond&quot; was published by Lee Edson with Little, Brown and Company. Seven major academic journals then followed with book reviews by noted authors: As the book was non-technical, written for the general reader, Thomas P. Hughes cited that as problematic given the technical context of Kármán&#x27;s work. Hughes conceded that Kármán &quot;exhibited a genius for finding the simplifying assumptions that made possible the mathematical analysis.&quot; While acknowledging Kármán&#x27;s gifts as an applied mathematician and teacher, Stanley Corrsin points out that the autobiography is &quot;marriage between a man and his ego.&quot; In the later part of his life, Kármán was a &quot;planner of global symposia and societies&quot; and a &quot;consultant to the upper echelons of the Pentagon corps.&quot;

On creativity, Kármán wrote &quot;the finest creative thought comes not out of organized teams but out of the quiet of one&#x27;s own world.&quot; In his review I. B. Holley noted &quot;penetrating insights into the creative process, its ingredients, nurture and exploitation.&quot; According to Holley, Kármán was given to &quot;convivial drinking and the company of beautiful women.&quot;

An enthusiastic review by J. Kestin advised readers to buy and study the book, and prize it as a reference. On the other hand, Charles Süsskind faults Kármán for his contempt for the conventional (gaminarie). Süsskind expected the book to show some reaction to Wernher von Braun&#x27;s coming to America, and some clarification of the Hsue-shen Tsien affair, rather than &quot;lapses into generalities&quot;. Süsskind also tags Kármán as a militarist: a &quot;forthright engineer who is quite unabashed about his lifelong association with military authorities in whatever country he happened to reside at the time.&quot;

Sydney Goldstein, who also wrote the Royal Society memoir for Kármán, reviewed the autobiography and remembered &quot;an eminent engineer and scientist, warm-hearted and witty, much traveled, well-known by many, devoted to international collaboration, who, in his own words, as a scientist found the military &#x27;the most comfortable group to deal with&#x27;&quot;.

<text>The svenska riksdaler () was the name of a Swedish coin first minted in 1604. Between 1777 and 1873, it was the currency of Sweden. The daler, like the dollar, was named after the German Thaler. The similarly named Reichsthaler, rijksdaalder, and rigsdaler were used in Germany and Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, and Denmark-Norway, respectively. &quot;Riksdaler&quot; is still used as a colloquial term for krona, Sweden&#x27;s modern-day currency.

==History==

===Penning accounting system===
The &quot;daler&quot; was introduced in 1534. It was initially intended for international use and was divided into 4 marks and then a mark is further subdivided into 8 öre and then an öre is further subdivided into 24 pennings. In 1604, the name was changed to &quot;riksdaler&quot; (&quot;daler of the realm&quot;, c.f. Reichsthaler). In 1609, the riksdaler rose to a value of 6 mark when the other Swedish coins were debased but the riksdaler remained constant.

From 1624, daler were issued in copper as well as silver. Because of the low value of copper, large plate money (&quot;plåtmynt&quot;) was issued. These were rectangular pieces of copper weighing in some cases several kilograms, with the largest one worth 10 daler and weighing almost ). They circulated until 1776. As silver became scarce, the silver daler rose in value relative to the copper daler, with the exchange rate between the two eventually being set at a ratio of three to one. Denominations in copper money were marked K.M. or KMT, with S.M. or SMT denoting silver money.

The cumbersome size and weight of plate money eventually prompted Sweden to become the first country in Europe to issue banknotes. These were issued by Stockholms Banco in 1661. The notes lost much of their value due to over production but succeeded in alleviating the immediate problem. They were issued until 1667. In 1681, the silver daler was debased, so that one riksdaler became equal to two silver dalers. A further debasement in 1712 resulted in one riksdaler equalling three silver daler. At the end of July 1768 the heavy plate money was abolished but reintroduced on 4 August out of need.

===Riksdaler accounting system===

In 1776, a new currency system was announced, which came into use at the beginning of 1777. The new currency was based on the riksdaler subdivided into 48 &quot;skilling&quot; (worth two old öre, sometimes spelled &quot;schilling&quot; with the plural &quot;schillingar&quot;), with each skilling further subdivided into 12 &quot;rundstycken&quot;. Pre-existing copper coins were halved in value and only the most recent silver coins retained their face values.

The new currency was issued in banknotes (fiat money) and silver and copper coins. At first, only the Riksens Ständers Wexel-Banco (the Bank of the Riksdag of the Estates) could issue banknotes but, in 1789, the Riksgälds Kontor (Swedish National Debt Office) was established and given the right to issue its own banknotes. The &quot;riksdaler specie&quot; was minted in silver, the &quot;riksdaler banco&quot; was issued by the Bank and the &quot;riksdaler riksgälds&quot; was issued by the Debt Office. Both the Bank and Debt Office issued copper coins.

The riksdaler specie was minted in 25.5 g fine silver and corresponded to the Reichsthaler specie (or &quot;rigsdaler specie&quot;) used in the rest of Scandinavia and Northern Germany. In contrast, the banknotes suffered heavily from a seigniorage induced inflation. In 1803, the values of the two paper moneys were tied, with 1 riksdaler banco = riksdaler riksgälds. In 1830, the exchange rate to the silver coinage was also fixed, with 1 riksdaler specie = riksdaler banco = 4 riksdaler riksgälds. The value of the copper coins of the Riksens Ständers Wexel-Banco fell (relative to silver) in line with the bank&#x27;s paper money. Thus, from 1830, there were 128 bank skilling to the riksdaler specie and these became the new standard subdivision of the riksdaler specie in 1834, carrying the name &quot;skilling banco&quot;.

===Coins===
In the 1770s, before the introduction of the new currency, coins were being issued in denominations of 1 öre K.M., 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 öre S.M., 1 and 2 daler S.M. and 1 riksdaler.

After the reform of 1777, silver coins were issued in denominations of , , , , and 1 riksdaler. The Riksgäldskontoret issued and skilling tokens (&quot;pollet&quot;) between 1799 and 1802, followed by issues of the Riksens Ständers Wexel-Banco in denominations of , , and 1 skilling from 1802.

In 1830, following the fixing of the relationship between the copper and silver coinages and the various paper money issues, copper skilling were introduced, together with a new silver coinage in denominations of , , and riksdaler. The new silver coins were all struck in .750 fineness and were weight related. Production of skilling, , and riksdaler ceased.

In 1835, a new copper coinage was introduced, consisting of , , , 1 and 2 skilling banco, along with silver riksdaler pieces. Production of the riksdaler ceased. Copper 4 skilling coins were introduced in 1849, followed by silver riksdaler in 1851. These last two coins, which were equal in value, were only minted until 1855 and 1853, respectively.

===Banknotes===

Between 1661 and 1667, Stockholms Banco issued notes in a large range of denominations of riksdaler specie (50 up to 1000), silver daler (50 up to 1000) and copper daler ( up to 1000). Paper money production resumed in 1701, with issued from the Kongliga (later Riksens) Ständers Wexel-Banco. Many of these notes had the value written in by hand at the time of issue. Printed denominations were 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36 copper daler (daler KMT).

In 1777, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 2 and 3 riksdaler, although notes with hand written amounts continued to be issued until 1836. In 1802, smaller denominations of 8, 12 and 16 schillingar were introduced, followed by notes for 10 and 14 skillingar in 1803.

The Riksgälds Kontor introduced notes with handwritten denominations in 1790. Printed denominations of 12, 16 and 24 schillingar, 1, 2 and 5 riksdaler were introduced in 1791, followed by 10, 50 and 100 riksdaler in 1816. The Riksgälds Kontor ceased printing paper money in 1834.

From 1834, the Riksens Ständers Wexel-Bank issued notes for 8, 12 and 16 schillingar banco and 2 and 3 riksdaler banco. The schillingar banco notes were issued until 1849 but the riksdaler notes were only issued until 1836.

Between 1835 and 1836, the Rikes Ständers Bank introduced notes in denominations of 32 skilling banco, 2, , 10, , , 100 and 500 riksdaler banco. The notes were also marked with the denominations in riksdaler riksgälds (1, 3, 10, 15, 25, 50, 150 and 750) and riksdaler specie (, , , , , , and ). The last of these notes were produced in 1857.

===Decimal system from 1855===

In 1855 two reforms took place, the introduction a decimal system, and a switch in the main currency unit from &quot;banco&quot; to &quot;riksgälds&quot; (which was renamed as the &quot;riksdaler riksmynt&quot;). One riksdaler specie was equal to 4 riksdaler riksmynt, each of which was divided into 100 &quot;öre&quot;.

The reforms of 1855 introduced a new coinage, consisting of bronze , 1, 2 and 5 öre, silver 10, 25 and 50 öre, 1 and 2 riksdaler riksmynt and 1 riksdaler specie. The silver coins retained the .750 fineness of the preceding issues, causing the 10 öre coin to weigh just 0.85 grams.

From 1858, the Rikes Ständers Bank issued banknotes for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 riksdaler riksmynt. Production of these notes was taken over by Sveriges Riksbank in 1869, with the notes issued until 1873.

The Scandinavian Monetary Union replaced the riksdaler riksmynt in 1873 with a new currency, the krona. An equal valued krone/krona of the monetary union replaced the three Scandinavian currencies at the rate of 1 krone/krona = Danish rigsdaler = Norwegian speciedaler = 1 Swedish riksdaler riksmynt.

<doc id="194068" wikidata="Q540649" url="?curid=194068" title="Blue-ringed octopus">
<text>Blue-ringed octopuses, comprising the genus Hapalochlaena, are four extremely venomous species of octopus that are found in tide pools and coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian oceans, from Japan to Australia. They can be identified by their yellowish skin and characteristic blue and black rings that can change color dramatically when the animal is threatened. They eat small crustaceans, including crabs, hermit crabs, shrimp, and other small sea animals.

They are one of the world&#x27;s most venomous marine animals. Despite their small size——and relatively docile nature, they are very dangerous if provoked when handled because their venom contains a powerful neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin.

The species tends to have a lifespan of approximately two to three years. This may vary depending on factors such as nutrition, temperature, and the intensity of light within its environment.

== Classification ==
The genus was described by British zoologist Guy Coburn Robson in 1929. There are four confirmed species of &quot;Hapalochlaena&quot;, and six possible but still undescribed species being researched:
* Greater blue-ringed octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena lunulata&quot;)
* Southern blue-ringed octopus or lesser blue-ringed octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena maculosa&quot;)
* Blue-lined octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena fasciata&quot;)
* &quot;Hapalochlaena nierstraszi&quot; was documented and described in 1938 from a single specimen found in the Bay of Bengal, with a second specimen caught and described in 2013.

== Behavior ==
Blue-ringed octopuses spend most of their time hiding in crevices while displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells. Like all octopuses, they can change shape easily, which allows them to squeeze into crevices much smaller than themselves. This, along with piling up rocks outside the entrance to its lair, helps safeguard the octopus from predators.

If they are provoked, they quickly change color, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50–60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second as an aposematic warning display. In the greater blue-ringed octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena lunulata&quot;), the rings contain multi-layer light reflectors called iridophores. These are arranged to reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction. Beneath and around each ring are dark pigmented chromatophores which can be expanded within 1 second to enhance the contrast of the rings. There are no chromatophores above the ring, which is unusual for cephalopods as they typically use chromatophores to cover or spectrally modify iridescence. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved by using muscles which are under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the iridescence is exposed, thereby revealing the blue color.

Similar to other Octopoda, the blue-ringed octopus swims by expelling water from a funnel in a form of jet propulsion.

=== Feeding ===
The blue-ringed octopus feeds on fish and crustaceans. It pounces on its prey, seizing it with its arms and pulling it towards its mouth. It uses its horny beak to pierce through the tough crab or shrimp exoskeleton, releasing its venom. The venom paralyzes the muscles required for movement, which effectively kills the prey.

== Reproduction ==
The mating ritual for the blue-ringed octopus begins when a male approaches a female and begins to caress her with his modified arm, the hectocotylus. A male mates with a female by grabbing her, which sometimes completely obscures the female&#x27;s vision, then transferring sperm packets by inserting his hectocotylus into her mantle cavity repeatedly. Mating continues until the female has had enough, and in at least one species, the female has to remove the over-enthusiastic male by force. Males will attempt copulation with members of their own species regardless of sex or size, but interactions between males are most often shorter in duration and end with the mounting octopus withdrawing the hectocotylus without packet insertion or struggle.

Blue-ringed octopus females lay only one clutch of about 50 eggs in their lifetimes, towards the end of autumn. Eggs are laid and then incubated underneath the female&#x27;s arms for about six months. During this process, the female does not eat. After the eggs hatch, the female dies, and the new offspring will reach maturity and be able to mate by the next year.

=== Mating behavior ===
In the southern blue-ringed octopus, body mass is observed to be the strongest factor that influences copulatory rates. Evidence of female preference of larger males is apparent, although no male preference of females is shown. In this species, it is suggested that males expend more effort than females to initiate copulation. Additionally, it is unlikely that males use odor cues to identify females with which to mate. Male-male mounting attempts are common in &quot;H. maculosa&quot;, proposing that there is no discrimination between sex. Male blue-ringed octopus will adjust mating durations based on the female&#x27;s recent mating history. Termination of copulation is not likely to happen with a female if she has not yet mated with another male. Duration length of mating is also found to be longer in these cases as well.

== Toxicity ==
The blue-ringed octopus, despite its small size, carries enough venom to kill 26 adult humans within minutes. Their bites are tiny and often painless, with many victims not realizing they have been envenomated until respiratory depression and paralysis begins. No blue-ringed octopus antivenom is available.

=== Venom ===
The octopus produces venom containing tetrodotoxin, histamine, tryptamine, octopamine, taurine, acetylcholine, and dopamine. The venom can result in nausea, respiratory arrest, heart failure, severe and sometimes total paralysis, blindness, and can lead to death within minutes if not treated. Death is usually from suffocation due to paralysis of the diaphragm.

The venom is produced in the posterior salivary gland of the octopus by endosymbiotic bacteria. The salivary glands possess a tubuloacinar exocrine structure and are located in the intestinal blood space.

The major neurotoxin component of the blue-ringed octopus is a compound originally known as &quot;maculotoxin&quot;; in 1978, this maculotoxin was found to be tetrodotoxin, a neurotoxin also found in pufferfish, rough-skinned newts, and some poison dart frogs; the blue-ringed octopus is the first reported instance in which tetrodotoxin is used as a venom. Tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels, causing motor paralysis and respiratory arrest within minutes of exposure. The octopus&#x27;s own sodium channels are adapted to be resistant to tetrodotoxin.

Direct contact is necessary to be envenomated. Faced with danger, the octopus&#x27;s first instinct is to flee. If the threat persists, the octopus will go into a defensive stance, and display its blue rings. If the octopus is cornered and touched, it may bite and envenomate its attacker.

Estimates of the number of recorded human fatalities caused by blue-ringed octopuses vary, ranging from seven to sixteen deaths; most scholars agree that there have been at least eleven.

Tetrodotoxin can be found in nearly every organ and gland of its body. Even sensitive areas such as the Needham&#x27;s sac, branchial heart, nephridia, and gills have been found to contain tetrodotoxin, and it has no effect on the octopus&#x27;s normal functions. This may be possible through a unique blood transport. The mother will inject the neurotoxin (and perhaps the toxin-producing bacteria) into her eggs to make them generate their own venom before hatching.

=== Effects ===
Tetrodotoxin causes severe and often total body paralysis. Tetrodotoxin envenomation can result in victims being fully aware of their surroundings but unable to move. Because of the paralysis, they have no way of signaling for help or indicating distress. The victim remains conscious and alert in a manner similar to the effect of curare or pancuronium bromide. This effect is temporary and will fade over a period of hours as the tetrodotoxin is metabolized and excreted by the body.

The symptoms vary in severity, with children being the most at risk because of their small body size.

=== Treatment ===
First aid treatment is pressure on the wound and artificial respiration once the paralysis has disabled the victim&#x27;s respiratory muscles, which often occurs within minutes of being bitten. Because the venom primarily kills through paralysis, victims are frequently saved if artificial respiration is started and maintained before marked cyanosis and hypotension develop. Respiratory support until medical assistance arrives will improve the victim&#x27;s chances of survival. Definitive hospital treatment involves placing the patient on a ventilator until the toxin is removed by the body. Victims who survive the first 24 hours usually recover completely.

== Conservation ==
Currently, the blue-ringed octopus population information is listed as Least Concern according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, threats such as bioprospecting, habitat fragmentation, degradation, overfishing, and human disturbance, as well as species collections for aquarium trade, may be threats to population numbers. It is possible that &quot;Hapalochlaena&quot; contributes to a variety of advantages to marine conservation. This genera of octopus provides stability of habitat biodiversity as well as expanding the balance of marine food webs. Various species of blue-ringed octopus may help control populations of Asian date mussels. Additionally, future research on tetrodotoxins produced by the blue-ringed octopus may produce new medicinal discoveries.

== In popular culture ==
In the 1983 James Bond film &quot;Octopussy&quot;, the blue-ringed octopus is the prominent symbol of the secret order of female bandits and smugglers, appearing in an aquarium tank, on silk robes, and as a tattoo on women in the order. &quot;The Adventure Zone&quot; featured a blue-ringed octopus in its &quot;Petals to the Metal&quot; series.

<text>Collective action refers to action taken together by a group of people whose goal is to enhance their condition and achieve a common objective. It is a term that has formulations and theories in many areas of the social sciences including psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science and economics.

==The social identity model==
Researchers Martijn van Zomeren, Tom Postmes, and Russell Spears conducted a meta-analysis of over 180 studies of collective action, in an attempt to integrate three dominant socio-psychological perspectives explaining antecedent conditions to this phenomenon – injustice, efficacy, and identity. In their resultant 2008 review article, an integrative Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA) was proposed which accounts for interrelationships among the three predictors as well as their predictive capacities for collective action. An important assumption of this approach is that people tend to respond to subjective states of disadvantage, which may or may not flow from objective physical and social reality.

===Perceived injustice===
Examining collective action through perceived injustice was initially guided by relative deprivation theory (RDT). RDT focuses on a subjective state of unjust disadvantage, proposing that engaging in fraternal (group-based) social comparisons with others may result in feelings of relative deprivation that foster collective action. Group-based emotions resulting from perceived injustice, such as anger, are thought to motivate collective action in an attempt to rectify the state of unfair deprivation. The extent to which individuals respond to this deprivation involves several different factors and varies from extremely high to extremely low across different settings. Meta-analysis results confirm that effects of injustice causally predict collective action, highlighting the theoretical importance of this variable.

===Perceived efficacy===
Moving beyond RDT, scholars suggested that in addition to a sense of injustice, people must also have the objective, structural resources necessary to mobilize change through social protest. An important psychological development saw this research instead directed towards subjective expectations and beliefs that unified effort (collective action) is a viable option for achieving group-based goals – this is referred to as perceived collective efficacy. Empirically, collective efficacy is shown to causally affect collective action among a number of populations across varied contexts.

===Social identity===
Social identity theory (SIT) suggests that people strive to achieve and maintain positive social identities associated with their group memberships. Where a group membership is disadvantaged (for example, low status), SIT implicates three variables in the evocation of collective action to improve conditions for the group – permeability of group boundaries, legitimacy of the intergroup structures, and the stability of these relationships. For example, when disadvantaged groups perceive intergroup status relationships as illegitimate and unstable, collective action is predicted to occur, in an attempt to change status structures for the betterment of the disadvantaged group.

Meta-analysis results also confirm that social identity causally predicts collective action across a number of diverse contexts. Additionally, the integrated SIMCA affords another important role to social identity – that of a psychological bridge forming the collective base from which both collective efficacy and group injustice may be conceived.

===Model refinement===
While there is sound empirical support for the causal importance of SIMCA&#x27;s key theoretical variables on collective action, more recent literature has addressed the issue of reverse causation, finding support for a related, yet distinct, encapsulation model of social identity in collective action (EMSICA). This model suggests that perceived group efficacy and perceived injustice provide the basis from which social identity emerges, highlighting an alternative causal pathway to collective action. Recent research has sought to integrate SIMCA with intergroup contact theory (see Cakal, Hewstone, Schwär, &amp; Heath) and others have extended SIMCA through bridging morality research with the collective action literature (see van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears for a review).

Also, utopian thinking has been proposed as an antecendant to collective action, aside to the route affecting perceived injustice, efficacy, or social identity. Utopian thinking contributes to accessing cognitive alternatives, which are imagined models of societies that are different from the current society. Cognitive alternatives are proposed by many social identity theorists as an effective way to increase collective action. Moreover, utopian thinking has the potential to increase perceived injustice, perceived efficacy, or form new social identities and therefore affect collective action.

==Public good==
The economic theory of collective action is concerned with the provision of public goods (and other collective consumption) through the collaboration of two or more individuals, and the impact of externalities on group behavior. It is more commonly referred to as Public Choice. Mancur Olson&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups,&quot; is an important early analysis of the problems of public good cost.

Besides economics, the theory has found many applications in political science, sociology, communication, anthropology and environmentalism.

===Collective action problem===

The term collective action problem describes the situation in which multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action, but has an associated cost making it implausible that any individual can or will undertake and solve it alone. The ideal solution is then to undertake this as a collective action, the cost of which is shared. Situations like this include the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, a collective action problem in which no communication is allowed, the free rider problem, and the tragedy of the commons, also known as the problem with open access. An allegorical metaphor often used to describe the problem is &quot;belling the cat&quot;.

Solutions to collective action problems include mutually binding agreements, government regulation, privatisation, and assurance contracts, also known as crowdacting.

===Exploitation of the great by the small===
Mancur Olson made the claim that individual rational choice leads to situations where individuals with more resources will carry a higher burden in the provision of the public good than poorer ones. Poorer individuals will usually have little choice but to opt for the free rider strategy, i.e., they will attempt to benefit from the public good without contributing to its provision. This may also encourage the under-production (inefficient production) of the public good.

===Institutional design===
While public goods are often provided by governments, this is not always the case. Various institutional designs have been studied with the aim of reducing the collaborative failure. The best design for a given situation depends on the production costs, the utility function, and the collaborative effects, amongst other things. Here are only some examples:

====Joint products====
A joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good. For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be tied to a donation to a charity (public good).

It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).

====Clubs====
Some institutional design, e.g., intellectual property rights, can introduce an exclusion mechanism and turn a pure public good into an impure public good artificially.

If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the collaboration, clubs can emerge. James M. Buchanan showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.

A nation can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club.

====Federated structure====
In some cases, theory shows that collaboration emerges spontaneously in smaller groups rather than in large ones (see e.g. Dunbar&#x27;s number). This explains why labor unions or charities often have a federated structure.

==In philosophy==
Since the late 20th century, analytic philosophers have been exploring the nature of collective action in the sense of acting together, as when people paint a house together, go for a walk together, or together execute a pass play. These particular examples have been central for three of the philosophers who have made well known contributions to this literature: Michael Bratman, Margaret Gilbert, and John Searle, respectively.

In and subsequent articles and book chapters including Gilbert (2006, chapter 7), whom argues for an account of collective action according to which this rests on a special kind of interpersonal commitment, what Gilbert calls a &quot;joint commitment&quot;. A joint commitment in Gilbert&#x27;s sense is not a matter of a set of personal commitments independently created by each of the participants, as when each makes a personal decision to do something. Rather, it is a single commitment to whose creation each participant makes a contribution. Thus suppose that one person says &quot;Shall we go for a walk?&quot; and the other says &quot;Yes, let&#x27;s&quot;. Gilbert proposes that as a result of this exchange the parties are jointly committed to go for a walk, and thereby obligated to one another to act as if they were parts of a single person taking a walk. Joint commitments can be created less explicitly and through processes that are more extended in time. One merit of a joint commitment account of collective action, in Gilbert&#x27;s view, is that it explains the fact that those who are out on a walk together, for instance, understand that each of them is in a position to demand corrective action of the other if he or she acts in ways that affect negatively the completion of their walk. In she discusses the pertinence of joint commitment to collective actions in the sense of the theory of rational choice.

In Searle (1990) Searle argues that what lies at the heart of a collective action is the presence in the mind of each participant of a &quot;we-intention&quot;. Searle does not give an account of we-intentions or, as he also puts it, &quot;collective intentionality&quot;, but insists that they are distinct from the &quot;I-intentions&quot; that animate the actions of persons acting alone.

In Bratman (1993) Bratman proposed that, roughly, two people &quot;share an intention&quot; to paint a house together when each intends that the house is painted by virtue of the activity of each, and also intends that it is so painted by virtue of the intention of each that it is so painted. That these conditions obtain must also be &quot;common knowledge&quot; between the participants.

Discussion in this area continues to expand, and has influenced discussions in other disciplines including anthropology, developmental psychology, and economics. One general question is whether it is necessary to think in terms that go beyond the personal intentions of individual human beings properly to characterize what it is to act together. Bratman&#x27;s account does not go beyond such personal intentions. Gilbert&#x27;s account, with its invocation of joint commitment, does go beyond them. Searle&#x27;s account does also, with its invocation of collective intentionality. The question of whether and how one must account for the existence of mutual obligations when there is a collective intention is another of the issues in this area of inquiry.

==Spontaneous consensus==

In addition to the psychological mechanisms of collective action as explained by the social identity model, researchers have developed sociological models of why collective action exists and have studied under what conditions collective action emerges. Along this social dimension, a special case of the general collective action problem is one of collective agreement: how does a group of agents (humans, animals, robots, etc.) reach consensus about a decision or belief, in the absence of central organization? Common examples can be found from domains as diverse as biology (flocking, shoaling and schooling, and general collective animal behavior), economics (stock market bubbles), and sociology (social conventions and norms) among others.

Consensus is distinct from the collective action problem in that there often is not an explicit goal, benefit, or cost of action but rather it concerns itself with a social equilibrium of the individuals involved (and their beliefs). And it can be considered spontaneous when it emerges without the presence of a centralized institution among self-interested individuals.

===Dimensions===

Spontaneous consensus can be considered along 4 dimensions involving the social structure of the individuals participating (local versus global) in the consensus as well as the processes (competitive vs cooperative) involved in reaching consensus:

* Competitive
* Cooperative
* Local
* Global

====Competitive versus cooperative====

The underlying processes of spontaneous consensus can be viewed either as &quot;cooperation&quot; among individuals trying to coordinate themselves through their interactions or as &quot;competition&quot; between the alternatives or choices to be decided upon. Depending on the dynamics of the individuals involved as well as the context of the alternatives considered for consensus, the process can be wholly cooperative, wholly competitive, or a mix of the two.

====Local versus global====

The distinction between local and global consensus can be viewed in terms of the social structure underlying the network of individuals participating in the consensus making process. &quot;Local consensus&quot; occurs when there is agreement between groups of neighboring nodes while &quot;global consensus&quot; refers to the state in which most of the population has reached an agreement. How and why consensus is reached is dependent on both the structure of the social network of individuals as well as the presence (or lack) of centralized institutions.

===Equilibrium mechanisms===

There are many mechanisms (social and psychological) that have been identified to underlie the consensus making process. They have been used to both explain the emergence of spontaneous consensus and understand how to facilitate an equilibrium between individuals and can be grouped according to their role in the process.

* Facilitation of Equilibrium
** Communication
** Punishment of Deviants
** Positive Payoffs
** Conformity Bias
* Selection of Alternatives
** Logical Reflection
** Psychological and shared biases
** Chance (when all alternatives are equivalent)

===Methods and techniques===

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of both the mechanisms as well as the applications of spontaneous consensus, a variety of techniques have been developed to study the emergence and evolution of spontaneous cooperation. Two of the most widely used are game theory and social network analysis.

====Game theory====

Traditionally game theory has been used to study zero-sum games but has been extended to many different types of games. Relevant to the study of spontaneous consensus are cooperative and non-cooperative games. Since a consensus must be reached without the presence of any external authoritative institution for it to be considered &quot;spontaneous&quot;, non-cooperative games and Nash equilibrium have been the dominant paradigm for which to study its emergence.

In the context of non-cooperative games, a consensus is a formal Nash equilibrium that all players tend towards through self-enforcing alliances or agreements.

An important case study of the underlying mathematical dynamics is the coordination game. Even when coordination is desired, it can be difficult to achieve due to incomplete information and constrained time horizons.

====Social network analysis====

An alternative approach to studying the emergence of spontaneous consensus—that avoids many of the unnatural or overly constrained assumptions of game theoretic models—is the use of network based methods and social network analysis (SNA). These SNA models are theoretically grounded in the communication mechanism of facilitating consensus and describe its emergence through the information propagation processes of the network (behavioral contagion). Through the spread of influence (and ideas) between agents participating in the consensus, local and global consensus can emerge if the agents in the network achieve a shared equilibrium state. Leveraging this model of consensus, researchers have shown that local peer influence can be used to reach a global consensus and cooperation across the entire network. While this model of consensus and cooperation has been shown to be successful in certain contexts, research suggest that communication and social influence cannot be fully captured by simple contagion models and as such a pure contagion based model of consensus may have limits.

<text>Gillian Wearing CBE, RA (born 10 December 1963) is an English conceptual artist, one of the Young British Artists, and winner of the 1997 Turner Prize. In 2007 Wearing was elected as lifetime member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Her statue of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett, popularly known as &quot;Hanging out the washing&quot;, stands in London&#x27;s Parliament Square.

From 5 November 2021 to 4 April 2022, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City showed &quot;Gillian Wearing: Wearing Masks&quot;, the first retrospective of Wearing&#x27;s work in North America.

==Early life==
Wearing was born in 1963 in Birmingham, England. She attended Dartmouth High School in Great Barr, Birmingham. She moved to Chelsea, London to study art at the Chelsea School of Art and squatted in Oval Mansions. In 1987 she attained a bachelor of technology degree in art and design and in 1990 she attained a BFA from Goldsmiths, University of London.

==Art practice==

Wearing is known for her method of documentation of everyday life through photography and video, concerning individual identity within the private and the public spaces, where Wearing blurs the line between reality and fiction. John Slyce has described Wearing&#x27;s method of representation as &quot;frame[ing] herself as she frames the other&quot;. Her work in photography and video at first appear like most other journalistic methods of documentation seen in television and documentaries, but after further examination it becomes apparent that they do not conform to mass-media conventions. Wearing&#x27;s work reveals that the camera does not take a neutral stance towards its object, but is rather a powerful mass-media organ that breaks down the divide between public and private. 
In the early 1990s, Wearing began putting together photography exhibitions where she worked with strangers. There is a recurring pattern in her work where she plays and mocks the idea of the artist as anthropologist, but her anthropological activities do not focus on discovering a foreign culture but instead challenges what we thought we already knew. Wearing sees that Anthropology &quot;attempts to compress human subjectivity into scientific objectivity&quot;. As John Slyce puts it: &quot;Gillian Wearing does not suffer the indignity of speaking for others.&quot;. How Wearing approaches her subjects then is by inviting the individual to include their own articulation of thought into the picture within the space that she has provided, rather than an objective documentation. In an interview with Donna De Salvo, Wearing states:

&quot;For me, one of the biggest problems with pure documentary photography is how the photographer, like the artist, engineers something to look like a certain kind of social statement—for instance, you can make someone look miserable, when this is just one side, a nuance of their personality. They might just be looking away at something, but their expression could be read as showing a kind of depression in their overall behavior. I couldn&#x27;t bear the idea of taking photographs of people without knowing&quot;.

===&quot;Signs that say what you want them to say and not Signs that say what someone else wants you to say&quot; (1992–1993)===
In her piece &quot;Signs that say what you want them to say and not Signs that say what someone else wants you to say&quot; (1992–1993), Wearing conducted a series of portraits wherein she approached strangers that she encountered on the street, and asked them to write what they were thinking about on a placard. Wearing stated that &quot;When they returned with something they had written, it challenged [her] own perception of them&quot;. Through this exercise, people of different backgrounds, religions, ages and social statuses become unified through the art practise as &quot;all of a sudden you have to start re-appraising people.&quot; The audience&#x27;s fantasies of imposing their own interpretations onto these photographed subjects are challenged and redirected by the paper that they are holding. This exchange between Wearing and the subjects she photographed transformed the typically alienating portrait photography practise into an intimate conversational piece, linking photographer with subject, and audience with photographer.

===Mask===
In Russell Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;Show Your Emotions&quot; he draws Wearing&#x27;s use of mask draws to an older tradition that runs back to at least as far as classical Greek tragedy: &quot;One in which the mask functions not so much to substitute one identity for another as to obliterate the superficial aspects of physical appearance in order to reveal more fundamental truths&quot;. In &quot;Confess all on video. Don&#x27;t worry you will be in disguise. Intrigued? Call Gillian&quot; (1994) is a 30-minute long video where Wearing recruited strangers through posting an ad in Time out magazine and provided a space where participants would confess their terrors and fantasies to the camera, their identity protected by costume masks. The mask is a reoccurring device in Wearing&#x27;s work and it functions as protection as well as an apparatus that empowers the wearer; by making their identities anonymous it allows them to express their identity without constraint. As the viewer, access to truth becomes dislocated. Wearing presents this fictitious nature of the work as a report. The use of masks also questions authenticity and how reality can be fabricated. as said by Doris Krystof:

&quot;Protected by masks, protected by their anonymity and protect by the free realm of art where their confessions are recorded but not judged, where there are no consequences to fear, no ideology or attempted appropriation to deal with, the participants could enjoy a sense of liberation and trust in their own voices.&quot;

&quot;Trauma&quot; (2000) is a further exploration of confessing with a mask. The eight participants confess their trauma and the mask that is given reflects the age when they suffered their trauma, with the intention of transporting the viewer back to &quot;the defining moment in the wearer&#x27;s lives&quot;. What&#x27;s intriguing about this piece is that it seems like that it&#x27;s not the first time that the participants have told their story because of how well rehearsed it looks. But that&#x27;s not the case, it might be that they have been reciting the trauma that they have experienced in their heads over many years.

In &quot;Homage to the woman with the bandaged face who I saw yesterday down Walworth Road&quot; (1995), Wearing covers her head with white bandages and walks around in public. This piece materialized after Wearing caught a glimpse of a woman she saw with a bandaged head while in her friend&#x27;s car. Wearing initially wanted to ask for permission to film the woman, although she decided to cover her own face with bandages and reenact what she had seen instead. Her walk was documented discreetly from behind and there was a hidden camera installed inside of the mask, capturing onlookers&#x27; horrid reactions. Krystof Doris contextualizes Wearing&#x27;s approach: &quot;The relationship between observer and observed is first established, then reversed, but always recounted from the perspective of the artist.&quot; In 2003-2006, Gillian Wearing recreated photographs of her relatives that were found in her family album. She created masks out of silicone of her mother, her father, her sister, her uncle, and a mask of herself with help from experts that were trained at Madam Tussauds in London. They start creating the mask in clay from a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional object. In an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; she explains that the process takes four months per mask, and how at first &quot;some people tried to direct me to use prosthetics, but I was adamant it had to be a mask, something that transforms me entirely, something that was not grotesque but real, like a trompe l&#x27;oeil&quot;. These expensive silicone masks deteriorate easily after use, turning the photo shoot into a performative act where the action is unrepeatable. This process becomes paradoxical because of the difficulties that are encountered while recreating these casual snapshots. This work references into the canonical work in the history of photography of Cindy Sherman, though Wearing has shifted the focus to exploring her own persona and its underlying relationships as a social construct. The works in Album then do not necessarily put the family members as the main focus; rather they capture Wearing&#x27;s engagement with the family members.

===Turner Prize===
&quot;&quot;60 Minutes Silence&quot; (1996)&quot; is the piece that won Wearing the Turner Prize in 1997. Wearing used a fixed camera and the length of the pose was long in duration, which resulted in an awkward personal moment. At first the image appears like a backlit group portrait of British police officers but after further examination the slight movements that they make reveals that it is in fact a video. In Krystof Doris&#x27; text &quot;Masks, Identity, and Performativity&quot; he explains that the power relation between the viewer and the viewed (the police officers) are reversed due to the disciplining scenario that Wearing placed upon the group of police officers. The individuality of each member begins to assert itself as the recording goes on and the officers conclusively become &quot;ordinary human beings&quot;.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Wearing started putting together photography exhibitions that were based around the idea of photographing anonymous strangers in the street who she had asked to hold up a piece of paper with a message on it. The series was named Signs That Say What You Want Them To Say and Not Signs That Say What Someone. Of these &quot;confessional&quot; pieces, Wearing stated, In 1994, Wearing created the provocative film &quot;Dancing in Peckham&quot;, where she recorded herself dancing in a busy South London shopping centre capturing the reactions of passers-by to explore the gap between public and private experience. 

One of Wearing&#x27;s first UK shows was held at the Chisenhale Gallery in east London, in June 1997.
In 1997, Wearing won the Turner Prize and exhibited videos such as &quot;60 minutes silence&quot; which is a video of 26 uniformed police officers, but at first appears to be a photograph. Wearing said, &quot;The piece is about authority, restraint, and control.&quot; She also exhibited &quot;Sacha and Mum&quot; showing emotions between a mother and daughter. Wearing described the piece as, &quot;Things can not be finalized—- as far as emotions are concerned. They&#x27;re always in turmoil and can go to two polar opposites.&quot; Cornelia Parker, Christine Borland and Angela Bulloch were the other shortlisted artists.

In the late 1990s, Wearing made a three-channel video called &quot;Drunk&quot; (1997-1999), for which she filmed a group of street drinkers who she had got to know outside her studio against the backdrop of a white photographic backdrop. The drinkers are shown in different scenes individually and in groups. They stagger around, fall over, bicker, fight, sleep and in the end one of the men stands against the backdrop and urinates.

===2000s===
In Wearing&#x27;s &quot;Broad Street&quot; (2001), she documents the behavior of typical teenagers in British society who go out at night and drink large amounts of alcohol. Wearing shows teenagers partying at various clubs and bars along Broad Street, Birmingham. Wearing follows these teenagers demonstrating how alcohol contributes to their loss of inhibitions, insecurities, and control.

In 2003, Wearing caused controversy with her cover for &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s G2 supplement, consisting solely of the handwritten words &quot;Fuck Cilla Black&quot;. The cover illustrated an article by Stuart Jeffries complaining about the cruelty of modern television.

The themes of modern television were further explored in Wearing&#x27;s project &quot;Family History&quot; (2006) commissioned by Film and Video Umbrella, and accompanied by a publication on the project.

===2010s===

Wearing&#x27;s 2010 show &quot;People (2005–2011)&quot; at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery included work ranging from video, to photographic portraiture, to installation and sculpture. &quot;Snapshot&quot; (2005) is a series of seven single-projection videos framed by a candy-colored array of plasma screens, each depicting different stages of the female life cycle—from the innocence of early childhood to old age.

Wearing also released her first feature film in this year: &quot;Self Made&quot;. Film theorist David Deamer writes that the film &#x27;is a paradox. And it is the nature of the paradox that gives the film its power [...] The paradox emerges indirectly, a consequence of the two modes of narration of the film. First mode: documentary. The participants – through their facilitator, Sam Rumbelow – explore the techniques of &quot;the method&quot;, method acting, which will allow them to encounter themselves anew and so generate their own &quot;self-made&quot; film. In this way each participant goes on to star in their own short, which, while encompassed by director Gillian Wearing&#x27;s documentary, appears as its own moment of narration. So, second mode: fiction&#x27;.

Wearing was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to art. In the same year, she was among the names in Blake Gopnik&#x27;s list &quot;The 10 Most Important Artists of Today&quot;.

In 2012, a major retrospective of her work was held at Whitechapel Gallery, London (March–June 2012), which surveyed her career and premiered new films and sculptures. The exhibition was organised with Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf and supported by Maja Hoffmann, Vicky Hughes and John Smith, and Dr Naomi Milgrom AO. An accompanying monograph was published by Ridinghouse and included texts by curator Daniel Herrmann, Doris Krystof, Bernhart Schwenk and David Deamer.

In 2013, Wearing showed her exhibit &quot;People: Selected Parkett Artists&#x27; Editions&quot; from 1984 to 2013 Parkett Space, Zurich, Switzerland (9 February-11 March 2013).

On 30 October 2014 her sculpture &quot;A Real Birmingham Family&quot; was unveiled in front of the Library of Birmingham.

On 24 April 2018, her statue of the suffragist Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in London&#x27;s Parliament Square; it is the first statue of a woman in Parliament Square. This makes Wearing the first woman to create a statue that is in Parliament Square.

=== 2020s ===
From November 5, 2021 to April 4, 2022, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City was showing &quot;Gillian Wearing: Wearing Masks&quot;, the first retrospective of Wearing&#x27;s work in North America.

<doc id="194085" wikidata="Q11824" url="?curid=194085" title="Sleeping Beauty">
<text>&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (, or The Beauty Sleeping in the Wood; , or &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;), also titled in English as &quot;The Sleeping Beauty in the Woods&quot;, is a fairy tale about a princess cursed by an evil fairy to sleep for a hundred years before being awakened by a handsome prince. A good fairy, knowing the princess would be frightened if alone when she wakes, uses her wand to put every living person and animal in the palace and forest asleep, to awaken when the princess does.

The earliest known version of the tale is found in the French narrative &quot;Perceforest&quot;, written between 1330 and 1344. Another was the Catalan poem &quot;Frayre de Joy e Sor de Paser&quot;. Giambattista Basile wrote another, &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot; for his collection &quot;Pentamerone&quot;, published posthumously in 1634–36 and adapted by Charles Perrault in &quot;Histoires ou contes du temps passé&quot; in 1697. The version collected and printed by the Brothers Grimm was one orally transmitted from the Perrault version, while including own attributes like the thorny rose hedge and the curse.

The Aarne-Thompson classification system for fairy tales lists &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; as a Type 410: it includes a princess who is magically forced into sleep and later woken, reversing the magic. The fairy tale has been adapted countless times throughout history and retold by modern storytellers across various media.

==Origin==
Early contributions to the tale include the medieval courtly romance &quot;Perceforest&quot; (). In this tale, a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her, and rapes her in her sleep. They conceive and when their child is born, the child draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring Troylus left her that he was the father, and Troylus later returns to marry her. Another early literary predecessor is the Provençal versified novel ().

The second part of the Sleeping Beauty tale, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death but instead are hidden, may have been influenced by Genevieve of Brabant. Even earlier influences come from the story of the sleeping Brynhild in the Volsunga saga and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian hagiography conventions. Following these early renditions, the tale was first published by Italian poet Giambattista Basile who lived from 1575 to 1632.

== Plot ==

The folktale begins with a princess whose parents are told by a wicked fairy that their daughter will die when she pricks her finger on a particular item. In Basile&#x27;s version, the princess pricks her finger on a piece of flax. In Perrault&#x27;s and the Grimm Brothers&#x27; versions, the item is a spindle. The parents rid the kingdom of these items in the hopes of protecting their daughter, but the prophecy is fulfilled regardless. Instead of dying, as was foretold, the princess falls into a deep sleep. After some time, she is found by a prince and is awakened. 

In Giambattista Basile&#x27;s version of Sleeping Beauty, &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot;, the sleeping beauty, Talia, falls into a deep sleep after getting a splinter of flax in her finger. She is discovered in her palace by a wandering king, who &quot;carrie[s] her to a bed, where he gather[s] the first fruits of love.&quot; He abandons her there after the assault and she later gives birth to twins while still unconscious.

According to Maria Tatar, there are versions of the story that include a second part to the narrative that details the couple&#x27;s troubles after their union; some folklorists believe the two parts were originally separate tales.

The second part begins after the prince and princess have had children. Through the course of the tale, the princess and her children are introduced in some way to another woman from the prince&#x27;s life. This other woman is not fond of the prince&#x27;s new family, and calls a cook to kill the children and serve them for dinner. Instead of obeying, the cook hides the children and serves livestock. Next, the other woman orders the cook to kill the princess. Before this can happen, the other woman&#x27;s true nature is revealed to the prince and then she is subjected to the very death that she had planned for the princess. The princess, prince, and their children live happily ever after.

===Basile&#x27;s narrative===

In Giambattista Basile&#x27;s dark version of Sleeping Beauty, &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot;, the sleeping beauty is named Talia. By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father, who is a great Lord, learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. Talia, now grown, sees an old woman spinning outside her window. Intrigued by the sight of the twirling spindle, Talia invites the woman over and takes the distaff from her hand to stretch the flax. Tragically, the splinter of flax gets embedded under her nail, and she is put to sleep. After Talia falls asleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers, and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and impregnates her. Afterwards, he leaves her in bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twinsone of whom keeps sucking her finger. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that got stuck in her finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.

When he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying &quot;Talia, Sun, and Moon&quot; in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king&#x27;s secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the &quot;king&quot; and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, &quot;Eat, eat, you are eating of your own.&quot; Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out what&#x27;s going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.

===Perrault&#x27;s narrative===

Perrault&#x27;s narrative is written in two parts, which some folklorists believe were originally separate tales, as they were in the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s version, and were later joined together by Giambattista Basile and once more by Perrault. According to folklore editors Martin Hallett and Barbara Karasek, Perrault&#x27;s tale is a much more subtle and pared down version than Basile&#x27;s story in terms of the more immoral details. An example of this is depicted in Perrault&#x27;s tale by the prince&#x27;s choice to instigate no physical interaction with the sleeping princess when he discovers her.

At the christening of a king and queen&#x27;s long-wished-for child, seven good fairies are invited to be the infant Princess&#x27;s godmothers and give her gifts. The seven fairies attend the banquet at the palace and each is given a golden box containing golden utensils adorned with diamonds and rubies. Soon after, an old fairy enters the palace, overlooked because she has not left her tower in fifty years and everyone believed her to be cursed or dead. Nevertheless, the eighth fairy is seated and given a box of ordinary utensils. When she hears the eighth fairy muttering some threats, the seventh, fearing that the uninvited guest will harm the Princess, hides herself behind some curtains, so she can be the last to give a gift.

Six of the invited fairies offer their gifts of unrivaled beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and all musical talents to the infant Princess. The eighth fairy, who is very angry about not being invited, curses the infant Princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy then offers her gift: an attempt to reverse the evil fairy&#x27;s curse, but she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a king&#x27;s son (&quot;&quot;).

The King then orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom banned and destroyed in an attempt to avert the eighth fairy&#x27;s curse on his daughter. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman (implied to be the evil fairy in disguise), spinning with her spindle. The Princess, who has never seen a spinning wheel before, asks the old woman if she can try it. The curse is fulfilled when the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The seventh fairy arrives in her dragon-drawn chariot. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle, except the King and Queen, to sleep. The King and Queen kiss their daughter goodbye and leave the castle to ban others from disturbing her, but the good fairy summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns to spring up around the place, shielding it from the outside world.

A hundred years pass and a prince from another royal family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father&#x27;s words: within the castle lies a very beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king&#x27;s son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant and unmatched beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The spell is broken, the princess awakens and bestows upon the prince a look &quot;more tender than a first glance might seem to warrant&quot; (in Perrault&#x27;s original French tale, the prince does not kiss the princess to wake her up) then converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the servants of the castle awaken and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.

After marrying the Sleeping Beauty in secret, the Prince visits her for four years and she bears him two children, unbeknownst to his mother, who is an ogre. When his father, the King, dies, the Prince ascends the throne and he brings his wife, who is now twenty years old, and their two children - a four-year-old daughter named Morning (Aurore or Dawn in the original French) and a three-year-old son named Day (Jour in the original French) - to his kingdom.

One day, the new King must go to war against his neighbor, Emperor Contalabutte, and leaves his mother to govern the kingdom and look after his family. After her son leaves, the Ogress Queen Mother sends her daughter-in-law to a house secluded in the woods and orders her cook to prepare Morning with Sauce Robert for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the princess, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands Day, but the cook this time substitutes a kid for the prince, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the Sleeping Beauty, the latter substitutes a hind prepared with Sauce Robert, satisfying the Ogress, and secretly reuniting the young Queen with her children, who have been hidden by the cook&#x27;s wife and maid. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cook&#x27;s trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns home unexpectedly and the Ogress, her true nature having been exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed by the creatures. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.

===Brothers Grimm&#x27;s version===

The Brothers Grimm included a variant of Sleeping Beauty, &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;, in the first volume of Children&#x27;s and Household Tales (published 1812). Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty (named Rosamund) with a kiss and does not include the part two as found in Basile&#x27;s and Perrault&#x27;s versions. The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault&#x27;s version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Their decision was notable because in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and Prose Eddas or Volsunga Saga, are their sleepers awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would have known since he wrote an encyclopedic volume on German mythology. His version is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault&#x27;s influence is almost certain. In the original Brothers Grimm&#x27;s version, the fairies are instead wise women.

The Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, &quot;The Evil Mother-in-law&quot;. This story begins with the heroine, a married mother of two children, and her mother-in-law, who attempts to eat her and the children. The heroine suggests an animal be substituted in the dish, and the story ends with the heroine&#x27;s worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-law&#x27;s attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.

===Variations===
The princess&#x27;s name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot;, she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault&#x27;s story but her daughter is called &quot;Aurore&quot;. The Brothers Grimm named her &quot;Briar Rose&quot; in their first collection. However, some translations of the Grimms&#x27; tale give the princess the name &quot;Rosamond&quot;. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet and Disney&#x27;s version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called &quot;Briar Rose&quot; in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies.

Besides &quot;Sun, Moon, and Talia&quot;, Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, &quot;The Young Slave&quot;, in his book, &quot;The Pentamerone&quot;. The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one titled &quot;The Glass Coffin&quot;.

Italo Calvino included a variant in &quot;Italian Folktales&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty and Her Children&quot;. In his version, the cause of the princess&#x27;s sleep is a wish by her mother. As in &quot;Pentamerone&quot;, the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. Calvino retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king&#x27;s mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, and instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile&#x27;s.

In his &quot;More English Fairy Tales&quot;, Joseph Jacobs noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Romani tale &quot;The King of England and his Three Sons&quot;.

The hostility of the king&#x27;s mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale &quot;The Six Swans&quot;, and also features in &quot;The Twelve Wild Ducks&quot;, where the mother is modified to be the king&#x27;s stepmother. However, these tales omit the attempted cannibalism.

Russian Romantic writer Vasily Zhukovsky wrote a versified work based on the theme of the princess cursed into a long sleep in his poem &quot;Спящая царевна&quot; (), published in 1832.
==Interpretations==

According to Maria Tatar, the Sleeping Beauty tale has been disparaged by modern-day feminists who consider the protagonist to have no agency and find her passivity to be offensive; some feminists have even argued for people to stop telling the story altogether.

Disney has received criticism for depicting both Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty princess as &quot;naïve and malleable&quot; characters. &quot;Time Out&quot; dismissed the princess as a &quot;delicate&quot; and &quot;vapid&quot; character. Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing the princess for lacking &quot;interesting qualities&quot;, where she also ranked her as Disney&#x27;s least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked the princess as the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, &quot;Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie… Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn&#x27;t doing much in the way of feminine progress.&quot; Leigh Butler of Tor.com went on to defend the character, writing, &quot;Aurora’s cipher-ness in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what &quot;all&quot; women are.&quot; Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Princess Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because, &quot;Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game.&quot; Despite being featured prominently in Disney merchandise, &quot;Aurora has become an oft-forgotten princess&quot;, and her popularity pales in comparison to those of Cinderella and Snow White.

An example of the cosmic interpretation of the tale given by the nineteenth century solar mythologist school appears in John Fiske&#x27;s &quot;Myths and Myth-Makers&quot;: “It is perhaps less obvious that winter should be so frequently symbolized as a thorn or sharp instrument... Sigurd is slain by a thorn, and Balder by a sharp sprig of mistletoe; and in the myth of the Sleeping Beauty, the earth-goddess sinks into her long winter sleep when pricked by the point of the spindle. In her cosmic palace, all is locked in icy repose, naught thriving save the ivy which defies the cold, until the kiss of the golden-haired sun-god reawakens life and activity.”

<text>San Francisco de Campeche (; , ), 19th c., also known simply as Campeche, is a city in Campeche Municipality in the Mexican state of Campeche, on the shore of the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico. Both the seat of the municipality and the state&#x27;s capital, the city had a population of 220,389 in the 2010 census, while the municipality had a population of 259,005.

The city was founded in 1540 by Spanish conquistadores as San Francisco de Campeche atop the pre-existing Maya city of Can Pech. Little trace remains of the Pre-Columbian city.

The city retains many of the old colonial Spanish city walls and fortifications which protected the city from pirates and buccaneers. The state of preservation and quality of its architecture earned it the status of a World Heritage Site in 1999. Campeche is (along with Quebec City) one of the only cities in North America with most of its historic old city walls intact. Originally, the Spaniards lived inside the walled city, while the indigenous Maya people lived in the surrounding &quot;barrios&quot; of San Francisco, Guadalupe, and San Román. These barrios still retain their original churches; the one in Guadalupe is almost 500 years old.

==History==

The modern city of San Francisco de Campeche was founded in 1540 by Francisco de Montejo upon the site of Can Pech, the former capital city of a Maya chiefdom. The city of Campeche was terrorized by pirates and marauders (such as the 1633 Sack of Campeche and the 1663 Sack of Campeche) until the city constructed major fortifications. The fortifications were started in 1686 and completed in 1704.

===First expedition===

The Hernández de Córdoba expedition of 1517 was the first Spanish expedition to reach Campeche, and its members were among the first Europeans to set foot on the Yucatán Peninsula. The expedition left the island of Cuba on February 8 and reached Isla Mujeres and Cabo Catoche in early March. They continued westward around the peninsula. Bernal Díaz del Castillo was the only member of that expedition to write an account of these events. In his account, he wrote that on Sunday March 22, they sighted and debarked at a village on the coast. This village was Can Pech, the capital of the Maya city-state of the same name. This happened to be the day of veneration of Saint Lazarus of Bardiaboch, which is why Hernández de Córdoba baptized the place with that name.

In need of water, the Spaniards landed and supplied themselves from a well. As the Mayans approached, the Spaniards indicated by means of signs that they came in peace; the Maya chief asked them if they came from where the sun rises, mentioning the word &quot;castilán&quot;. The Spaniards, surprised to hear this word, responded affirmatively, and the chief invited them to his city, where copal was lit. By means of signs, the Maya chief indicated to the expeditionaries that they should leave the city before the fire went out. Meanwhile, Mayan warriors were arriving at the place. Based on their recent experience at Cabo Catoche, the Spanish decided to leave. They would later encounter rough seas which caused them to lose the water they had just collected. This in turn forced them to land at Chakán Putum, where a fierce battle between Mayans and Spaniards took place.

===Conquest===
After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Francisco de Montejo requested permission from Charles V to conquer the Yucatán Peninsula. In 1526, the Spanish crown granted Montejo the title of &quot;Adelantado, governor, sheriff and captain general of Yucatan&quot;. His conquest of Chakán Putum and Can Pech were part of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, which was carried out in three stages.

In the first stage (1527 to 1529), Montejo ventured along the eastern coast of the peninsula with the help of the captain Alonso Dávila, whom he had known since Cortes&#x27; expedition, but they were repelled by the Maya.

In the second stage (1530-1535), Montejo ventured into the west, where he founded “Salamanca de Campeche” in 1531. Montejo sent Alonso Dávila to cross the peninsula south, where he founded “Villa Real” in Bacalar, but this position soon had to be abandoned. Montejo’s son was defeated in battle at Chichén Itzá towards the end of 1534, after which the Spaniards abandoned the peninsula for five years.

In the third stage (1540-1547), Montejo arrived in Ciudad Real de Chiapa (San Cristóbal de las Casas) in 1540, where he gave instructions to Francisco Gil to be in charge of Champotón. In 1546, when the conquest of Yucatan seemed to be over, Montejo and his wife traveled to San Francisco de Campeche to meet with his son and his nephew. The Maya had organized in secret, and a great rebellion broke out on the night of 8 November 1546 (5 Cimi 19 Xul, end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar). Montejo’s son and nephew took up arms to end the rebellions the following year. 

===Viceroyalty period===
Like most cities constructed by the Spanish conquistadors, the city of Campeche was designed in a standard military fashion based on a grid plan, with a &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot; near its center. Around this main square were located the Campeche Cathedral, the Royal Audience and the houses of the highest-ranking officials. A pillory — a column that served as a symbol of Spanish power and justice — stood in the center of the plaza. The jail, the municipal palace and the defense tower would be built soon after. The market was located around a smaller plaza.

The Spanish residents lived and worked near the main square, in the current neighborhood of San Román, while the indigenous Maya people lived in the old pre-Hispanic settlements — currently the neighborhoods of San Francisco and Siete de Agosto. The Naboríos, indigenous Mexicans who arrived with the conquistadors, occupied the San Román neighborhood, while the slaves from Africa lived in the neighborhoods of Santa Ana and Santa Lucía.

The city served as the base of operations for the conquest of the rest of Yucatán (1542–1546), beginning with the occupation of Ti&#x27;ho, an abandoned settlement of the Mayan Itza people, where the Spanish founded Mérida, the provincial capital, in 1542.

The armed conquest was followed by an ideological conquest which consisted of the indoctrination of the Maya people with European cultural ideology, particularly that of the Catholic religion. The first religious order that arrived in Campeche was that of the Franciscans, who arrived in Campeche in 1535. They were soon forced to leave due to a series of difficulties raised by both indigenous and Spanish people, but they returned in 1540. That year, they began the construction of a temple and convent dedicated to San Francisco. The Franciscans evangelized throughout the Yucatán Peninsula with no competition from other religious orders, such as the Jesuits or the Dominicans were competing for the territory from that point forward.

In 1542, the king proclaimed the calls New Laws, which established the freedom of the Indians as subjects of the Crown. Slavery was legally abolished, but would continue by other means. The parcel subject a certain number of peoples to a Spaniard, to whom they had to pay in kind (wax, cotton blankets) and labor. Those who were not entrusted were under the royal jurisdiction and received the name of &quot;peoples of the Royal Crown.&quot; The indigenous tributaries of the encomiendas español, continued to suffer a treatment that was practically slavery. The friars of the different religious orders present fought to defend the rights of the indigenous people, preserve their freedom and limit the abuses of the conquerors. Thanks to this, in 1547, Felipe II of Spain issued a royal identity card in favor of the personal freedom of the natives, and to make sure that their interests were fulfilled, he created a City Hall Mayor for the province of Yucatán.

====Trade and piracy====
Campeche&#x27;s position in the Gulf of Mexico made it the main port of the Yucatan Peninsula, standing out as a point of connection with the foreigner, which allowed the economic boom and population growth. From there, from early times, the cargoes of the so-called palo de Campeche, also known as &quot;dye stick&quot;, a native product of the region that would lead to large estates, among which are counted, Uayamón, Xanabchakán and Mucuychacán, to mention three of them, and also of salt. The port of Campeche also gained fame for its Shipyards industry.

The commercial monopoly of Spain, implemented by the House of Hiring of the Indies to their domains, which prohibited them from trading even among themselves and with other nations, led to illegal practices such as piracy. One of the measures to stop them was promulgated in 1616 by the Mayor of Yucatan Luis de Céspedes y Oviedo, which involved the creation of a license on the cutting and trade of the Campeche stick, as well Like new taxes. This first measure was insufficient and counterproductive, because far from bringing down piracy, he encouraged it. In 1629, the King of Spain Felipe IV created a navy coast guard to protect trade, but this measure also did not give the expected results, neither did the military garrison to protect the city implanted by Mayor Centeno Maldonado. The constant pressures from other European nations and the continuing uprisings in their Dutch positions made it impossible to adopt new measures against piracy, which remained in full swing.

Among the pirates most famous that docked at Campeche are John Hawkins, Francis Drake, Laurens de Graaf, Cornelius Jol, Jacobo Jackson, Michel de Grandmont, Portuguese Bartholomew, William Parker, Jean David Nau, Edward Mansvelt, Henry Morgan, Lewis Scot, Roche Brasiliano and Jean Lafitte. On January 27, 1661, a fleet of filibusters appeared in the port of San Francisco de Campeche and, although it did not disembark, looted two well-loaded commercial frigates, which barely arrived and then quietly withdrew, without being chased, because that day there was no armed ship in the bay capable of hunting him. The head of this filibuster expedition was called Henry Morgan.

A very feared pirate in the town of Campeche was Laurens de Graaf or Lorencillo, who was Dutch and had served the king of Spain fighting filibusters. But then he also dedicated himself to piracy. In 1685 he attacked and took the town of Campeche and twenty other towns in the area. He spent two months and captured so many prisoners and stole so many jewels and pieces of silver that filled the cargo of his ship. He was chased by three Spanish frigates with cannons. The pirate dodged the attacks, threw the entire load into the sea so that the ship achieved greater speed and, with wind in favor, moved away quickly.

Another pirate was El Olonés whose real name was Jean David Nau. He committed innumerable and famous attacks against the Spanish viceregency on the mainland. In a terrible storm, he lost his ship on the coast of Campeche. All the men were saved, but, arriving on land, the Spanish pursued them, killing most of them and wounding El Olonés. Needing to escape, he saved his life through a ploy: he took handfuls of sand, mixed it with the blood from his wounds and smeared his face and other parts of his body. Then, hiding with great skill among the dead, he remained motionless until the Spaniards left the battlefield. When they were gone, he retired to the forest, cleaned his wounds and took care of them until healed and then headed to the City of Campeche perfectly disguised. In the city, he spoke with certain slaves to whom he promised freedom if they obeyed him. They accepted his promises and stealing a canoe at night, threw themselves into the sea with El Olonés.

====Elevation to city status====
The coat of arms held by the city of San Francisco de Campeche was granted in 1777 by the king of Spain Carlos III, being elevated from the title of villa to that of city.

Before the current shield was adopted, there was a process to constitute a shield as an officer. The first project was presented in 1772 before the possible elevation to the title of city of the town of San Francisco de Campeche, when requested by the Cabildo de Campeche in a contest for the election of shield de Armas. The first design was submitted by Juan Antonio Rexo and Peñuelas on September 24 of that year but was rejected on October 17 for not being subject to the rules of heraldry. Ramón Zazo and Ortega subsequently presented three projects; the first two were rejected but finally the third was approved in council on November 7, 1777. The shield was approved by his majesty Carlos III of Spain with the certificate of: &quot;the City Title is granted to the town of San Francisco de Campeche.&quot;

== Climate ==

Campeche has a tropical savanna climate, with most rain falling in the wet season from June to October.

==Demographics==
As of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 259,005.

The municipal seat, and largest settlement, is the city of San Francisco de Campeche (often shortened to Campeche). As of 2010, the city had a population of 220,389.

Aside from the municipal seat, the municipality has 564 localities.

The largest localities are, (with 2010 populations in parentheses): Lerma (8,281), Chiná (5,194), classified as urban, and Los Laureles (2,251), Alfredo V. Bonfil (2,060), Pich (1,756), Tikinmul (1,663), Imí (1,227), Hampolol (1,123), Castamay (1,101), and San Francisco Kobén (1,045), classified as rural.

== Economy ==

The economy of San Francisco de Campeche is based primarily on the services sector: commerce, tourism, communications, public administration, public services. There are also various maquiladoras textiles installed in the city, and small and medium-sized enterprises generally associated with the exploitation of primary products, forming the secondary sector. The primary sector persists through fishing activity.

=== Tourism ===

In recent years tourism has had a strong boost in the State of Campeche. Underpinning the tourist activity the emblematic places in the capital city are:

==== Downtown and historic neighborhoods ====
The &quot;centro histórico&quot; of Campeche is a beautiful example of a fortified urban center in the viceregal baroque style. It contains many examples of Spanish Colonial architecture, and the fortifications system of Campeche is an important example of Spanish military architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries. These qualities have earned it the designation of Cultural Heritage of Humanity by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

Its aligned streets allow us to take a tour admiring the decoration of its houses, some of them with strong Moorish and Spanish reminiscences of the 18th century and some modifications of the 19th century. The color of its facades print a vibrant sense of life in those who visit them, each street is full of stories and legends.

The walls around part of the city are a reminder of the viceroyalty of the 17th and 18th centuries.

Religious and civil architecture are merged with civil and military architecture, as modest bastions of faith that protected the population during pirate offensives; Franciscan bulrush churches and baroque altarpieces with Solomon columns leave a mark of their strong impact during Catholic evangelization in fortified American lands such as the Villa de San Francisco de Campeche. The sobriety of its facades are imposed on the faith when the protection of its faithful was pondering.

==== Archaeological sites ====

There is the place known as Acanmul and also relatively close, the archaeological sites of Edzná and Jaina. The city can also be taken as a starting point to visit other important sites of the State of Campeche.

===== Edzná =====

The &quot;Casa de los Itzáes&quot;, is a place where we find about twenty monumental buildings that tell us about the concentration of political, economic and religious power that occurred in pre-Columbian times.

Due to the type of soil, the valley in which it is located, is flooded in the rainy season and retains high humidity almost all year. To remedy this problem, the Maya developed an advanced system of hydraulic works: a network of canals drained the valley and the water was taken to a lagoon, which was transformed into dam through retaining walls, while other canals were used to irrigate the fields. This led to an optimum degree of moisture in the soil for intensive cultivation while the canals provided abundant fishing, and were used as communication routes and in some cases served as a defense. The plazas had a magnificent drain system and the rainwater reached artificial reservoirs called chultunes.

Edzná had numerous religious, administrative and residential buildings distributed over an area of approximately 25 square kilometers. Of particular importance on this site is the five-story building, which is built on a large platform that gives it great architectural majesty.

===== Jaina =====

The &quot;House on the sea&quot; is one of the most interesting places in the region due mainly to its fame as a Mayan necropolis. A little more than a thousand human burials have been explored around the site, in which extraordinary pieces of clay have been found that were possibly deposited as mortuary offerings. At the time of their discovery, these pieces helped cultivate a new appreciation of the art Mayan Culture made in mud, since its quality far exceeded what had previously been found in the area.

==== The Petenes ====

Part of the urban area of San Francisco de Campeche borders the Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve.

Curious circular forms of vegetation have been called petenes where the origin of a source of fresh water, in the middle of an area of salt water, promotes the development of plants less resistant to salt, leading to islets where flora has taken hierarchy around the origin of fresh water. It is an entire organization that allows nesting and refuge for a large number of bird and mammal species.

In the coastal mangroves of the reserve, there are innumerable natural paths that make up attractive routes, in them the sport of fishing tarpon and the observation of birds and other animal species are carried out.

The enormous natural wealth of the area, forms the ideal scenario for the development and enjoyment of various activities ecotourism.

== Transportation ==
The city is served with commercial airline flights at Campeche International Airport.

== Culture ==

=== The typical dress ===

Essentially composed of three pieces, the upper part has its origin in the huipil or mestizo hipil, it differs in that it is embroidered in black and with motifs inspired by the flowers of onion and pumpkin. The suit complements an overflow of Santa Maria; The skirt is of Spanish origin and reaches the ankles is made of calico or zaraza, fine printed taffeta or Spanish brocade.

The pujuy, (cover roads) looks for him, stopping the flight of all the birds and in his song he says: give me back my suit, gentleman! The dancers symbolize the feathers with a ribbon of color that each one brings, and on the neck of the dancer representing the cutz, they turn them on.

Because of its idea of disorder and hustle and bustle, it is interpreted in very lively and cheerful ways without making a couple or defining with whom you dance, all dance and zap in confusion, marking and challenging with heel strokes who is closest indifferent to the opposite sex. It retains the Spanish style very marked, it is written in three-beat measure and there is no news of its copla.
* &quot; &#x27;Cuban Arabic.&#x27; &quot;This is a short but very energetic dance, it is written in six eighths and its genre is zapateado. It is danced linked by the waist and with the free hand up, it is always done in the game of two couples or in even numbers that evolve, heel and valsean with very fast turns and running almost the entire stage, it is repeated several times, it concludes with a strong blow and displace the public, asking for applause.
* &quot; &#x27;Campechito retrechero.&#x27; &quot;It is the diminutive affectionate together with the traditional expression that means the contagious joy and the carefree limitlessness of the Campeche spirit, given name to this typical jarana. The dancers embellish themselves with their heels and infect the spectator, with the bullanguera chant of an ancient town that has managed to project a personality across seas and continents.
* &quot; &#x27;Baile del Almud.&#x27; &quot;Set of mestizo sounds that naturalized in Yucatán and Campeche, acquired the name of jarana; The skillful heel and shot at 6x8 pace make it very lucid. When running on a bushel, its beauty becomes more significant, when the music is interrupted, the dancers continue to zap, taking turns in this fate, and demonstrating their ability.

== City fortifications ==
The city of Campeche is an example of urbanism in a baroque colonial city, with a reticular and regular plan, its urban trace, a model of colonial port cities, reflects the main role that it played as a commercial, religious and military connection point characterized by its high level of integrity and homogeneity. More than one thousand buildings with a historic value have survived as witnesses of space and temporal superimposition of several significant historic periods of Mexico.

Campeche faced regular attacks by Dutch, English and French buccaneers and pirates such as Francis Drake, John Hawkins, Laurens de Graaf, Cornelis Jol, Jacobo Jackson, Jean Lafitte, Francisco de Grammont, Bartolomé Portugués, William Parker, Francisco Nau, Edward Mansvelt, Henry Morgan, Lewis Scot, Roche Braziliano and Michel de Grammont for almost 160 years. In response, in 1686 the government started to fortify the city.

The French engineer Louis Bouchard de Becour was commissioned to unify all the defensive works that surrounded the city with a wall. At its completion, the wall surrounding the city of Campeche was 2,560 meters in length, forming an irregular hexagon around the main part of the city, with eight defensive bastions on the corners. These bulwarks now serve different functions:

* Santiago: Used as the Botanical Garden &#x27;Xmuch´haltún&#x27;. Reconstructed.
* San Pedro: Former prison.
* San Francisco: Protects the Land Gate. Houses the library of the INAH.
* San Juan: Protects the Land Gate.
* Nuestra Señora de la Soledad: Also protects the Sea Gate. It is the largest one and holds the Museum of City History.
* San Carlos: Holds the City Museum. This fort was the first one built. Protects the Sea Gate.
* Santa Rosa.

It also contained four gates to allow access to the main quarters. The main entrances are the &quot;Puerta de la tierra&quot; (&quot;Land Gate&quot;), built in 1732, and the &quot;Puerta del mar&quot; (&quot;Sea Gate&quot;). The Land Gate is kept as a tourist attraction, having a light and sound show three nights each week and keeping original supplies and items from the 17th century. The other gates were Guadalupe and San Román, connecting to the outside neighborhoods.

Additionally, two main forts protected the city from two nearby hills on each side, the forts of San José el Alto (built in 1762) and San Miguel. These forts gave long-range artillery coverage and served also as look-outs. They were built before the walls of the city. The fort of San Miguel is used as a museum and houses a collection of pre-Hispanic items. The fort of San José houses a collection of boats and weapons of the period.

<text>The Himba (singular: OmuHimba, plural: OvaHimba) are an ethnic group with an estimated population of about 50,000 people living in northern Namibia, in the Kunene Region (formerly Kaokoland) and on the other side of the Kunene River in southern Angola. There are also a few groups left of the OvaTwa, who the OvaHimba consider to be part of their tribe, but are hunter-gatherers. Culturally distinguishable from the Herero people, the OvaHimba are a semi-nomadic, pastoralist people and speak OtjiHimba, a variety of Herero, which belongs to the Bantu family within Niger–Congo. The OvaHimba are semi-nomadic as they have base homesteads where crops are cultivated, but may have to move within the year depending on rainfall and where there is access to water.

The OvaHimba are considered the last (semi-) nomadic people of Namibia.

==Culture==
===Subsistence economy===

The OvaHimba are predominantly livestock farmers who breed fat-tailed sheep and goats, but count their wealth in the number of their cattle. They also grow and farm rain-fed crops such as maize and millet. Livestock are the major source of milk and meat for the OvaHimba. Their main diet is sour milk and maize porridge () and sometimes plain hard porridge only, due to milk and meat scarcity. Their diet is also supplemented by cornmeal, chicken eggs, wild herbs and honey. Only occasionally, and opportunistically, are the livestock sold for cash. Non-farming businesses, wages and salaries, pensions, and other cash remittances make up a very small portion of the OvaHimba livelihood, which is gained chiefly from their work in conservancies, old-age pensions, and drought relief aid from the government of Namibia.

===Daily life===

Women and girls tend to perform more labor-intensive work than men and boys do, such as carrying water to the village, earthen plastering the mopane wood homes with a traditional mixture of red clay soil and cow manure binding agent, collecting firewood, attending to the calabash vines used for producing and ensuring a secure supply of soured milk, cooking and serving meals, as well as artisans making handicrafts, clothing and jewelry. The responsibility for milking the cows and goats also lies with the women and girls. Women and girls take care of the children, and one woman or girl will take care of another woman&#x27;s children. The men&#x27;s main tasks are tending to the livestock farming, herding where the men will often be away from the family home for extended periods, animal slaughtering, construction, and holding council with village tribal chiefs.

Members of a single extended family typically dwell in a homestead (&quot;onganda&quot;), a small family-village, consisting of a circular hamlet of huts and work shelters that surround an &quot;okuruwo&quot; (sacred ancestral fire) and a kraal for the sacred livestock. Both the fire and the livestock are closely tied to their veneration of the dead, the sacred fire representing ancestral protection and the sacred livestock allowing &quot;proper relations between human and ancestor&quot;.

The OvaHimba use a heterogeneous pasture system that includes both rainy-season pastures and dry-season pastures. Dry-season pastures are rested during the rainy season which results in higher biomass production in the soil compared to constantly grazing all pastures.

===Clothing and hair style===

Both the Himba men and women are accustomed to wearing traditional clothing that befits their living environment in the Kaokoland and the hot semi-arid climate of their area. In most occurrences this consists simply of skirt-like clothing made from calfskins and sheep skin or, increasingly, from more modern textiles, and occasionally sandals for footwear. Women&#x27;s sandals are made from cows&#x27; skin while men&#x27;s are made from old car tires. Women who have given birth wear a small backpack of skin attached to their traditional outfit. Himba people, especially women, are famous for covering themselves with &quot;otjize&quot; paste, a cosmetic mixture of butterfat and ochre pigment. Otjize cleanses the skin over long periods due to water scarcity and protects from the hot and dry climate of the Kaokoland, as well as from insect bites. It gives Himba people&#x27;s skin and hair plaits a distinctive texture, style, and orange or red tinge, and is often perfumed with the aromatic resin of the &quot;omuzumba&quot; shrub. Otjize is considered foremost a highly desirable aesthetic beauty cosmetic, symbolizing earth&#x27;s rich red color and blood, the essence of life, and is consistent with the OvaHimba ideal of beauty.

From pubescence, boys continue to have one braided plait, while girls will have many &quot;otjize&quot;-textured hair plaits, some arranged to veil the girl&#x27;s face. In daily practice the plaits are often tied together and held parted back from the face. Women who have been married for about a year or have had a child wear an ornate headpiece called the &quot;Erembe&quot;, sculptured from sheepskin, with many streams of braided hair coloured and put in shape with otjize paste. Unmarried young men continue to wear one braided plait extending to the rear of the head, while married men wear a cap or head-wrap and un-braided hair beneath. Widowed men will remove their cap or head-wrap and expose un-braided hair. The OvaHimba are also accustomed to use wood ash for hair cleansing due to water scarcity.

===Customary practices===
The OvaHimba are polygamous, with the average Himba man being husband to two wives at the same time. They also practice early arranged marriages. Young Himba girls are married to male partners chosen by their fathers. This happens from the onset of puberty, which may mean that girls aged 10 or below are married off. This practice is illegal in Namibia, and even some OvaHimba contest it, but it is nevertheless widespread.

Genetic testing was used in a 2020 study of a semi-nomadic group near the Angolan border. It showed that 48% of all children were conceived by a father outside of the marriage; and that more than 70% of the couples had at least one child from an extra-pair father. Furthermore, parents of both sexes could, with a reliability of 72 and 73% percent, tell which ones of their children were fathered by a man outside of the marriage.

Among the Himba people, it is customary as a rite of passage to circumcise boys before puberty. Upon marriage, a Himba boy is considered a man. A Himba girl is not considered a fully-fledged woman until she bears a child.

Marriage among the OvaHimba involves transactions of cattle, which are the source of their economy. Bridewealth is involved in these transactions; this can be negotiable between the groom&#x27;s family and the bride&#x27;s father, depending on the relative poverty of the families involved. In order for the bride&#x27;s family to accept the bridewealth, the cattle must appear of high quality. It is standard practice to offer an ox, but more cattle will be offered if the groom&#x27;s father is wealthy and is capable of offering more.

===Societal participation===
Despite the fact that a majority of OvaHimba live a distinct cultural lifestyle in their remote rural environment and homesteads, they are socially dynamic, and not all are isolated from the trends of local urban cultures. The OvaHimba coexist and interact with members of their country&#x27;s other ethnic groups and the social trends of urban townsfolk. This is especially true of those in proximity to the Kunene Region capital of Opuwo, who travel frequently to shop at the local town supermarkets for the convenience of commercial consumer products, market food produce and to acquire health care.

===Links with Western culture===
Some Himba children attend Western schools, and some young people leave the homelands to live in towns.

==Tribal structure==

Because of the harsh desert climate in the region where they live and their seclusion from outside influences, the OvaHimba have managed to maintain and preserve much of their traditional lifestyle. Members live under a tribal structure based on bilateral descent that helps them live in one of the most extreme environments on earth.

Under bilateral descent, every tribe member belongs to two clans: one through the father (a patriclan, called ) and another through the mother (a matriclan, called ). Himba clans are led by the eldest male in the clan. Sons live with their father&#x27;s clan, and when daughters marry, they go to live with the clan of their husband. However, inheritance of wealth does not follow the patriclan but is determined by the matriclan, that is, a son does not inherit his father&#x27;s cattle but his maternal uncle&#x27;s instead. Along with the inheritance of wealth, moral obligations are also important within the tribal structure. When a person dies, the OvaHimba evaluate the care of those who are left behind, such as orphans and widows. Access to water-points and pastures is another part of the OvaHimba inheritance structure.

Bilateral descent is found among only a few groups in West Africa, India, Australia, Melanesia and Polynesia, and anthropologists consider the system advantageous for groups that live in extreme environments because it allows individuals to rely on two sets of kin dispersed over a wide area.

==History==
The OvaHimba history is fraught with disasters, including severe droughts and guerrilla warfare, especially during Namibia&#x27;s war of independence and as a result of the civil war in neighboring Angola.

In the 1980s it appeared the OvaHimba way of life was coming to a close due to a climax in adverse climatic conditions and political conflicts. A severe drought killed 90% of their livestock, and many gave up their herds and became refugees in the town of Opuwo living in slums on international humanitarian aid, or joined Koevoet paramilitary units to cope with the livestock losses and widespread famine. OvaHimba living over the border in Angola were occasionally victims of kidnapping during the South African Border war, either taken as hostages or abducted to join the Angolan branch of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN, army of SWAPO).

===Religion===
The OvaHimba are a monotheistic people who worship the god Mukuru, as well as their clan&#x27;s ancestors (ancestor reverence). Mukuru only blesses, while the ancestors can bless and curse. Each family has its own sacred ancestral fire, which is kept by the fire-keeper. The fire-keeper approaches the sacred ancestral fire every seven to eight days in order to communicate with Mukuru and the ancestors on behalf of his family. Often, because Mukuru is busy in a distant realm, the ancestors act as Mukuru&#x27;s representatives.

The OvaHimba traditionally believe in &quot;omiti&quot;, which some translate to mean witchcraft but which others call &quot;black magic&quot; or &quot;bad medicine&quot;. Some OvaHimba believe that death is caused by &quot;omiti&quot;, or rather, by someone using &quot;omiti&quot; for malicious purposes. Additionally, some believe that evil people who use &quot;omiti&quot; have the power to place bad thoughts into another&#x27;s mind or cause extraordinary events to happen (such as when a common illness becomes life-threatening). But users of &quot;omiti&quot; do not always attack their victim directly; sometimes they target a relative or loved one. Some OvaHimba will consult a traditional African diviner-healer to reveal the reason behind an extraordinary event, or the source of the &quot;omiti&quot;.

===Since Namibian independence===

The OvaHimba have been successful in maintaining their culture and traditional way of life.

As such, the OvaHimba have worked with international activists to block a proposed hydroelectric dam along the Kunene River that would have flooded their ancestral lands. In 2011, when Namibia announced its new plan to build a dam in Orokawe, in the Baynes Mountains. The OvaHimba submitted in February 2012 their protest declaration against the hydroelectric dam to the United Nations, the African Union and to the Government of Namibia.

The governments of Norway and Iceland funded mobile schools for Himba children, but since Namibia took them over in 2010, they have been converted to permanent schools and are no longer mobile. The Himba leaders complain in their declaration about the culturally inappropriate school system, that they say would threaten their culture, identity and way of life as a people.

===Human rights===
Groups of the last remaining hunters and gatherers Ovatwa are held in secured camps in the northern part of Namibia&#x27;s Kunene region, despite complaints by the traditional Himba chiefs that the Ovatwa are held there without their consent and against their wishes.

In February 2012, traditional Himba chiefs issued two separate declarations to the African Union and to the OHCHR of the United Nations.The first, titled &quot;Declaration of the most affected Ovahimba, Ovatwa, Ovatjimba and Ovazemba against the Orokawe Dam in the Baynes Mountains&quot; outlines the objections from regional Himba chiefs and communities that reside near the Kunene River. The second, titled &quot;Declaration by the traditional Himba leaders of Kaokoland in Namibia&quot; lists violations of civil, cultural, economic, environmental, social and political rights perpetrated by the government of Namibia (GoN).

In September 2012, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples visited the OvaHimba and heard their concerns that they do not have recognized traditional authorities and that they are placed under the jurisdictions of chiefs of neighboring dominant tribes, who make decisions on behalf of the minority communities. In his view, the lack of recognition of traditional chiefs, in accordance with Namibian law, relates to a lack of recognition of the minority indigenous tribes&#x27; communal lands. On November 23, 2012, hundreds of OvaHimba and Zemba from Omuhonga and Epupa region protested in Okanguati against Namibia&#x27;s plans to construct a dam in the Kunene River in the Baynes Mountains, against increasing mining operations on their traditional land and human rights violations against them.

On March 25, 2013, over 1,000 Himba people marched in protest again, this time in Opuwo, against the ongoing human rights violations that they endure in Namibia. They expressed their frustration over the lack of recognition of their traditional chiefs as &quot;Traditional Authorities&quot; by the government; Namibia&#x27;s plans to build the Orokawe dam in the Baynes Mountains at the Kunene River without consulting with the OvaHimba, who do not consent to the construction plans; culturally inappropriate education; the illegal fencing of parts of their traditional land; and their lack of property rights to the territory that they have lived upon for centuries. They also protested against the implementation of the Communal Land Reform Act of 2002.

On October 14, 2013, Himba chief Kapika, on behalf of his region Epupa and the community which was featured in German RTL reality TV show &quot;Wild Girls&quot; condemned the misuse of Himba people, individuals and villagers in the show, and demanded the halt of broadcasting any further episodes as they would mock the culture and way of being of the Himba people.

In March 2014, OvaHimba from both countries, Angola and Namibia, marched again in protest against the dam&#x27;s construction plans and against the government attempt to bribe their regional Himba chief. In the signed letter of the Himba community from Epupa, the region that would be directly affected by the dam, the traditional leaders explain that any consent form signed by a former chief as a result of bribery was not valid, as they remain opposed to the dam.

==Anthropological investigations==

===Color perception and vision===

Several researchers have studied the OvaHimba perception of colors. The OvaHimba use four color names: &quot;zuzu&quot; stands for dark shades of blue, red, green and purple; &quot;vapa&quot; is white and some shades of yellow; &quot;buru&quot; is some shades of green and blue; and &quot;dambu&quot; is some other shades of green, red and brown.

Like many traditional societies, the Himba have exceptionally sharp vision, believed to come from their cattle rearing and need to identify each cow&#x27;s markings.

<text>The Colonia Tovar dialect, or Alemán Coloniero, is a dialect that is spoken in Colonia Tovar, Venezuela, and belongs to the Low Alemannic branch of German.

==Characteristics==

The dialect, like other Alemannic dialects, is not mutually intelligible with Standard German. It is spoken by descendants of Germans from the Black Forest region of southern Baden, who emigrated to Venezuela in 1843. Most speakers also speak Spanish, and the dialect has both acquired Spanish loanwords and influenced Venezuelan Spanish.

==History==

Until 1942, when Colonia Tovar was declared a municipality, most of its residents above the age of 15 were fluent in German, being unable to converse or understand Spanish, owing to the town&#x27;s isolation. In World War II, Venezuela declared war on Germany, and so German classes in Colonia Tovar were banned. The town became connected with the rest of the country and so people began to converse in Spanish, which has led to the dialect&#x27;s decline.

Despite attempts to use German as the language of instruction, the state has not given local schools permission to teach in bilingual classes, and so, only private tutors were allowed to instruct in the Colonia Tovar dialect and in Standard German. Most descendants of German settlers in Colonia Tovar now mostly speak Standard German.

<text>Champotón is a small city in Champotón Municipality in the Mexican state of Campeche, located at , about 60 km south of the city of Campeche where the small Champotón river meets the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. At the 2010 census it had a population of 30,881.

Champotón, historically also called Chakanputun, Chanpaton and Chanputun, was a city of the Maya civilization dating back to at least the 10th century before it was conquered by Spain in the 16th century. There the famous battle &quot;Mala Pelea&quot; occurred. In the first Spanish exploration (1517), they were defeated by the Maya. Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s expedition exacted revenge in 1518.

==History==
According to the Chilam Balam of Chumayel, the Itzáes began to arrive at the Yucatán peninsula in the year 435, begun in Bacalar and rising to the north and west, in this way they also inhabited Chakán Putum.

In the year 869, coming from Nonohual came Ah Mekat Tutul Xiu, who was the chief of the tutul xiúes and forced the first Itzáes to retreat into the jungle and leave Chakán Putum and other cities, the tutul xiúes were settled mainly in Uxmal more late in 987, some of the Itzaes who lived &quot;under the trees, under the ashes and under the misery&quot; returned again to Chichen Itza, others of the Itzaes separated and founded Mayapán (1047 AD), the latter since then He knew them as the &quot;Cocomes&quot;.

Cocomes, itzáes and tutul xiúes formed the Mayapán League that began in 1047. The Cocomes made war with the Itzáes who emigrated to the Guatemalan Petén, and later the Tutul Xiúes fought with the Cocomes, eventually disintegrating the union in 1441.

After the Yucatán Peninsula, was divided into 16 cacicazgos, in the state of Campeche, was part of the chiefdom of Ah Canul, Can Pech, and Chakán Putum. The struggles between cacicazgos were frequent, especially between cocomes and tutul xiúes.

In 1517 the first Spanish expedition to the Mexican coasts was made by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, first Spanish conquistador to arrive to the Yucatán Peninsula, who after having touched Isla Mujeres and Cabo Catoche continued skirting the peninsula&#x27;s coastline, arriving in Campeche on Sunday of San Lázaro. The natives of Campeche welcomed the Spaniards, in this place they were supplied with water, and they returned to embark to continue their journey, however they incurred the mistake of not closing their pipes and water containers, so they had to disembark again a little further south in a nearby place called Champoton (Chakán Putum).

According to the story of the soldier and chronicler Bernal Díaz del Castillo, it is known that three days later the expeditionaries continued along the coast and reached Chakanputún, which they renamed Champoton and where they met with a thousand heavily armed Maya who attacked the Spaniards by killing to more than 50 and leaving the captain wounded. The Spanish expedition withdrew.

After this fierce fight, the Spaniards had to flee without water and with many wounded, 57 dead and two kidnappings (Alonso Boto and an old Portuguese), the same Hernández de Córdoba left with 33 wounds, because the Mayans soon realized that he was the boss and as described by Diaz del Castillo shouted &quot;calachuni&quot;, &quot;calachuni&quot; (which means &quot;the boss&quot;), they fled to Florida, a place known by the pilot Antón de Alaminos looking for water, but there they were also repelled by the natives (Bernal Díaz del Castillo who participated in the trip, was wounded in Florida) and finally returned to the port of Carenas near Havana in Cuba, Hernández de Córdoba would die 10 days later as a result of injuries in Sancti Espiritus.

Due to these events, Champoton was baptized as &quot;Puerto de Mala Pelea&quot;. November December The Moch (the &quot;stubby&quot;, the one - armed Cohuó) chief was the first Indian hero; This Mayan chief was able to provide the first defeat to a foreign invading army in America.

The following year, in 1518, the second expedition commanded by Juan de Grijalva departed from Cuba, after passing through Cozumel and the Bay of Ascension, they circled the coast of the peninsula again until they reached Champoton again to obtain water, to the experience of the first expedition, the Spaniards were more prepared to face and subdue the natives. The balance of the confrontation inclined to the Europeans who had 7 casualties (among them Juan de Quiteria) and 60 wounded (Juan de Grijalva was wounded with three arrows and lost two teeth), the Mayans couohes suffered many losses (200), among the chief cacique died, and the rest fled inland.

Grijalva sent his translators (Julianillo and Melchorejo, Mayas trapped in Cabo Catoche during the first expedition who had already learned Castilian) to call other caciques, nobody came to the call, so this expedition left Champoton and continued its route to the mouth of the river since then called &quot;Grijalva&quot; in Tabasco, in this expedition came Francisco de Montejo for the first time.

In the third expedition (1519) commanded by Hernán Cortés, his intention was to disembark again to avenge the previous expeditionaries, but the strong wind did not favor the disembarkation, and the pilots convinced Cortés to continue straight ahead with the boats, in such a way that They passed by the Lagoon of Terms, where they would face the Chontal Maya of the region, it is likely that the Mayans of Can Pech, and Chakan Putúm made a common front before the disembarkation made at a point near Zintla (Centla).

After a strong confrontation ( Battle of Centla ), Cortes subdued and agreed with the Mayans founding the town of Santa Maria de la Victoria, (Frontier). It was here that the Mayans gave Cortés to Malintzin along with other slaves as an act of peace, it is possible that &quot;Doña Marina&quot; was a slave of the Mayans of Champotón.

In 1526 Francisco de Montejo, who had participated in the conquest of Tenochtitlan, traveled to Spain and requested permission to carry out the conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula, so in 1526 the Spanish crown awarded Montejo the title of &quot;Adelantado, Governor , Chief Constable and Captain General of Yucatan &quot;. The conquests of Champoton and Campeche were part of the Conquest of Yucatán, which was carried out in three stages.

In the first stage or attempt, Montejo dabbled between 1527 and 1529 in the northeast of the peninsula with the help of Captain Alonso Dávila, but they were repelled by the Mayans. In the second stage or attempt (1530-1535) Montejo dabbled in the west, managing to found in 1531 &quot;Salamanca de Campeche&quot;. Alonso Dávila was sent by Montejo to cross the peninsula south and founded in Bacalar Villa Real, but this position had to be abandoned. The mighty Mayans would rebel in the battle of San Bernabé on June 11, 1531, in the vicinity of Campeche.

The son of Montejo known as Montejo &quot;el Mozo&quot; is defeated in the royal city of Chichen Itza towards the end of 1534, so in 1535, the Spaniards left the peninsula completely. From Honduras and then from Ciudad Real de Chiapa (San Cristobal de las Casas), Montejo &quot;el adelantado&quot; would turn orders to his son and nephew to enter the peninsula again.

Montejo &quot;the Adelantado&quot; asked Lorenzo de Godoy to move the town of San Pedro Tanoche in Tabasco to Champoton to establish the first position in the peninsula, which is why it was baptized as &quot;Villa de San Pedro Champotón&quot; in 1538. (the transfer of the village was not easy, according to the narrator of the conquistador Diego Sanchez who participated with his wife in this expedition).

Francisco de Montejo &quot;el Mozo&quot; was in Santa María de la Victoria recruiting soldiers and waiting for resources, an activity that took a long time. At first the Mayans in Champotón, cooperated with the Spaniards of the town, but when seeing that they were few they began to conspire. Francisco de Montejo, the nephew who had been sent by his cousin to help protect the position, realized this conspiracy and in a surprise operation kidnapped the Mayan caciques, taking them to Santa Maria de la Victoria, so that they would renew there obedience to &quot;El Mozo&quot; The name of the village changed to &quot;Salamanca de Champotón&quot;.

In 1540 &quot;El Mozo&quot; from Santa María de la Victoria received material and human resources to attend the position of Champotón, a first advance to the north began and on October 4 the garrison of San Francisco de Campeche was established.

&quot;El Adelantado&quot; appointed &quot;Francisco Gil&quot; as &quot;lieutenant governor and captain general&quot; as successor to &quot;El Mozo&quot; in the establishment of Champotón, so &quot;el Mozo&quot;, &quot;el Sobrino&quot; along with other captains would advance to the north and orient the conquest of Yucatán.

In 1543 the crown appointed Fray Bartolomé de las Casas to be bishop of Chiapas, its jurisdictional limits included Champotón. In 1546, led by Fray Luis de Villalpando, the Franciscan friars arrived: Juan de Albalote, Lorenzo de Bienvenida, Melchor de Benavente, Don Angel Maldonado and Don Juan de Herrera. That same year in 1546 Francisco de Montejo, &quot;el Adelantado&quot;, introduced the cultivation of sugarcane.

During the Viceroyalty the city, head of an important sugar producing region, had a population composed of Spaniards, Mayans and black slaves, and was attacked in 1644, 1672 and 1748 by English pirates, which caused considerable damage.

The independence of Mexico was peaceful in Champoton, as in the rest of the Yucatán peninsula, and the city served as a refuge for the survivors of the rest of the peninsula during the Caste War, since the indigenous Mayans did not revolt in this area . By decree of Governor Miguel Barbachano of May 1, 1852, Champoton is elevated to the category of village and when the district of Campeche becomes a state, it becomes part of the new entity.

On November 19, 1863, there was a landing in Champotón by French forces who made a sudden and surprising attack, taking possession of the San Antonio Fort. For its part, the troop stationed in Champotón led by then-Colonel Pedro Celestino Brito, supported by Lieutenant José de la Rosa Ugarte and second lieutenant Durán, bravely faced it and managed to recover the bastion and that the French, in an approximate number of 50, they will retreat to their ships.

The Mexican Revolution did not seriously affect the population, except for the permanence during five months of a de-Huerta army in retreat in 1923–24. On November 7, 1957, Champoton was granted the title of city by decree no. 88 issued by the H. State Congress . Dr. Alberto Trueba Urbina made the formal declaration at the premises of the choreographic society &quot;Cultura y Progreso&quot; (current village casino) on December 8 of the same year at 11:30 am; he was municipal president the prof. Abraham Aguilar Espinosa.

By decree number 131, issued by the LXI Legislature of the Congress of the State of Campeche, published in the official newspaper of the State on June 27, 2014, was declared at the head of the Municipality of Champoton as &quot;Heroic City of Champoton&quot;; which is why all the references made to the Champoton head will be called &quot;Heroic City&quot;.

==Demographics==
As of 2010, the city of Champotón had a population of 30,881.

<text>Owen Flanagan (born 1949) is the James B. Duke University Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Professor of Neurobiology Emeritus at Duke University. Flanagan has done work in philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of social science, ethics, contemporary ethical theory, moral psychology, as well as on cross-cultural philosophy.

==Biography==
Flanagan was born in Bronxville, New York. He grew up in Hartsdale, New York. He earned his PhD from Boston University and his Bachelor of Arts degree from Fordham University. He taught for 16 years at Wellesley College before moving to Duke in 1993.

Flanagan has written extensively on consciousness. He has been realistic about the difficulty of consciousness as a scientific and philosophical problem, but optimistic about the chance of solving the problem. One of the problems in a study of consciousness is the hidden way in which conscious states are dependent on brain states. Flanagan has proposed that there is a &quot;natural method&quot; to go about understanding consciousness. Three key elements of this developing science are: paying attention to subjective reports on conscious experiences, incorporating the results from psychology and cognitive science, and including the results from neuroscience that will reveal how neuronal systems produce consciousness.

Flanagan has also written extensively about ethics. Just as philosophical theorizing about consciousness must pay close attention to psychology and neuroscience, so too should ethics pay attention to the relevant sciences. His book, &quot;Varieties of Moral Personality: Ethics and Psychological Realism&quot; (1991) helped spawn several modern approaches to moral psychology by insisting on relevance of empirical psychology to the way we think of moral psychology and moral possibility.

In recent work, &quot;The Geography of Morals&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2016) and &quot;How to Do Things with Emotions: Anger and Shame Across Cultures&quot; (Princeton University Press 2021) Flanagan has brought anthropological realism to the study of cross-cultural ethics and the philosophy of emotions.

Flanagan was Rockefeller Fellow at the National Humanities Center (NHC), Research Triangle Park, NC in 2015-2016, and Berggruen Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) in Stanford CA in 2016-2017.

Two books devoted entirely to Flanagan&#x27;s work are: &quot;The Natural Method: &quot;(Eddy Nahmias, Thomas Polger, and Wenqing Zhao eds. MIT Press 2020) and &quot;Naturalism, Human Flourishing, and Asian Philosophy: Owen Flanagan and Beyond&quot;(ed. Bongrae Seok, Routledge 2020).

Flanagan works closely with Jeff Sachs at the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. He was a principal in the &quot;Ethics in Action&quot; initiative with the Vatican (2017-2020), and he leads an ongoing initiative with Sachs and the Vatican on &quot;Science, Ethics, Happiness, and Well-Being.&quot;

<text>The Swedish National Debt Office ( or shortly &quot;Riksgälden&quot;) was founded by Gustav III at the Riksdag of the Estates in 1789, through the Act of union and security. It is a Swedish Government agency. The first task of the Debt Office was to finance the ongoing war against Russia.

The method of raising funds was to issue promissory notes called &quot;Riksgälds&quot; denominated in Riksdaler which was the Swedish currency at the time. The reason why the funds could not be raised through the Riksbank was that its notes had to be backed by silver (commodity money) to two thirds, whereas no such restrictions applied for the promissory notes (credit money) issued by the Debt office. This produced a heavy seigniorage-induced inflation, where the exchange rate for the promissory notes against silver was 1 to 4 in 1834.

In 1989, after two hundred years as one of the few state agencies that reported directly to the Riksdag, the Debt office was reconstituted and is now reporting to the Ministry of Finance and the Government. After 1989 it also assumed the role as the government&#x27;s internal bank from the Riksbank.

Since January 1, 2008 the Debt office handles the Swedish deposit insurance, which 1996-2007 was handled by a separate governmental agency.

Since 2022 the Swedish National Debt Office is headed by Director General Karolina Ekholm, PhD in economics.

<doc id="194097" wikidata="Q2067944" url="?curid=194097" title="Philip Treacy">
<text>Philip Anthony Treacy (born 26 May 1967) is an Irish haute couture milliner, or hat designer, who has been mostly based in London for his career, and who was described by &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine as &quot;perhaps the greatest living milliner&quot;. In 2000, Treacy became the first milliner in eighty years to be invited to exhibit at the Paris haute couture fashion shows. He has won British Accessory Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards five times, and has received public honours in both Britain and Ireland. His designs have been displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In 1989, Treacy was discovered and then mentored by fashion editor Isabella Blow, whom Treacy described as the &quot;biggest inspiration&quot; on his life. Blow would wear and promote Treacy&#x27;s designs at important fashion events and helped Treacy to break into some of the main fashion houses, particularly Chanel and Givenchy. Treacy is associated with celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Madonna, and Sarah Jessica Parker. He has been associated with British royalty and has designed hats for royal occasions, including the fascinator (or &quot;pretzel hat&quot;) worn by Princess Beatrice in 2011. In 2024, Treacy was granted a royal warrant by Queen Camilla.

==Early life==
Philip Anthony Treacy was born on 26 May 1967 in the small village of Ahascragh, near Ballinasloe, in County Galway in the Republic of Ireland, whose population was circa 500. Treacy says that his interest in sewing started at age five, and that his obsession with the weddings in the Catholic church across the road from his house inspired an early passion for fashion. In 1985, at age 17, Treacy moved to Dublin to study fashion at the National College of Art and Design, where he spent a six-week work experience with British milliner Stephen Jones, and graduated in 1987. In 1988, Treacy won an MA scholarship for the Fashion Design course at the Royal College of Art in London, and graduated in 1990 with first class honours.

In 1989, he took one of his hats to Michael Roberts, fashion editor of &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine, and his style editor Isabella Blow. Blow asked Treacy to make a hat for her wedding, and soon after in 1990, invited him to live with her and her new husband Detmar Blow, in their Belgravia home in London, where Treacy worked in their basement. Alexander McQueen, another Blow discovery, also shared her Belgravia home.

In July 2002, the Design Museum in London, hosted an exhibition of the 30 most iconic hats Treacy had designed for Blow, titled: &quot;When Philip met Isabella&quot;. The exhibition was so well received that it went on a world tour for several years and drew an attendance of circa 43,000 when shown in Dublin in 2005. In a 2011 interview, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said: &quot;She made him famous. He made her look like an icon. When you think of the late, great Blow, you think of her in one of his creations, be it a giant disc or a replica sailing ship.&quot;

==Career==

===Haute couture===

In 1991, aged 23, Treacy got his &quot;big break&quot; when asked by Karl Lagerfeld to come to the Chanel showrooms in Paris for what was to be the start of a long-term working relationship; the meeting was held on the prompting of Blow. The first hat that Treacy designed for Chanel appeared on the cover of &quot;British Vogue&quot; worn by model Linda Evangelista; the hat was called &quot;Twisted Birdcage&quot; and was photographed by French fashion photographer, Patrick Demarchelier.

In 1991, Treacy opened his first showroom in London (pictured), and won the first of five British Accessory Designer of the Year awards. Two years later, Treacy held his first fashion show during London Fashion Week in Harvey Nichols, with Naomi Campbell, Yasmin Le Bon, Kate Moss, Christy Turlington and Stella Tennant modelling in return for keeping Treacy&#x27;s hats, all of which were black. In 1994, he opened up his boutique at 69 Elizabeth Street, in Belgravia, London, next door to Isabella Blow&#x27;s residence at number 67.

Treacy has designed hats for Alexander McQueen (another discovery of Isabella Blow), including his 1999 &quot;white collection&quot; for Givenchy in Paris, for Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, and for Valentino, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Versace and Rifat Ozbek. In January 2000, he became the first milliner for eighty years to be invited to exhibit at the Paris shows. In November 2015, &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine ran a feature of Treacy&#x27;s 20 &quot;most awe-inspiring chapeaux&quot; from the runways.

===Wider fashion===
Treacy has designed hats for films, including the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, and most notably the Beauxbatons hat for &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; in 2005. Sarah Jessica Parker has worn his hats at &quot;Sex and the City&quot; premieres (2008, 2011), and Met Galas (2013, 2015). Treacy designed Madonna&#x27;s gold headpiece for her 2012 Super Bowl XLVI halftime show. Lady Gaga described Treacy as &quot;the greatest milliner of all time&quot;, while hosting his 2012 London Week fashion show. Notable designs for Lady Gaga include a telephone-shaped headpiece with a removable handset hat, worn for her appearance on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; in 2010 (now in permanent display at Madame Tussauds), and a &quot;lightning-bolt&quot; hat she wore for the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards.

As well as Isabella Blow, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Lady Gaga, notable muses for Treacy&#x27;s hats are socialite Daphne Guinness, model Naomi Campbell, and singer, and model, Grace Jones, who used Treacy as art director and designer for her 2009 &quot;The Hurricane Tour&quot;.

In a July 2011 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Treacy distilled what he felt a hat should do (a Treacy quote which is often reproduced):

Treacy had previously written a piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in May 2001 on what defines the &quot;perfect hat&quot;.

===Royal occasions===
Treacy&#x27;s hats are also associated with English royalty, with thirty-seven worn at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, including the controversial fascinator-style hat worn by Princess Beatrice of York (pictured). This so-called &quot;pretzel hat&quot; was auctioned for charity by Princess Beatrice on eBay for $130,000 (£80,100) on 22 May 2011. Treacy felt the criticism regarding the &quot;pretzel hat&quot; was extreme (the hat had its own Facebook page with over 140,000 connections), and in July 2011 said: &quot;In the future, we&#x27;ll look back and think she looked wild&quot;. In a July 2018 &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; interview on BBC Radio 4, Treacy said of the backlash to his design: &quot;There was a moment where I thought I would find myself with my head on a spike outside the Tower of London&quot;. The hat is stored at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Treacy designed over twenty hats that were worn at the 19 May 2018 wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, including by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and by Oprah Winfrey. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, chose a Treacy hat for her first official royal event in December 2017.

In July 2018, Treacy credited the patronage of Elizabeth II with &quot;single-handedly saving the British hat industry&quot;.

In 2023, Treacy created the caps of maintenance for the three crowns used in the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

==Awards==

Treacy won the title of British Accessory Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards five times during the 1990s (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1997). In January 2000, Treacy was invited by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture to participate in Paris fashion shows, the first milliner to be invited in 80 years. In November 2004, Treacy was named the International Designer of the Year, at the China Fashion Awards in Shanghai. Treacy&#x27;s hats have been exhibited, and are housed in the collections of design museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the &quot;Galleria del Costume&quot; of the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine has described Treacy, on several occasions, as being one of the greatest milliners in the world.

Treacy has also been recognized outside of the world of fashion. In April 2006, he was awarded a Doctorate of Fine Arts, by the National University of Ireland at University College Dublin. He was awarded an honorary OBE (Order of the British Empire) for services to the British fashion industry by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall at a special ceremony in Clarence House in November 2007. Treacy designed the headdress worn by the Duchess of Cornwall for the couple&#x27;s wedding. In July 2010, Treacy was one of six contemporary and internationally renowned Irish fashion designers honoured by a set of Irish postage stamps issued by An Post. The other designers were Paul Costelloe, Louise Kennedy, John Rocha, Lainey Keogh and Orla Kiely.

==Personal life==
Treacy is gay and in May 2017 he married his long-term partner of over 21 years, Stefan Bartlett, in a ceremony in Las Vegas. Treacy is the second youngest of a large family and has one sister, and seven brothers. He is particularly close to his sister, Marion Tubbing, the eldest sibling, whom he credits with supplying him with editions of &quot;Harper&#x27;s and Queen&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; while living in Galway (Tubbing was working in London at the time), and to whom, along with his partner Bartlett, Treacy dedicated his 2015 biography: &quot;Philip Treacy: Hat Designer&quot;.

Treacy has also noted the support his parents gave him in pursuing his love of millinery, noting that his father would say: &quot;whatever makes him happy&quot;. Treacy&#x27;s father was a baker and his mother was a housewife, however, his father had a weak heart which prevented him from working as a full-time baker, and he eventually died when Treacy was age 11 from a heart attack; Treacy&#x27;s mother died in 1993 when he was 25. Treacy called his friendship with his mentor, Isabella Blow, &quot;an affair without sex&quot;. He has highlighted the importance of fashion model Grace Jones as a friend.

<text>Francisco Escárcega Márquez (2 January 1896 – 22 July 1938) was a builder of railroads in Mexico and fought in the Mexican Revolution. He was born in Nanacamilpa, Tlaxcala, and opened up areas in southern and eastern Mexico with railways. In 1938, he was in an aircraft crash in Palenque, Chiapas, while conducting aerial surveillance for a new railway. He survived the crash but died later of his injuries in Villahermosa, Tabasco.

Following his death, the town of Escárcega in the state of Campeche – at the time, a railway camp known as &quot;Kilómetro 47&quot; on the route from Coatzacoalcos to Campeche – was renamed in his honour.

<doc id="194103" wikidata="Q156351" url="?curid=194103" title="Cliché">
<text>A cliché ( or ; ) is a saying, idea, or element of an artistic work that has become overused to the point of losing its original meaning, novelty, or figurative or artistic power, even to the point of now being bland or uninteresting. In phraseology, the term has taken on a more technical meaning, referring to an expression imposed by conventionalized linguistic usage.

The term, which is typically pejorative, is often used in modern culture for an action or idea that is expected or predictable, based on a prior event. Clichés may or may not be true. Some are stereotypes, but some are simply truisms and facts. Clichés often are employed for comedic effect, typically in fiction.

Most phrases now considered clichéd originally were regarded as striking but have lost their force through overuse. The French poet Gérard de Nerval once said, &quot;The first man who compared woman to a rose was a poet, the second, an imbecile.&quot;

A cliché is often a vivid depiction of an abstraction that relies upon analogy or exaggeration for effect, often drawn from everyday experience. Used sparingly, it may succeed, but the use of a cliché in writing, speech, or argument is generally considered a mark of inexperience or a lack of originality.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;cliché&quot; is borrowed from French, where it is a past passive participle of &quot;clicher&quot;, &#x27;to click&#x27;, used as a noun; &quot;cliché&quot; is attested from 1825 and originated in the printing trades. The term &quot;cliché&quot; was adopted as printers&#x27; jargon to refer to a stereotype, electrotype, cast plate or block print that could reproduce type or images repeatedly. It has been suggested that the word originated from the clicking sound in &quot;dabbed&quot; printing (a particular form of stereotyping in which the block was impressed into a bath of molten type-metal to form a matrix). Through this onomatopoeia, &quot;cliché&quot; came to mean a ready-made, oft-repeated phrase.

=== Usage ===

Various dictionaries recognize a derived adjective &quot;clichéd&quot;, with the same meaning. &quot;Cliché&quot; is sometimes used as an adjective, although some dictionaries do not recognize it as such, listing the word only as a noun and &quot;clichéd&quot; as the adjective.

==Thought-terminating cliché==
Thought-terminating clichés, also known as thought-stoppers, or semantic stopsigns, are words or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic. They are typically short, generic truisms that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought. They are often sayings that have been embedded in a culture&#x27;s folk wisdom and are tempting to say because they &quot;sound&quot; true or good or like the right thing to say. Some examples are: &quot;Stop thinking so much&quot;, &quot;here we go again&quot;, and &quot;so what, what effect do my [individual] actions have?&quot;

The term was popularized by psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton in his 1961 book, &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of &quot;Brainwashing&quot; in China&quot;. Lifton wrote, &quot;The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis&quot;. Sometimes they are used in a deliberate attempt to shut down debate, manipulate others to think a certain way, or dismiss dissent. However, some people repeat them, even to themselves, out of habit or conditioning, or as a defense mechanism to reaffirm a confirmation bias.

<text>A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. 

The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities such as e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.

In cryptography, a PKI is an arrangement that &quot;binds&quot; public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a certificate authority (CA). Depending on the assurance level of the binding, this may be carried out by an automated process or under human supervision. When done over a network, this requires using a secure certificate enrollment or certificate management protocol such as CMP.

The PKI role that may be delegated by a CA to assure valid and correct registration is called a &quot;registration authority&quot; (RA). An RA is responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity making the request. The Internet Engineering Task Force&#x27;s RFC 3647 defines an RA as &quot;An entity that is responsible for one or more of the following functions: the identification and authentication of certificate applicants, the approval or rejection of certificate applications, initiating certificate revocations or suspensions under certain circumstances, processing subscriber requests to revoke or suspend their certificates, and approving or rejecting requests by subscribers to renew or re-key their certificates. RAs, however, do not sign or issue certificates (i.e., an RA is delegated certain tasks on behalf of a CA).&quot; While Microsoft may have referred to a subordinate CA as an RA, this is incorrect according to the X.509 PKI standards. RAs do not have the signing authority of a CA and only manage the vetting and provisioning of certificates. So in the Microsoft PKI case, the RA functionality is provided either by the Microsoft Certificate Services web site or through Active Directory Certificate Services that enforces Microsoft Enterprise CA, and certificate policy through certificate templates and manages certificate enrollment (manual or auto-enrollment). In the case of Microsoft Standalone CAs, the function of RA does not exist since all of the procedures controlling the CA are based on the administration and access procedure associated with the system hosting the CA and the CA itself rather than Active Directory. Most non-Microsoft commercial PKI solutions offer a stand-alone RA component.

An entity must be uniquely identifiable within each CA domain on the basis of information about that entity. A third-party validation authority (VA) can provide this entity information on behalf of the CA.

The X.509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificates.

== Capabilities ==

PKI provides &quot;trust services&quot; - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities, be they people or computers. Trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities: Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity (CIA).

Confidentiality: Assurance that no entity can maliciously or unwittingly view a payload in clear text. Data is encrypted to make it secret, such that even if it was read, it appears as gibberish. Perhaps the most common use of PKI for confidentiality purposes is in the context of Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a capability underpinning the security of data in transit, i.e. during transmission. A classic example of TLS for confidentiality is when using a web browser to log on to a service hosted on an internet based web site by entering a password.

Integrity: Assurance that if an entity changed (tampered) with transmitted data in the slightest way, it would be obvious it happened as its integrity would have been compromised. Often it is not of utmost importance to prevent the integrity being compromised (tamper proof), however, it is of utmost importance that if integrity is compromised there is clear evidence of it having done so (tamper evident).

Authenticity: Assurance that every entity has certainty of what it is connecting to, or can evidence its legitimacy when connecting to a protected service. The former is termed server-side authentication - typically used when authenticating to a web server using a password. The latter is termed client-side authentication - sometimes used when authenticating using a smart card (hosting a digital certificate and private key).

== Design ==

Public-key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to securely communicate on an insecure public network, and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures.

A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a system for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates, which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity. The PKI creates digital certificates that map public keys to entities, securely stores these certificates in a central repository and revokes them if needed.

A PKI consists of:

* A &quot;certificate authority&quot; (CA), which stores, issues and signs the digital certificates;
* A &quot;registration authority&quot; (RA), which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the CA;
* A &quot;central directory&quot;, a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed;
* A &quot;certificate management system&quot;, which manages things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued;
* A &quot;certificate policy&quot;, which states the PKI&#x27;s requirements concerning its procedures. Its purpose is to allow outsiders to analyze the PKI&#x27;s trustworthiness.

== Methods of certification ==

=== Certificate authorities ===
The primary role of the CA is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user. This is done using the CA&#x27;s own private key, so that trust in the user key relies on one&#x27;s trust in the validity of the CA&#x27;s key. When the CA is a third party separate from the user and the system, then it is called the Registration Authority (RA), which may or may not be separate from the CA. The key-to-user binding is established, depending on the level of assurance the binding has, by software or under human supervision.

The term trusted third party (TTP) may also be used for certificate authority (CA). Moreover, PKI is itself often used as a synonym for a CA implementation.

==== Certificate revocation ====

A certificate may be revoked before it expires, which signals that it is no longer valid. Without revocation, an attacker would be able to exploit such a compromised or mis-issued certificate until expiry. Hence, revocation is an important part of a public key infrastructure. Revocation is performed by the issuing certificate authority, which produces a cryptographically authenticated statement of revocation.

For distributing revocation information to clients, timeliness of the discovery of revocation (and hence the window for an attacker to exploit a compromised certificate) trades off against resource usage in querying revocation statuses and privacy concerns. If revocation information is unavailable (either due to accident or an attack), clients must decide whether to &quot;fail-hard&quot; and treat a certificate as if it is revoked (and so degrade availability) or to &quot;fail-soft&quot; and treat it as unrevoked (and allow attackers to sidestep revocation).

Due to the cost of revocation checks and the availability impact from potentially-unreliable remote services, Web browsers limit the revocation checks they will perform, and will fail-soft where they do. Certificate revocation lists are too bandwidth-costly for routine use, and the Online Certificate Status Protocol presents connection latency and privacy issues. Other schemes have been proposed but have not yet been successfully deployed to enable fail-hard checking.

==== Issuer market share ====
In this model of trust relationships, a CA is a trusted third party – trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate.

According to NetCraft report from 2015, the industry standard for monitoring active Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates, states that &quot;Although the global [TLS] ecosystem is competitive, it is dominated by a handful of major CAs — three certificate authorities (Symantec, Sectigo, GoDaddy) account for three-quarters of all issued [TLS] certificates on public-facing web servers. The top spot has been held by Symantec (or VeriSign before it was purchased by Symantec) ever since [our] survey began, with it currently accounting for just under a third of all certificates. To illustrate the effect of differing methodologies, amongst the million busiest sites Symantec issued 44% of the valid, trusted certificates in use — significantly more than its overall market share.&quot;

Following major issues in how certificate issuing was managed, all major players gradually distrusted Symantec-issued certificates, starting in 2017 and completed in 2021.

==== Temporary certificates and single sign-on ====

This approach involves a server that acts as an offline certificate authority within a single sign-on system. A single sign-on server will issue digital certificates into the client system, but never stores them. Users can execute programs, etc. with the temporary certificate. It is common to find this solution variety with X.509-based certificates.

Starting Sep 2020, TLS Certificate Validity reduced to 13 Months.

=== Web of trust ===
An alternative approach to the problem of public authentication of public key information is the web-of-trust scheme, which uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestations of those certificates. The singular term &quot;web of trust&quot; does not imply the existence of a single web of trust, or common point of trust, but rather one of any number of potentially disjoint &quot;webs of trust&quot;. Examples of implementations of this approach are PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and GnuPG (an implementation of OpenPGP, the standardized specification of PGP). Because PGP and implementations allow the use of e-mail digital signatures for self-publication of public key information, it is relatively easy to implement one&#x27;s own web of trust.

One of the benefits of the web of trust, such as in PGP, is that it can interoperate with a PKI CA fully trusted by all parties in a domain (such as an internal CA in a company) that is willing to guarantee certificates, as a trusted introducer. If the &quot;web of trust&quot; is completely trusted then, because of the nature of a web of trust, trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web. A PKI is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including PGP or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustworthiness of that enterprise&#x27;s or domain&#x27;s implementation of PKI.

The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP version 2.0:

=== Simple public key infrastructure ===
Another alternative, which does not deal with public authentication of public key information, is the simple public key infrastructure (SPKI), which grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of X.509 and PGP&#x27;s web of trust. SPKI does not associate users with persons, since the &quot;key&quot; is what is trusted, rather than the person. SPKI does not use any notion of trust, as the verifier is also the issuer. This is called an &quot;authorization loop&quot; in SPKI terminology, where authorization is integral to its design. This type of PKI is specially useful for making integrations of PKI that do not rely on third parties for certificate authorization, certificate information, etc.; a good example of this is an air-gapped network in an office.

=== Decentralized PKI ===

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) eliminate dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key management, which is the standard in hierarchical PKI. In cases where the DID registry is a distributed ledger, each entity can serve as its own root authority. This architecture is referred to as decentralized PKI (DPKI).

== History ==
Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ, where James Ellis, Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution. Because developments at GCHQ are highly classified, the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid-1990s.

The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie, Hellman, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman changed secure communications entirely. With the further development of high-speed digital electronic communications (the Internet and its predecessors), a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other, and as a further consequence of that, for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting.

Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used. With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread, the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute. Commercial reasons alone (e.g., e-commerce, online access to proprietary databases from web browsers) were sufficient. Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol (&#x27;https&#x27; in Web URLs); it included key establishment, server authentication (prior to v3, one-way only), and so on. A PKI structure was thus created for Web users/sites wishing secure communications.

Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market, started companies (or new projects at existing companies), and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability. An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations (see &quot;ABA digital signature guidelines&quot;), and shortly thereafter, several U.S. states (Utah being the first in 1995) and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations. Consumer groups raised questions about privacy, access, and liability considerations, which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others.

The enacted laws and regulations differed, there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation, and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be.

By the first few years of the 21st century, the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly. Operating procedures (manual or automatic) were not easy to correctly design (nor even if so designed, to execute perfectly, which the engineering required). The standards that existed were insufficient.

PKI vendors have found a market, but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid-1990s, and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated. PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to, and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others. PKI has had the most success in government implementations; the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program.

== Uses ==

PKIs of one type or another, and from any of several vendors, have many uses, including providing public keys and bindings to user identities, which are used for:
* Encryption and/or sender authentication of e-mail messages (e.g., using OpenPGP or S/MIME);
* Encryption and/or authentication of documents (e.g., the XML Signature or XML Encryption standards if documents are encoded as XML);
* Authentication of users to applications (e.g., smart card logon, client authentication with SSL/TLS). There&#x27;s experimental usage for digitally signed HTTP authentication in the Enigform and mod_openpgp projects;
* Bootstrapping secure communication protocols, such as Internet key exchange (IKE) and SSL/TLS. In both of these, initial set-up of a secure channel (a &quot;security association&quot;) uses asymmetric key—i.e., public key—methods, whereas actual communication uses faster symmetric key—i.e., secret key—methods;
* Mobile signatures are electronic signatures that are created using a mobile device and rely on signature or certification services in a location independent telecommunication environment;
* Internet of things requires secure communication between mutually trusted devices. A public key infrastructure enables devices to obtain and renew X.509 certificates, which are used to establish trust between devices and encrypt communications using TLS.

== Criticism ==

Some argue that purchasing certificates for securing websites by SSL/TLS and securing software by code signing is a costly venture for small businesses. However, the emergence of free alternatives, such as Let&#x27;s Encrypt, has changed this. HTTP/2, the latest version of HTTP protocol, allows unsecured connections in theory; in practice, major browser companies have made it clear that they would support this protocol only over a PKI secured TLS connection. Web browser implementation of HTTP/2 including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge supports HTTP/2 only over TLS by using the ALPN extension of the TLS protocol. This would mean that, to get the speed benefits of HTTP/2, website owners would be forced to purchase SSL/TLS certificates controlled by corporations.

Currently the majority of web browsers are shipped with pre-installed intermediate certificates issued and signed by a certificate authority, by public keys certified by so-called root certificates. This means browsers need to carry a large number of different certificate providers, increasing the risk of a key compromise.

When a key is known to be compromised, it could be fixed by revoking the certificate, but such a compromise is not easily detectable and can be a huge security breach. Browsers have to issue a security patch to revoke intermediary certificates issued by a compromised root certificate authority.

<text>The collodion process is an early photographic process. The collodion process, mostly synonymous with the &quot;collodion wet plate process&quot;, requires the photographic material to be coated, sensitized, exposed, and developed within the span of about fifteen minutes, necessitating a portable darkroom for use in the field. Collodion is normally used in its wet form, but it can also be used in its dry form, at the cost of greatly increased exposure time. The increased exposure time made the dry form unsuitable for the usual portraiture work of most professional photographers of the 19th century. The use of the dry form was mostly confined to landscape photography and other special applications where minutes-long exposure times were tolerable.

==History==
Gustave Le Gray first theorized about the collodion process, publishing a method in 1850 that was &quot;theoretical at best&quot;, but Frederick Scott Archer was credited with the invention of the process, which he created in 1848 and published in 1851. During the subsequent decades, many photographers and experimenters refined or varied the process. By the end of the 1860s, it had almost entirely replaced the first-announced photographic process, the daguerreotype.

During the 1870s, the collodion process was largely replaced by gelatin dry plates—glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin. Invented by Dr. Richard Leach Maddox in 1871, dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient, but it could also be made much more sensitive, greatly reducing exposure times. This marked the beginning of the modern era of photography.

One collodion process, the tintype, was in limited use for casual portraiture by some itinerant and amusement park photographers as late as the 1930s, and the wet plate collodion process was still in use in the printing industry in the 1960s for line and tone work, mostly printed material involving black type against a white background because, in large volumes, it was much cheaper than gelatin film.

==21st century==
The wet plate collodion process has undergone a revival as a historical technique in the twenty-first century. There are several practicing ambrotypes and tintypes who regularly set up and make images, for example at Civil War re-enactments and arts festivals. Fine art photographers use the process and its handcrafted individuality for gallery showings and personal work. There are several makers of reproduction equipment, and many artists work with collodion around the globe. The process is taught in workshops around the world and several workbooks and manuals are in print. Modern collodion artists include:

==Advantages==
The collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support (glass). This was an improvement over the calotype process, discovered by Henry Fox Talbot, which relied on paper negatives, and the daguerreotype, which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated. The collodion process thus combined desirable qualities of the calotype process (enabling the photographer to make a theoretically unlimited number of prints from a single negative) and the daguerreotype (creating a sharpness and clarity that could not be achieved with paper negatives). Collodion printing was typically done on albumen paper.

As collodion is a sticky and transparent medium and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet, it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography. When a metal plate is coated with collodion, charged with silver nitrate, exposed, and developed, it produces a direct positive image on the plate, although laterally reversed (left and right would be reversed, like in a mirror). When coated on glass, the image becomes negative and can be reproduced easily on photographic paper. This was a huge advantage over the daguerreotype, which was not directly reproducible. Wet plate/collodion is also a relatively inexpensive process compared to its predecessor, and does not require polishing equipment or the extremely toxic fuming boxes needed for the daguerreotype. With glass as the medium, the cost per image was also far less than special silver-plated copper plates, and more durable than paper negatives. The process was also very fast for the time, requiring only a few seconds to expose an image in daylight, rather than 30 seconds or more for other forms of photography available in the mid-1800s.

==Disadvantages==

The wet collodion process had a major disadvantage. The entire process, from coating to developing, had to be done before the plate dried. This gave the photographer no more than about 10-15 minutes to complete everything. This made it inconvenient for field use, as it required a portable darkroom. The plate dripped silver nitrate solution, causing stains and potentially explosive build-up of nitrate residue in the camera and plate holders.

The silver nitrate bath was also a source of problems. It gradually became saturated with alcohol, ether, iodide and bromide salts, dust, and various organic matter. It would lose effectiveness, causing plates to mysteriously fail to reproduce an image.

As with all preceding photographic processes, the wet-collodion process was sensitive only to blue and ultraviolet light. Warm colors appear dark, cool colors uniformly light. A sky with clouds is quite difficult to render, as the spectrum of white clouds contains about as much blue as the sky. Lemons and tomatoes appear shiny black, and a blue and white tablecloth appears plain white. Victorian sitters who in collodion photographs look as if they are in mourning might have been wearing bright yellow or pink.

==Use==
Despite its disadvantages, wet plate collodion became enormously popular. It was used for portraiture, landscape work, architectural photography, and art photography. The largest collodion glass plate negatives produced in the nineteenth century were made in Sydney, Australia, in 1875. They were made by the professional photographer Charles Bayliss with the help of a wealthy amateur photographer Bernhard Otto Holtermann, who also funded the project.

Bayliss and Holtermann produced four known glass negatives all of which were taken from Holtermann&#x27;s purpose-built camera in the tower of his mansion in North Sydney. Two were 160 x 96.5 cm (5.1 ft x 3.08 ft) and formed a panorama of Sydney Harbour from Garden Island to Miller&#x27;s Point. The other two were 136 x 95 cm (4.4 x 3.1 feet) and were of the Harbour and Garden Island and Longnose Point. Three of the four are now held by the State Library of New South Wales.

The wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process. World Wet Plate Day is staged annually in May for contemporary practitioners. Oskar Barnack Award winning photojournalist and contemporary collodion wet plate artist Charles Mason finds an artistic appeal in the uncertainty of the results of a wet plate photograph that cannot be recreated with modern digital photography. Mason says &quot;If you plan it, then it becomes contrived, If you just let it happen, it&#x27;s the gods helping you out.&quot; In 2018 Mason completed an artist-in-residency program with Denali National Park where he produced 24 collodion wet plate images of the park.

==Search for a dry collodion process==

The extreme inconvenience of exposing wet collodion in the field led to many attempts to develop a &quot;dry&quot; collodion process, which could be exposed and developed sometime after coating. A large number of methods were tried, though none were ever found to be truly practical and consistent in operation. Well-known scientists such as Joseph Sidebotham, Richard Kennett, Major Russell, and Frederick Charles Luther Wratten attempted but never met with good results.

Typically, methods involved coating or mixing the collodion with a substance that prevented it from drying quickly. As long as the collodion remained at least partially wet, it retained some of its sensitivity. Common processes involved chemicals such as glycerin, magnesium nitrate, tannic acid and albumen. Others involved more unlikely substances, such as tea, coffee, honey, beer, and seemingly unending combinations thereof.

Many methods worked to an extent; they allowed the plate to be exposed for hours, or even days, after coating. They all possessed the chief disadvantage, that they rendered the plate extremely slow. An image could require anywhere from three to ten times more exposure on a dry plate than on a wet plate.

==Collodion emulsion==

In 1864 W. B. Bolton and B. J. Sayce published an idea for a process that would revolutionize photography. They suggested that sensitive silver salts be formed in a liquid collodion, rather than being precipitated, in-situ, on the surface of a plate. A light-sensitive plate could then be prepared by simply flowing this emulsion across the surface of a glass plate; no silver nitrate bath was required.

This idea was soon brought to fruition. First, a printing emulsion was developed using silver chloride. These emulsions were slow, and could not be developed, so they were mostly used for positive printing. Shortly later, silver iodide and silver bromide emulsions were produced. These proved to be significantly faster, and the image could be brought out by development.

The emulsions also had the advantage that they could be &quot;washed&quot;. In the wet collodion process, silver nitrate reacted with a halide salt; potassium iodide, for example. This resulted in a double replacement reaction. The silver and iodine ions in the solution reacted, forming silver iodide on the collodion film. However, at the same time, potassium nitrate also formed, from the potassium ions in the iodide and the nitrate ions in the silver. This salt could not be removed in the wet process. However, with the emulsion process, it could be washed out after the creation of the emulsion.

The speed of the emulsion process was unremarkable. It was not as fast as the ordinary wet process, but was not nearly as slow as the dry plate processes. Its chief advantage was that each plate behaved the same way. Inconsistencies in the ordinary process were rare.

=== Phenotype ===
The &quot;phenotype&quot; (from Latin pannus = cloth) is a direct positive that, like the tintype, uses collodion emulsion from an underexposed image that is transferred to a dark surface so that transparent (unexposed) areas appear black and weak precipitated silver (highlights) appear brighter in reflected light, on the same principle as the daguerreotype and ambrotype. It was invented in 1852 by French photographer Jean Nicolas Truchelut, a pupil of Louis Daguerre and an itinerant daguerreotypist. Similar images on black waxed linen were displayed at the French Academy of Sciences by Wulff &amp; Co. in 1853. 

Various substrates were tried including wood, and Australian photographers Alfred R. Fenton and Frederick H. Coldrey patented a version on black leather in 1857 to create an unbreakable photograph that could be sent by mail. Various practitioners formulated, and some patented, their own recipes with the aim of good adhesion, but a disadvantage of using such supports was that flexing of the surface caused cracking and flaking of the emulsion so few historical examples survive. The process continued to be used until the 1880s but was being gradually displaced by the more durable tintype from the 1860s.

==Collodion emulsion preparation example==


Below is an example of the preparation of a collodion emulsion, from the late 19th century. The language has been adapted to be more modern, and the units of measure have been converted to metric.

# 4.9 grams of pyroxylin are dissolved in 81.3 ml of alcohol, and 148 ml of ether.
# 13 grams of zinc bromide are dissolved in 29.6 ml of alcohol. Four or five drops of nitric acid are added. This is added to half the collodion made above.
# 21.4 grams of silver nitrate are dissolved in 7.4 ml of water. 29.6 ml of alcohol are added. This is then poured into the other half of the collodion; the brominated collodion is dropped in, slowly, while stirring.
# The result is an emulsion of silver bromide. It is left to ripen for 10 to 20 hours until it attains a creamy consistency. It may then be used or washed, as outlined below.
# To wash, the emulsion is poured into a dish and the solvents are evaporated until the collodion becomes gelatinous. It is then washed with water, followed by washing in alcohol. After washing, it is redissolved in a mixture of ether and alcohol and is then ready for use.

Emulsions created in this manner could be used wet, but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process.
Collodion emulsion plates were developed in an alkaline developer, not unlike those in common use today. An example formula follows.
:Part A: Pyrogallic acid 96 g, alcohol 1 oz.
:Part B: Potassium bromide 12 g, distilled Water 30 ml
:Part C: Ammonium carbonate 80 g water 30 ml

When needed for use, mix 0.37 ml of A, 2.72 ml of B, and 10.9 ml of C. Flow this over the plate until developed. If a dry plate is used, first wash the preservative off in running water.
