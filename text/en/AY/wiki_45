<text>Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers is an American bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States. The company operates approximately 600 retail stores across all 50 U.S. states.

Barnes &amp; Noble operates mainly through its Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company&#x27;s headquarters are at 33 E. 17th Street on Union Square in New York City.

After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes &amp; Noble is the United States&#x27; largest national bookstore chain and the only national chain. Previously, Barnes &amp; Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Bookseller stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain in 2010. The company was also one of the nation&#x27;s largest manager of college textbook stores located on or near many college campuses when that division was spun off as a separate public company called Barnes &amp; Noble Education in 2015. 

The company is known by its customers for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e-readers and tablets. The company offers publishing and self-publishing services.

==History==

===19th century: Foundations===

Barnes &amp; Noble began in 1886 as a bookstore called Arthur Hinds &amp; Company, located at 4 Cooper Institute in the Cooper Union Building in New York City. In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble from Westfield, Massachusetts, who had graduated from Harvard College earlier that year, was hired to work there as a clerk.

In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds &amp; Noble.

===20th century: Expansion===

====1900–1919====
In 1901, Hinds &amp; Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street. In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles Barnes; the name of the store was changed to Barnes &amp; Noble soon after. Charles had previously opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois, in 1873, named the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company; William Barnes, however, divested himself of his ownership interest in his father&#x27;s business shortly before his partnership with Noble. (His father&#x27;s company would go on to become the Follett Corporation.) Although the flagship store once featured the motto &quot;Founded in 1873,&quot; the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection with Barnes &amp; Noble, save for the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.

====1920–1939====
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes&#x27; son, John Wilcox Barnes. Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72. In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved its flagship location to 18th Street and Fifth Avenue, which served as the company&#x27;s flagship location until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes &amp; Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.

====1940–1959====
In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak. It underwent a major renovation the following year. That decade, the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago. William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control. The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.

====1960–1979====
John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later. The business was then purchased in 1971 by Leonard Riggio, who has been credited as one of the founders, for $1.2 million. By then, it had been mismanaged and consisted only of &quot;a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue.&quot; The publishing operation was sold separately by Amtel to Harper &amp; Row. In 1974, Barnes &amp; Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in the United States to discount books, by selling &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers&#x27; list price. Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes &amp; Noble opened smaller discount stores, which were eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes &amp; Noble to reach new customers nationwide.

In November 1974, editors of the British-produced &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, claimed on the BBC One television program Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes &amp; Noble had overtaken that of London&#x27;s Foyles bookshop to become the world&#x27;s biggest bookstore.

====1980–1999====

Barnes &amp; Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million. Solveig Robinson, author of &quot;The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture&quot;, wrote that the purchase &quot;gave [Barnes &amp; Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore.&quot; The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States. B&amp;N&#x27;s critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers. The last B. Dalton stores ceased operations in January 2010.

In 1989, Barnes &amp; Noble purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop.

In September 1993, Barnes &amp; Noble became a publicly traded company by issuing $77 million worth of stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the BKS ticker symbol. The company remained on the stock exchange until August 2019 when Elliot Management purchased all of the company&#x27;s stock and took the company private.

Before Barnes &amp; Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called &quot;Trintex&quot;, a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company&#x27;s website was not launched until May 1997. BarnesandNoble.com went public in 1999.

===21st century: Operating in an electronic environment===

====2000s====
In 2004, it was reported that the reading of books was on the decline in America, with the number of non-reading adults increasing by 17 million between 1992 and 2002. Despite this, Barnes &amp; Noble claimed that its retail store business was expanding in the book market. Beginning in 1999, Barnes &amp; Noble owned GameStop, a video game and electronics retail outlet. The company distributed its shares in GameStop in late 2004, spinning it off into its own company in an attempt to simplify its corporate structure.

CEO Leonard Riggio stepped down in 2002, naming his younger brother and former acting chief executive of BarnesandNoble.com, Stephen Riggio, to succeed him. Some corporate governance experts noted that this appointment could potentially cause conflict of interest, but the company board noted that Riggio&#x27;s experience at the company made him the right person for the job. Stephen Riggio stepped down from the position in 2010.

====2010s====

In 2010, website president William Lynch was named CEO. He is credited with helping launch the company&#x27;s electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman. When Lynch resigned in mid-2013, he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year. Following the spinoff of Barnes &amp; Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire, who departed one year later. Demos Parneros was named Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer in April 2017 after having joined the company as Chief Operating Officer in November 2016; however, he was fired in July 2018 for &quot;company policy violations&quot; without severance and was immediately removed from the company&#x27;s board, at the advice of a law firm hired by Barnes &amp; Noble. On August 28, 2018, Parneros filed a lawsuit against Barnes &amp; Noble, claiming wrongful termination.

After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders, in 2011, Barnes &amp; Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in the United States. This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes &amp; Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers. Amazon has even opened its own physical bookstores, once again creating a second national bookstore chain.

Barnes &amp; Noble began reducing its overall presence in the 2010s, closing its original flagship store in early 2014. In mid-2014, the company announced it would separate its Nook Media division from its retail store division.

In February 2018, Barnes &amp; Noble permanently laid off 1,800 full time employees at an annual cost savings of $40 million per year. According to &quot;TechCrunch&quot;, the company essentially fired their entire full time staff at all their stores, who would be making an average of $22,000 per year (~$11 per hour), and were replaced by part time workers earning close to minimum wage.

In the 2018 fiscal year that ended in July, the company&#x27;s overall losses reached $17 million.

In early July 2018, Barnes &amp; Noble fired CEO Demos Parneros for an unspecified violation of company policy, which was later revealed to be over sexual harassment claims. It accused Pareneros of breaching his duties of loyalty and good faith and acting as a &quot;faithless servant&quot; by sexually harassing the female employee, bullying subordinates, and attempting to &quot;sabotage&quot; a potential acquisition of the New York-based company, and asserted that the company should therefore be entitled to claw back his salary, bonus, and other benefits during the period of his &quot;disloyal conduct&quot;.

On October 3, 2018, the board of directors announced that they would entertain offers to buy the company. Among the potential buyers was Leonard Riggio, who owned at the time approximately 19% of Barnes &amp; Noble stock. As a result of the news, the company&#x27;s stock price jumped by nearly 30%.

In August 2019, Elliott Investment Management acquired the company for approximately $683 million with James Daunt, the managing director of London-based Waterstones Booksellers Ltd., becoming CEO. James Daunt was to become CEO of both Waterstones and Barnes &amp; Noble and was to relocate from London to New York. On August 7, 2019, Barnes &amp; Noble became a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Elliott.

====2020s====
In March 2020, Barnes &amp; Noble announced that it would temporarily stop selling magazines and, likewise temporarily, close 400 of its 620 stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 12 Barnes &amp; Noble stores have closed completely following Elliott Advisors&#x27; takeover of the company. Daunt intends to overhaul the acquisition procedure, opting for centralized and reduced initial frontlist orders compared to previous years. In 2021, the company acquired Paper Source.

In April 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the company used the temporary closure of stores during the pandemic to refurbish them, and credited Daunt with turning around sales both in store and online. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Barnes &amp; Noble saw up to a 500% increase in graphic novel and manga sales. 

In June 2024, the company announced the purchase (via its TC Acquisition subsidiary) of The Tattered Cover, the small but iconic Denver-based independent chain of bookstores, for $1.83M. The deal keeps the current branding, locations, most employees and plans to operate in the spirit of longtime owner and First Amendment advocate, the late Joyce Meskis. The sale was approved by a bankruptcy court in July 2024.

The company opened 60 new locations in 2024. It announced in January 2025 that a location will be re-opened in downtown Washington D.C.

==Publishing==
Barnes &amp; Noble maintains a separate publishing business in addition to its retail stores and other entities. Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s publishing company got its start by reissuing inexpensive versions of out-of-print books, and made a push to expand the unit in 2003. The company saw success the following year; in September 2004, its book, &quot;Hippie&quot;, reached &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Barnes &amp; Noble often publishes and sells books at a lower cost than competitors, and sells lines of inexpensive books like &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble Classics&quot; and the leather-bound &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble Collectible Classics&quot; collection which it has published since 1992. In addition, the company has a second paperback series called the &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading&quot;. Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense&quot; by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies, and its reissued edition of &quot;The Columbia History of the World&quot; by John Garrity, has sold over 1 million copies.

The company has expanded business by acquiring several firms over the years, including J.B. Fairfax International in 1999, SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company, in 2001 and Sterling Publishing in 2003.

==Food service==
In 1993, Barnes &amp; Noble signed an agreement to serve Starbucks coffee in each of its existing and future cafes. In 2004, Barnes &amp; Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&amp;T Wi-Fi network). All stores offered Wi-Fi as of 2006 and as of July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.

In 2016, Barnes &amp; Noble announced plans to open four concept stores in 2017 that featured cafés twice the size of its usual food spots, as well as bars offering wine and beer. Restaurants would also include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The restaurants were expected to revive sales growth. Company executives planned to open additional concept stores if sales met expectations. The first stores were opened in Scarsdale, New York; Edina, Minnesota; Plano, Texas; and Folsom, California.

==Community involvement==
Barnes &amp; Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. The Barnes &amp; Noble located in Fairbanks, Alaska gave over $80,000 to the community between 2015 and 2018 through book fair fundraising programs. To promote nationwide literacy among 1st through 6th graders and encourage more reading and learning during the summer, Barnes &amp; Noble has implemented a summer challenge.

== &quot;The Barnes &amp; Noble Review&quot; ==

The Barnes &amp; Noble Review is an online magazine, hosted on Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s website, that publishes evaluations of both fiction and nonfiction works, along with essays, interviews, and pieces on other topics. It was launched in October 2007 by Barnes &amp; Noble CEO Steve Riggio and James Mustich Jr., publisher of the book catalog A Common Reader. Regular contributors to the magazine have included book critics Michael Dirda, Brooke Allen, Laura Miller, and Adam Kirsch, as well as prominent writers in fields outside of literary criticism, such as political journalists Chris Hayes and Ezra Klein, philosopher A. C. Grayling, music critic Robert Christgau, and cartoonist Ward Sutton. Miller, who has written for &quot;Salon&quot; and Mustich&#x27;s Common Reader, said, &quot;The reviews [at &quot;BNR&quot;] are the same as anywhere else&quot;, adding that the tone and length of the pieces evoke &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; rather than the less formal &quot;Salon&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s web traffic flourished during its first few years. According to Compete.com, it amassed 50,000 unique visitors in December 2009.

Some critics were originally skeptical of &quot;The Barnes &amp; Noble Review&quot;. Art Winslow, former literary editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, said that because Barnes &amp; Noble is a brand name, &quot;BNR&quot;″s contributors are effectively endorsing the corporation, and that the motives behind the publication undermine its integrity: &quot;Criticism&#x27;s content should be free of any commercialism. Barnes &amp; Noble has found another way to sell books, and that&#x27;s the &quot;Review&quot;. ... I wouldn&#x27;t write there.&quot; Mustich disputed the idea that the magazine serves as a corporate tactic: &quot;We counter that skepticism with quality. If people read the site, they can determine that we are doing what we purport to do. They have never tried to influence my judgment. The first attempt would have been the last.&quot;

==Barnes &amp; Noble Nook==

Barnes &amp; Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company, based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009, and was released November 30, 2009, for $259. On June 21, 2010, Barnes &amp; Noble reduced the Nook&#x27;s price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.

The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets with reading apps, such as Apple&#x27;s iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen. Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future. The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.

On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.

In November 2012, the technology publications &quot;Mashable&quot; and &quot;Techdirt&quot; criticized the license agreement with which Barnes &amp; Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer&#x27;s credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.

In June 2014, Barnes &amp; Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company, but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes &amp; Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business. Samsung and Barnes &amp; Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes &amp; Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake. Samsung and Barnes &amp; Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.

In March 2016, Barnes &amp; Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15. It continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.

In 2021, the company announced the release of a new 10-inch Android-based tablet, which is named the Nook 10&quot; HD, in a partnership with Lenovo, which is manufacturing the device.

==College bookstores spin-off==

Barnes &amp; Noble formerly had a subsidiary, Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers, that specialized in operating campus bookstores at colleges and university. In 2015, the college operations were spun off into a new separate company, Barnes &amp; Noble Education.

<doc id="191877" wikidata="Q1473883" url="?curid=191877" title="Raid (insecticide)">
<text>Raid is the brand name of a line of insecticide products produced by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, first launched in 1956.

The initial active ingredient was allethrin, the first synthetic pyrethroid. Raid derivatives aimed at particular invertebrate species can contain other active agents such as the more toxic cyfluthrin which is also a pyrethroid.
As of 2019 Raid Ant &amp; Roach Killer contains pyrethroids, imiprothrin, and cypermethrin; other products contain tetramethrin and prallethrin as active ingredients. Raid Flying Insect Killer, a spray, uses piperonyl butoxide and D-phenothrin.

The brand was sold as Ridsect for Malaysian market.

== &quot;Raid Kills Bugs Dead&quot; slogan ==
The product&#x27;s original advertising tagline from its introduction in 1956 until 2016, &quot;Raid Kills Bugs Dead&quot;, was created by the advertising agency Foote, Cone &amp; Belding. The phrase itself is often attributed to the poet Lew Welch, who worked for the agency at the time.

The line was first used in commerce in 1966 and was trademarked in 1986. Noted animation director Tex Avery was the producer of the first &quot;Kills Bugs Dead&quot; commercials. Artist Don Pegler developed the bug characters used in the US and continued animating them for forty years. Pegler &quot;codified the look, feel and animation&quot; of the weird insects that run in fear of Raid, according to Steve Schildwachter, executive vice-president at Draftfcb.

The slogan had been part of a successful, long-running advertising campaign. Conjuring up images of an Eliot Ness-style raid on an illegal bar during Prohibition, the television spots featured various anthropomorphic cartoon bugs (such as mosquitos, flies, cockroaches, ants, spiders (even though spiders technically are not bugs), etc.) plotting some silly scheme like invading a kitchen, or sometimes doing something like in a crime scene, or hanging out in some places, only to be attacked by the magical appearance of the product which swiftly dispatched the bugs to various giddily horrible deaths. The bugs would scream the brand&#x27;s name (&quot;RAAAIIIID!!??&quot;), and then a huge cartoon-style explosion would occur, presumably precipitating their demise. The bugs&#x27; voices were provided by Avery, Mel Blanc, Paul Frees, Larry Moran, Frank Welker, Tim Dadabo and Paul Hancock.

Similar campaigns have been run in other countries, either by dubbing the US cartoons or by producing local versions, including those for Baygon, another S.C. Johnson brand of insecticides.

==Illicit use==

In recent years, reports of the use of heavy duty bug sprays as an illicit drug have gained notoriety. Although products such as Raid are relatively safe to humans (when used as intended), the act of huffing, smoking, snorting, vaping, plugging, drinking and/or injecting Raid or other bug sprays can cause irreversible neurological damage, or even death.

In July 2019, it was announced that three people had died in West Virginia after overdosing on an unidentified wasp spray. Authorities have warned of a growing trend of ingesting bug spray in the southern United States, supposedly as a substitute for methamphetamine. Possible symptoms of ingesting bug poison include, but are not limited to: erratic behavior, nausea, headache, sore throat, extreme inflammation, redness of the hands and feet, auditory hallucinations, convulsions, coma, and death.

==Competition==
Raid&#x27;s main competitors in the insecticide market are Black Flag, Hot Shot, Mortein and Baygon (also sister brand).

<text>Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user&#x27;s ears. They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear. Headphones are also known as earphones or, colloquially, cans. Circumaural (around the ear) and supra-aural (over the ear) headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the drivers in place. Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces, consists of individual units that plug into the user&#x27;s ear canal; within that category have been developed cordless air buds using wireless technology. A third type are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open. In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of a headphone and microphone.

Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM radio. The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by switchboard operators, to keep their hands free. Initially, the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones.

Headphones exhibit a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities. Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles. Headphones that use cables typically have either a or phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some headphones are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to receive the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players. As a result of the Walkman effect, beginning in the 1980s, headphones started to be used in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit. Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and DJs, who use headphones to cue up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.

== History ==
Headphones grew out of the need to free up a person&#x27;s hands when operating a telephone. By the 1880s, soon after the invention of the telephone, telephone switchboard operators began to use head apparatuses to mount the telephone receiver. The receiver was mounted on the head by a clamp which held it next to the ear. The head mount freed the switchboard operator&#x27;s hands, so that they could easily connect the wires of the telephone callers and receivers. The head-mounted telephone receiver in the singular form was called a &quot;headphone&quot;. These head-mounted phone receivers, unlike modern headphones, only had one earpiece.

By the 1890s a listening device with two earpieces was developed by the British company Electrophone. The device created a listening system through the phone lines that allowed the customer to connect into live feeds of performances at theaters and opera houses across London. Subscribers to the service could listen to the performance through a pair of massive earphones that connected below the chin and were held by a long rod.

French engineer Ernest Mercadier in 1891 patented a set of in-ear headphones. The German company Siemens Brothers at this time was also selling headpieces for telephone operators which had two earpieces, although placed outside the ear. The Siemens Brothers headpieces looked similar to modern headphones. The majority of headgear used by telephone operators continued to have only one earpiece.

Headphones appeared in the emerging field of wireless telegraphy, which was the beginning stage of radio broadcasting. Some early wireless telegraph developers chose to use the telephone receiver&#x27;s speaker as the detector for the electrical signal of the wireless receiving circuit. By 1902 wireless telegraph innovators, such as Lee de Forest, were using two jointly head-mounted telephone receivers to hear the signal of the receiving circuit. The two head-mounted telephone receivers were called in the singular form &quot;head telephones&quot;. By 1908 the headpiece began to be written simply as &quot;head phones&quot;, and a year later the compound word &quot;headphones&quot; began to be used.

One of the earliest companies to make headphones for wireless operators was the Holtzer-Cabot Company in 1909. They were also makers of head receivers for telephone operators and normal telephone receivers for the home. Another early manufacturer of headphones was Nathaniel Baldwin. He was the first major supplier of headsets to the U.S. Navy. In 1910, motivated by his inability to hear sermons during Sunday service, he invented a prototype telephone headset. He offered it for testing to the navy, which promptly ordered 100 of them. Wireless Specialty Apparatus Co., in partnership with Baldwin Radio Company, set up a manufacturing facility in Utah to fulfill orders. These early headphones used moving iron drivers, with either single-ended or balanced armatures. The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm. The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves. The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor sound quality. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their impedance varied; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 ohms. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedances of 1,000 to 2,000 ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers. Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.

In 1958, John C. Koss, an audiophile and jazz musician from Milwaukee, produced the first stereo headphones.

Smaller earbud-type earpieces, which plugged into the user&#x27;s ear canal, were first developed for hearing aids. They became widely used with transistor radios, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the Regency TR-1. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to the radio anywhere. The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a piezoelectric crystal to produce sound. The 3.5 mm radio and phone connector, which is the most commonly used in portable applications today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964. Its popularity was reinforced by its use on the Walkman portable tape player in 1979.

== Applications ==


Wired headphones may be used with stationary CD and DVD players, home theater, personal computers, or portable devices (e.g., digital audio player/MP3 player, mobile phone), as long as these devices are equipped with a headphone jack. Cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as FM, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. These are battery-powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a silent disco.

In the professional audio sector, headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a DJ mixer, and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, DJs use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.

Wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35 mm (inch) and 3.5 mm phone connectors. The larger 6.35 mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5 mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35 mm and 3.5 mm devices.
As active component, wireless headphones tend to be costlier due to the necessity for internal hardware such as a battery, a charging controller, a speaker driver, and a wireless transceiver, whereas wired headphones are a passive component, outsourcing speaker driving to the audio source.

Some headphone cords are equipped with a serial potentiometer for volume control.

Wired headphones may be equipped with a non-detachable cable or a detachable auxiliary male-to-male plug, as well as some with two ports to allow connecting another wired headphone in a parallel circuit, which splits the audio signal to share with another participant, but can also be used to hear audio from two inputs simultaneously. An external audio splitter can retrofit this ability.

=== Applications for audiometric testing ===
Various types of specially designed headphones or earphones are also used to evaluate the status of the auditory system in the field of audiology for establishing hearing thresholds, medically diagnosing hearing loss, identifying other hearing related disease, and monitoring hearing status in occupational hearing conservation programs. Specific models of headphones have been adopted as the standard due to the ease of calibration and ability to compare results between testing facilities.

Supra-aural style headphones are historically the most commonly used in audiology as they are the easiest to calibrate and were considered the standard for many years. Commonly used models are the Telephonics Dynamic Headphone (TDH) 39, TDH-49, and TDH-50. In-the-ear or insert style earphones are used more commonly today as they provide higher levels of interaural attenuation, introduce less variability when testing 6,000 and 8,000 Hz, and avoid testing issues resulting from collapsed ear canals. A commonly used model of insert earphone is the Etymotic Research ER-3A. Circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range (8,000 Hz to 20,000 kHz). Along with Etymotic Research ER-2A insert earphones, the Sennheiser HDA300 and Koss HV/1A circum-aural earphones are the only models that have reference equivalent threshold sound pressure level values for the extended high frequency range as described by ANSI standards.

Audiometers and headphones must be calibrated together. During the calibration process, the output signal from the audiometer to the headphones is measured with a sound level meter to ensure that the signal is accurate to the reading on the audiometer for sound pressure level and frequency. Calibration is done with the earphones in an acoustic coupler that is intended to mimic the transfer function of the outer ear. Because specific headphones are used in the initial audiometer calibration process, they cannot be replaced with any other set of headphones, even from the same make and model.

== Electrical characteristics ==
Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.

=== Impedance ===
Headphones are available with high or low impedance (typically measured at 1 kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32 ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100–600 ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.

The impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.

Historically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500 ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. This means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external headphone amplifier may be beneficial.

=== Sensitivity ===
Sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in decibels of sound pressure level per milliwatt (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per volt (dB (SPL) / V). Both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably. As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using Ohm&#x27;s law:

:formula_1

Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage. For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square (RMS) voltage produces a maximum volume of 100 dB.

Pairing high-sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones. The maximum sound pressure level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120 dB. In contrast, the American Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends an average SPL of no more than 85 dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the European Union standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85 dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40–4,000 Hz noise) of no more than 100 dB to avoid accidental hearing damage. Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110 dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.

The sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125 dB/mW and usually measured at 1 kHz.

== Specifications ==
Headphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: &quot;circumaural (over-ear)&quot;, &quot;supra-aural (on-ear)&quot;, &quot;earbud&quot; and &quot;in-ear&quot;.

=== Connectivity ===

==== Wired ====
Wired headphones make a direct electrical connection to the source device using a cable, typically connected with a headphone jack.

==== Wireless ====
Modern wireless or cordless earphones have no cord connecting the two earphones to the source device or to each other; they receive audio by means of a wireless technology such as Bluetooth. In historical usage, &#x27;wireless&#x27; referred to a connection to a radio receiver, which was known as a wireless.

On some models both audio streams are transmitted to one earphone which forwards one stream to the other earphone. On other models each earphone receives its audio stream directly from the source device. The former arrangement has the advantage of being compatible with legacy systems while the latter arrangement has the advantage of causing less power drain in the earphone that has to forward one audio stream. 

Connection between the two earphones also being wireless may be referred to as true wireless stereo (TWS), offering longer battery life and complete transmission on left and right channels, avoiding possible source signal omission if only one is worn. 

=== Ear adaption ===

==== Circumaural ====

&quot;Circumaural headphones&quot; (sometimes called &quot;full size headphones&quot; or &quot;over-ear headphones&quot;) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over . Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.

==== Supra-aural ====

&quot;Supra-aural headphones&quot; or &quot;on-ear headphones&quot; have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.

==== Ear-fitting headphones ====

===== Earphones =====
Earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear, facing but not inserted in the ear canal. Earphones are portable and convenient, but many people consider them uncomfortable. They provide hardly any acoustic isolation and leave room for ambient noise to seep in; users may turn up the volume dangerously high to compensate, at the risk of causing hearing loss. On the other hand, they let the user be better aware of their surroundings. Since the early days of the transistor radio, earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices. They are sold at times with foam or rubber pads for comfort. (The use of the term &quot;earbuds&quot;, which has been around since at least 1984, did not hit its peak until after 2001, with the success of Apple&#x27;s MP3 player.)

===== In-ear headphones =====
In-ear headphones, also known as &quot;in-ear monitors (IEMs)&quot; or &quot;canalphones&quot;, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles.

The outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, aluminum, ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic. Some in-ear headphones utilize built-in microphones to allow some outside sound to be heard when desired.

Generic or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from silicone rubber, elastomer, or foam. Such plugs in lower-end devices may be interchangeable, which increases the risk of them falling off and getting lodged in the ear canal. Custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation.

Some wireless earphones include a charging case.

=== Open- or closed-back ===
Both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:
: Headphones having the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.
: They have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some believe the term &quot;semi-open&quot; is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.
: Closed-back (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.

=== Headset ===

A headset is a headphone combined with a microphone. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user&#x27;s mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.

==== Telephone headsets ====

Telephone headsets connect to a fixed-line telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the handset of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5 mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.

For older models of telephones, the headset microphone impedance is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound amplification for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or AC adaptors.

==== Communication headsets ====

Communication headsets are used for two-way communication and typically consist of a headphone and attached microphone. Such headsets are used in a variety of professions as aviation, military, sports, music, and many service-oriented sectors. They come in all shapes and sizes, depending on use, required noise attenuation, and fidelity of communication needed.

== Ambient noise reduction ==
Unwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active noise cancellation.

Passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12 dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15 dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25 dB.

Active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20 dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.

== Transducer technology ==
Headphones use various types of transducer to convert electrical signals to sound.

=== Moving-coil ===

The moving coil driver, more commonly referred to as a &quot;dynamic&quot; driver is the most common type used in headphones. It consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. A voice coil, a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like. When the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce sound waves.

=== Electrostatic ===

Electrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated PET film membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1,000 volts.

Due to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20 kHz. The high-frequency response means that the low-midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high-frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.

Electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100 V to over 1 kV, and are on the user&#x27;s head. Since the invention of insulators, there is no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant electric current, which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.

=== Electret ===
An electret driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However, the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009 to 2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a &quot;Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film&quot;, Frequency response chart readings can reach 50 kHz at 100 db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.

=== Planar magnetic ===
Planar magnetic (also known as orthodynamic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to planar magnetic loudspeakers.

A planar magnetic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets. A current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.

=== Balanced armature ===
A balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the left diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term &#x27;balanced&#x27;. As illustrated in the right diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound.
The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the &#x27;balance&#x27; position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during World War II for use in military sound powered telephones. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.

Today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage. They generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20 Hz and above 16 kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.

The earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.

=== Thermoacoustic technology ===
The thermoacoustic effect generates sound from the audio frequency Joule heating of the conductor, an effect that is not magnetic and does not vibrate the speaker.
In 2013 a carbon nanotube thin-yarn earphone based on the thermoacoustic mechanism was demonstrated by a research group in Tsinghua University. The as-produced CNT thin yarn earphone has a working element called CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip. Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.

=== Other transducer technologies ===
Transducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma or Ionic. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company&#x27;s speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.

Magnetostriction headphones, sometimes sold under the label &quot;Bonephones&quot;, work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via bone conduction. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are deaf for reasons that do not affect the nervous apparatus of hearing. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the mid-1980s, a French company called Audio Reference tried to market the Plasmasonic plasma headphone invented by Henri Bondar. There are no known functioning examples left. Due to the small volume of air in a headphone, the plasma or ionic transducer can become a full range driver although the high temperatures and voltages needed makes them very rare.

== Benefits and limitations ==

Headphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for privacy or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public library. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20 Hz within 3 dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15&quot; or 18&quot;) speaker driver to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with in-ear monitor headphones). Headphones&#x27; impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.

Marketed claims such as &#x27;frequency response 4 Hz to 20 kHz&#x27; are usually overstatements; the product&#x27;s response at frequencies lower than 20 Hz is typically very small.
Headphones are also useful for video games that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gunfire).

Although modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to stereo recordings since the release of the Walkman, there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard panned sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.

Binaural recordings use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2 kHz, often using a dummy head. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.

It is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.

Headsets can have ergonomic benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow call center agents to maintain better posture without needing to hand-hold a handset or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.

== Health and safety ==
=== Dangers and risks ===

Using headphones at a sufficiently high volume level may cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness. The headphone volume often has to compete with the background noise, especially in loud places such as subway stations, aircraft, and large crowds. Extended periods of exposure to high sound pressure levels created by headphones at high volume settings may be damaging to hearing; Nearly 50% of teenagers and young adults (12 to 35 years old) in middle and high income countries listen to unsafe levels of sound on their personal audio devices and smartphones. However, one hearing expert found in 2012 (before the worldwide adoption of smartphones as the main personal listening devices) that &quot;fewer than 5% of users select volume levels and listen frequently enough to risk hearing loss.&quot; The International Telecommunication Union recently published &quot;Guidelines for safe listening devices/systems&quot; recommended that sound exposure not exceed 80 decibels, A-weighted dB(A) for a maximum of 40 hours per week. The European Union have also set a similar limit for users of personal listening devices (80 dB(A) for no more than 40 hours per week) and for each additional increase of 3-dB in sound exposure, the duration should be cut in half (83 dB(A) for no more than 20 hours, 86 dB(A) for 10 hours per week, 89 dB(A) for 5 hours per week and so on. Most major manufactures of smartphones now include some safety or volume limiting features and warning messaging in their devices. though such practices have received mixed response from some segments of the buying who favor the personal choice of setting their own volume levels.

The usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, high-impedance equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones.

Some studies have found that people are more likely to raise volumes to unsafe levels while performing strenuous exercise. A Finnish study recommended that exercisers should set their headphone volumes to half of their normal loudness and only use them for half an hour.

Other than hearing risk, there is a general danger that listening to loud music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to injury and accidents. Noise-cancelling headphones add extra risk. Several countries and states have made it illegal to wear headphones while driving or cycling.

There have also been numerous reports of contact dermatitis due to exposure to in-ear headphones such as Apple AirPods. The contact dermatitis would be caused by in-ear headphones that contain gold, rubber, dyes, acrylates, or methacrylates. However, there have been no studies done to prove that exposure to in-ear headphones will cause contact dermatitis, rather that there is a correlation between in-ear headphone use and contact dermatitis cases.

=== Occupational health and safety ===
Hearing risk from headphones&#x27; use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job (i.e., pilots, call center and dispatch operators, sound engineers , firefighters, etc.) and hearing damage depends on the exposure time. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends sound exposure not exceed 85 dB(A) over 8 hour work day as a time-weighted average. NIOSH uses the 3-dB exchange rate often referred to as &quot;time-intensity tradeoff&quot; which means if sound exposure level is increased by 3 decibels, the duration of exposure should be cut in half. NIOSH published several documents targeted at protecting the hearing of workers who must wear communication headsets such as call center operators, firefighters, and musicians and sound engineers.

<doc id="191886" wikidata="Q275020" url="?curid=191886" title="Émile Combes">
<text>Émile Justin Louis Combes (; 6 September 183525 May 1921) was a French politician and freemason who led the Lefts Bloc (French: &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot;) cabinet from June 1902 to January 1905.

==Career==
Émile Combes was born on 6 September 1835, in Roquecourbe, Tarn, the sixth child of Jean Combes, a dressmaker, and Marie-Rose Bannesborn.

He first learned Latin from his public schoolteacher and then from his godfather and cousin, a priest named Jean Gaubert. Gabriel Merle, biographer of Émile Combes, describes Jean Gaubert: &quot;He has the prestige and authority of the priesthood and education. He is obeyed. And if he demands sacrifices, he also imposes them on himself. His insistence that one of his younger cousins should become a priest is astonishing. Having failed with Philippe around 1840 and Émile in 1847, he missed his last attempt with Henri around 1860.&quot;

Thanks to his knowledge of Latin, twelve-year-old Émile Combes entered the fourth year of the minor seminary in Castres. His godfather supported him financially through his studies, first at the seminary; then at the &quot;École des Carmes,&quot; an ecclesiastical school where future priests wishing to study at the Sorbonne were trained; and finally at the &quot;Grand Séminaire d&#x27;Albi&quot;, where Émile Combes wore the cassock and was tonsured. Here, his vocation to the priesthood was seen as unserious, and despite initial efforts to persist, he would abandon the idea before ordination.

His anti-clericalism would later lead him into becoming a Freemason. He was also in later life a spiritualist. He later took a diploma as a doctor of letters (1860). He then studied medicine and graduated in 1867, and setting up in practice at Pons in Charente-Inférieure. In 1881, he presented himself as a political candidate for Saintes, but was defeated. In 1885, he was elected to the senate by the &quot;département&quot; of Charente-Inférieure. He sat in the Democratic left, and was elected vice-president in 1893 and 1894. The reports which he drew up upon educational questions drew attention to him, and on 3 November 1895, he entered the Leon Victor Auguste Bourgeois cabinet as minister of public instruction, resigning with his colleagues on 21 April following.

==Prime minister==
He actively supported the Waldeck-Rousseau ministry, and upon its retirement in 1902, he was himself charged with the formation of a cabinet. In this, he took the portfolio of the Interior, and the main energy of the government was devoted to an anti-clerical agenda. The parties of the Left united upon this question in the &quot;Bloc republicain&quot;, supported Combes in his application of the law of 1901 on the religious associations, and voted the new bill on the congregations (1904). Under his guidance, France took the first definite steps toward the separation of church and state. By 1904, through his efforts, nearly 10,000 religious schools had been closed, and thousands of priests and nuns left France rather than be persecuted.

Combes was vigorously opposed by all the conservative parties, who saw the mass closure of church schools as a persecution of religion. Combes led the anti-clerical coalition on the left, facing opposition primarily organized by the pro-Catholic party &quot;Action libérale populaire&quot; (ALP). ALP had a stronger popular base, with better financing and a stronger network of newspapers, but had far fewer seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

Among people who looked with favor on his stubborn enforcement of the law, he was familiarly called &quot;le petit père&quot;. In October 1904, his Minister of War, General André, was uncovered &#x27;republicanizing&#x27; the army. He took the promotion process out of the hands of senior officers and handled it directly as a political matter. He used Freemasons to spy on the religious behavior of all 19,000 officers; they flagged the observant Catholics and André made sure they would not be promoted. Exposed as the &quot;Affaire Des Fiches&quot;, the scandal undermined support for the Combes government. It also undermined morale in the army, as officers realized that hostile spies examining their private lives were more important to their careers than their own professional accomplishments.

Finally, the defection of the Radical and Socialist groups induced him to resign on 17 January 1905, although he had not met an adverse vote in the Chamber. His policy was still carried on; and when the law of the separation of church and state was passed, all the leaders of the Radical parties entertained him at a noteworthy banquet in which they openly recognized him as the real originator of the movement.

==Later life==
The campaign for the separation of church and state was the last big political action in his life. While still possessed of great influence over extreme Radicals, Combes took but little public part in politics after his resignation from the premiership in 1905. He joined the Aristide Briand ministry in October 1915 as one of the five Elder Statesmen, but without portfolio.

According to Geoffrey Kurtz, the years of Émile Combes&#x27; administration were a period of social reform &quot;without equal&quot; during the era of the Third Republic, which included such reforms as an eight-hour day for miners, a ten-hour day for many workers, the lowering of mandatory military service from 3 to 2 years, the elimination of certain middle-class draft exemptions, and some modest public assistance for the chronically ill, the disabled, and the elderly. In 1903, safety standards were extended to shops and offices. In addition, a 1904 law &quot;pioneered assistance to the children of single mothers, ignoring invidious distinctions between married and single mothers, in order to prevent abandonment.&quot;

Combes died on 25 May 1921 in Pons, Charente-Maritime.

<doc id="191890" wikidata="Q201052" url="?curid=191890" title="American Idol">
<text>American Idol is an American singing competition television series created by Simon Fuller, produced by Fremantle North America and 19 Entertainment, and distributed by Fremantle North America. It aired on Fox from June 11, 2002, to April 7, 2016, for 15 seasons. It was on hiatus for two years until March 11, 2018, when a revival of the series began airing on ABC.

It started as an addition to the &quot;Idol&quot; format that was based on &quot;Pop Idol&quot; from British television, in which the programme&#x27;s first series, which was won by Will Young, ended over four months before the show began, as it later became one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents, with the winner determined by American viewers using phones, Internet platforms, and SMS text voting. The winners of the first twenty-two seasons, as chosen by viewers, are Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery, Phillip Phillips, Candice Glover, Caleb Johnson, Nick Fradiani, Trent Harmon, Maddie Poppe, Laine Hardy, Just Sam, Chayce Beckham, Noah Thompson, Iam Tongi, and Abi Carter.

&quot;American Idol&quot; employs a select panel of judges who critique the contestants&#x27; performances. The original judges, for seasons one through eight, were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson, singer and choreographer Paula Abdul, and music executive and manager Simon Cowell. The judging panel for the last three seasons on Fox consisted of singers Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick Jr. Season sixteen brought three new judges: singers Luke Bryan, Katy Perry, and Lionel Richie. Beginning in the twenty-third season, Underwood will replace Perry, alongside returning judges Bryan and Richie. The show has been hosted by television presenter Ryan Seacrest throughout its run, apart from the show&#x27;s inaugural season when comedian Brian Dunkleman joined Seacrest as co-host.

The success of &quot;American Idol&quot; has been described as &quot;unparalleled in broadcasting history&quot;. A rival TV executive said the series was &quot;the most impactful show in the history of television&quot;. It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, in its first ten years, &quot;&quot;Idol&quot; has spawned 345 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson, Clay Aiken, Adam Lambert, and Jordin Sparks while remaining a TV ratings juggernaut.&quot; For an unprecedented eight consecutive years, from the 2003–04 television season through the 2010–11 season, either its performance show or result show was ranked number one in U.S. television ratings.
==History==

&quot;American Idol&quot; was based on the British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot; created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition &quot;Popstars&quot;. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain. Fuller was inspired by the idea from &quot;Popstars&quot; of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time. &quot;Pop Idol&quot; debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunnerthe executive producer and production leaderand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.

In 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including UPN and Fox. However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox&#x27;s parent company, was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, Elisabeth, who had seen the British show. Although Fox&#x27;s executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show. The show was renamed &quot;American Idol: The Search for a Superstar&quot; and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer. With its successful launch in the summer, the show was then moved to January and expanded. The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show on U.S. television, a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons until 2011.

However, after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in 2012, with rating falls of over 20% each season, the fifteenth season would be its last on Fox, ending its run in April 2016. In May 2017, ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the 2017–18 television season. The first season of the revived series, or the sixteenth season overall, started airing in March 2018. Seven seasons have been aired on ABC as of May 2024.

==Judges and hosts==
===Judges===
The show had originally planned on having four judges following the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell. A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing &quot;image concerns.&quot; In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew after only a few days of auditions, due to being uncomfortable with giving out criticism. The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.

In the eighth season, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. Abdul left the show in 2009, after the eighth season, as a result of failing to agree to terms with the show producers. Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul for the ninth season, but left in 2010 after just one season. DioGuardi was let go from &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2010 after two seasons, as producers favored a return to the three-person judges panel previously used prior to DioGuardi&#x27;s appearance on the show. Cowell also left the show in 2010 to introduce the American version of his show &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2011. Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth.

Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in the tenth season, but both left in 2012 after two seasons. Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. They were replaced by three new judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban, who joined Jackson in the twelfth season. However, both Carey and Minaj left after one season. Jackson also departed the judges table after twelve seasons, but would return as the in-house mentor for the thirteenth season in 2014, after which he left the show permanently.

Urban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. After a one-season hiatus, Lopez returned to &quot;American Idol&quot; for the thirteenth season, and was joined by former mentor Harry Connick Jr. After this, Lopez, Urban, and Connick Jr. remained on the show until its cancellation after the fifteenth season in 2016.

When the show was revived by ABC in 2018, Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie were selected as judges, marking the sixteenth season of &quot;Idol&quot;. Bryan and Richie have remained on the show since, while Perry left the show in May 2024 after seven seasons. On July 31, 2024, published reports announced former &quot;Idol&quot; winner Carrie Underwood as Perry&#x27;s replacement, joining Bryan and Richie for the twenty-third season.

Guest judges may occasionally be introduced. In the second season, guest judges such as Richie and Gladys Knight were used, and in the third season, Donna Summer, Quentin Tarantino, Gloria Estefan, and some of the mentors also joined as judges to critique the performances in the final rounds. Guest judges were sporadically used during the audition rounds: Gene Simmons, LL Cool J, Brandy, Mark McGrath, and Kenny Loggins in the fourth season; Carole Bayer Sager, Jewel, and Olivia Newton-John in the sixth season; Shania Twain, Neil Patrick Harris, Avril Lavigne, Mary J. Blige, Joe Jonas, Kristin Chenoweth, Victoria Beckham, and Perry in the ninth season (substituting in the vacant chair, before DeGeneres was hired); and Adam Lambert filled in for Urban at one audition location during the fourteenth season. In the ABC version, two instances occurred during the live shows: Abdul filled in for Bryan on one episode of the nineteenth season, while Alanis Morissette and Ed Sheeran filled in for Perry and Richie on an episode of the twenty-first season.

===Hosts===

The first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman, following the format of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter, resulting in Seacrest becoming the sole emcee starting with the second season in 2003.

Seacrest has remained as sole host of &quot;American Idol&quot; ever since, with the exception of the two-year hiatus between 2016 and 2018 as well as April 8, 2019, during the seventeenth season, when Bobby Bones subbed for Seacrest after the latter fell ill. Dunkleman did, however, return for the initial series finale on Fox in 2016 as a guest.

==Selection process==

In a series of steps, the show selected the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants.

===Contestant eligibility===
The eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage (in previous years by the audition stage).
===Initial auditions===
For the first eighteen seasons, contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show&#x27;s producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sing in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television. Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10 and 60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood (the average total is between 150 and 200).

From the nineteenth season onwards, contestants request a Zoom interview and audition remotely for the show&#x27;s producers. If the audition goes well, they will then invite the contestants to audition in front of the judges, in one of the audition cities.

===Hollywood week===
Once in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together. In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a banddepending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round. In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.

In the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists. At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty. In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called &quot;Hollywood or Home&quot; was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood. In the fourteenth season, the &quot;Hollywood or Home&quot; round was dropped, and a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at the House of Blues or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24. In the seventeenth and eighteenth seasons, the showcase round took place in Hawaii. From the nineteenth season onward, a showstopper round was used.

===Audience voting===
From the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant&#x27;s performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant&#x27;s telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers. One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110 million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&amp;T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5 million text messages were sent to &quot;American Idol&quot; that season. The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178 million texts by the eighth season. Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.

===Semi-finals===
In the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.

From the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.

The wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward – the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer – for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at The Fillmore Detroit, starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the same process was repeated again. However, instead of a top 24, it&#x27;s a top 20, the contestants performed at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes. In the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the top 20 performed at their homes, and based on the vote, half of the top 20 would advance to the top 10, and the other half would be eliminated. However, a wild card was given to one of the bottom 10 to save them from elimination. In the nineteenth season, the show used a combination of the process from the sixteenth and fourteenth seasons. In the twentieth season, the show repeated the process from the previous season, but they used a top 20 instead of a top 16, and there were no all star duets. In the twenty-first season, the same process was repeated, but they started with a top 26 instead of a top 24. In the twenty-second season, the show repeated the process from the twentieth season.

===Finals===
The finals are broadcast in primetime from Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience (except the eighteenth season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). From 2002 to 2019 and from 2021 to 2022, the venue was CBS Television City. Starting in 2023, it changed to Red Studios. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more general themes such as &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one hits or songs from the contestant&#x27;s year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. From the tenth to twelfth seasons, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.

The most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two. The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant&#x27;s time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the sixth season, during the series&#x27; first ever Idol Gives Back episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, from the eighth to the fourteenth seasons, and the seventeenth season onward, the judges may overturn viewers&#x27; decision with a &quot;Judges&#x27; Save&quot; if they unanimously agreed to. &quot;The save&quot; could only be used once, and only up through the Top 5. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.

The &quot;Fan Save&quot; was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.

===Season finale===
During the original run of &quot;American Idol&quot; on Fox, the finale week consisted of a one-hour long final performance night and a two-hour last episode of the season that culminates in revealing the winner, both of which are broadcast live in the U.S. Eastern and Central time zones. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, which holds an audience of over 7,000. Since the show&#x27;s reboot on ABC, the venue remains the same throughout the entire show (excluding auditions), but was still two episodes in the sixteenth season, and then stretched to a single three-hour season finale that is annually aired live simultaneously in all U.S. territories, starting with the seventeenth season. The eighteenth-season finale was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Rewards for winner and finalists===
The winner usually receives a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums, and secures a management contract with &quot;American Idol&quot;-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to the ninth season reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner. At first the contract came with a $250,000-plus advance, but dropped to about $62,500 over the Fox years. All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, had also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in the eleventh season, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal. BMG/Sony (first through ninth seasons), UMG (tenth through fifteenth seasons), and Disney Music Group&#x27;s Hollywood Records (sixteenth through eighteenth seasons) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season&#x27;s finale. In the fourteenth and fifteenth seasons, the winner was signed with Big Machine Records. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants&#x27; albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in the tenth and twelfth seasons, 5 in the fourteenth season, and 7 in the sixteenth season) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.

==Series overview==

==Season synopses==
Each season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden or platinum ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.

With the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is Kris Pooley, who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the &quot;American Idol&quot; band was led by Rickey Minor (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and Ray Chew (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons, with the tenth, eleventh and thirteenth-season finales aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. Since the sixteenth season, the show has been airing on Sundays and Mondays.

===2002–2016: Fox===
====Season 1 (2002)====
The first season of &quot;American Idol&quot; debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell served as judges.

In the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show&#x27;s age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital. Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.

The final showdown was between Justin Guarini, one of the early favorites, and Kelly Clarkson. Clarkson was not initially thought of as a contender, but impressed the judges with some good performances in the final rounds, such as her performance of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Natural Woman&quot;, and Betty Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Stuff Like That There&quot;, and eventually won the crown on September 4, 2002.

In what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, &quot;A Moment Like This&quot;, went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become one of the most successful &quot;Idol&quot; contestants internationally, with worldwide album sales of more than 25 million.

Starting September 30, 2006, this season was repackaged as &quot;American Idol Rewind&quot; and syndicated directly to stations in the U.S.

====Season 2 (2003)====
Following the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show&#x27;s budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Ryan Seacrest as the lone host. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season.

Corey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation. Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modeled for an adult website.

The season finale drew more than 38 million viewers, marking &quot;Idol&quot;&#x27;s biggest audience ever for a single episode. Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through. In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.

Both finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard&#x27;s coronation song &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; with his single release from the show &quot;This Is the Night&quot;, as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.

====Season 3 (2004)====
The third season premiered on January 19, 2004. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;She Bangs&quot; received widespread attention. His exposure on &quot;Idol&quot; landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third bestselling singer from that season.

Much media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated. Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes &quot;incredibly racist&quot;. The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke &#x27;blown out of proportion&#x27;.

The performance of &quot;Summertime&quot; by Barrino, later known simply as &quot;Fantasia&quot;, at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite &quot;Idol&quot; moment in the nine seasons he was on the show. Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single &quot;I Believe&quot;, a song co-written by the first season finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released &quot;Dreams&quot;.

====Season 4 (2005)====
The fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This was the first full season of the series to be aired in high definition; the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season, and among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, the two rockers of the show.

The top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing &#x27;personal reasons&#x27; and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Fremantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.

During the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants&#x27; telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.

In May 2005, Underwood was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song &quot;Inside Your Heaven&quot;, with Underwood&#x27;s version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful &quot;Idol&quot; contestant in the U.S., selling 16 million albums in the country, while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.

====Season 5 (2006)====
The fifth season began on January 17, 2006. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. It remains the highest-rated season in the show&#x27;s run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.

Chris Daughtry&#x27;s performance of Fuel&#x27;s &quot;Hemorrhage (In My Hands)&quot; on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel&#x27;s new lead singer, an invitation he declined. His performance of Live&#x27;s version of &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live. He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.

On May 30, 2006, Taylor Hicks was named &quot;American Idol&quot;, with Katharine McPhee the runner-up. &quot;Do I Make You Proud&quot; was released as Hicks&#x27; first single and McPhee&#x27;s was &quot;My Destiny&quot;.

Despite being eliminated earlier in the season, Chris Daughtry (as lead of the band Daughtry) became the most successful recording artist from this season. Other contestants, such as Hicks, McPhee, Bucky Covington, Mandisa, Kellie Pickler, and Elliott Yamin have had varying levels of success.

====Season 6 (2007)====
The sixth season began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3 million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41 million viewers.

Teenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season&#x27;s most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo, and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on the Top 7 results, Sanjaya was voted off.

This season saw the first &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76 million in corporate and viewer donations. No contestant was eliminated that week, but two (Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson) were eliminated the next.

In the May 23 season finale, Jordin Sparks was declared the winner with the runner-up being Blake Lewis. Sparks has had some success as a recording artist post-&quot;Idol&quot;.

This season also saw the launch of the &quot;American Idol&quot; Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the &quot;coronation song&quot;. Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, &quot;This Is My Now&quot;, was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.

====Season 7 (2008)====
The seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. The media focused on the professional status of the seventh season contestants, the so-called &#x27;ringers&#x27;, many of whom, including Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson, had prior recording contracts. Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.

For the finals, &quot;American Idol&quot; debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook&#x27;s performance of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook&#x27;s own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell&#x27;s version. Cornell himself said he was &#x27;flattered&#x27; and praised David Cook&#x27;s performance. David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.

David Archuleta&#x27;s performance of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget. Jason Castro&#x27;s semi-final performance of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley&#x27;s version of the song to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; digital song chart. This was the first season in which contestants&#x27; recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants&#x27; songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.

&quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64 million for charity.

The finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.

The &quot;American Idol&quot; Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the &quot;coronation song&quot;. The winning song, &quot;The Time of My Life&quot;, was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.

====Season 8 (2009)====
The eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. This season featured the first major change to the judging panel; a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants&#x27; personal life.

This was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.

There were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the &quot;Judges&#x27; Save&quot;, and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.

The two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season. It was claimed, and then later retracted, that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen&#x27;s home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&amp;T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.

Both Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, &quot;No Boundaries&quot; which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status.

====Season 9 (2010)====

The ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi, and Simon Cowell returned as judges. Paula Abdul left the show and Ellen DeGeneres replaced Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week. One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General Larry Platt whose performance of &quot;Pants on the Ground&quot; became a viral hit song.

Crystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized. The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.

Michael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges&#x27; Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first &quot;Idol&quot; alum to do so. &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.

A special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show&#x27;s past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.

The final two contestants were Lee DeWyze and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song – DeWyze chose U2&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, and Bowersox chose Patty Griffin&#x27;s &quot;Up to the Mountain&quot;. This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.

====Season 10 (2011)====
The tenth season premiered on January 19, 2011. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, who left the show on her own accord.

Randy Jackson was the only judge from the ninth season to return for the tenth. Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M label group, the new partner of &quot;American Idol&quot;, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors, although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyoncé, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.

The tenth season is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace. Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.

One of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancée received widespread coverage. Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated.

Pia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former &quot;Idol&quot; contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks. After &quot;Idol&quot;, Jennifer Lopez helped guide her career.

The two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win &quot;American Idol&quot;. McCreery released his first single, &quot;I Love You This Big&quot;, as his coronation song, and Alaina released &quot;Like My Mother Does&quot;. McCreery&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Clear as Day&quot;, became the first debut album by an &quot;Idol&quot; winner to reach No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since Ruben Studdard&#x27;s &quot;Soulful&quot; in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

====Season 11 (2012)====
The eleventh season premiered on January 18, 2012. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, and Randy Jackson returned as judges. One more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, which was later revealed to be Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants. Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests.

Finalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones. He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain. He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.

Jessica Sanchez received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their &quot;save&quot; option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.

Phillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. During the finale, fifth season finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to third season runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage – which she accepted.

Phillips released &quot;Home&quot; as his coronation song, while Sanchez released &quot;Change Nothing&quot;. Phillips&#x27; &quot;Home&quot; has since become the best selling of all coronation songs, with over 5 million copies sold.

====Season 12 (2013)====
The twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Randy Jackson returned as a judge. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. Randy Jackson was the only judge from the eleventh season to return for the twelfth. This season&#x27;s judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj.

This was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.

The top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show&#x27;s history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges&#x27; &quot;save&quot; was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.

23-year-old Candice Glover won the season with Kree Harrison taking the runner-up spot. Glover became the first female to win &quot;American Idol&quot; since Jordin Sparks, who won the show in 2007. Glover released &quot;I Am Beautiful&quot; as a single while Harrison released &quot;All Cried Out&quot; immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.

Towards the end of the season, Randy Jackson, the last remaining of the original judges, announced he would no longer serve as a judge to pursue other business ventures. Both judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj also decided to leave after one season to focus on their music careers.

====Season 13 (2014)====
The thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014. Ryan Seacrest returned as host and Keith Urban returned as a judge. Urban was the only judge from the twelfth season to return as a judge for the thirteenth season. Randy Jackson returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Connick Jr. served as a mentor for &quot;Idol&quot; in 2010 and 2012. Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.

This was the first season where the contestants were permitted to perform in the final rounds songs they wrote themselves. In the Top 8, Sam Woolf received the fewest votes, but he was saved from elimination by the judges. The 500th episode of the series was the Top 3 performance night.

Caleb Johnson was named the winner of the season, with Jena Irene as the runner-up. Johnson released &quot;As Long as You Love Me&quot; as his coronation single while Irene released &quot;We Are One&quot;.

====Season 14 (2015)====
The fourteenth season premiered on January 7, 2015. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, and Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. returned for their respective fourth, third and second seasons as judges. Eighth season runner-up Adam Lambert filled in for Urban during the New York City auditions. Randy Jackson did not return as the in-house mentor and left the show permanently. Scott Borchetta replaced Jackson as the mentor.

Changes this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten. Coca-Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role. The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records.

Nick Fradiani won the season, defeating Clark Beckham. Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region. Fradiani released &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; as his coronation single while Beckham released &quot;Champion&quot;. Jax, the third place finalist, also released a single called &quot;Forcefield&quot;.

====Season 15 (2016)====
Fox announced on May 11, 2015, that the fifteenth season would be the final season of &quot;American Idol&quot;; as such, the season was expected to have an additional focus on the program&#x27;s alumni. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning as judges. The fifteenth season premiered on January 6, 2016. The season was shortened by four weeks compared to previous years. During the finale episode, President Barack Obama praised the millions of young people that voted for contestants and pitched that they vote in the upcoming election. The farewell season concluded on April 7, 2016. Seacrest signed off by saying: &quot;And one more time—this is so tough—we say to you from Hollywood, goodnight America&quot;, and then he added, &quot;for now.&quot;

Trent Harmon won the season against runner-up La&#x27;Porsha Renae. Harmon released &quot;Falling&quot; co-written by Keith Urban as his coronation song. Renae&#x27;s &quot;Battles&quot;, third-place finisher Dalton Rapattoni&#x27;s &quot;Strike A Match&quot; and fourth-place finisher MacKenzie Bourg&#x27;s &quot;Roses&quot; were also released as singles.

===2018–present: ABC revival===
In early 2017, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox. A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans. In May 2017, ABC was making a bid to revive the program. ABC acquired the rights to the series, and &quot;American Idol&quot; returned for the 2017–18 television season.

====Season 16 (2018)====
In July 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would return as host, and by September 2017 it was revealed that Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie would serve as judges. The sixteenth season premiered on March 11, 2018. This was the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot; to air on ABC. The season was again shortened compared to the previous season to twelve weeks, with multiple elimination in the final rounds. Unlike previous seasons where only two finalists remained in the final episode, three finalists performed in the finale. On May 21, 2018, the season concluded with Maddie Poppe crowned the winner, beating Caleb Lee Hutchinson as runner-up and Gabby Barrett in third place. Her winning song was &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot;. Caleb Lee Hutchinson released &quot;Johnny Cash Heart&quot; as a single, while Gabby Barrett&#x27;s song was &quot;Rivers Deep&quot;.

====Season 17 (2019)====
ABC renewed the revival series for another season. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges. The seventeenth season premiered on March 3, 2019. For the finale, the show no longer features separate performance and result shows. On May 19, 2019, the season concluded with three finalists, with Madison VanDenburg eliminated in third place after performing two songs, and the final two performing their last song. For the first time, there were no separate performance and grand finale shows this season. Laine Hardy was crowned the winner and Alejandro Aranda runner-up. Hardy released a single, &quot;Flame&quot;, immediately after the win, but Aranda did not. However, Aranda later released a song he performed in the finale, &quot;Tonight&quot;, under the name Scarypoolparty on June 28, 2019.

==== Season 18 (2020) ====

On May 13, 2019, the series was renewed for an eighteenth season and it premiered on February 16, 2020. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges. For the first time, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, from the top 20 to the finale, the contestants performed in their own homes, while Ryan Seacrest hosted the show remotely in his own home in Los Angeles with the judges also in their respective homes. The season was also further truncated, with the top 5 performing in the finale. Each finalist also performed only two songs for the finale. On May 17, the season concluded, with Just Sam crowned as the winner, with Arthur Gunn finishing as the runner-up. &quot;Rise Up&quot;, the song Just Sam performed for their audition and reprised on the finale, was released as their debut song.

====Season 19 (2021)====

On May 15, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a nineteenth season and it premiered on February 14, 2021. Seacrest returned as host, and Bryan, Perry and Richie returned as judges.

==Reception==
===U.S. television ratings===
Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;American Idol&quot;. It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years, or eight consecutive (and total) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall.
:&quot;Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.&quot;

&quot;American Idol&quot; premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9 million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year. The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23 million, with more than 40 million watching some part of that show. That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 18–49 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.

The growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million. The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18–49 age group. The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever &quot;American Idol&quot; episode at 38.1 million for the final hour. By the third season, the show had become the top show in the 18–49 demographic&lt;ref name=&quot;realitytvworld_5/24/2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including the tenth season, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings. By the fourth season, &quot;American Idol&quot; had become the most-watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million. The show reached its peak in the fifth season with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and this season remains the highest-rated of the series.

The sixth season premiered with the series&#x27; highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of &quot;American Idol.&quot; During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before, as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The show was dubbed &quot;the Death Star&quot;, and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses. However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.

The loss of viewers continued into the seventh season. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers, and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18–34 demo since the first season in 2002. However, the ratings rebounded for the seventh-season finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over the sixth season as the series&#x27; third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network. Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from the sixth season, which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.

The declining trend however continued into the eighth season, as total viewers numbers fell by 5–10% for early episodes compared to the seventh season, and by 9% for the finale. In the ninth season, &quot;Idol&quot; six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat &quot;Idol&quot; in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over &quot;Idol&quot;&#x27;s 18.4 million. Nevertheless, &quot;American Idol&quot; overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS&#x27; &quot;All in the Family&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

In the tenth season, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12–13%, and by up to 23% in the 18–49 demo compared to the ninth season. Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale – up 12% for the adults 18–49 demographic and a 21% increase in total viewers from the ninth-season finale. While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year – the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season. The demographics also became &quot;whiter&quot; over time and less diverse. Nevertheless, in the 2010–11 television season, Fox maintained its lead on over other networks with its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18–49 demographic ratings in the United States.

The eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as &quot;The Voice&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;. The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16–21% in overall viewer numbers and 24–27% in the 18/49 demo, while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18–49 demo. The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, &quot;American Idol&quot; lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, although the strengths of &quot;Idol&quot; in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18–49 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.

The loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18–49 demo. The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18–49 demo. The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season. The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18–49 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and &quot;American Idol&quot; lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013–14 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series&#x27; end in 2016.

The continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show&#x27;s major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show). On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; would be its last. Despite these changes, the show&#x27;s ratings would decline more sharply. The fourteenth-season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale. The show&#x27;s ratings, however, rebounded in its final season and ended its run in 2016 as Fox&#x27;s first-ever program to conclude its run without dropping from the Nielsen Top 30 most-watched television shows in each of its seasons.

For the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox. The finale of the seventeenth season was slightly more watched than the sixteenth.

===Critical reception===
Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered that &quot;As TV, &quot;American Idol&quot; is crazily entertaining; as music, it&#x27;s dust-mote inconsequential&quot;. Others, however, thought that &quot;the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed&quot;. It was also described as a &quot;sadistic musical bake-off&quot;, and &quot;a romp in humiliation&quot;. Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations – Karla Peterson of &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; charged that &quot;American Idol&quot; is &quot;a conniving multimedia monster&quot; that has &quot;absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil&quot;. The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted sarcastically that &quot;The terrorists have won&quot; and, with a sideswipe at the show&#x27;s commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who &quot;gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the &#x27;Great &quot;American Idol&quot; Marketing Mandala&#x27; is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made &quot;American Idol&quot; a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).&quot;

Some of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, thought that &quot;for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, &quot;Idol&quot; provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today&#x27;s music business.&quot; Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show &quot;undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism&quot;. Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has &quot;reshaped the American songbook&quot;, &quot;led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture&quot;, and connects &quot;the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.&quot; Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of &quot;Newsweek&quot; accused judge Simon Cowell&#x27;s cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that &quot;Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.&quot; Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on &quot;Idol&quot; are not real artists with self-respect.

Some in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the &quot;true art form of music&quot;, thought that shows like &quot;American Idol&quot; made it seem &quot;so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight&quot;, and that &quot;television is a lie&quot;. Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that &quot;American Idol&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t really about music. It&#x27;s about all the bad aspects of the music business – the arrogance of commerce, this sense of &#x27;I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don&#x27;t know.&#x27; &quot; That &quot;American Idol&quot; is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that &quot;Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award&quot;. It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot;, commenting on talent shows in general, said that &quot;there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs&quot;. &quot;American Idol&quot; revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer.

The success of the show&#x27;s alumni, however, has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having &quot;proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records&quot;. While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format. According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, &quot;if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone&quot;, and that country music and Idol &quot;go together well&quot;.

&quot;American Idol&quot; was nominated for the Emmy&#x27;s Outstanding Reality Competition Program for nine years but never won. Director Bruce Gower won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Series in 2009, and the show won a Creative Arts Emmys each in 2007 and 2008, three in 2009, and two in 2011, as well as a Governor&#x27;s Award in 2007 for its Idol Gives Back edition. It won the People&#x27;s Choice Award, which honors the popular culture of the previous year as voted by the public, for favorite competition/reality show in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. It won the first Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award in 2011 for Best Reality Competition.

In 2013, TV Guide ranked the series No. 48 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.

===Geographical, ethnic, and gender bias===
Throughout the series, twelve of the seventeen &quot;Idol&quot; winners, including its first five, had come from the Southern United States. A large number of other finalists during the series&#x27; run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry, who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.

The show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch &quot;American Idol&quot; during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series. Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47 million CDs sold by &quot;Idol&quot; contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.

Theories given for the success of Southerners on &quot;Idol&quot; have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing. Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride. According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, &quot;People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they&#x27;re adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region.&quot;

For five consecutive seasons, starting in the seventh season, the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar – a trend that &quot;Idol&quot; pundits call the &quot;White guy with guitar&quot; or &quot;WGWG&quot; factor. Just hours before the eleventh-season finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book &quot;American Idol: The Untold Story&quot;, said, &quot;You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as ... who&#x27;s the nicest guy in a popularity contest&quot;, he says, &quot;And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.&quot;

===Start order bias===
Some fans call the final performance of the night the &quot;pimp spot&quot; because it usually receives a big boost in votes, due to the recency effect. By performing first, a performer may benefit from the primacy effect, but any other early performance may be stifled. The second performance spot is sometimes called the &quot;un-pimp spot&quot; because it is the least beneficial.

==Controversy==

The show was criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future careers and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.

Individual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions or for being &#x27;ringers&#x27; planted by the producers. A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record, although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others.

Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism, most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote, and in the eighth season, when the massive increase in text votes fueled the texting controversy. Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the first season. Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol and Vote for the Worst.

==Cultural impact==

===Television===
The enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated were transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. &quot;American Idol&quot; and other shows such as &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; were credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and &quot;Idol&quot; became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series, which it remained for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades). On several occasions, notably in 2003 and 2008, &quot;American Idol&quot; overtook the Academy Awards as the most-watched non-sports entertainment event on U.S. television, marking the most recent time as of 2025 that a live regular non-sports primetime series has garnered such viewership in the country.

The show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network in overall viewers in 2008 and among adults aged 18–49, the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years from 2005 to 2012. Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Bones&quot;, and &quot;Idol&quot;, for years, was Fox&#x27;s strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;New Girl&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot;. The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, &quot;saved Fox&quot;.

The show&#x27;s massive success in the mid-2000s to early 2010s spawned a number of imitating singing-competition shows, such as &quot;Rock Star&quot;, &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot;, &quot;Rising Star&quot;, &quot;The Sing-Off&quot;, and &quot;The X Factor&quot;. The number of imitative singing shows on American television had reached 17 by 2016. Its format also served as a blueprint for non-singing TV shows such as &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, most of which contribute to the current highly competitive reality TV landscape on American television.

===Music===
As one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, &quot;American Idol&quot; has had a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment. It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability. The alumni of the show&#x27;s original run scored 13 Grammy Award wins out of 54 Grammy nominations up to its end in 2016, with Underwood and Clarkson receiving 10 wins combined.

Various &quot;American Idol&quot; alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in its first 10 years, and 458 by its last year of broadcast in 2016, with 100 achieved by Kelly Clarkson alone. According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and bestselling albums and singles. In 2007, &quot;American Idol&quot; alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales. Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, &quot;American Idol&quot; had become &quot;a dominant force in radio&quot; according to Rich Meyer, president of the radio station monitoring research company Mediabase. By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.

At the end of the show&#x27;s original run on Fox in 2016, &quot;Idol&quot;&#x27;s contestants have sold more than 60 million albums in the U.S. and more than 100 million records globally, more than 175 of which are certified platinum or gold. Its participants have generated more than 450 Billboard No. 1 hits and sold more than 260 million digital downloads.

===Film and theater===

The impact of &quot;American Idol&quot; was also strongly felt in musical theater, where many of &quot;Idol&quot; alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former &quot;American Idol&quot; contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on. The casting of a popular &quot;Idol&quot; contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the &quot;Idol&quot; vocal coach Debra Byrd, won a role in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and eventually went on to win an Academy Award for her performance. She later became the show&#x27;s first and only alumnus ever to win the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony). In all, as of 2025, &quot;American Idol&quot; finalists resulted to 5 Grammy Award winners (Clarkson, Barrino, Hudson, Underwood and Mandisa), 2 Emmy Award winners (Clarkson and Hudson), and an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Tony Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Award winner (Hudson).

In 2007, a musical based on the show, &quot;&quot;, played off-Broadway. The musical closed after its official opening night.

==Revenue and commercial ventures==

The dominance of &quot;American Idol&quot; in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900 million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets. By the seventh season, the show was estimated to earn around $900 million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income. One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of &quot;American Idol&quot; at $6.4 billion. Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities. Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature &quot;Idol&quot; branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs. &quot;American Idol&quot; also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.

===Advertising revenue===
&quot;American Idol&quot; became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting the fourth season, and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot, and reaching up to $1.3 million for the finale. Its ad prices reached a peak in the seventh season at $737,000. Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404 million in the third season to $870 million in the sixth season. While that declined from the eighth season onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor, with advertising revenue topping $800 million annually the next few seasons. However, the sharp drop in ratings in the eleventh season also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for the twelfth season, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers. By 2014, ad revenue from had fallen to $427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $300,000. For the relaunched &quot;Idol&quot; on ABC, it has been reported that a 30-second spot may cost between $120,000 and $160,000.

===Media sponsorship===
Ford Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of &quot;American Idol&quot; in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10 million in the first season, rising to $35 million by the seventh season, and between $50 and $60 million in the tenth season. The third major sponsor AT&amp;T Wireless joined in the second season but ended after the twelfth season, and Coca-Cola officially ended its sponsorship after the thirteenth season amidst the declining ratings of &quot;Idol&quot; in the mid-2010s. iTunes sponsored the show since the seventh season.

&quot;American Idol&quot; prominent display of its sponsors&#x27; logo and products had been noted since the early seasons. By the sixth season, &quot;Idol&quot; showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research. The branded entertainment integration proved beneficial to its advertisers – promotion of AT&amp;T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture, and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.
* Coca-Cola – Cups bearing logo of Coca-Cola, and occasionally its subsidiary Vitaminwater, are featured prominently on the judges table. Contestants are shown between songs held in the &quot;Coca-Cola Red Room&quot;, the show&#x27;s equivalent of the green room. (The Coca-Cola logo however is obscured during rebroadcast in the UK which until 2011 banned product placement.)
* Ford – Contestants appear in the special Ford videos on the results shows, and winners Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Hicks, and Kris Allen have also appeared in commercials for Ford. The final two each won a free Ford Mustang in the fourth through sixth seasons, Ford Escape Hybrid in the seventh season, Ford Fusion Hybrid in the eighth season, Ford Fiesta in the ninth season, and 2013 Ford Fusion in the eleventh season. In the tenth season Scotty McCreery chose a Ford F-150 and Lauren Alaina chose Shelby Mustang. In the red room, there is a glass table with a Ford wheel as its base.
* AT&amp;T – AT&amp;T Mobility is promoted as the service provider for text-voting. AT&amp;T created an ad campaign that centered on an air-headed teenager going around telling people to vote.
* Apple iTunes – Ryan Seacrest announces the availability of contestants&#x27; performances exclusively via iTunes. Videos are regularly shown of contestants learning their songs by rehearsing with iPods.
* Previous sponsors include Old Navy and Clairol&#x27;s Herbal Essences. In the second and third seasons, contestants sometimes donned Old Navy clothing for their performances with celebrity stylist Steven Cojocaru assisting with their wardrobe selection, and contestants received Clairol-guided hair makeovers. In the seventh-season finale, both David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in &quot;Risky Business&quot;-inspired commercials for Guitar Hero, a sponsor of the tour that year.

Coca-Cola&#x27;s archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor &quot;American Idol&quot; at the show&#x27;s start. What the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; later called &quot;missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation&quot; contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsored the American version of Cowell&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot; in hopes of not repeating its &quot;Idol&quot; mistake until its cancellation.

For the revived series on ABC, Macy&#x27;s and Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Zyrtec signed on as the major sponsors of the show.

===American Idol tour===

The top ten (eleven in the tenth season, five in the fourteenth season, and seven in the sixteenth season) toured at the end of every season except for the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons. In the twelfth season tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour. Kellogg&#x27;s Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the seventh season tour. M&amp;M&#x27;s Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the ninth season tour. The fifth season tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35 million. However no concert tour was organized in the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons, the only seasons not to have an associated tour. The sixteenth season tour featured the band In Real Life as an opener on select dates.

==&quot;Idol Gives Back&quot;==

&quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; was a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185 million in total.

===Music releases===

&quot;American Idol&quot; has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants&#x27; performances as well as the winner&#x27;s coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made &quot;American Idol&quot; the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program. Starting late in the fifth season, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the &quot;American Idol&quot; official website only. In the seventh season the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In the tenth season the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.

19 Recordings, a recording label owned by 19 Entertainment, currently hold the rights to phonographic material recorded by all the contestants. 19 Recordings originally partnered with Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) to promote and distribute the recordings through its labels RCA Records, Arista Records, J Records, and Jive Records. From 2005–2007, BMG partnered with Sony Music Entertainment to form a joint venture known as Sony BMG Music Entertainment. From 2008 to 2010, following their acquisition of BMG, Sony Music handled the distribution of &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s music. In 2010, UMG&#x27;s Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M Records replaced Sony as the music label for &quot;American Idol&quot;.

==Theme park attraction==

On February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted &quot;The American Idol Experience&quot; at its Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the &quot;Idol&quot; set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real &quot;Idol&quot; judges, critiqued the performances. Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a &quot;finals&quot; show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner. The winner of the finals show received a &quot;Dream Ticket&quot; that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future &quot;American Idol&quot; audition. The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.

<doc id="191892" wikidata="Q271534" url="?curid=191892" title="Pansexuality">
<text>Pansexuality is sexual, romantic, or emotional attraction towards people of all genders, or regardless of their sex or gender identity. Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that gender and sex are not determining factors in their romantic or sexual attraction to others.

Pansexuality is sometimes considered a sexual orientation in its own right or, at other times, as a branch of bisexuality (since attraction to all genders falls under the category of attraction to people of the same gender and different genders) to indicate a lack of gender preference. While pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore explicitly rejects the gender binary in terms of the chosen etymology, this is by no means a feature which is exclusive to pansexuality and can also be found in broad definitions of homosexuality, bisexuality and the asexual spectrum.

==History of the term==
Pansexuality is also sometimes called &quot;omnisexuality&quot;. Omnisexuality may be used to describe those &quot;attracted to people of all genders across the gender spectrum&quot;, and pansexuality may be used to describe the same people, or those attracted to people &quot;regardless of gender&quot;. The prefix &quot;&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;all, every&quot;.

In 1878, Machado de Assis, a renowned Brazilian writer of the 19th century, made one of the first known uses to date in Portuguese of the term &quot;omnisexual&quot; for his criticism of the novel &quot;O Primo de Basílio&quot; by Eça de Queirós. The review was published in the newspaper of the time, &quot;O Cruzeiro&quot;, which, on April 16, 1878, featured a review signed by Eleazar, the pseudonym of Machado de Assis, on the cover of the newspaper. Machado de Assis classified the naturalism and lack of sexual filter present in the novel as “reminiscences and allusions of an eroticism that Proudhon would call omnisexual and omnimod”.

Early individuals who displayed pansexual tendencies include John Wilmot and Friedrich Schiller. Although later attributed to Shulamith Firestone, the hybrid words &quot;pansexual&quot; and &quot;pansexualism&quot; were first attested in 1914 (spelled &quot;pan-sexualism&quot;), coined by opponents of Sigmund Freud to denote the idea &quot;that the sex instinct plays the primary part in all human activity, mental and physical&quot;. The term was translated to German as in Freud&#x27;s work &quot;Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego&quot;. 

The word &quot;pansexual&quot; is attested as a term for a variety of attraction, alongside &quot;omnisexual&quot; (coming from the Latin , &quot;all&quot;) and the earlier &quot;bisexual&quot;, by the 1970s. &quot;Bi Any Other Name&quot; states that &quot;pansexual people have been actively involved in the bisexual community since the 1970s.&quot; The term &quot;pansexuality&quot; emerged as a term for a sexual identity or sexual orientation in the 1990s, &quot;to describe desires that already existed for many people&quot;. Social psychologist Nikki Hayfield states that the term saw early use in BDSM communities.

In 2010, the pansexual flag was posted on a Tumblr blog to represent the pansexual community. It was designed by Jasper Varney. The colors are intended to represent attraction and gender spectrum, with cyan for attraction to men, pink for attraction to women, and yellow for attraction to non-binary people.

Variations on pansexual are beginning to appear in surveys, e.g., &quot;panqueer&quot;, which combines pansexual with queer, has been used by participants in a study on non-medical impacts of COVID-19.

==Comparison to bisexuality and other sexual identities==
===Definitions===

A literal dictionary definition of bisexuality, due to the prefix &quot;&quot;, is sexual or romantic attraction to two sexes (males and females), to two genders (men and women), or attraction to both people of the same gender and different genders.

Pansexuality, however, composed with the prefix &quot;&quot;, is the sexual attraction to a person of any sex or gender. Using these definitions, pansexuality is defined differently by explicitly including people who are intersex or outside the gender binary. 

Volume 2 of Cavendish&#x27;s &quot;Sex and Society&quot; states that &quot;although the term&#x27;s literal meaning can be interpreted as &quot;attracted to everything&quot;, people who identify as pansexual do not usually include paraphilias, such as bestiality, pedophilia and necrophilia, in their definition&quot;, and that they &quot;stress that the term &#x27;pansexuality&#x27; describes only consensual adult sexual behaviors.&quot;

The definition of pansexuality can encourage the belief that it is the only sexual identity that covers individuals who do not cleanly fit into the categories of male or man, or female or woman. However, bisexual-identified people and scholars may object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since &quot;bisexual&quot; is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses attraction to different genders as well, it includes attraction to more than two genders. Gender is considered more complex than the state of one&#x27;s sex, as gender includes genetic, hormonal, environmental and social factors. Furthermore, the term &quot;bisexual&quot; is sometimes defined as the romantic or sexual attraction to multiple genders. The Bisexual Resource Center, for example, defines bisexuality as &quot;an umbrella term for people who recognize and honor their potential for sexual and emotional attraction to more than one gender&quot;, while the American Institute of Bisexuality states that the term &quot;bisexual&quot; &quot;is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions&quot; and that &quot;the scientific classification &#x27;bisexual&#x27; only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation.&quot; 

Scholar Shiri Eisner states that terms such as &quot;pansexual&quot;, &quot;omnisexual&quot;, &quot;polysexual&quot;, &quot;queer&quot;, etc. are being used in place of the term &quot;bisexual&quot; because &quot;bisexuality, it&#x27;s been claimed, is a gender binary, and therefore oppressive, word&quot; and that &quot;the great debate is being perpetuated and developed by bisexual-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the one hand, and non-bi-identified transgender and genderqueer people on the other.&quot; Eisner argues that &quot;the allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality&#x27;s actual attributes or bisexual people&#x27;s behavior in real life&quot; and that the allegations are a political method to keep the bisexual and transgender movements separated, because of those who believe that bisexuality ignores or erases the visibility of transgender and genderqueer people.

The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that &quot;terms like &#x27;pansexual&#x27;, &#x27;polysexual&#x27;, &#x27;omnisexual&#x27;, and &#x27;ambisexual&#x27; also describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with those labels are also bisexual&quot; and that &quot;by replacing the prefix bi – (two, both) with pan- (all), poly- (many), omni- (all), ambi- (both, and implying ambiguity in this case), people who adopt these labels seek to clearly express the fact that gender does not factor into their own sexuality&quot;, but &quot;this does not mean, however, that people who identify as bisexual are fixated on gender.&quot; The institute believes that the idea that identifying as bisexual reinforces a false gender binary &quot;has its roots in the anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world&quot;, and that, &quot;while it is true that our society&#x27;s language and terminology do not necessarily reflect the full spectrum of human gender diversity, that is hardly the fault of people who choose to identify as bi. ... The Latin prefix bi- does indeed indicate two or both, however the &#x27;both&#x27; indicated in the word bisexual are merely &#x27;homosexual&#x27; (lit. same sex) and &#x27;heterosexual&#x27; (lit. different sex).&quot; The institute argues that heterosexuality and homosexuality, by contrast, &quot;are defined by the boundary of two sexes/genders. Given those fundamental facts, any criticism of bisexuality as reinforcing a gender binary is misplaced. Over time, our society&#x27;s concept of human sex and gender may well change.&quot;

==== Tensions with bisexuals ====
Bisexuals frequently struggle with myths and misconceptions about the definition of bisexuality, such as the idea that bisexuality conforms to the gender binary (thereby excluding attraction to nonbinary individuals), or excludes attraction to trans people in general. This sometimes creates tension between bisexuals and pansexuals, as pansexuals often see themselves as being more inclusive to a wider array of genders. A 2022 study by the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot; suggests that the majority of women who identify as pansexual or queer defined bisexuality as limited to attraction to cisgender men and women and critiqued bisexuality as reinforcing the traditional gender binary. However, bisexual women defined bisexuality as attraction to two or more, or &quot;similar or dissimilar&quot;, genders, described bisexuality as inclusive of attractions to all genders, and reported negative psychological outcomes as a result of the debate around bisexual gender inclusivity.

In another study, Ashley Green noted that pansexual participants sought to authenticate their identity as pansexual by juxtaposing it with bisexuality, often speaking of bisexuality as being inferior to pansexuality, most notably because they felt it excluded individuals who did not identify within the gender binary, some expressing very negative feelings toward bisexual individuals and positioning &quot;pansexuality as being the superior identity as a result of its inclusivity, demonizing bisexual individuals as being transphobic if they do not identify as pansexual once they are informed that there is a &#x27;better&#x27; identity&quot;. Green notes that this does not account for the large percentage of transgender and nonbinary individuals who also identify as bisexual, and characterizes these participants as contributing to a long history of biphobia. While some participants spoke favorably of bisexuality, describing the recognition of the validity of pansexuality as being contingent on the recognition of the validity of bisexuality, Green concludes by saying &quot;In borrowing narratives that they are familiar with, the pansexual individuals interviewed in this study reinforced an essentialist understanding of identity despite their attempts to deconstruct gender binaries&quot;.

A 2017 study published in the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot; found that when bisexuals and pansexuals described gender and defined bisexuality, &quot;there were no differences in how pansexual and bisexual people ... discussed sex or gender&quot;, and that the findings &quot;do not support the stereotype that bisexual people endorse a binary view of gender while pansexual people do not.&quot;

===Umbrella term===
Social psychologist Corey Flanders said the &quot;bisexual umbrella&quot; is a term used to describe a range of sexual identities and communities that express attraction to multiple genders, often grouping together those who identify as bisexual, pansexual, queer, and fluid, as well as other identities. The term faces issues of balancing inclusivity with cohesiveness where, on one hand, the term can bring together many disparate identities and gather their experiences, and on the other, it can lead to too many sub-groupings and exclude those who identify with more than one sexual identity.

The term &quot;pansexuality&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;bisexuality&quot;, and, similarly, people who identify as bisexual may &quot;feel that gender, biological sex, and sexual orientation should not be a focal point in potential [romantic/sexual] relationships.&quot; Additionally, &quot;pansexuality&quot; is often used in conjunction with &quot;bisexuality&quot;, which can pose difficulties in studying differences and similarities in experiences between those who identify as pansexual and those who identify as bisexual and not pansexual. In one study analyzing sexual identities described as alternative terms for bisexual or bi-self labels, &quot;half of all bisexual and bisexual-identified respondents also chose alternative self-labels such as &#x27;queer&#x27;, &#x27;pansexual&#x27;, &#x27;pansensual&#x27;, &#x27;polyfidelitous&#x27;, &#x27;ambisexual&#x27;, &#x27;polysexual&#x27;, or personalized identities such as &#x27;byke&#x27; or &#x27;biphilic&#x27;.&quot; In a 2017 study, identifying as pansexual was found to be &quot;most appealing to nonheterosexual women and noncisgender individuals.&quot; Polysexuality is similar to pansexuality in definition, meaning &quot;encompassing more than one sexuality&quot;, but not necessarily encompassing all sexualities. This is distinct from polyamory, which means more than one intimate relationship at the same time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. 

Sexual fluidity is different from gender fluidity. Sexual fluidity is a concept that describes how a person&#x27;s sexual identity may shift, and can shift at any time. The American Institute of Bisexuality stated that the term &#x27;fluid&#x27; &quot;expresses the fact that the balance of a person&#x27;s homosexual and heterosexual attractions exists in a state of flux and changes over time.&quot;

Eisner states that &quot;the idea of bisexuality as an umbrella term can emphasize a multiplicity of identities, forms of desire, lived experiences, and politics,&quot; and &quot;resist a single standard&quot; of defining bisexual-umbrella identities and communities, including pansexuality and pansexuals. Eisner also says that only those who want to be included under the bisexual umbrella should be included. The term &quot;plurisexualities&quot; is used by social psychologist Nikki Hayfield over bisexuality as an umbrella term &quot;to capture additional identities relating to attraction to multiple genders&quot;, while also referring to specific identities like &quot;bisexual&quot;, &quot;asexual&quot;, and &quot;pansexual&quot;.

In contrast to the idea of a bisexual umbrella, scholars Christopher Belous and Melissa Bauman propose that pansexuality might be considered more of an umbrella term than bisexuality, arguing that because pansexuality is often defined more broadly than bisexuality, bisexuality may exist under the umbrella of &quot;pansexual orientations&quot;. They noted that more research is necessary to clarify which of the two terms might be more appropriate as an umbrella term. Scholar Emily Prior questions the use of bisexuality as an umbrella term, noting that &quot;the empirical evidence just isn&#x27;t there&quot; to determine whether bisexuality can effectively act as an umbrella term. Social psychologist Joye Swan argues that including other orientations under the bisexual umbrella contributes to bisexual invisibility, invisibility for other sexualities, and presumes that &quot;all or most bisexual people agree with being categorized&quot; under the bisexual umbrella.

== Demographics ==
A 2016 Harris Poll survey of 2,000 US adults commissioned by GLAAD found that among 18-34 year-olds, about two percent self-identify as pansexual and approximately one percent in all other age groups. In 2017, 14% of a sample of 12,000 LGBTQ youth between 13 and 17 years of age declared themselves pansexual in a Human Rights Campaign/University of Connecticut survey.

According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, 25% of American transgender people identify as bisexual. One New Zealand 2019 study of a nationally representative group of bisexual and pansexual participants found that younger, gender-diverse, and Maori people were more likely to self-identify as pansexual compared to bisexual. The 2021 IPSOS survey found that the United States was the country with the highest percentage of pansexual individuals.

==Pansexual &amp; Panromantic Days==

There are two main LGBTQ awareness periods for pansexual and panromantic people. One of them is the annual Pansexual &amp; Panromantic Awareness Day (24 May), first celebrated in 2015, to promote awareness of and celebrate pansexual and panromantic identities. Another one is the Pansexual Pride Day, celebrated every December 8th.

<doc id="191895" wikidata="Q261074" url="?curid=191895" title="Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)">
<text>The Symphony No. 7 by Gustav Mahler is a symphony in five movements composed in 1904–05, sometimes referred to by the title Song of the Night (), which was not the composer&#x27;s own designation. Although the symphony is often described as being in the key of E minor, its tonal scheme is more complicated. The symphony&#x27;s first movement moves from B minor (introduction) to E minor, and the work ends with a rondo finale in C major. Thus, as Dika Newlin has pointed out, &quot;in this symphony Mahler returns to the ideal of &#x27;progressive tonality&#x27; which he had abandoned in the Sixth&quot;. The complexity of the work&#x27;s tonal scheme was analysed in terms of &quot;interlocking structures&quot; by Graham George.

==Background==
In 1904, Mahler was enjoying great international success as a conductor, but he was also, at last, beginning to enjoy international success as a composer. His second daughter was born that June, and during his customary summer break away from Vienna in his lakeside retreat at Maiernigg in the Carinthian mountains, he finished his Symphony No. 6 and sketched the second and fourth movements (the two &quot;Nachtmusik&quot; movements) for Symphony No. 7 while mapping out much of the rest of the work. He then worked on the Seventh intensively the following summer. While Mahler later claimed to take just four weeks to complete the first, third and fifth movements, scholars have asserted that a timeframe of six to seven weeks is more plausible.

The completed score was dated 15 August 1905, and the orchestration was finished in 1906; he laid the Seventh aside to make small changes to the orchestration of Symphony No. 6, while rehearsing for its premiere in May 1906. The Seventh had its premiere on 19 September 1908, in Prague with the Czech Philharmonic, at the festival marking the Diamond Jubilee of Emperor Franz Joseph.

The three years which elapsed between the completion of the score and the symphony&#x27;s premiere witnessed dramatic changes in Mahler&#x27;s life and career. In March 1907 he had resigned his conductorship of the Vienna State Opera, as the musical community in Vienna turned against him (which was why he chose Prague for the work&#x27;s debut); on 12 July his first daughter died of scarlet fever; and, even as she lay on her deathbed, Mahler learned that he was suffering from an incurable heart condition. Musicologists surmise that this is why the optimism and cheerfulness of the symphony was subsequently tempered by the small but significant revisions Mahler made in the years leading up to its premiere.

The symphony was first published in 1909 by the firm Bote &amp; Bock. In 1960, a critical edition of the symphony edited by Erwin Ratz appeared, correcting about 800 printing errors. Two years later, Hans Redlich&#x27;s edition of the symphony was published without any of Mahler&#x27;s amendments to the score made after publication, unlike Ratz&#x27;s edition. In 2012, a new critical edition prepared by Reinhold Kubik was published.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for large orchestra. As in some of his other symphonies (particularly his 5th and 6th), Mahler&#x27;s use of unconventional instruments is displayed in the 7th with the scoring of tenorhorn, cowbells, guitar and mandolin. The orchestra consists of the following:

;Woodwinds
:piccolo
:3 oboes
:cor anglais
:E clarinet
:3 B and A clarinets
:bass clarinet
:3 bassoons
:contrabassoon

;Brass
:4 horns
:3 trumpets
:3 trombones
:tuba

;Percussion
:4 timpani
:bass drum
:cymbals
:triangle
:
:tam-tam
:
:glockenspiel
;Strings
:
:2 harps

:1st violins
:2nd violins
:violas
:cellos
:double basses


==Structure==
The duration of the symphony is around 80 minutes. There is, however, an exceptionally lengthy recording by Otto Klemperer, which is 100 minutes long.
Another recording by Hermann Scherchen with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is 68 minutes long.

The work is in five movements:

=== I. Langsam – Allegro risoluto, ma non troppo ===

(E minor, beginning B minor)

The movement is in sonata form. It begins with a slow introduction in B minor, launched by a dark melody played by a .
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key b \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \tempo &quot;&quot; 4 = 40 \partial 16*9 fis16\f fis8.( d16) gis,4~ | gis8.[ r32 b64 d] fis8..-&gt; eis64 fis gis8..-&gt; fis64 e ais,4~ | ais4. } &lt;/score&gt;
The accompaniment rhythm
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key b \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 b8.-- b32-. b-. b8.-- b32-. b b2 } &lt;/score&gt;
was said to have come to Mahler whilst rowing on the lake at Maiernigg after a period of compositional drought. The principal theme, presented by horns in unison in E minor, is accompanied similarly, though much faster and in a higher register.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 2/2 \key e \minor \tempo &quot;Allegro con fuoco&quot; \tempo 4 = 152 e2-&gt; b-&gt; | r4 r8 b g&#x27;4. fis8 | e2-&gt; a,-&gt; | r4 r8 a c4. e8 | a4 r8 g f2 } &lt;/score&gt;
The second theme is then presented by violins, accompanied by sweeping cello arpeggios.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot;&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \major r4 g4.\pp\fermata( e8\&lt; f fis | g aes\!) \slashedGrace { a,!( } e&quot;2\sf\fermata\&gt;)( cis8\! d\pp) | \slashedGrace { d,( } d&#x27;)-&gt;( c fis, g) \slashedGrace { b,( } b&#x27;)-&gt;( a cis, d) | f( e16) r e4. } &lt;/score&gt;
This theme is infected with chromatic sequences. At one point the violins reach an F7 (the highest F on a piano). The exposition is wrapped up with a march theme from the introduction, which is followed by a repeat of the principal theme.

This leads straight into the development, which continues for some time before suddenly being interrupted by pianissimo trumpet fanfares and a slow chorale based on the march theme from the introduction.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef bass \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key ees \major &lt;c bes g ees&gt;2\pp \breathe &lt;d bes g d bes&gt;4.( &lt;ees bes g bes, ees,&gt;8) \breathe | &lt;ees bes g bes, ees,&gt;1 \breathe } &lt;/score&gt;
This section has been interpreted as a &quot;religious vision&quot;. It has also been asserted that this section contains the chains of fourths that impressed Arnold Schoenberg. After this section plays itself out, a harp glissando propels the music into a new section based on the second theme and the march/chorale theme. But before a climax can be articulated, the final cadence is interrupted by the music from the introduction and the baritone horn arioso. This leads into the recapitulation, but before the actual recapitulation occurs, there is an incredibly difficult high note for trumpet. In fact, the principal trumpet for the work&#x27;s premiere even confronted Mahler, saying &quot;I&#x27;d just like to know what&#x27;s beautiful about blowing away at a trumpet stopped up to high C.&quot; Mahler had no answer, but later pointed out to Alma that the man did not understand the agony of his own existence.

The recapitulation is very similar to the exposition, although it is significantly more agitated. There is a grand pause during the first thematic section that leads into a massive climax. The second theme is also considerably shortened. The march theme from the introduction leads straight into an epic coda that features march rhythms and multiple high points in the orchestral texture, before ending on an E major chord.

The lengthy and dramatically intense first movement is followed by three distinct pictures of night: two movements entitled &quot;Nachtmusik&quot; (i.e. nocturne) and a &quot;shadowy&quot; scherzo in between them.

===II. Nachtmusik I===

:&quot;Allegro moderato. Molto moderato&quot; (&quot;Andante&quot;) C major – C minor

The first of the two &quot;Nachtmusik&quot; movements is said to represent a &quot;Nachtwanderung&quot; (&quot;wandering by night&quot;). Mahler, who described the movement in vague terms, compared it to Rembrandt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, though he did not intend to evoke the painting itself. Overall, the movement possesses a grotesque quality, but always with friendly intentions. The movement progresses through a series of marches and dances and naturalistic nocturnal descriptions. One remarkable aspect of the movement is its symmetrical form; it is a rondo following the structure (I)–(A)–(B)–(I/A)–(C)–(I/A)–(B)–(A)–(I), where (I) is an introductory section and (I/A) combines the introductory music and the (A) theme.

The second movement opens with horns calling to each other.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key c \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 g4(\ff | c e g c8)[ r16 aes] | g2.\fermata r4 | r1 | r2 r4 } \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key c \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 r4 | r1 | r2^&quot;mit Dämpfer&quot; r4 c8.\p( ees16 | g4-&gt;) g-&gt; g-&gt;( c8)[ r16 aes] | g2.\fermata } » } &lt;/score&gt;
The second horn is muted, however, to create the illusion of distance. Scampering woodwinds imitating somewhat grotesque bird calls pass off into the distance, as the trumpets sound the major/minor seal from Symphony No. 6. The horns introduce a rich, somewhat bucolic (A) theme, surrounded by dancing strings and a march rhythm from his song &quot;Revelge&quot;.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \major \partial 4*1 g-&gt;( | g&#x27;8\sf-.) g16-. g-. g8-. aes-. g r f4-&gt; | ees4.\trill d16-. c-. d8 } &lt;/score&gt;
This theme leads to some confusion about the key, as it switches between C major and C minor every few beats. The rural mood is heightened by a gentle, rustic dance for the (B) section – typical of Mahler at his most carefree and childlike – as well as by the gentle clanking of distant cowbells in the returns of the introductory section. The malicious (C) theme, upon its return, is arabesqued by the &quot;Revelge&quot; rhythms and bird calls from earlier in the movement.

=== III. Scherzo ===

:&quot;Schattenhaft. Fließend aber nicht zu schnell&quot; (&quot;Shadowy. Flowing but not too fast&quot;) D major

There is an undercurrent of night about the spooky third movement; while &quot;scherzo&quot; means &quot;joke&quot;, this movement is remarkably spooky and even grim. If the first &quot;Nachtmusik&quot; possessed a friendly mood disguised in grotesqueries, this movement is a demon sneering at the listener. Nonetheless, as the Spanish musicologist José L. Pérez de Arteaga points out, this movement is really &quot;a most morbid and sarcastic mockery of the Viennese waltz&quot;.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \time 3/4 \key d \major \partial 4*2 a\pp( g) | \grace { a,32[( a&#x27;] } \times 2/3 { d8)-&gt; fis r } fis2~ | fis8 r a-&gt;( b g a) | fis2.~ | fis8 r a,-&gt;( bes g a) | \grace { bes,32[( d] } \times 2/3 { bes&#x27;8) g&#x27; r } g2~ | g8([ bes)] a([ bes) g-. a-.] | fis2. } &lt;/score&gt;
The movement begins with a strange gesture: a pianissimo dialogue between timpani and pizzicato basses and cellos with sardonic interjections from the winds. After some buildup, the orchestra sets off on a threatening waltz, complete with unearthly woodwind shrieks and ghostly shimmerings from the basses, with a recurring &quot;lamenting&quot; theme in the woodwinds. The scherzo is contrasted by a warmer trio in the major mode, introduced by and containing a &quot;shrieking&quot; motif beginning in the oboes and descending through the orchestra.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; « { \clef treble \time 3/4 \key d \major fis2( g4) | fis( e fis) | e2( d4) | a2 d8-. e-. | \autoBeamOff fis4. e8-. fis r | a4( g8) r e r | fis2. } \\ { d2\p( ees4) | d( a d) | a r r | s2. | \autoBeamOff a4. g8 a s | fis&#x27;4( e8) s a, s | d2. } » &lt;/score&gt;

The brilliance of this movement lies in its extraordinary and original orchestration, which gives this movement a strongly nightmarish quality. Multiple viola solos rise above the texture, and there is a persistent timpani and pizzicato motif that pervades the dance. The theme and its accompaniment are both passed around the orchestra rather than being played by a specific instrument. At one memorable point in the score, the cellos and double basses are instructed to play pizzicato with the volume , with the footnote, &quot;pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood&quot;.
===IV. Nachtmusik II===
:&quot;Andante amoroso&quot;. F major

The fourth movement (the second &quot;Nachtmusik&quot;) contrasts with the first in that it illustrates a more intimate and human scene. With its &quot;amoroso&quot; marking and reduced instrumentation (trombones, tuba and trumpets are silent and the woodwinds are reduced by half) this movement has been described as &quot;a long stretch of chamber music set amidst this huge orchestral work&quot;. A solo violin introduces the movement,
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 2/4 \key f \major \partial 8*1 f8\f\glissando( | f&#x27;2)~\sf | f4\&lt;( e8 d)\! | c4\&gt; bes8( g)\! | f4 } &lt;/score&gt;
while a horn solo above the gentle tones of a guitar and mandolin create a magical serenade character.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 2/4 \key f \major \partial 8*1 c8-.\p | f4-&gt; f-&gt; | g4.-&gt; f16-. e-. | g8-. f16-. e-. g8-. f16-. e-. | aes2-&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;
However, sardonic dissonances give this movement a more satirical and even diseased feel. The trio contrasts with this, and more reflects the intimate mood that would be expected from a Viennese serenade. The movement ends in transcendence, providing a peaceful backdrop for the finale&#x27;s abrupt entrance.

Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht accounted for the unusual musical episodes of this movement by offering a program in which Mahler walks through Vienna one evening, Thomas Peattie thus described it as &quot;nothing less than an aural mapping of the city at night&quot;. He noted that the metaphor of walking was often heard musically as a succession of fragmentary tableaux.

===V. Rondo Finale===
Boisterous timpani joined by blazing brass set the scene for the riotous final movement in C major.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key c \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 g8\f g16 g g8 e g g16 g g8 e16 g | b4\trill\sfp } &lt;/score&gt;
The long, arduous first movement, after three shorter movements developmental in mood, is finally equalled by a substantial &quot;daylight&quot; finale. The movement is a rondo combined with a set of eight variations, capped off by a dramatic coda. There are parodies of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; and Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. There are many strange and abrupt interruptions of climactic buildups, including at the very end of the coda. The texture is, for the most part, based on a banal descending broken scale motif.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key c \major c4-&gt; r8 d-&gt; b4-&gt; r8 c-&gt; | a4.-&gt;( b8-!) g-! d-&gt;[ e-&gt; f-&gt;] | g4-&gt; r8 a-&gt; f4-&gt; r8 g-&gt; | e4.-&gt;( f8-!) d-! } &lt;/score&gt;
There is also a heavy emphasis on acerbic brass chorales and relentlessly satirical rustic dances. Little wonder that, of all the symphony&#x27;s movements, this has come in for the greatest amount of criticism and puzzlement. It has been seen by many as something of a let-down and somewhat superficial, dodging questions set by the previous movements; its virtually unrelenting mood of celebration seems quite at odds with the dark character of the earlier movements. &quot;A vigorous life-asserting pageant of Mahlerian blatancy&quot;, is how Michael Kennedy describes it, and Mahler himself explained it with the &quot;The world is mine!&quot; The principal theme of the first movement crops up amidst the outrageously exuberant finale, but is soon quelled and reappears in the major mode. Cowbells from the first &quot;Nachtmusik&quot; and the unpitched low bells from Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 also make appearances. The movement (and therefore the symphony) ends in a very strange way; a seemingly random stray G changes the harmonic quality from major to augmented, the music suddenly drops to piano before a stubborn C major chord ends the work.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key c \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 &lt;e c gis&gt;1\ff( | &lt;c g e&gt;8 } \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef bass \key c \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 &lt;e c gis&gt;1 | &lt;c e, g, c,&gt;8 } » } &lt;/score&gt;

==Critical analysis==
The harmonic and stylistic structure of the piece may be viewed as a depiction of the journey from dusk till dawn. The piece evolves from uncertain and hesitant beginnings to an unequivocal C major finale, with its echoes of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;: indeed, at the premiere the overture to this opera was performed after the symphony.

This journey from night to day proceeds via the third movement scherzo, marked &quot;schattenhaft&quot; (shadowy), which may have been what prompted Arnold Schoenberg to become a particular champion of the work. The abundance of themes based upon the interval of a fourth has parallels with the First Chamber Symphony.

The piece has several motifs in common with the Symphony No. 6, notably the juxtaposition of major with minor chords, the march figure of the first movement, and the use of cowbells within certain pastoral episodes.

Andrew Thomson has examined Mahler&#x27;s use of fourth-based chords in the symphony. John Williamson has discussed in detail Mahler&#x27;s first movement introduction in the context of Mahler&#x27;s introductions in his earlier symphonies. Martin Scherzinger has analysed the fifth movement of the symphony from a deconstructionist perspective informed by the methodology of Jacques Derrida.

==Reception==
Mahler conducted the premiere of his Symphony No. 7 in Prague in 1908. A few weeks later he conducted it in Munich and the Netherlands. Both the audience and the performers at the premiere were confused by the work, and it was not well received.

<doc id="191897" wikidata="Q3175727" url="?curid=191897" title="Electric-field screening">
<text>In physics, screening is the damping of electric fields caused by the presence of mobile charge carriers. It is an important part of the behavior of charge-carrying mediums, such as ionized gases (classical plasmas), electrolytes, and electronic conductors (semiconductors, metals).
In a fluid, with a given permittivity , composed of electrically charged constituent particles, each pair of particles (with charges and ) interact through the Coulomb force as
formula_1
where the vector is the relative position between the charges. This interaction complicates the theoretical treatment of the fluid. For example, a naive quantum mechanical calculation of the ground-state energy density yields infinity, which is unreasonable. The difficulty lies in the fact that even though the Coulomb force diminishes with distance as , the average number of particles at each distance is proportional to , assuming the fluid is fairly isotropic. As a result, a charge fluctuation at any one point has non-negligible effects at large distances.

In reality, these long-range effects are suppressed by the flow of particles in response to electric fields. This flow reduces the &quot;effective&quot; interaction between particles to a short-range &quot;screened&quot; Coulomb interaction. This system corresponds to the simplest example of a renormalized interaction.

In solid-state physics, especially for metals and semiconductors, the screening effect describes the electrostatic field and Coulomb potential of an ion inside the solid. Like the electric field of the nucleus is reduced inside an atom or ion due to the shielding effect, the electric fields of ions in conducting solids are further reduced by the cloud of conduction electrons.

== Description ==
Consider a fluid composed of electrons moving in a uniform background of positive charge (one-component plasma). Each electron possesses a negative charge. According to Coulomb&#x27;s interaction, negative charges repel each other. Consequently, this electron will repel other electrons creating a small region around itself in which there are fewer electrons. This region can be treated as a positively charged &quot;screening hole&quot;. Viewed from a large distance, this screening hole has the effect of an overlaid positive charge which cancels the electric field produced by the electron. Only at short distances, inside the hole region, can the electron&#x27;s field be detected. For a plasma, this effect can be made explicit by an formula_2-body calculation. If the background is made up of positive ions, their attraction by the electron of interest reinforces the above screening mechanism. In atomic physics, a germane effect exists for atoms with more than one electron shell: the shielding effect. In plasma physics, electric-field screening is also called Debye screening or shielding. It manifests itself on macroscopic scales by a sheath (Debye sheath) next to a material with which the plasma is in contact.

The screened potential determines the inter atomic force and the phonon dispersion relation in metals. The screened potential is used to calculate the electronic band structure of a large variety of materials, often in combination with pseudopotential models. The screening effect leads to the independent electron approximation, which explains the predictive power of introductory models of solids like the Drude model, the free electron model and the nearly free electron model.

== Theory and models ==
The first theoretical treatment of electrostatic screening, due to Peter Debye and Erich Hückel, dealt with a stationary point charge embedded in a fluid.

Consider a fluid of electrons in a background of heavy, positively charged ions. For simplicity, we ignore the motion and spatial distribution of the ions, approximating them as a uniform background charge. This simplification is permissible since the electrons are lighter and more mobile than the ions, provided we consider distances much larger than the ionic separation. In condensed matter physics, this model is referred to as jellium.

=== Screened Coulomb interactions ===
Let &quot;ρ&quot; denote the number density of electrons, and &quot;φ&quot; the electric potential. At first, the electrons are evenly distributed so that there is zero net charge at every point. Therefore, &quot;φ&quot; is initially a constant as well.

We now introduce a fixed point charge &quot;Q&quot; at the origin. The associated charge density is &quot;Qδ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;), where &quot;δ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the Dirac delta function. After the system has returned to equilibrium, let the change in the electron density and electric potential be Δ&quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) and Δ&quot;φ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) respectively. The charge density and electric potential are related by Poisson&#x27;s equation, which gives
formula_3
where &quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity.

To proceed, we must find a second independent equation relating &quot;Δρ&quot; and &quot;Δφ&quot;. We consider two possible approximations, under which the two quantities are proportional: the Debye–Hückel approximation, valid at high temperatures (e.g. classical plasmas), and the Thomas–Fermi approximation, valid at low temperatures (e.g. electrons in metals).

==== Debye–Hückel approximation ====

In the Debye–Hückel approximation, we maintain the system in thermodynamic equilibrium, at a temperature &quot;T&quot; high enough that the fluid particles obey Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. At each point in space, the density of electrons with energy &quot;j&quot; has the form
formula_4
where &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant. Perturbing in &quot;φ&quot; and expanding the exponential to first order, we obtain
formula_5
where
formula_6

The associated length is called the Debye length. The Debye length is the fundamental length scale of a classical plasma.

==== Thomas–Fermi approximation ====
In the Thomas–Fermi approximation, named after Llewellyn Thomas and Enrico Fermi, the system is maintained at a constant electron chemical potential (Fermi level) and at low temperature. The former condition corresponds, in a real experiment, to keeping the metal/fluid in electrical contact with a fixed potential difference with ground. The chemical potential &quot;μ&quot; is, by definition, the energy of adding an extra electron to the fluid. This energy may be decomposed into a kinetic energy &quot;T&quot; part and the potential energy −&quot;eφ&quot; part. Since the chemical potential is kept constant,
formula_7

If the temperature is extremely low, the behavior of the electrons comes close to the quantum mechanical model of a Fermi gas. We thus approximate &quot;T&quot; by the kinetic energy of an additional electron in the Fermi gas model, which is simply the Fermi energy &quot;E&quot;F. The Fermi energy for a 3D system is related to the density of electrons (including spin degeneracy) by
formula_8
where &quot;k&quot;F is the Fermi wavevector. Perturbing to first order, we find that
formula_9

Inserting this into the above equation for Δ&quot;μ&quot; yields
formula_10
where
formula_11
is called the Thomas–Fermi screening wave vector.

This result follows from the equations of a Fermi gas, which is a model of non-interacting electrons, whereas the fluid, which we are studying, contains the Coulomb interaction. Therefore, the Thomas–Fermi approximation is only valid when the electron density is low, so that the particle interactions are relatively weak.

==== Result: Screened potential ====

Our results from the Debye–Hückel or Thomas–Fermi approximation may now be inserted into Poisson&#x27;s equation. The result is
formula_12
which is known as the screened Poisson equation. The solution is
formula_13
which is called a screened Coulomb potential. It is a Coulomb potential multiplied by an exponential damping term, with the strength of the damping factor given by the magnitude of &quot;k&quot;0, the Debye or Thomas–Fermi wave vector. Note that this potential has the same form as the Yukawa potential. This screening yields a dielectric function formula_14.

== Many-body theory ==

=== Classical physics and linear response ===

A mechanical formula_2-body approach provides together the derivation of screening effect and of Landau damping. It deals with a single realization of a one-component plasma whose electrons have a velocity dispersion (for a thermal plasma, there must be many particles in a Debye sphere, a volume whose radius is the Debye length). On using the linearized motion of the electrons in their own electric field, it yields an equation of the type
formula_16

where formula_17 is a linear operator, formula_18 is a source term due to the particles, and formula_19 is the Fourier-Laplace transform of the electrostatic potential. When substituting an integral over a smooth distribution function for the discrete sum over the particles in formula_17, one gets
formula_21
where formula_22 is the plasma permittivity, or dielectric function, classically obtained by a linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation, formula_23 is the wave vector, formula_24 is the frequency, and formula_25 is the sum of formula_2 source terms due to the particles.

By inverse Fourier-Laplace transform, the potential due to each particle is the sum of two parts One corresponds to the excitation of Langmuir waves by the particle, and the other one is its screened potential, as classically obtained by a linearized Vlasovian calculation involving a test particle. The screened potential is the above screened Coulomb potential for a thermal plasma and a thermal particle. For a faster particle, the potential is modified. Substituting an integral over a smooth distribution function for the discrete sum over the particles in formula_25, yields the Vlasovian expression enabling the calculation of Landau damping.

=== Quantum-mechanical approach ===
In real metals, the screening effect is more complex than described above in the Thomas–Fermi theory. The assumption that the charge carriers (electrons) can respond at any wavevector is just an approximation. However, it is not energetically possible for an electron within or on a Fermi surface to respond at wavevectors shorter than the Fermi wavevector. This constraint is related to the Gibbs phenomenon, where Fourier series for functions that vary rapidly in space are not good approximations unless a very large number of terms in the series are retained. In physics, this phenomenon is known as Friedel oscillations, and applies both to surface and bulk screening. In each case the net electric field does not fall off exponentially in space, but rather as an inverse power law multiplied by an oscillatory term. Theoretical calculations can be obtained from quantum hydrodynamics and density functional theory (DFT).

<text>Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Rosenthal (born December 2, 1944) is an American horticulturist, author, publisher, and &quot;Cannabis&quot; grower known for his advocacy for the legalization of marijuana use. He served as a columnist for &quot;High Times Magazine&quot; during the 1980s and 1990s. He was arrested in 2002 for cultivation of cannabis by federal authorities, who do not recognize the authority of states to regulate the use of medical marijuana. He was convicted in federal court, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Rosenthal was subsequently convicted again, but was not re-sentenced, since his original sentence had been completed.

Rosenthal has been active in promoting and developing policies of civil regulation for medicinal marijuana. With the passage of California&#x27;s pioneering Proposition 215 in 1996, which authorizes medicinal use of marijuana, he worked with the state and local governments to implement the delivery of pharmaceutical-grade cannabis to patients with a doctor&#x27;s recommendation to use marijuana.

Rosenthal is also the author of numerous books about the cultivation of marijuana.

==Legal battles==
In 2002, federal agents arrested Rosenthal, who previously had been deputized by the City of Oakland to grow marijuana for medical use. He was convicted, and some of the jurors denounced their own verdict after they learned Rosenthal was acting as an agent of the City of Oakland, a fact that had been withheld from them during the trial. In a surprise setback for the federal government, Rosenthal was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer to only one day in prison; time already served. In 2006, the 9th Circuit Appeals Court subsequently overturned Rosenthal&#x27;s conviction. Months later, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office re-indicted him. Although the judge had promised to sentence Rosenthal to no additional prison time, a new trial commenced on 14 May 2007.

On 31 May 2007, it was announced that Rosenthal had been convicted again on three of the five charges against him: one conspiracy count; one count of cultivation, intending to distribute and distributing marijuana; and one count of using a commercial building as a site for growing and distributing marijuana. He was acquitted of growing and distributing marijuana at the Harm Reduction Center medical-marijuana club in San Francisco. The jury deadlocked on whether he had conspired to grow and distribute marijuana at the Harm Reduction Center. Judge Breyer once again prohibited Rosenthal&#x27;s lawyers from arguing before the jury that his work was sanctioned by Oakland government officials, a main point of contention for the jurors of the previous trial. Ed Rosenthal did not receive any additional jail time and planned to appeal.

==Advocacy==

Rosenthal&#x27;s public battles in the court have focused attention on the question of whether marijuana laws have become more harmful to society than the behavior they were intended to regulate. Recent polls show that as many as 80% of Americans support legal access to medical marijuana. The Federal Government does not recognize the legitimacy of medical marijuana initiatives passed by individual states, but under the Cole Memorandum, will not be enforcing federal laws against states that have legalized the recreational use such as California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine, Nevada, Massachusetts and Washington.

Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draft (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.

Pressurized kerosene lamps use a gas mantle; these are known as Petromax, Tilley lamps, or Coleman lamps, among other manufacturers. They produce more light per unit of fuel than wick-type lamps, but are more complex and expensive in construction and more complex to operate. A hand-pump pressurizes air, which forces liquid fuel from a reservoir into a gas chamber. Vapor from the chamber burns, heating a mantle to incandescence and providing heat.

Kerosene lamps are widely used for lighting in rural areas of Africa and Asia, where electricity is not distributed or is too costly. As of 2005, kerosene and other fuel-based illumination methods consume an estimated of fuel per year, equivalent to per day. This is comparable to annual U.S. jet-fuel consumption of per year.

== History ==
In 1813, John Tilley invented the hydro-pneumatic blowpipe. In 1818, William Henry Tilley, gas fitters, was manufacturing gas lamps in Stoke Newington.

In 1846, Abraham Pineo Gesner invented a substitute for whale oil for lighting, distilled from coal. Later made from petroleum, kerosene became a popular lighting fuel. Modern and most popular versions of the paraffin lamp were later constructed by Polish inventor and pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz, in Lviv in 1853. It was a significant improvement over lamps designed to burn vegetable or sperm oil.

In 1914, the Coleman Lantern pressure lamp was introduced by the Coleman Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;terry-marsh/coleman-1914&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldtowncoleman/date-a-coleman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coleman/our-story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Tilley High-Pressure Gas Company started using kerosene as a fuel for lamps.&lt;ref name=&quot;gracesguide/Tilley_Lamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Flat-wick lamp ===

A flat-wick lamp is a simple type of kerosene lamp, which burns kerosene drawn up through a wick by capillary action. If this type of lamp is broken, it can easily start a fire. A flat-wick lamp has a fuel tank (fount), with the lamp burner attached. Attached to the fuel tank, four prongs hold the glass chimney, which acts to prevent the flame from being blown out and enhances a thermally induced draft. The glass chimney needs a &quot;throat&quot;, or slight constriction, to create the proper draft for complete combustion of the fuel; the draft carries more air (oxygen) past the flame, helping to produce a smokeless light, which is brighter than an open flame would produce.

The chimney is used for a more important duty. The mantle/wick holder has holes around the outer edges. When the lantern is lit and a chimney is attached, the thermally induced draft draws air through these holes and passes over the top of the mantle, just as a chimney in a house. This has a cooling effect and keeps the mantle from overheating. Without a properly installed chimney, a definite safety condition exists. This is even more important if using Aladdin lamps. They also have a thinner chimney to induce a faster airflow. This information should be adhered to regardless of the type of lantern in use.

The lamp burner has a flat wick, usually made of cotton. The lower part of the wick dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the wick extends out of the wick tube of the lamp burner, which includes a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the wick extends above the wick tube controls the flame. The wick tube surrounds the wick and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner. Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed metal sprocket bearing against the wick. If the wick is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone at the top of the wick tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the wick has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the wick draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat-wick lamps use the dead-flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below, and hot air exits above.

This type of lamp was very widely used by railways, both on the front and rear of trains and for hand signals, due to its reliability. At a time when there were few competing light sources at night outside major towns, the limited brightness of these lamps was adequate and could be seen at sufficient distance to serve as a warning or signal.

=== Central-draft (tubular round wick) lamp ===
A central-draft lamp is a continuation of the principles used in the Argand lamp from 1780. It also uses a tubular round wick and it also has air intake under the flame into the glass chimney. Since whale oil used in the Argand lamp has a high viscosity it was necessary to place the oil reservoir higher than the flame of the lamp itself in order to let the oil flow by pressure caused by gravity. Kerosene has a much lower viscosity and can be transported through the wick by capillary action. This made it possible to install the oil reservoir below the flame. Oil reservoirs were made with a hollow tube in the middle that transported air from below the oil reservoir into the flame. The tubular woven wick (or flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick) is placed around this tube. The tubular wick is then mounted into a &quot;carrier&quot;, which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the &quot;central draft&quot; or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly. 

=== Side-draft (flat wick folded round) lamp ===
In 1865 the Berlin based company Wild &amp; Wessel invented the Kosmos Brenner. This lamp used a flat wick that was folded open at the bottom and gradually folded round at the top. This allowed for air flow in the centre of flame just like in centre-draft burner. Only here the air intake is done above the oil reservoir and under the burner itself. This avoids the need of a hollow tube all along the hight of the reservoir. This make it easier to use ceramic or glass oil reservoirs. While the Kosmos Brenner doesn&#x27;t use a flame spreader other side draft kerosene lamps do. Examples are the Ideal Brenner and the Matador Brenner from Ehrich and Graetz 

=== Duplex lamp (two parallel flat wicks) lamp ===
In 1865 the Duplex lamp also came on the market. It was a very popular type of kerosene lamp in Great Britain. The lamps had 2 flat wicks inside 1 glass chimney. Both wicks could be ajusted with their own wick raiser knob. 

=== Mantle lamp ===
A variation on the &quot;central-draft&quot; lamp is the mantle lamp. The mantle is a roughly pear-shaped mesh made of fabric placed over the burner. The mantle typically contains thorium or other rare-earth salts; on first use the cloth burns away, and the rare-earth salts are converted to oxides, leaving a very fragile structure, which incandesces (glows brightly) upon exposure to the heat of the burner flame. Mantle lamps are considerably brighter than flat- or round-wick lamps, produce a whiter light and generate more heat. Mantle lamps typically use fuel faster than a flat-wick lamp, but slower than a center-draft round-wick, as they depend on a small flame heating a mantle, rather than having all the light coming from the flame itself.

Mantle lamps are nearly always bright enough to benefit from a lampshade, and a few mantle lamps may be enough to heat a small building in cold weather. Mantle lamps, because of the higher temperature at which they operate, do not produce much odor, except when first lit or extinguished. Like flat- and round-wick lamps, they can be adjusted for brightness; however, caution must be used, because if set too high, the lamp chimney and the mantle can become covered with black areas of soot. A lamp set too high will burn off its soot harmlessly if quickly turned down, but if not caught soon enough, the soot itself can ignite, and a &quot;runaway lamp&quot; condition can result.

All unpressurized mantle lamps are based on the Argand lamp that was improved by the Clamond basket mantle. These lamps were popular from 1882 until shortly after WWII, when rural electrification made them obsolete. Aladdin Lamps is the only maker of this style lamp today. Even they, are now marketing electric fixtures that fit the old style lamps.

Large fixed pressurized kerosene mantle lamps were used in lighthouse beacons for navigation of ships, brighter and with lower fuel consumption than oil lamps used before. An early version of the gas mantle lamp, kerosene was vaporized by a secondary burner, which pressurized the kerosene tank that supplied the central draught. Like all gas mantle lamps, the only purpose of the burner is to hold the flame that heats the mantle, which is 4-5 times as bright as the wick itself. The Coleman Lantern is the direct descendant of this type lamp.

=== Kerosene lantern ===

A kerosene lantern, also known as a &quot;barn lantern&quot; or &quot;hurricane lantern&quot;, is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use. They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet-metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast. Both hot-blast and cold-blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead-flame lamps, as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.

The earliest portable kerosene &quot;glass globe&quot; lanterns, of the 1850s and 1860s, were of the dead-flame type, meaning that it had an open wick, but the airflow to the flame was strictly controlled in an upward motion by a combination of vents at the bottom of the burner and an open topped chimney. This had the effect of removing side-to-side drafts and thus significantly reducing or even eliminating the flickering that can occur with an exposed flame.

Later lanterns, such as the hot-blast and cold-blast lanterns, took this airflow control even further by partially or fully enclosing the wick in a &quot;deflector&quot; or &quot;burner cone&quot; and then channeling the air to be supplied for combustion at the wick while at the same time pre-heating the air for combustion.

The hot-blast design, also known as a &quot;tubular lantern&quot; due to the metal tubes used in its construction, was invented by John H. Irwin and was . As noted in the patent, the &quot;novel mode of constructing a lantern whereby the wind, instead of acting upon the flame in such a manner as to extinguish it, serves to support or sustain and prevent the extinguishment thereof.&quot; This improvement essentially redirected wind which might normally tend to extinguish the flame of an unprotected dead-flame lantern, instead is redirected, slowed, pre-heated, and supplied to the burner to actually support and promote the combustion of the fuel.

Later, Irwin improved upon this design by inventing and . This design is similar to his earlier &quot;hot-blast&quot; design, except that the oxygen-depleted hot combustion byproducts are redirected and prevented from recirculating back to the burner by redesigning the intake products, so that only oxygen-rich, fresh air is drawn from the atmosphere into the lamp (&quot;the inlets for fresh air are placed out of the ascending current of products of combustion, and said products are thereby prevented from entering [the air intake]&quot;). The primary benefit of this design compared to the earlier &quot;hot-blast&quot; design was to maximize the amount of oxygen available for combustion by ensuring that only fresh air is supplied to the burner, thereby increasing the brightness and stability of the flame.

== Safety ==
=== Combustion ===
Contamination of lamp fuel with even a small amount of gasoline results in a lower flash point and higher vapor pressure for the fuel, with potentially dangerous consequences. Vapors from spilled fuel may ignite; vapor trapped above liquid fuel may lead to excess pressure and fires. Kerosene lamps are still extensively used in areas without electrical lighting; the cost and dangers of combustion lighting are a continuing concern in many countries.

=== Inhalation ===
The World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that “governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use”. Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter, and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer, respiratory infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataract, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

== Performance ==
Flat-wick lamps have the lowest light output, center-draft round-wick lamps have three to four times the output of flat-wick lamps, and pressurized lamps have higher output yet; the range is from 8 to 100 lumens. A kerosene lamp producing 37 lumens for 4 hours per day for a month (120 hours) consumes about of kerosene.

12.57 lumens = 1 CP

==1970s==
===1973===
* Alexander Holevo publishes a paper showing that &quot;n&quot; qubits can carry more than &quot;n&quot; classical bits of information, but at most &quot;n&quot; classical bits are accessible (a result known as &quot;Holevo&#x27;s theorem&quot; or &quot;Holevo&#x27;s bound&quot;).
* Charles H. Bennett shows that computation can be done reversibly.

===1975===

* Roman Stanisław Ingarden, a Polish mathematical physicist, submits the paper &quot;Quantum Information Theory&quot; in Reports on Mathematical Physics, vol. 10, pp. 43–72, published 1976. It is one of the first attempts at creating a quantum information theory, showing that Shannon information theory cannot directly be generalized to the quantum case, but rather that it is possible to construct a quantum information theory, which is a generalization of Shannon&#x27;s theory, within the formalism of a generalized quantum mechanics of open systems and a generalized concept of observables (the so-called semi-observables).

==1980s==
===1980===
* Paul Benioff describes the first quantum mechanical model of a computer. In this work, Benioff showed that a computer could operate under the laws of quantum mechanics by describing a Schrödinger equation description of Turing machines, laying a foundation for further work in quantum computing. The paper was submitted in June 1979 and published in April 1980. 
* Yuri Manin briefly motivates the idea of quantum computing.
* Tommaso Toffoli introduces the reversible Toffoli gate, which (together with initialized ancilla bits) is functionally complete for reversible classical computation.

===1981===
* At the first Conference on the Physics of Computation, held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in May, Paul Benioff and Richard Feynman give talks on quantum computing. Benioff&#x27;s talk built on his earlier 1980 work showing that a computer can operate under the laws of quantum mechanics. The talk was titled &quot;Quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of discrete processes that erase their own histories: application to Turing machines&quot;. In Feynman&#x27;s talk, he observed that it appeared to be impossible to efficiently simulate an evolution of a quantum system on a classical computer, and he proposed a basic model for a quantum computer.

===1982===
* Paul Benioff further develops his original model of a quantum mechanical Turing machine.
* William Wootters and Wojciech H. Zurek, and independently Dennis Dieks rediscover the no-cloning theorem of James L. Park.
* Richard Feynman formulates a conjecture on quantum simulation, stating that quantum systems require quantum computers to be simulated efficiently.

===1984===
* Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard employ Wiesner&#x27;s conjugate coding for distribution of cryptographic keys.

===1985===
* David Deutsch, at the University of Oxford, England, describes the first universal quantum computer. Just as a Universal Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine efficiently (Church–Turing thesis), so the universal quantum computer is able to simulate any other quantum computer with at most a polynomial slowdown.
* Asher Peres points out the need for quantum error correction schemes and discusses a repetition code for amplitude errors.

===1988===
* Yoshihisa Yamamoto and K. Igeta propose the first physical realization of a quantum computer, including Feynman&#x27;s CNOT gate. Their approach uses atoms and photons and is the progenitor of modern quantum computing and networking protocols using photons to transmit qubits and atoms to perform two-qubit operations.

===1989===
* Gerard J. Milburn proposes a quantum-optical realization of a Fredkin gate.
* Bikas Chakrabarti &amp; collaborators from Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, India, propose that quantum fluctuations could help explore rugged energy landscapes by escaping from local minima of glassy systems having tall but thin barriers by tunneling (instead of climbing over using thermal excitations), suggesting the effectiveness of quantum annealing over classical simulated annealing.

==1990s==

===1991===
* Artur Ekert at the University of Oxford, proposes entanglement-based secure communication.

===1992===
* David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa propose a computational problem that can be solved efficiently with the deterministic Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm on a quantum computer, but for which no deterministic classical algorithm is possible. This was perhaps the earliest result in the computational complexity of quantum computers, proving that they were capable of performing &quot;some&quot; well-defined computation more efficiently than any classical computer.
* Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani propose the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm. It is a restricted version of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm where instead of distinguishing between two different classes of functions, it tries to learn a string encoded in a function. The Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm was designed to prove an oracle separation between complexity classes BQP and BPP.
* Research groups at Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (Garching) and shortly after at NIST (Boulder) experimentally realize the first crystallized strings of laser-cooled ions. Linear ion crystals constitute the qubit basis for most quantum computing and simulation experiments with trapped ions.

===1993===
* Dan Simon, at Université de Montréal, Quebec, Canada, invent an oracle problem, Simon&#x27;s problem, for which a quantum computer would be exponentially faster than a conventional computer. This algorithm introduces the main ideas which were then developed in Peter Shor&#x27;s factorization algorithm.

===1994===
* Peter Shor, at AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Labs in New Jersey, publishes Shor&#x27;s algorithm. It would allow a quantum computer to factor large integers quickly. It solves both the factoring problem and the discrete log problem. The algorithm can theoretically break many of the cryptosystems in use today. Its invention sparked tremendous interest in quantum computers.
* The first United States Government workshop on quantum computing is organized by NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in autumn.
* Isaac Chuang and Yoshihisa Yamamoto propose a quantum-optical realization of a quantum computer to implement Deutsch&#x27;s algorithm. Their work introduced dual-rail encoding for photonic qubits.
* In December, Ignacio Cirac, at University of Castilla–La Mancha at Ciudad Real, and Peter Zoller at the University of Innsbruck propose an experimental realization of the controlled NOT gate with cold trapped ions.

===1995===
* The first United States Department of Defense workshop on quantum computing and quantum cryptography is organized by United States Army physicists Charles M. Bowden, Jonathan Dowling, and Henry O. Everitt; it took place in February at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
* Peter Shor proposes the first schemes for quantum error correction.
* Christopher Monroe and David J. Wineland at NIST (Boulder, Colorado) experimentally realize the first quantum logic gate – the controlled NOT gate – with trapped ions, following the Cirac-Zoller proposal.
*Independently, Subhash Kak and Ronald Chrisley propose the first quantum neural network.

===1996===
* Lov Grover, at Bell Labs, invents the quantum database search algorithm. The quadratic speedup is not as dramatic as the speedup for factoring, discrete logs, or physics simulations. However, the algorithm can be applied to a much wider variety of problems. Any problem that can be solved by random, brute-force search, may take advantage of this quadratic speedup in the number of search queries.
* The United States Government, particularly in a joint partnership of the Army Research Office (now part of the Army Research Laboratory) and the National Security Agency, issues the first public call for research proposals in quantum information processing.
* Andrew Steane designs Steane code for error correction.
* David DiVincenzo, of IBM, proposes a list of minimal requirements for creating a quantum computer, now called DiVincenzo&#x27;s criteria.
* Seth Lloyd proves Feynman&#x27;s conjecture on quantum simulation.

===1997===
* David G. Cory, Amr Fahmy and Timothy Havel, and at the same time Neil Gershenfeld and Isaac Chuang at MIT publish the first papers realizing gates for quantum computers based on bulk nuclear spin resonance, or thermal ensembles. The technology is based on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) machine, which is similar to the medical magnetic resonance imaging machine.
* Alexei Kitaev describes the principles of topological quantum computation as a method for dealing with the problem of decoherence.
* Daniel Loss and David DiVincenzo propose the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum computer, using as qubits the intrinsic spin-1/2 degree of freedom of individual electrons confined to quantum dots.

===1998===

<doc id="191921" wikidata="Q3272069" url="?curid=191921" title="ArtCenter College of Design">
<text>ArtCenter College of Design is a private art university in Pasadena, California.

It was incorporated in 1930 as a degree-granting institution of higher learning in the US created specifically for students of both the visual arts and design. It offers Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Arts, Master of Science, Doctor of Arts, and Doctor of Science degrees across multiple majors mostly relating to design.

==History==
ArtCenter College of Design was founded in 1930 in downtown Los Angeles as the ArtCenter School. In 1935, Fred R. Archer founded the photography department, and Ansel Adams was a guest instructor in the late 1930s. During and after World War II, ArtCenter ran a technical illustration program in conjunction with the California Institute of Technology.

In 1947, the post-war boom in students caused the school to expand to a larger location in the building of the former Cumnock School for Girls in the Hancock Park neighborhood, while still maintaining a presence at its original downtown location. The school began granting Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degrees in arts in 1949, and was fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges in 1955.

In 1965, the school changed its name to Art Center College of Design. The school expanded its programs, including a film program in 1973. The school moved to the Hillside Campus in Pasadena in 1976. The school operated ArtCenter Europe in Vevey, Switzerland from 1986 to 1996. In 2003, ArtCenter was granted Non-governmental organization status by the UN Department of Public Information.

ArtCenter opened the South Campus in Pasadena in 2004. In 2019, ArtCenter revealed they exceeded their $100 million goal when their fundraising campaign for additional scholarships and expanding their south campus started in 2011. The school raised $124 million from more than 7,000 contributions. ArtCenter celebrated their 90th anniversary on April 16, 2020. The planned celebration was rescheduled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

==Academics==
ArtCenter offers undergraduate and graduate programs in a wide variety of art and design fields, as well as public programs for children and high school students, and continuing studies for adults in the Los Angeles metro area. It is one of the few schools to offer a degree in Interaction Design. The two campuses in Pasadena are considered architecturally notable. ArtCenter built its reputation as a vocational school, preparing returning G.I.s for work in the commercial arts fields and began awarding degrees in 1949. In recognition of Art Center&#x27;s commitment to addressing social and humanitarian issues through design, 2003 saw ArtCenter become the first design college to ever receive NGO (non-governmental organization) status by the United Nations.

The college logo is an orange circle, also known as the ArtCenter &quot;Dot,&quot; which has been a part of the school&#x27;s identity since its inception by founder Tink Adams and a small number of colleagues. ArtCenter is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.

===Rankings===
While art and design schools are not regularly included in typical undergraduate rankings such as &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, ArtCenter has been recognized by a number of national and industry publications. The college&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate industrial design programs are consistently ranked number one by &quot;DesignIntelligence.&quot; &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; also ranks Art Center&#x27;s Art, Industrial Design and Media Design Practices programs among the top 20 graduate schools in the U.S. Most recently, the growing influence of Art Center&#x27;s Film programs resulted in the college&#x27;s ranking among &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&#x27;s&quot; list of the Top 25 Global Film Schools.

In 2014, Money magazine ranked Art Center third on its list of 25 of the best college values and in 2013, Coroflot&#x27;s 2013 Creative Employment Snapshot respondents showed Art Center alumni earning more compared to peer institutions. In 2021, ArtCenter was ranked number ten globally according to the QS World University Rankings by the subject Art and Design.

==Facilities==
ArtCenter College of Design has two campuses in Pasadena: Hillside Campus and South Campus.

===Hillside Campus===

Designed by modernist architect Craig Ellwood, the Hillside Campus broke ground in November 1974. The &quot;bridge building&quot; spanned an arroyo and roadway on in the hills above Pasadena. Opening in 1976, the building was later expanded with the south wing, designed by former Ellwood associate James Tyler, and constructed between 1989 and 1991. The Hillside Campus houses classrooms and studio space, multiple computer labs, the James Lemont Fogg Memorial Library, a model shop with traditional tools as well as rapid prototyping technologies (multi-axis CNC, laser-cutting, and multiple types of 3D printing), painting facilities, the Color, Material, and Trends Exploration Lab (CMTEL), an (Auto) Interior Simulation Lab, the Sinclaire Pavilion, photo and film stages with printing and editing facilities, and both a curated student gallery and an external exhibit gallery, both open to the public. The Hillside Campus has been designated as a historic monument by the City of Pasadena.

===South Campus===
The South Campus opened in 2004 in a former aircraft-testing facility built during World War II. Renovated by the Santa Monica-based firm Daly Genik, it houses the graduate Art and the Media Design Practices programs and studios, exhibition space for both of those programs, a print shop, a letterpress studio, and public programs including the ArtCenter at Night, ArtCenter for Kids, and the Design-Based Learning Lab. There is an exhibition space known as the Wind Tunnel, which is currently the home of the Media Design Practices program. The Wind Tunnel has hosted events including the biannual ArtCenter Design Conference like 2006&#x27;s &quot;Radical Craft&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Serious Play&quot;; an annual Summit on Sustainable Mobility, large exhibitions such as &quot;Supersonic: 1 Wind Tunnel, 8 Schools, 120 Artists&quot;; &quot;Gardenlab&quot;, and &quot;Open House: Architecture and Technology for Intelligent Living&quot; (with Vitra Design Museum), and various community meetings and events.

In 2012, ArtCenter announced the expansion of South Campus with the acquisition of a former U.S. Postal Service property adjacent to the existing campus, made entirely possible through the college&#x27;s philanthropic efforts. At that time, the college appointed Michael Maltzan Architecture as its partner in planning academic spaces and expansion of its educational resources. With this agreement still intact, actual renovation of the former USPS building was completed by Darin Johnstone Architecture in 2014. Also in 2014, ArtCenter announced the acquisition of an office building at the &quot;gateway&quot; to Pasadena and future plans for new student housing, all of which will elevate South Campus from a &quot;satellite&quot; location to equal programs and activities found at the Hillside Campus.

In 2014, ArtCenter announced a $2 million gift to establish the Hoffmitz Milken Center for Typography &quot;to advance the research, teaching and understanding of letterform design.&quot; The center is named after 20-year Art Center typography teacher Leah Toby Hoffmitz Milken and the establishing gift was made by the Lowell Milken Family Foundation.

== Student outcomes ==
College scorecard estimated that the median salary in 2020 and 2021 for graduates who matriculated in 2010 and 2011 was $70,700 with 68% making more than high school graduates. Center on Education and the Workforce estimates the return on investment 10 years after graduation with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the college is $5,000; however, this metric appreciates to $1,010,000 40 years after graduation.

<text>Denatured alcohol, also known as methylated spirits, metho, or meths in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, and as [[Rectified spirit|denatured rectified spirit]], is ethanol that has additives to make it poisonous, bad-tasting, foul-smelling, or nauseating to discourage its recreational consumption. It is sometimes dyed so that it can be identified visually. Pyridine and methanol, each and together, make denatured alcohol poisonous; denatonium makes it bitter.

Denatured alcohol is used as a solvent and as fuel for alcohol burners and camping stoves. Because of the diversity of industrial uses for denatured alcohol, hundreds of additives and denaturing methods have been used. The main additive usually is 10% methanol (methyl alcohol), hence the name &quot;methylated spirits&quot;. Other common additives include isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone.

Denaturing alcohol does not alter the ethanol molecule (chemically or structurally), unlike denaturation in biochemistry. Rather, the ethanol is mixed with other chemicals to form a foul-tasting, often toxic, solution. For many of these solutions, it is intentionally difficult to separate the components.

In many countries denaturated alcohol is traditionally dyed with methyl violet or similar hue (crystal violet, methylene blue) dye for safety reasons. In Central and Eastern Europe ((what are now) Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and others) this was mandatory during the communist era.

== Uses ==

In many countries, sales of alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed for revenue and public health policy purposes (see Pigovian tax). In order to avoid paying beverage taxes on alcohol that is not meant to be consumed, the alcohol is usually &quot;denatured&quot;, or treated with added chemicals to make it unpalatable. Its composition is tightly defined by government regulations in countries that tax alcoholic beverages. Denatured alcohol is used identically to ethanol itself but only for applications that involve fuel, surgical and laboratory stock. Pure ethanol is required for food and beverage applications and certain chemical reactions where the denaturant would interfere. In molecular biology, denatured ethanol should not be used for the precipitation of nucleic acids, since the additives may interfere with downstream applications.

Denatured alcohol has no advantages for any purpose over normal ethanol; it is a public policy compromise. As denatured alcohol is sold without the often heavy taxes on alcohol suitable for consumption, it is a cheaper solution for most uses that do not involve drinking. If pure ethanol were made cheaply available for fuel, solvents, or medicinal purposes, it could be used as a beverage without payment of alcohol tax.

== Toxicity ==

Despite its poisonous content, denatured alcohol is sometimes consumed as a surrogate alcohol. This can result in blindness or death if it contains methanol. For instance, during the thirteen-year prohibition of alcohol in the US, federal law required methanol be added to domestically manufactured industrial alcohols. From 25–27 December 1926, which was roughly at the midpoint of nationwide alcohol prohibition, 31 people in New York City alone died of methanol poisoning. To help prevent this, denatonium is often added to give the substance an extremely bitter flavour. Substances, such as pyridine, are added to give the mixture an unpleasant odour, and agents such as syrup of ipecac may also be included to induce vomiting.

New Zealand has removed methanol from its government-approved &quot;methylated spirits&quot; formulation.

In the USSR, denatured alcohol was used as drinking alcohol surrogate, along with many other technical ethanol-containing products. This was especially common during various anti-alcohol campaigns initiated by the Soviet government. There is much evidence to that in both popular folklore and in literature and music. The word &quot;denaturat&quot; (Russian: денатурат) even gained a special symbolic meaning. Its consumption is mentioned in songs of Vladimir Vysotsky, as well as written works of Venedikt Yerofeev, Yuz Aleshkovsky, and Vyacheslav Shishkov.

== Formulations ==
Diverse additives are used to make it difficult to use distillation or other simple processes to reverse the denaturation. Methanol is commonly used both because its boiling point is close to that of ethanol and because it is toxic. Another typical denaturant is pyridine. Often the denatured alcohol is dyed with methyl violet.

There are several grades of denatured alcohol, but in general the denaturants used are similar. As an example, the formulation for &quot;completely denatured alcohol&quot;, according to 2005 British regulations was as follows:

The European Union agreed in February 2013 to the following mutual procedures for the complete denaturing of alcohol:

=== Specially denatured alcohol ===
A specially denatured alcohol (SDA) is one of many types of denatured alcohol specified under the United States Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 21.151. A specially denatured alcohol is a combination of ethanol and another chemical substance, e.g., ethyl acetate in SDA 29, 35, and 35A, added to render the mixture unsuitable for drinking. SDAs are often used in cosmetic products, and can also be used in chemical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and solvents. Another example is SDA 40-B, which contains tert-butyl alcohol and denatonium benzoate, N.F. In the United States and other countries, the use of denatured alcohol unsuitable for beverages avoids excise taxes on alcohol.

<doc id="191924" wikidata="Q156211" url="?curid=191924" title="Treaty of Paris (1763)">
<text>The Treaty of Paris, also known as the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763 by the kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement, following Great Britain and Prussia&#x27;s victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

The signing of the treaty formally ended the conflict between France and Great Britain over control of North America (the Seven Years&#x27; War, known as the French and Indian War in the United States), and marked the beginning of an era of British dominance outside Europe. Great Britain and France each returned much of the territory that they had captured during the war, but Great Britain gained much of France&#x27;s possessions in North America. Additionally, Great Britain agreed to protect Roman Catholicism in the New World. The treaty did not involve Prussia and Austria, as they signed a separate agreement, the Treaty of Hubertusburg, five days later.

==Exchange of territories==
During the war, Great Britain had conquered the French colonies of Canada, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago, the French factories (trading posts) in India, the slave-trading station at Gorée, the Sénégal River and its settlements, and the Spanish colonies of Manila (in the Philippines) and Havana (in Cuba). France had captured Minorca and British trading posts in Sumatra, while Spain had captured the border fortress of Almeida in Portugal, and Colonia del Sacramento in South America.
The treaty restored most of the territories to their original owners, but Britain was allowed to keep considerable gains. France and Spain restored all their conquests to Britain and Portugal. Britain restored Manila and Havana to Spain, and Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Gorée, and the Indian factories to France. In return, France recognized the sovereignty of Britain over Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago.

France also ceded the eastern half of French Louisiana to Britain; that is, the area from the Mississippi River to the Appalachian Mountains. France had already secretly given Louisiana to Spain three months earlier in the Treaty of Fontainebleau, but Spain did not take possession until 1769. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. In addition, France regained its factories in India but recognized British clients as the rulers of key Indian native states and pledged not to send troops to Bengal. Britain agreed to demolish its fortifications in British Honduras (now Belize) but retained a logwood-cutting colony there. Britain confirmed the right of its new subjects to practise Catholicism.

France lost all its territory in mainland North America except for the territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River. France retained fishing rights off Newfoundland and the two small islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, where its fishermen could dry their catch. In turn, France gained the return of its sugar colony, Guadeloupe, which it considered more valuable than Canada. Voltaire had notoriously dismissed Acadia as (a few acres of snow).

==Louisiana question==
The Treaty of Paris is notable because it furthered the transfer of Louisiana from France to Spain. However, the agreement to transfer had occurred with the Treaty of Fontainebleau, but it was not publicly announced until 1764. The Treaty of Paris gave Britain the east side of the Mississippi (including Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which was to be part of the British territory of West Florida). On the east side, New Orleans remained in French hands (albeit temporarily). The Mississippi River corridor in what is now Louisiana was later reunited following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819.

The 1763 treaty states in Article VII:

==Canada question==
===British perspective===
The war was fought all over the world, but the British began the war over French possessions in North America. After a long debate of the relative merits of Guadeloupe, which produced £6 million a year in sugar, and Canada, which was expensive to keep, Great Britain decided to keep Canada for strategic reasons and to return Guadeloupe to France. The war had weakened France, but it was still a European power. British Prime Minister Lord Bute wanted a peace that would not push France towards a second war.

Although the Protestant British worried about having so many Roman Catholic subjects, Great Britain did not want to antagonize France by expulsion or forced conversion or for French settlers to leave Canada to strengthen other French settlements in North America.

===French perspective===
Unlike Lord Bute, the French Foreign Minister, the Duke of Choiseul, expected a return to war. However, France needed peace to rebuild. France preferred to keep its Caribbean possessions with their profitable sugar trade, rather than the vast Canadian lands, which had been a financial burden on France. French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt. In Canada, France wanted open emigration for those, such as the nobility, who would not swear allegiance to the British Crown. Finally, France required protection for Roman Catholics in North America.

Article IV stated:

==Dunkirk question==
During the negotiations that led to the treaty, a major issue of dispute between Britain and France had been over the status of the fortifications of the French coastal settlement of Dunkirk. The British had long feared that it would be used as a staging post to launch a French invasion of Britain. Under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, the British forced France to concede extreme limits on those fortifications. The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had allowed more generous terms, and France constructed more significant defences for the town.

The 1763 treaty had Britain force France to accept the 1713 conditions and demolish the fortifications constructed since then. That would be a continuing source of resentment to France, which would eventually have that provision overturned in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which brought an end to the American Revolutionary War.

==Reactions==

When Lord Bute rose to the position of British prime minister in 1762, he pushed for a resolution to the war with France and Spain since he feared that Great Britain could not govern all of its newly acquired territories. In what Winston Churchill would later term a policy of &quot;appeasement&quot;, Bute returned some colonies to Spain and France in the negotiations.

Despite a desire for peace, many in the British Parliament opposed the return of any gains made during the war. Notable among the opposition was former prime minister William Pitt, the Elder, who warned that the terms of the treaty would lead to further conflicts once France and Spain had time to rebuild and later said, &quot;The peace was insecure because it restored the enemy to her former greatness. The peace was inadequate, because the places gained were no equivalent for the places surrendered.&quot; The treaty passed by 319 votes to 65.

The Treaty of Paris took no consideration of Great Britain&#x27;s battered continental ally, King Frederick II of Prussia, who negotiated peace terms separately in the Treaty of Hubertusburg. For decades after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Frederick II decried it as a British betrayal.

Many Protestant American colonists were disappointed by the protection of Catholicism in the Treaty of Paris. Criticism of the British colonial government as insufficiently anti-Catholic and fear of the protections for Catholicism expanding beyond Quebec was one of many reasons for the breakdown of American–British relations that led to the American Revolution.

==Effects on French Canada==

The article permitted unrestrained emigration for 18 months from Canada. However, passage on British ships was expensive. A total of 1,600 people left New France by that clause, but only 270 of them were French Canadians. Some claim that there was a deliberate British policy to limit emigration to avoid strengthening other French colonies.

Article IV of the treaty allowed Catholicism to be practiced in Canada. King George III agreed to allow Catholicism within the laws of Great Britain, which included various Test Acts to prevent governmental, judicial and bureaucratic appointments from going to Roman Catholics. They were believed to be agents of the Jacobite pretenders to the throne, who normally resided in France and were supported by its government. The Test Acts were somewhat relaxed in Quebec, but top positions such as governorships were still held by Anglicans.

Article IV has also been cited as the basis for Quebec&#x27;s unique legal code that differs from the rest of Canada. There was a general constitutional principle in the United Kingdom allowing colonies taken through conquest to continue their laws. That was limited by royal prerogative, which allowed the monarch to change the accepted laws in a conquered colony later. However, the treaty eliminated that power because of a different constitutional principle, which considered the terms of a treaty to be paramount. In practice, Roman Catholics were allowed to become jurors in inferior courts in Quebec and to argue based on principles of French law. However, the judge was British, and his opinion on French law could be limited or hostile. If the case was appealed to a superior court, neither French law nor Roman Catholic jurors were allowed.

Many French residents of what are now the Maritime Provinces of Canada were deported during the Great Expulsion of the Acadians (1755–1763). After signing the peace treaty guaranteed some rights to Roman Catholics, some Acadians returned to Canada. However, they were no longer welcome in the British colony of Nova Scotia. They were forced into New Brunswick, which became a bilingual province as a result of that relocation.

Britain now owned much land that France had owned, and the French people of Quebec felt greatly betrayed by the French concession. The commander-in-chief of the British, Jeffrey Amherst noted, &quot;Many of the Canadians consider their Colony to be of utmost consequence to France &amp; cannot be convinced ... that their Country has been conceded to Great Britain.&quot;

<text>The Treaty of Paris, signed in Paris by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and representatives of the United States on September 3, 1783, officially ended the American Revolutionary War and recognized the Thirteen Colonies, which had been part of colonial British America, to be free, sovereign and independent states.

The treaty set the boundaries between British North America, later called Canada, and the United States, on lines the British labeled as &quot;exceedingly generous&quot;, although exact boundary definitions in the far-northwest and to the south continued to be subject to some controversy. Details included fishing rights and restoration of property and prisoners of war.

This treaty and the separate peace treaties between Great Britain and the nations that supported the American cause, including France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic are known collectively as the Peace of Paris. Only Article 1 of the treaty, which acknowledges the United States&#x27; existence as free, sovereign, and independent states, remains in force.

==Agreement==


Peace negotiations began in Paris in April 1782, following the victory of George Washington and the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. The negotiations continued through the summer of 1782. Representing the United States were Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens, and John Adams. Representing the Kingdom of Great Britain and King George III were David Hartley and Richard Oswald.

The treaty was drafted on November 30, 1782, and signed at the Hôtel d&#x27;York at present-day 56 Rue Jacob in Paris on September 3, 1783, by Adams, Franklin, Jay, and Hartley.

In September 1782, French Foreign Minister Vergennes proposed a solution to deadlocked negotiations between the United States and the British, which was rejected by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and all parties sought peace, except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the Revolutionary War until it could capture Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes developed treaty terms under which Spain would forego holding Gibraltar and the United States would be granted independence, but it would be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would keep the area north of the Ohio River, which was part of the Province of Quebec. In the area south of that would be an independent Indian barrier state, under Spanish control.

The American delegation perceived that they could obtain a better treaty in negotiating directly with the British in London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them and to bypass France and Spain, and British Prime Minister Lord Shelburne agreed. In charge of the British negotiations, some of which took place in his study at Lansdowne House, now a bar in the Lansdowne Club, Shelburne now saw a chance to split the United States from France and to establish the new nation as a valuable economic partner. The terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of present-day Florida, and south of present-day Canada. The northern boundary would be almost the same as it is today.

The United States would gain fishing rights off Nova Scotia&#x27;s coasts and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. The treaty was highly favorable for the United States and deliberately so from the British point of view. Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly-growing United States, which came to pass.

Great Britain also signed separate agreements with France and Spain, and provisionally with the Netherlands. In the treaty with Spain, the territories of East and West Florida were ceded to Spain without a clear northern boundary, which resulted in a territorial dispute resolved by the Treaty of Madrid in 1795. Spain also received the island of Menorca, but the Bahamas, Grenada, and Montserrat, which had been captured by the French and Spaniards, were returned to Britain. The treaty with France was mostly about exchanges of captured territory. France&#x27;s only net gains were the island of Tobago, and Senegal in Africa, but it also reinforced earlier treaties, guaranteeing fishing rights off Newfoundland. Dutch possessions in the East Indies, captured in 1781, were returned by Britain to the Netherlands in exchange for trading privileges in the Dutch East Indies by a treaty, which was not finalized until 1784.

The Congress of the Confederation, operating as the legislative body of the newly established United States, ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784, in Annapolis, Maryland, in the Old Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House. Copies were sent back to Europe for ratification by the other parties involved, the first reaching France in March 1784. British ratification occurred on April 9, 1784, and the ratified versions were exchanged in Paris on May 12, 1784.

==Terms==

The treaty and the separate peace treaties between Great Britain and the three colonial powers that supported the American cause, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic, are known collectively as the Peace of Paris. Only Article 1 of the treaty, which acknowledges the United States&#x27; existence as free sovereign and independent states, remains in force. The U.S. borders changed in later years, which is a major reason specific articles of the treaty were superseded.

&quot;Preamble&quot;. Declares the treaty to be &quot;in the Name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity&quot; followed by a reference to the divine providence, states the &quot;bona fides&quot; of the signatories, and declares the intention of both parties to &quot;forget all past misunderstandings and differences&quot; and &quot;secure to both perpetual peace and harmony.&quot;
#Britain acknowledges the United States, comprising what had been the Province of New Hampshire, Province of Massachusetts Bay, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut Colony, Province of New York, Province of New Jersey, Province of Pennsylvania, Delaware Colony, Province of Maryland, Colony of Virginia, Province of North Carolina, Province of South Carolina, and Province of Georgia, to be free, sovereign, and independent states, and that the British Crown and all heirs and successors relinquish claims to the Government, property, and territorial rights of the same, and every part thereof,
#Establishing the boundaries of the United States, including but not limited to those between the United States and British North America from the Mississippi River to the Southern colonies. Britain surrenders their previously owned land,
#Granting fishing rights to United States fishermen in the Grand Banks, off the coast of Newfoundland and in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence;
#The US and the British agreed to pay all debts including from Spain and the Netherlands. 
#The Congress of the Confederation will &quot;earnestly recommend&quot; to state legislatures to recognize the rightful owners of all confiscated lands and &quot;provide for the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to British subjects&quot; (Loyalists);
#The United States will prevent future confiscations of the property of Loyalists;
#Prisoners-of-war on both sides are to be released. All British property now in the United States is to remain with them and to be forfeited;
#Both Great Britain and the United States are to be given perpetual access to the Mississippi River;
#Territories captured by either side subsequent to the treaty will be returned without compensation;
#Ratification of the treaty is to occur within six months from its signing.
&quot;Eschatocol.&quot; &quot;Done at Paris, this third day of September in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three.&quot;

==Consequences==
Historians have often commented that the treaty was very generous to the United States in terms of greatly enlarged boundaries. Historians such as Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States. The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and to create lucrative markets for British merchants without any military or administrative costs to Britain. The point was that the United States would become a major trading partner. As French Foreign Minister Vergennes later put it, &quot;The English buy peace rather than make it.&quot; Vermont was included within the boundaries because the state of New York insisted that Vermont was a part of New York although Vermont was then under a government that considered Vermont not to be a part of the United States.

Privileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status, including protection from pirates in the Mediterranean Sea were lost. Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property and Article 6, which provided for confiscating Loyalist property for &quot;unpaid debts&quot;. The Commonwealth of Virginia defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors. Several Loyalists attempted to file for a return for their property in the US legal system after the American Revolutionary War, but most were unsuccessful.

The actual geography of North America turned out not to match the details used in the treaty. The treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida. The Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which it had first given its territory in Florida to Great Britain. While the West Florida Controversy continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8. To the north, the treaty stated that the boundary of the United States extended from the &quot;most northwesternmost point&quot; of the Lake of the Woods in present-day Minnesota, Manitoba, and Ontario, directly westward until it reached the Mississippi River. However, the Mississippi does not extend that far northward, and the line going west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the river. Additionally, the Treaty of Paris did not explain how the new border would function in terms of controlling the movement of people and trade between British North America and the United States. The American diplomats&#x27; expectation of negotiating a commercial treaty with Great Britain to resolve some of the unfinished business of the Treaty of Paris failed to materialize in 1784. Despite government agreements for British evacuation of northern forts, Britain continued to occupy the forts. Meanwhile, the British were dissatisfied with the American harassment of Loyalists. The United States would thus wait until 1794 to negotiate its first commercial agreement with the British Empire, the Jay Treaty.

Great Britain violated the treaty stipulation that it would relinquish control of forts in United States territory &quot;with all convenient speed&quot;. British troops remained stationed at six forts in the Great Lakes region and at two at the north end of Lake Champlain. The British also built an additional fort in present-day Ohio in 1794, during the Northwest Indian War. They justified their treaty violations during the unstable and extremely tense time that existed in the area following the Revolutionary War, and in the failure of the newly established federal government of the United States to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for British losses, forcing the British to liquidate various assets in the region. All of the posts were relinquished peacefully through diplomatic means as a result of the Jay Treaty:

<text>The Treaty of Paris, signed on 30 May 1814, ended the war between France and the Sixth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars, following an armistice signed on 23 April between Charles, Count of Artois, and the allies. The treaty set the borders for France under the House of Bourbon and restored territories to other nations. It is sometimes called the First Peace of Paris, as another one followed in 1815.

==Background==
==Parties to the treaty==
This treaty was signed on 30 May 1814, following an armistice signed on 23 April 1814 between Charles of Bourbon, Count of Artois, as Lieutenant General of the Realm, and the allies. Napoleon had abdicated as Emperor on 6 April, as a result of negotiations at Fontainebleau.

Peace talks had started on 9 May between Talleyrand, who negotiated with the allies of Chaumont on behalf of the exiled Bourbon king Louis XVIII of France, and the allies. The Treaty of Paris established peace between France and Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, who in March had defined their common war aim in Chaumont. Signatories were:
* Talleyrand, for France
* Lords Castlereagh, Aberdeen and Cathcart for Great Britain
* Counts Razumovsky and Nesselrode for Russia
* Prince Metternich and Count Stadion for Austria
* Baron Hardenberg and Wilhelm von Humboldt for Prussia.

The Treaty was also signed by Portugal and Sweden while Spain ratified shortly after in July. The allied parties did not sign a common document, but instead concluded separate treaties with France allowing for specific amendments.

==New borders of France==
The allies had agreed to reduce France to her 1792 borders and restore the independence of her neighbors after Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s defeat.

==Plan for Congress of Vienna==
In addition to the cessation of hostilities, the treaty provided a rough draft of a final settlement, which according to article 32 was to be concluded within the next two months at a congress involving all belligerents of the Napoleonic Wars. This provision resulted in the Congress of Vienna, held between September 1814 and June 1815.

The Allies declared that their aim was to establish a lasting peace based on a just distribution of forces among the powers, and considered it not necessary to impose harsh conditions on France as she had been restored to a monarchy.
Thus the preliminary conditions already agreed in Paris were moderate for France so as not to disturb the re-enthronement of the returned Bourbon king: France&#x27;s borders of 1 June 1792 were confirmed, and in addition, she was allowed to retain Saarbrücken, Saarlouis, Landau, the County of Montbéliard, part of Savoy with Annecy and Chambéry, also Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin as well as artifacts acquired during the war, while on the other hand she had to cede several colonies.

To distinguish this agreement from a second treaty of Paris, concluded on 20 November 1815 as one of the treaties amending Vienna, the treaty of 30 May 1814 is sometimes referred to as the First Peace of Paris.

==Territories of other nations==
The treaty reapportioned several territories amongst various countries. Most notably, France retained all European territory that it possessed on 1 January 1792 and also reacquired many of the territories lost to Britain during the war. They included Guadeloupe (), which had been ceded to Sweden by Britain when it entered the coalition. In return, Sweden was compensated 24 million francs, which gave rise to the Guadeloupe Fund. The only exceptions were Tobago, Saint Lucia, Seychelles and Mauritius, all of which were handed over to British control. Britain kept sovereignty over the island of Malta ().

The treaty returned to Spain the territory of Santo Domingo, which had been transferred to France by the 1795 Peace of Basel (). The Peace of Basel had implicitly recognised French sovereignty over Saint-Domingue, which Dessalines later proclaimed independent under the name of Haiti. France did not recognize the independence of Haiti until 1824.

This treaty formally recognized the independence of Switzerland ().

==House of Bourbon==
The treaty recognised the Bourbon monarchy in France, in the person of Louis XVIII, because the treaty was between Louis XVIII the king of France and the heads of states of the Coalition great powers ().

==Slave trade and slavery==
The treaty aimed to abolish the French slave trade in France (but not slavery) over a five-year period (). The territories of France were not included in this aim. This aim was also included in the succeeding 1815 treaty, applying to all parties, but with &quot;without loss of time&quot; rather than by a given date.

==Aftermath==
Several powers, despite the peaceful intentions of the treaty, still feared a reassertion of French power. The Netherlands, now freed from the French empire, asked William I of the House of Orange to be their prince; he accepted in late 1813. This was a first step to what occurred in 1815 during the Congress of Vienna and simultaneously, Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days. In March 1815, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed, which added the former territory of the low countries that had been ruled by the Austrian Empire to the Netherlands, and had William I as its king. His son William joined the fighting at Waterloo, whose battle site was located in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Though the Dutch initiated their request to William I, the great powers of the Napoleonic wars had made a secret pact to support a strong nation on that border with France with William as its king, in the Eight Articles of London, signed on 21 June 1814. Thus the action by the Dutch had the strong support of Britain and the other signatories of that pact.

Many German states had been consolidated by Napoleon, and retained that status after the Treaty of Paris of 1814. Prussia gained territory in western Germany, near the border with France, in a swap with William I of the Netherlands. In Italy, several different political entities were recognized.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s brief return to power and defeat, a new Treaty of Paris was signed the following year.

<text>The Treaty of Paris of 1815, also known as the Second Treaty of Paris, was signed on 20 November 1815, after the defeat and the second abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte. In February, Napoleon had escaped from his exile on Elba, entered Paris on 20 March and began the Hundred Days of his restored rule. After France&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the Seventh Coalition at the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon was persuaded to abdicate again, on 22 June. King Louis XVIII, who had fled the country when Napoleon arrived in Paris, took the throne for a second time on 8 July.

The 1815 treaty had more punitive terms than the treaty of the previous year. France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities, and its borders were reduced to those that had existed on 1 January 1790. France was to pay additional money to cover the cost of providing additional defensive fortifications to be built by neighbouring Coalition countries. Under the terms of the treaty, parts of France were to be occupied by up to 150,000 soldiers for five years, with France covering the cost. However, the Coalition occupation under the command of the Duke of Wellington was deemed necessary for only three years; the foreign troops withdrew from France in 1818 (Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle).

In addition to the definitive peace treaty between France and Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, there were four additional conventions and an act confirming the neutrality of Switzerland, signed on the same day.

==Definitive treaty==

The 1815 peace treaties were drawn up entirely in French, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of contemporary diplomacy. There were four treaties, between France and each of the four major Seventh Coalition powers: Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia. All four treaties were signed on the same day (20 November 1815), had verbatim stipulations, and were styled the same way (for example the &quot;Definitive Treaty between Great Britain and France&quot;).

The treaty was harsher towards France than the Treaty of 1814, which had been negotiated through the manoeuvre of Talleyrand, because of reservations raised by the recent widespread support for Napoleon in France. France lost the territorial gains of the Revolutionary armies in 1790–92, which the previous treaty had allowed France to keep; the nation was reduced to its 1790 boundaries, plus the enclaves of the Comtat Venaissin, the County of Montbéliard and the Republic of Mulhouse, which France was allowed to keep, but minus a few patches of territory along the northern border, including Landau and the Saarlouis exclave, which had been French since 1697, as well as six communes in the Pays de Gex (Pregny, Collex-Bossy, Grand-Saconnex, Vernier, Meyrin and Versoix) which were ceded to the Republic of Geneva so that it be connected to the rest of Switzerland. France was now also ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities, in five yearly instalments, and to maintain at its own expense a Coalition army of occupation of 150,000 soldiers in the eastern border territories of France, from the English Channel to the border with Switzerland, for a maximum of five years. The twofold purpose of the military occupation was rendered self-evident by the convention annexed to the treaty outlining the incremental terms by which France would issue negotiable bonds covering the indemnity: in addition to safeguarding the neighboring states from a revival of revolution in France, it guaranteed fulfilment of the treaty&#x27;s financial clauses.

Although some of the Allies, notably Prussia, initially demanded that France cede significant territory in the East, rivalry among the powers and the general desire to secure the Bourbon Restoration made the peace settlement less onerous than it might have been. The treaty was signed for Great Britain by Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh and the Duke of Wellington and by Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu for France; parallel treaties with France were signed by Austria, Russia, and Prussia, forming in effect the first confederation of Europe. The Quadruple Alliance was reinstated in a separate treaty also signed 20 November 1815, introducing a new concept in European diplomacy, the peacetime congress &quot;for the maintenance of peace in Europe&quot; on the pattern of the Congress of Vienna, which had concluded 9 June 1815.

The treaty is brief. In addition to having &quot;preserved France and Europe from the convulsions with which they were menaced by the late enterprise of Napoleon Bonaparte&quot;, the signers of the Treaty also repudiated &quot;the revolutionary system reproduced in France&quot;.

The treaty is presented &quot;in the desire to consolidate, by maintaining inviolate the Royal authority, and by restoring the operation of the Constitutional Charter, the order of things which had been happily re-established in France&quot;. The first Treaty of Paris, of 30 May 1814, and the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, of 9 June 1815, were confirmed. On the same day, in a separate document, Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia renewed the Quadruple Alliance. The princes and free towns, who were not signatories, were invited to accede to its terms, whereby the treaty became a part of the public law by which Europe, with the exclusion of the Ottoman Empire, established &quot;relations from which a system of real and permanent balance of power in Europe is to be derived&quot;.

===Article on the slave trade===
An additional article appended to the treaty addressed the issue of slavery. It reaffirmed the &quot;Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8th of February 1815&quot; (which also formed of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna) and added that the governments of the contracting parties should &quot;without loss of time, ... [find] the most effectual measures for the entire and definitive abolition of a Commerce so odious, and so strongly condemned by the laws of religion and of nature&quot;.

==Convention on pecuniary indemnity==
A convention on pecuniary indemnity regulated the mode of liquidating the indemnity of 700 millions francs to be paid by France, in conformity to the fourth article of the treaty. The sum was to be paid, day by day, in equal portions, in the space of five years, from 1 December 1815.

Thus, France was required to pay on account of this convention 383,251 francs every day for five years, equal to about 16,000 pounds sterling at the exchange rate of the day. For this daily quota, the French government had to give assignations on the French treasury, payable to bearer, day by day. In the first instance, however, the Coalition Commissioners were to receive the whole of the 700 million in fifteen bonds of 46⅔ million each; the first of which was payable on 31 March 1816, the second on 21 July 1816, and so on, every fourth month. In the month preceding the commencement of each of these four monthly periods, France was to redeem successively one of these bonds for 46⅔ millions, by exchanging it against the first-mentioned daily assignations payable to bearer, which assignations, for the purpose of convenience and negotiability, were again subdivided into &quot;coupures&quot;, or sets of smaller sums. As a guarantee for the regular payment of these assignations, and to provide for deficiencies, France assigned, moreover, to the allies, a fund of interest, to be inscribed in the &quot;Grand Livre&quot; of her public debt, of seven millions francs on a capital of 140 millions. A liquidation was to take place every six months, when the assignations duly discharged by the French Treasury were to be received as payments to their amount, and the deficiency arising from assignations not honoured would be made good, with interest, at five percent from the fund of interest inscribed in the &quot;Grand Livre&quot;, in a manner specified in this convention.

The distribution of the sum among the Coalition Powers, agreed to be paid by France in this convention, was regulated by a separate convention, the &quot;Protocol for the pecuniary indemnity to be furnished by France&quot; and the &quot;Table of allotment&quot;:

==Convention on the military line==
A convention on the military line regulated all matters concerning the temporary occupation of the frontiers of France by a Coalition army of 150,000 men, conforming to . The military line to be occupied, would extend along the frontiers which separated the departments of the Pas de Calais, of the North of the Ardennes, of the Meuse, of the Moselle, of the Lower Rhine, and of the Upper Rhine, from the interior of France.

It was also agreed that neither the Coalition nor the French troops would occupy (unless for particular reasons and by mutual agreement), the following territories and districts:
* In the department of the Somme, all the country north of that river, from Ham, to where it falls into the sea;
* In Aisne, the districts of Saint-Quentin, Vervins and Laon;
* In the Marne, those of Rheims, Sainte-Menehould, and Vitry;
* In the Haute-Marne, those of Saint-Dizier and Joinville;
* In Meurthe, those of Toul, Dieuze, Sarrebourg and Blamont;
* In the Vosges, those of Saint-Dié, Bruyères and Remiremont;
* The district of Lure, in the Haute-Saône; and that of Saint-Hippolyte in Doubs.
Within the line occupied by the Coalition army, 26 fortresses were allowed to have garrisons (see the table on the right), but without any materiel or equipment of artillery and engineer stores.

France was to supply all the needs of the 150,000 Coalition troops who remained in the country. Lodging, fuel, light, provisions, and forage were to be furnished in kind, to an extent not exceeding 200,000 daily rations for men, and 50,000 daily rations for horses; and for pay, equipment, clothing, &amp;c.

France was to pay to the Coalition 50 million francs per annum during the five-year occupation: the allies, however, were content with only 30 million, on account, for the first year. The territories and fortresses definitively ceded by France, as well as the fortresses to be provisionally occupied by the Coalition troops for five years, were to be given up to them within ten days from the signature of the principal treaty, and all the Coalition forces, except 150,000 which were to remain, were to evacuate France within 21 days from that date.

The direct expense entailed upon France by this convention greatly exceeded the 700 million francs of the indemnity. Estimating the value of the soldier&#x27;s portion and allowances at 1½ francs, and the cavalry ration at 2 francs, the annual cost of the deliveries in kind for 200,000 portions and 50,000 rations would have been 146 million in francs, which, with the addition of 50 million franc of money per annum, formed a total of 196 million francs per year, equal to 22,370 sterling per day at the exchange rate of the time.

==Convention on private claims upon France==
A convention on private claims upon France assured the payment of money due by France to the subjects of the Coalition powers, in conformity with the treaty of 1814 and to the of the 1815 peace treaty. There were twenty-six articles in the convention, which provided for the following:
* the liquidation of all claims arising from articles furnished by individuals, and partnerships, by virtue of contracts and other arrangements with French administrative authorities;
* arrears of pay to military persons or employees no longer subjects of France;
* deliveries to French hospitals;
* loans contracted by French military or civil authorities;
* losses of money confided to the French post-office etcetera;
* the restitution of the funds of the Hamburg bank, seized by Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout, to be regulated by a separate convention between commissioners from that city and those of Louis XVIII. This issue was already contentious and had been subject to secret articles in both of the 1814 Convention for a suspension of hostilities with France and the 1814 Paris Peace Treaty. The matter was settled when the French government agreed to pay compensation in a special convention signed by the parties on 27 October 1816.
* the payment of a claim of upwards of forty million francs to the Counts of Bentheim and Steinfurt.
All these claims were to be sent in within a year after the ratification of the treaty or they would be voided (Article XVI), and committees for their liquidation were to be appointed.

Articles XVII–XIX related to the payment of the claims and their inscription in the &quot;Grand Livre&quot; (general ledger). The claims under this convention were immense, so it was impossible for the parties to have a clear idea of the necessary amount at the time of the treaty&#x27;s signing. As a guarantee of payment, Article XX provided that a capital, bearing 3½ millions of francs in interest, be inscribed in the &quot;Grand Livre&quot;, the interest of which was to be received half yearly by joint-commissioners.

==Convention on claims of British subjects==
A fourth convention related exclusively to the liquidation of the claims of British subjects on the government of France, in conformity with the Paris peace treaty of 1814, and the Article VIII of the Paris Peace Treaty of 1815. All British subjects who had suffered loss of property in France since 1 January 1791, by sequestration or confiscation by the French government, were to be indemnified. The amount of permanent stock lost was to be inscribed in the &quot;Grand Livre&quot;, and to bear interest from 22 March 1816; excepting, however, such holders as had, since 1797, voluntarily submitted to receive their dividends at a third. The same was to be the case in regard to former life annuities from the French government.

Indemnification was further granted for the loss of immovable property by sequestration, confiscation, or sale; and particular regulations were laid down for ascertaining its value in the fairest possible manner. A separate account was to be kept of arrears that had accrued for all types of property, for which arrears were to be calculated at an interest of four percent per annum. Movable properly, lost through the above causes, was also to be paid for by inscriptions according to its value, with interest calculated on it at three percent per annum. From this indemnity, however, were excluded ships, cargoes, and other movable property seized in conformity to the laws of war and the prohibitory decrees. All claims of the above, or any other description, were to be given in, within three months after the date of the signing fourth convention (20 November 1815) from Europe, six months from the western colonies, and twelve months from the East Indies, &amp;c.

The claims were to be examined and decided on by a mixed commission of liquidation: and, if their votes were equal, an arbitrator would be chosen by lot from a mixed commission of arbitration. As a guarantee for the payment of claims sanctioned under this convention, there was to be inscribed in the &quot;Grand Livre&quot;, before 1 January 1816, a capital bearing 3½ millions francs of interest, in the name of a further mixed commission of English and French officers, who were to receive such interest; without, however, disposing of the same otherwise than by placing it in the public funds, at accumulating interest for the benefit of the creditors. As soon as the inscription had been effected, Britain would restore the French colonies as agreed in the treaty of 1814, including the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, which had been provisionally re-occupied by the British troops.

==Act on the neutrality of Switzerland==
The Swiss Confederation had been internationally recognised as an independent neutral state at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. During the Napoleonic Wars it failed to remain neutral, as some cantons had been annexed into other states and, under French influence, the Act of Mediation was signed, replacing the Swiss Confederation with the more centralised Helvetic Republic, allied to France. With the fall of Napoleon in 1814, the cantons of Switzerland started the process of writing a new, less centralised constitution.

On 20 March 1815, at the Congress of Vienna, the European powers (Austria, France, Great Britain, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Spain and Sweden) agreed to recognise permanently an independent, neutral Switzerland, and on 27 May Switzerland acceded to this declaration.

However, during Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days the Seventh Coalition suspended the signing of the Act of Acknowledgement and Guarantee of the perpetual Neutrality of Switzerland until after Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated; this allowed Coalition forces to pass through Swiss territory. So with Article 84 of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna dated 20 November 1815, the four major Coalition powers (Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia) and France gave their formal and authentic acknowledgement of the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland.

==Return of looted art==

Much art had been looted from across Europe by the French armies since 1793. The First Treaty of Paris had made no demands in this respect, but the second treaty required that stolen artworks be returned to their countries of origin. The process was haphazard, as some states had ceased to exist, but the treaty was one of the first in history to require the return of war booty on a large scale.

<text>The Treaty of Peace between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain, commonly known as the Treaty of Paris of 1898, was signed by Spain and the United States on December 10, 1898, and marked the end of the Spanish–American War. Under it, Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over and title to territories described there as &quot;the island of Porto Rico and other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and the island of Guam in the Marianas or Ladrones, the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands, and comprehending the islands lying within the following line:&quot; (details elided), to the United States. The cession of the Philippines involved a compensation of $20 million from the United States to Spain.

The treaty came into effect on April 11, 1899, when the documents of ratification were exchanged. It was the first treaty negotiated between the two governments since the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty.

The Treaty of Paris marked the end of the Spanish Empire, apart from some small holdings. It had a major cultural impact in Spain known as the &quot;Generation of &#x27;98&quot;. It marked the beginning of the United States as a world power. In the U.S., many supporters of the war opposed the treaty, which became one of the major issues in the election of 1900 when it was opposed by Democrat William Jennings Bryan, who opposed imperialism. Republican President William McKinley supported the treaty and was reelected.

==Background==
The Spanish–American War began on April 25, 1898, due to a series of escalating disputes between the two nations, and ended on December 10, 1898, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. It resulted in Spain&#x27;s loss of its control over the remains of its overseas empire. After much of mainland in the Americas had achieved independence, Cubans tried their hand at revolution in 1868–1878, and again in the 1890s, led by José Martí. The Philippines at this time also became resistant to Spanish colonial rule. August 26, 1896, presented the first call to revolt, led by Andrés Bonifacio, succeeded by Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy. Aguinaldo then negotiated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato with the Spaniards and went into exile to Hong Kong along with the other revolutionary leaders.

The Spanish–American War that followed had overwhelming public support in the United States due to the popular fervor towards supporting Cuban freedom. 

On September 16, President William McKinley issued secret written instructions to his emissaries as the Spanish–American War drew to a close:

==Negotiations==
Article V of the peace protocol between United States and Spain on August 12, 1898, read as follows:

The composition of the American commission was somewhat unusual in that three of its members were senators, which meant, as many newspapers pointed out, that they would later vote on the ratification of their own negotiations. These were American delegation&#x27;s members:
* William R. Day, chairman, a former U.S. Secretary of State who had resigned from the position to lead the commission
* William P. Frye, a senator from Maine
* Cushman Kellogg Davis, a senator from Minnesota
* George Gray, a senator from Delaware
* Whitelaw Reid, a former diplomat and a former nominee for Vice President

The Spanish commission included the following Spanish diplomats:
* Eugenio Montero Ríos,
* Buenaventura de Abarzuza,
* José de Garnica,
* Wenceslao Ramírez de Villa-Urrutia,
* Rafael Cerero, and
* Jules Cambon (French diplomat).

The American delegation, headed by former Secretary of State William R. Day, who had vacated his position as U.S. Secretary of State to head the commission, arrived in Paris on September 26, 1898. The negotiations were conducted in a suite of rooms at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the first session, on October 1, the Spanish demanded that before the talks got underway, the return of the city of Manila, which had been captured by the Americans a few hours after the signing of the peace protocol in Washington, to Spanish authority. The Americans refused to consider the idea and, for the moment, it was pursued no further.

Felipe Agoncillo, a Filipino lawyer who represented the First Philippine Republic, was denied participation in the negotiation.

For almost a month, negotiations revolved around Cuba. The Teller Amendment to the declaration of war made it impractical for the United States to annex the island as it had with Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. At first, Spain refused to accept the Cuban national debt of $400 million, but ultimately, it had no choice. Eventually, it was agreed that Cuba was to be granted independence and for the Cuban debt to be assumed by Spain. It was also agreed that Spain would cede Guam and Puerto Rico to the United States.

The negotiators then turned to the question of the Philippines. Spanish negotiators were determined to hang onto all they could and hoped to cede only Mindanao and perhaps the Sulu Islands. On the American side, Chairman Day had once recommended the acquisition of only the naval base in Manila, as a &quot;hitching post.&quot; Others had recommended retaining only the island of Luzon. However, in discussions with its advisers, the commission concluded that Spain, if it retained part of the Philippines, would be likely to sell it to another European power, which would likely be troublesome for America. On November 25, the American Commission cabled McKinley for explicit instructions. Their cable crossed one from McKinley saying that duty left him no choice but to demand the entire archipelago. The next morning, another cable from McKinley arrived:

This position was proposed by U.S. negotiators, though they considered it unsound, and was formally rejected on November 4. Spain was in distressed financial condition, and was responsible for considerable Cuban debt, having been sovereign when the debts were incurred. Estimating U.S. costs in the war at $300 million and regarding Porto Rico as worth only a fraction of that, the negotiators favored acquisition of the Philippines as indemnity for the balance. Seeking a solution to avoid collapse of the negotiations, Senator Frye suggested offering Spain $10 or $20 million, describing the purpose as the assumption of existing debts incurred for improvements of a pacific nature. The State Department approved, though it considered this odious. After some discussion, the American delegation offered $20 million on November 21, one tenth of a valuation that had been estimated in internal discussions in October, and requested an answer within two days. Montero Ríos said angrily that he could reply at once, but the American delegation had already departed from the conference table. When the two sides met again, Queen-Regent Maria Christina had cabled her acceptance. Montero Ríos then recited his formal reply:

Work on the final draft of the treaty began on November 30. It was signed on December 10, 1898.

In Madrid, the Cortes Generales, Spain&#x27;s legislature, rejected the treaty, but Maria Christina signed it as she was empowered to do by a clause in the Spanish constitution.

===U.S. ratification===
In the Senate, there were four main schools of thought on U.S. imperialism that influenced the debate on the treaty&#x27;s ratification. Republicans generally supported the treaty, but those opposed either aimed to defeat the treaty or exclude the provision that stipulated the acquisition of the Philippines. Most Democrats, particularly in the South, also favored expansion. A minority of Democrats also favored the treaty on the basis of ending the war and granting independence to Cuba and the Philippines. During the Senate debate on ratification, Senators George Frisbie Hoar and George Graham Vest were outspoken opponents. Hoar stated:

Some anti-expansionists stated that the treaty committed the United States to a course of empire and violated the most basic tenets of the constitution. They argued that neither the Congress nor the President had the right to pass laws that governed colonial peoples who were not represented by lawmakers.

Some Senate expansionists supported the treaty and reinforced such views by arguing:

Expansionists said that the Constitution applied only to citizens, an idea that was later supported by the Supreme Court in the Insular Cases.

As the Senate debate continued, Andrew Carnegie and former President Grover Cleveland petitioned the Senate to reject the treaty. Both men adamantly opposed such imperialist policies and participated in the American Anti-Imperialist League, along with other such prominent members as Mark Twain and Samuel Gompers.

Fighting erupted between Filipino and American forces in Manila on February 4, and quickly escalated into a battle between armies. This changed the course of debate in the Senate in favor of ratification. The treaty was eventually approved on February 6, 1899, by a vote of 57 to 27, just over the two-thirds majority required. Only two Republicans voted against ratification: George Frisbie Hoar of Massachusetts and Eugene Pryor Hale of Maine. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich had opposed entry into the Spanish–American War but supported McKinley after it began. He played a central role in winning the treaty&#x27;s two-thirds majority ratification.

==Provisions==
The Treaty of Paris provided for the independence of Cuba from Spain, but the U.S. Congress ensured indirect U.S. control by the Platt Amendment and the Teller Amendment. Spain relinquished all claims of sovereignty over and title to Cuba. Upon Spain&#x27;s departure, Cuba was to be occupied by the United States, which would assume and discharge any obligations of international law by its occupation.

The treaty also specified that Spain would cede Puerto Rico and the other islands under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies as well as the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands to the United States.

The treaty also specified that Spain would cede the Philippine Islands, including the islands within a specified line, to the United States in exchange for $20 million.

Specifics of the cession of the Philippines were later clarified on November 7, 1900, when Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Washington. This clarified that the territories relinquished by Spain to the United States included any and all islands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago, but lying outside the lines described in the Treaty of Paris. That treaty explicitly named the islands of Cagayan Sulu and Sibutu and their dependencies as among the relinquished territories. The boundary between the Philippines and North Borneo was further clarified by the Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (1930).

==Aftermath==
===In the United States===
Victory in the Spanish–American War turned the United States into a world power because the attainment of the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines expanded its economic dominance in the Pacific. Its growth continued to have effects on U.S. foreign and economic policy well into the next century. Furthermore, McKinley&#x27;s significant role in advancing the ratification of the treaty transformed the presidential office from a weaker position to a prototype of the stronger presidency that is more seen today.

===In Spain===
The &quot;Generation of &#x27;98&quot; in Spain comprised those Spanish writers deeply impacted by the events and committed to cultural and aesthetic renewal. They were associated with modernism. The term refers to the moral, political and social crisis in Spain produced by the humiliating loss of the worldwide empire. The intellectuals are known for their criticism of the Spanish literary and educational establishments, which they saw as steeped in conformism, ignorance, and a lack of any true spirit. Their criticism was coupled with and heavily connected to the group&#x27;s dislike for the Restoration Movement that was occurring in Spanish government. 

A few years after the war, during the reign of Alfonso XIII, Spain improved its commercial position and maintained close relations with the United States, which led to the signing of commercial treaties between the two countries in 1902, 1906 and 1910. Spain would turn its attention to its possessions in Africa (especially northern Morocco, Spanish Sahara and Spanish Guinea) and would begin to rehabilitate itself internationally after the Algeciras Conference of 1906.

===In the Philippines===
Philippine revolutionaries had declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898, and resisted the imposition of American sovereignty. The 1899 Battle of Manila between American and Filipino forces on February 4-5, 1899 ignited the Philippine-American War, which concluded with an American victory in 1902.

====In Mindanao====
The United States fought long brutal wars against the Moro sultanates in Mindanao from 1899 to 1913. It annexed the Sultanate of Maguindanao and the Confederation of sultanates in Lanao in 1905 after the Battle of the Malalag River and then annexed the Sultanate of Sulu in 1913 after the Battle of Bud Bagsak.

<text>The 1920 Treaty of Paris was an act signed by Romania and the principal Allied Powers of the time (France, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan) whose purpose was the recognition of Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia. The treaty, however, never came into force because Japan failed to ratify it.

On 9 April 1918 (old style 27 March 1918), during the chaos of the Russian Civil War and following Romanian military intervention, the Bessarabian legislature (&quot;Sfatul Țării&quot;) voted in favor of the union of Bessarabia with Romania with 86 votes in favor, three against, and 36 abstentions, an act regarded by the Russians as a Romanian invasion.

As with the Treaty of Versailles, the 1920 treaty contained the Covenant of the League of Nations, and, as a result, it was not ratified by the United States. The United States refused initially to sign the Treaty on the grounds that Russia was not represented at the treaty conference.

The Paris Peace Treaty of 28 October 1920, formally recognized the union of Bessarabia with Romania. The union was recognized by the United Kingdom, France and Italy, but Japan did not ratify it, and the Soviet Union never recognized this Union.

<text>The Electric Image Animation System (EIAS) is a 3D computer graphics package published by EIAS3D. It currently runs on the macOS and Windows platforms.

==History==
Electric Image, Inc. was initially a visual effects production company. They developed their own in-house 3D animation and rendering package for the Macintosh beginning in the late 1980s, calling it ElectricImage Animation System. (To avoid confusion with the current product with its similar name, we will refer to this initial incarnation of the product simply as &quot;ElectricImage&quot;.)

When the company later decided to offer their software for sale externally, it quickly gained a customer base that lauded the developers for the software&#x27;s exceptionally fast rendering engine and high image quality. Because it was capable of film-quality output on commodity hardware, ElectricImage was popular in the movie and television industries throughout the decade. It was used by the &quot;Rebel Unit&quot; at Industrial Light and Magic quite extensively and was in use by a variety of game companies, such as Bad Mojo and Bad Day on the Midway. However, only these high end effects companies could afford it: Electric Image initially sold for US $7500.

EIAS has been used in numerous film and television productions, such as: &quot;Cliffs of Freedom, Piranha 3D, Alien Trespass, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Daddy Day Care, K-19: The Widowmaker, Gangs of New York, Austin Powers: Goldmember, Men In Black II, The Bourne Identity, Behind Enemy Lines, Time Machine, Ticker, JAG - Pilot Episode, Spawn, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, Galaxy Quest, Mission to Mars, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, Titan A.E., U-571, Dinosaur, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator 2: Judgment Day - DVD Intro, Jungle Book 2, American President, Sleepers, Star Wars Special Edition, Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, Return of Jedi Special Edition, Bicentennial Man, Vertical Limit, Elf, Blade Trinity, and Lost In Space.&quot;

TV Shows: &quot;Evil, Invisible City, Shinning Girls, Lovecraft Country, Rising Dion, Legion, The Strain, The Librarians, Falling Skies, Revolution, Breaking Bad, Alcatraz, Pan AM, The whole Truth, Lost, Flash Forward, Fringe, Surface, Weeds, Pushing Daisies, The X-Files, Alias, Smallville, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5, Young Indiana Jones, Star Trek Voyager, Mists of Avalon and Star Trek Enterprise.

Electric Image, Inc. was always a small company that produced software on the Mac platform and so never had a large a market share. Play, Inc. purchased Electric Image corporation in November 1998. The first version of EIAS released under the Play moniker was version 2.9. Play later released the 3.0 version. This was the first version to run on Windows, and to mark this move, Play renamed the package Electric Image Universe. 

In 2000, Dwight Parscale (former CEO of Newtek) and original Electric Image founders Markus Houy and Jay Roth bought back the original company from Play Inc. On September 19, 2000, the company bought back the shares of Electric Image from Play and set about to recapture the product&#x27;s former customer base. The new company released version 4.0 and 5.0 under the Electric Image moniker. Then due to a licensing problem with Spatial Technologies, they dropped the Modeler program from the version 5.5 release, and renamed the package back to Electric Image Animation System.

Versions 6.0 and 6.5 were subsequently released with vast improvements to the rendering engine and OpenGL performance. Version 6.5r2 added FBX file importing capability. 6.6 added Universal Binary support and finally drops support for Mac OS 9. Version 7.0 brought Multi-Layer Rendering, Image-Based Lighting, Raytrace Sky Maps and Rigid Body Dynamics. The version, 8.0, added Photon Mapping, Fast soft shadows, area light, Quadratic light drop-off, EXR and 16bit image input support, Displacement Sea Level, new Weight maps tools, much workflow enhancement and Renderama improvements.

In 2009, EITG began negotiations to sell the intellectual property rights of ElectricImage. On January 12, 2010 it was announced that Tomas Egger, Igor Yatsenko, and Igor Ivaniuk had become the new owners of EIAS. Known collectively as &quot;The Igors&quot;, Igor Yatsenko and Igor Ivaniuk had been EIAS&#x27;s primary software developers for many years. They released version 9.0 in November 2012, followed by version 9.1 in June 2013.

==Market positioning==
The existing customer base for EIAS favors it for its fast renderer, its high output quality, and its camera mapping features. The tool set lends itself particularly well to hard-surface animation/rendering and other forms of non-organic tasks. It is most popular with architects and visual effects artists for TV and film.

EIAS&#x27;s primary competitors in the integrated 3D package space are Autodesk with Maya, 3D Studio Max and Softimage, Maxon with Cinema 4D, and Newtek with Lightwave 3D.

==Components==
The Electric Image Animation System is not a single program, but rather a suite of several programs designed to work together. Each of the primary programs handles a particular part of the production workflow:

===Animator===
Animator is the EIAS animation program. It can directly import 3D models in the Lightwave, 3D Studio, AutoCAD, Maya, and Electric Image FACT formats. In addition to animating models, Animator allows you to set up rendering settings. It efficiently supports the animation of very geometrically complex projects.

===Camera===
Camera is the EIAS rendering program, known for its speed and high image quality. As of version 9.0, it supports ray tracing, Phong shading, scanline rendering, spatial anti-aliasing, motion blur, caustics, radiosity, Photon mapping, Irradiance Cache, Screen Cache and global illumination. Camera outputs to several file formats, like Quicktime and EI&#x27;s own Image format. The latter is directly supported by Adobe After Effects CC and Adobe Photoshop CC.

===Renderama===
Renderama and Renderama Slave compose EIAS&#x27;s distributed network rendering system. It allows for the rendering of a project to be distributed over a network&#x27;s computers (i.e., for the formation of a render farm). It supports both single and multiprocessor computers, taking advantage of all available processors to distribute the workload. It also supports rendering across platforms (e.g., Windows 7/8 - 64 bits and Mac OS X 10.6.8 or earlier).

===Modeler===
Modeler saves its files in Electric Image&#x27;s &quot;FACT&quot; file format for importing into Animator (see above). It supports ACIS modeling, &quot;ÜberNurbs&quot; (EIAS&#x27; subdivision surfaces modeling technology), LAWS (based on parametric formulas) as well as Boolean operations and other modern modeling tools.

Modeler last shipped in Electric Image Universe 5.0. As a result, users of EIAS 5.5 and newer use a third-party modeler instead. Electric Image recommends Nevercenter Silo for this purpose. Form•Z from auto•des•sys is also popularly used as a companion for EIAS.

<text>Exponential growth occurs when a quantity grows as an exponential function of time. The quantity grows at a rate directly proportional to its present size. For example, when it is 3 times as big as it is now, it will be growing 3 times as fast as it is now.

In more technical language, its instantaneous rate of change (that is, the derivative) of a quantity with respect to an independent variable is proportional to the quantity itself. Often the independent variable is time. Described as a function, a quantity undergoing exponential growth is an exponential function of time, that is, the variable representing time is the exponent (in contrast to other types of growth, such as quadratic growth). Exponential growth is the inverse of logarithmic growth.

Not all cases of growth at an always increasing rate are instances of exponential growth. For example the function formula_1 grows at an ever increasing rate, but is much slower than growing exponentially. For example, when formula_2 it grows at 3 times its size, but when formula_3 it grows at 30% of its size. If an exponentially growing function grows at a rate that is 3 times is present size, then it always grows at a rate that is 3 times its present size. When it is 10 times as big as it is now, it will grow 10 times as fast.

If the constant of proportionality is negative, then the quantity decreases over time, and is said to be undergoing exponential decay instead. In the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals, it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay since the function values form a geometric progression.

The formula for exponential growth of a variable at the growth rate , as time goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is

formula_4

where is the value of at time 0. The growth of a bacterial colony is often used to illustrate it. One bacterium splits itself into two, each of which splits itself resulting in four, then eight, 16, 32, and so on. The amount of increase keeps increasing because it is proportional to the ever-increasing number of bacteria. Growth like this is observed in real-life activity or phenomena, such as the spread of virus infection, the growth of debt due to compound interest, and the spread of viral videos. In real cases, initial exponential growth often does not last forever, instead slowing down eventually due to upper limits caused by external factors and turning into logistic growth.

Terms like &quot;exponential growth&quot; are sometimes incorrectly interpreted as &quot;rapid growth&quot;. Indeed, something that grows exponentially can in fact be growing slowly at first.

==Examples==

===Biology===
* The number of microorganisms in a culture will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted, so there is no more of that nutrient for more organisms to grow. Typically the first organism splits into two daughter organisms, who then each split to form four, who split to form eight, and so on. Because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate, it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state. However, cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism and gene expression. 
* A virus (for example COVID-19, or smallpox) typically will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial immunization is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people.

===Physics===
* Avalanche breakdown within a dielectric material. A free electron becomes sufficiently accelerated by an externally applied electrical field that it frees up additional electrons as it collides with atoms or molecules of the dielectric media. These &quot;secondary&quot; electrons also are accelerated, creating larger numbers of free electrons. The resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete dielectric breakdown of the material.
* Nuclear chain reaction (the concept behind nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons). Each uranium nucleus that undergoes fission produces multiple neutrons, each of which can be absorbed by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a function of the shape and mass of the uranium), the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. &quot;Due to the exponential rate of increase, at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion, which only takes 3–4 generations.&quot;
* Positive feedback within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic amplification can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal, although resonance effects may favor some component frequencies of the signal over others.

===Economics===
* Economic growth is expressed in percentage terms, implying exponential growth.

===Finance===
* Compound interest at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital. See also rule of 72.
* Pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes also show this type of growth resulting in high profits for a few initial investors and losses among great numbers of investors.

===Computer science===
* Processing power of computers. See also Moore&#x27;s law and technological singularity. (Under exponential growth, there are no singularities. The singularity here is a metaphor, meant to convey an unimaginable future. The link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist Ray Kurzweil.)
* In computational complexity theory, computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) for only a constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity , if a problem of size requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms need to be able to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of Moore&#x27;s Law do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely increases the feasible problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size in time , then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size in the same time . So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.

=== Internet phenomena ===
* Internet contents, such as internet memes or videos, can spread in an exponential manner, often said to &quot;go viral&quot; as an analogy to the spread of viruses. With media such as social networks, one person can forward the same content to many people simultaneously, who then spread it to even more people, and so on, causing rapid spread. For example, the video Gangnam Style was uploaded to YouTube on 15 July 2012, reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers on the first day, millions on the twentieth day, and was cumulatively viewed by hundreds of millions in less than two months.

==Basic formula==
A quantity depends exponentially on time if
formula_5
where the constant is the initial value of , formula_6 the constant is a positive growth factor, and is the time constant—the time required for to increase by one factor of :
formula_7

If and , then has exponential growth. If and , or and , then has exponential decay.

Example: &quot;If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour?&quot; The question implies , and .

formula_8
formula_9

After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.

Many pairs of a dimensionless non-negative number and an amount of time (a physical quantity which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with proportional to . For any fixed not equal to 1 (e.g. &quot;e&quot; or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time . For any non-zero time the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number .

Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different base. The most common forms are the following:
formula_10
where expresses the initial quantity .

Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
* The &quot;growth constant&quot; is the frequency (number of times per unit time) of growing by a factor ; in finance it is also called the logarithmic return, continuously compounded return, or force of interest.
* The &quot;e-folding time&quot; &quot;τ&quot; is the time it takes to grow by a factor &quot;e&quot;.
* The &quot;doubling time&quot; &quot;T&quot; is the time it takes to double.
* The percent increase (a dimensionless number) in a period .
The quantities , , and , and for a given also , have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):
formula_11
where corresponds to and to and being infinite.

If is the unit of time the quotient is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, can be replaced by , but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.

A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the rule of 70,
that is, formula_12.

==Reformulation as log-linear growth==
If a variable exhibits exponential growth according to formula_13, then the log (to any base) of grows linearly over time, as can be seen by taking logarithms of both sides of the exponential growth equation:
formula_14

This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a log-linear model. For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on , one can linearly regress on .

==Differential equation==
The exponential function formula_15 satisfies the linear differential equation:
formula_16
saying that the change per instant of time of at time is proportional to the value of , and has the initial value formula_17.

The differential equation is solved by direct integration:
formula_18
so that formula_19

In the above differential equation, if , then the quantity experiences exponential decay.

For a nonlinear variation of this growth model see logistic function.

== Other growth rates ==
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (that is the basis of the Malthusian catastrophe) as well as any polynomial growth, that is, for all :
formula_20

There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See .

Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called hyperbolic growth. In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the hyperoperations beginning at tetration, and formula_21, the diagonal of the Ackermann function.

=== Logistic growth ===
In reality, initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever. After some period, it will be slowed by external or environmental factors. For example, population growth may reach an upper limit due to resource limitations. In 1845, the Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst first proposed a mathematical model of growth like this, called the &quot;logistic growth&quot;.

==Limitations of models==
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant (leading to a logistic growth model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

==Exponential growth bias==

Studies show that human beings have difficulty understanding exponential growth. Exponential growth bias is the tendency to underestimate compound growth processes. This bias can have financial implications as well.

===Rice on a chessboard===

According to legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful handmade chessboard. The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third, and so on. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for grains on the th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million ( trillion) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006)

The &quot;second half of the chessboard&quot; refers to the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization&#x27;s overall business strategy.

===Water lily===
French children are offered a riddle, which appears to be an aspect of exponential growth: &quot;the apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit&quot;. The riddle imagines a water lily plant growing in a pond. The plant doubles in size every day and, if left alone, it would smother the pond in 30 days killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day, the plant&#x27;s growth is small, so it is decided that it won&#x27;t be a concern until it covers half of the pond. Which day will that be? The 29th day, leaving only one day to save the pond.

<text>The Treaty of Paris (formally the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community) was signed on 18 April 1951 between France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which subsequently became part of the European Union. The treaty came into force on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002, exactly fifty years after it came into effect.

The treaty was intended to bring diplomatic and economic stability in western Europe after the Second World War. Some of the main enemies during the war were now sharing production of coal and steel, the key resources which previously had been central to the war effort.

The Europe Declaration, issued by the representatives of the six nations, declared that the Treaty had given birth to &quot;Europe&quot;. The Declaration emphasised that the supranational principle was the foundation of the new democratic organisation of Europe. The supranational concept was opposed by Charles de Gaulle.

<text>Robert William Chambers (May 26, 1865 – December 16, 1933) was an American artist and fiction writer, best known for his book of short stories titled &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, published in 1895.

==Early life==
Chambers was born in Brooklyn, New York, to William P. Chambers (1827–1911), a corporate and bankruptcy lawyer, and Caroline Smith Boughton (1842–1913). His parents met when his mother was twelve years old and William P. was interning with her father, Joseph Boughton, a prominent corporate lawyer. Eventually the two formed the law firm of Chambers and Boughton which continued to prosper even after Joseph&#x27;s death in 1861. Robert Chambers&#x27;s great-grandfather, William Chambers (birth unknown), a lieutenant in the British Royal Navy, was married to Amelia Saunders (1765–1822), a great-granddaughter of Tobias Saunders of Westerly, Rhode Island. The couple moved from Westerly to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and then to Galway, New York, where their son, also named William Chambers (1798–1874), was born. The second William graduated from Union College at the age of 18, and then went to a college in Boston, where he studied medicine. Upon graduating, he and his wife, Eliza P. Allen (1793–1880), a direct descendant of Roger Williams, the founder of Providence, Rhode Island, were among the first settlers of Broadalbin, New York. His brother was the architect Walter Boughton Chambers.

Chambers was first educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and then entered the Art Students&#x27; League at around the age of twenty, where the artist Charles Dana Gibson was a fellow student. Chambers studied in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian from 1886 to 1893, and his work was displayed at the Salon as early as 1889. 

==Career==
On his return to New York, he succeeded in selling his illustrations to &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Truth&quot;, and &quot;Vogue&quot; magazines. Then, for reasons unclear, he devoted his time to writing, producing his first novel, &quot;In the Quarter&quot;, written in 1887 in Munich. His most famous, and perhaps most meritorious, effort is &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, a collection of Art Nouveau short stories published in 1895. This included several famous weird short stories that are connected by the theme of a fictitious drama of the same title, which drives those who read it insane. E. F. Bleiler described &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; as one of the most important works of American supernatural fiction. It was also strongly admired by H. P. Lovecraft and his circle.

Chambers returned to the weird genre in his later short story collections &quot;The Maker of Moons&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of Choice&quot; and &quot;The Tree of Heaven&quot;, but none earned him as much success as &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;. Some of Chambers&#x27;s work contains elements of science fiction, such as &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot; and &quot;Police!!!&quot;, about a zoologist who encounters monsters.

Chambers&#x27;s main work of historical fiction was a series of novels set during the Franco-Prussian War. These novels were &quot;The Red Republic&quot; (1895, centring on the Paris Commune), &quot;Lorraine&quot; (1898), &quot;Ashes of Empire&quot; (1898) and &quot;Maids of Paradise&quot; (1903). Chambers wrote &quot;Special Messenger&quot; (1909), &quot;Ailsa Paige&quot; (1910) and &quot;Whistling Cat&quot; (1932), novels set during the American Civil War. Chambers also wrote &quot;Cardigan&quot; (1901), a historical novel for younger readers, set at the outbreak of the American Revolution. Chambers later turned to writing romantic fiction to earn a living. According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status. Chambers&#x27; romance novels often featured intimate relationships between &quot;caddish&quot; men and sexually willing women, resulting in some reviewers accusing Chambers&#x27; works of promoting immorality. Many of his works were also serialised in magazines.

His novel &quot;The Man They Hanged&quot; was about Captain Kidd, and argued that Kidd was not a pirate but had been made a scapegoat by the British government.

During World War I, Chambers wrote war adventure novels and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as &quot;Marooned&quot; in &quot;Barbarians&quot; (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction.

Chambers for several years made Broadalbin, New York, his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown.

==Personal life==
On July 12, 1898, he married Elsa (Elsie) Vaughn Moller (1872–1939). They had a son, Robert Edward Stuart Chambers (1899–1955) (who sometimes used the name Robert Husted Chambers).

==Death==
Robert W. Chambers died on December 16, 1933, three days after undergoing intestinal surgery.

==Criticism and legacy==
H. P. Lovecraft said of Chambers in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith:

Despite Chambers&#x27;s effective later abandonment of the weird supernatural tale, these early works are all that remained in print through most of the twentieth century, thanks to Lovecraft&#x27;s inclusion of them in the critical study &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;.

Frederic Taber Cooper commented:

In an overview of Chambers&#x27; historical fiction, Wendy Bousfield stated that the historical novel &quot;Cardigan&quot; was &quot;Chambers&#x27; most highly praised historical novel&quot; during his lifetime. Bousfield also argued that much of Chambers&#x27; historical fiction was marred by poorly written characters and &quot;insensitive humor at the expense of ethnic types&quot;. Bousfield also wrote that &quot;Chambers&#x27; trivializing of human relationships is regrettable, since his recreation of period details of dress and daily life is vivid and historically accurate.&quot;

Critical studies of Chambers&#x27;s horror and fantasy work include Lee Weinstein&#x27;s essay in &quot;Supernatural Fiction Writers&quot;, Brian Stableford&#x27;s essay in the
&quot;St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers&quot; and a chapter in S. T. Joshi&#x27;s book &quot;The Evolution of the Weird Tale&quot; (2004).

Chambers&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tracer of Lost Persons&quot; was adapted into a long-running (1937–54) radio crime drama, &quot;Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons&quot;, by soap opera producers Frank and Anne Hummert.

Chambers&#x27;s &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; has inspired many modern authors, including Karl Edward Wagner, Joseph S. Pulver, Lin Carter, James Blish, Nic Pizzolatto, Michael Cisco, Stephen King, Ann K. Schwader, Robert M. Price, Galad Elflandsson and Charles Stross.

<doc id="191936" wikidata="Q821952" url="?curid=191936" title="Oil lamp">
<text>An oil lamp is a lamp used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although their use is less common in modern times. They work in the same way as a candle but with fuel that is liquid at room temperature, so that a container for the oil is required. A textile wick drops down into the oil, and is lit at the end, burning the oil as it is drawn up the wick.

Oil lamps are a form of lighting, and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the Argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used.

Sources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds and kukui) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, or flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, ghee, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, or seal). Camphine, made of purified spirits of turpentine, and burning fluid, a mixture of turpentine and alcohol, were sold as lamp fuels starting in the 1830s as the whale oil industry declined. Burning fluid became more expensive during the Civil War when a federal tax on alcohol was reenacted. Sales of both camphene and burning fluid decreased in the late 1800s as other sources of lighting, such as kerosene made from petroleum, gas lighting and electric lighting, began to predominate.

Most modern lamps (such as fueled lanterns) have been replaced by gas-based or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Oil lamps are currently used primarily for their ambience.

==Components==
The following are the main external parts of a terra-cotta lamp:
; Shoulder
; Pouring hole
: The hole through which fuel is put inside the fuel chamber. The width generally ranges from . There may be one hole or multiple holes.
; Wick hole and the nozzle
: May be either an opening in the body of the lamp or an elongated nozzle. In some specific types of lamps, there is a groove on the top of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.
; Handle
: Lamps can come with a handle. The handle can come in different shapes. The most common is a ring-shaped for the forefinger surmounted by a palmette, on which the thumb is pressed to stabilize the lamp. Other handles can be crescent-shaped, triangular, or oval-shaped. The handleless lamps usually have an elongated nozzle, and sometimes have a lug rising diagonally from the periphery. The lug may act as a small handle where the thumb rests. Some lugs are pierced. It was speculated that pierced lugs were used to place a pen or straw, called the or , with which the wick was trimmed. Others think that the pierced lugs were used to hang the lamp on a metal hook when not in use.
; Discus
; Fuel chamber
: The fuel reservoir. The mean volume in a typical terra-cotta lamp is .

==Types==
Lamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material (clay, silver, bronze, gold, stone, slip), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).

Typologically, lamps of the Ancient Mediterranean can be divided into seven major categories:

; Wheel-made: This category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simplicity, with little or no decoration, a wide pour-hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced lug. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between the 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.

; Volute, Early Imperial: With spiral, scroll-like ornaments called volutes extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the Early Roman period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder, no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.

; High Imperial: These lamps are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles, short, plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.

; Frog: This is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in Egypt and found in the regions around it, between and 300 AD. The frog (Heqet) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.

; African Red Slip: Lamps made in North Africa, but widely exported, decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, Christian or Jewish. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole. It is hypothesized that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.

; Slipper: These lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the Levant. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD. Decorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.

; Factory lamps: Also called , these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and two or three bumps on the shoulder. Initially made in factories in Northern Italy and Southern Gaul between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.

==In religious contexts==

===Judaism===
Lamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of &quot;lighting&quot; the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.
The oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and religion. The Temple Menorah, a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the Chanukah story.

===Christianity===
There are several references to oil lamps in the New Testament. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Eastern Catholic Churches oil lamps (, ) are still used both on the Holy Table (altar) and to illuminate icons on the iconostasis and around the temple (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their icon corner. Traditionally, the sanctuary lamp in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the bishop when the church is consecrated, and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally olive oil. Oil lamps are also referenced as a symbol throughout the New Testament, including in the Parable of the Ten Virgins.

===Hinduism===

Oil lamps are commonly used in Hindu temples as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of Aarti.

In the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.

A hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu puja ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with ghee. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.

In South India, there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals. Some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well.

; : A brass lamp with a depiction of goddess Sri Lakshmi over the back piece. They are usually small and have only one wick.
; &quot;Nilavilakku&quot;: A tall brass or bronze lamp on a stand where the wicks are placed at a certain height.
; : A brass or bronze lamp in the form of a lady holding a vessel with her hands. This type of lamp comes in different sizes, from very small to almost life-size. There are also large stone versions of this lamp in Hindu temples and shrines of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, especially at the base of columns and flanking the entrance of temples. They have only one wick.
; : A brass or bronze lamp hanging from a chain, often with multiple wicks.
; &quot;Nachiarkoil lamp&quot;: An ornamental brass lamp made of series of diyas, a handicraft product which is exclusively made by the Pather (Kammalar) community in Nachiyar Koil, Tamil Nadu, India.

===Chinese===

Oil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (giving them a similar appearance to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.

Such lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.

==History==

Curved stone lamps were found in places dated to the 10th millennium BC (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300–8000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in Lascaux in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.
Some archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps existed more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500–4500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating to 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that had been used for a long time (Early Bronze Age, Canaanite/Bronze I–IV, c. 3300–2000 BC).

It is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.

=== Chalcolithic Age (4500–3300 BC) ===
The first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared in the Chalcolithic. These were of the round bowl type.

=== Bronze Age (3200–1200 BC) ===
Bronze Age lamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the shape of the base.

====Intermediate Bronze Age (EBIV/MBI)====
A design with four spouts for wicks appeared in the Intermediate Bronze Age (2300-2000 BC). Lamps are made from large bowls with flattened bases for stability, and four equally spaced shallow pinches in the rim for wicks, although some lamps with only a single pinch have also been found. The four-spout design evolved to provide sufficient light when fueled with fish or animal oils, which burn less efficiently than olive oil.

====Middle Bronze Age lamps (MB)====
The four-wick oil lamps persist into this period. However, most lamps now have only one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp&#x27;s body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter&#x27;s wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.

====Late Bronze Age lamps (LB)====
A more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made, with simple and usually flat bases.

===Iron Age (1200–560 BC)===
During the Iron Age, lamp rims become wider and flatter, with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim. The lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution, although some remain similar to lamps from the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.

In the later Iron Age, variant forms appear. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.

===Arctic===
The &quot;qulliq&quot; (seal-oil lamp) provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse population relied almost entirely on seal oil. This lamp was the most important article of furniture for the Inuit, Yupik and other Inuit peoples.

The lamps were made of stone and their sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but mostly were elliptical or half-moon shaped. The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or cottongrass and were lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.

===Persian===
Persian lamps were large, with thin sides and a deep pinch that flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.

===Greek===
Greek lamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handle-less. Some are with a lug, which may be pierced or not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over so it overlaps in order to make the nozzle, and is then pinched to make the wick hole.

They are round in shape and wheel-made.

===Chinese===
The earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the Warring States period (481–221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame. Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.

===Early Roman===

Production of oil lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply in the Early Roman era. Molds began to be used, and lamps were produced in large scale in factories. All lamps are closed in type. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic &quot;Imperial Type&quot;—round, with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U-shaped), a closed body, a central disk decorated with reliefs and a filling hole.

===Late Roman===
Late Roman lamps were of the &quot;High Imperial&quot; type. They included more decorations, and were produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appeared during this period. Many different varieties were created.

Frog type lamps also appeared during this period. These are kidney-shaped, heart-shaped or oval, and feature the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that two identical lamps are seldom found.

===Late Middle Age===

Early Christian and late antique oil lamps were diverse. One of the most notable ones were Mediterranean sigillata (“African”) lamps. The motifs were largely geometric, vegetative and graphic (monograms), with figural depiction of animals and human figures, often Christ. Those depicting Christ or the Chi Rho often categorized as Hayes Type II.

===Byzantine===
Oil lanterns of the Byzantine were slipper-shaped and highly decorative. The multiple-nozzle design continued and most lamps bore handles. Some have complex exteriors.

===Early Islamic===
There is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, or fish to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.

The early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of a bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Later, they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.

An early description of the kerosene lamp comes from 9th-century Baghdad by al-Razi (Rhazes). He referred to it as the in his (&#x27;Book of Secrets&#x27;).

In the transition period, some lamps had Arabic writing. Writing later disappears until the Mamluk period (13th to 15th century AD).

=== Industrial age ===
Oil burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.

==Regional variations==
===Land of Israel/Palestine region===
*Jerusalem oil lamp: The clay has a characteristic black color because it was burned without oxygen. Usually of high quality.
*Daroma oil lamp
*Jerash oil lamp
*Nabatean oil lamp
*Herodian oil lamp: Considered to be used mainly by Jews. Wheel-made, rounded, and have a nozzle with concave sides. The lamps are usually not decorated; if there is decoration, it tends to be simple. Very common throughout all of Judea, and some lamps have also been found in Jordan. Date from the 1st century BC to the end of the 1st century AD.
*Menorah oil lamp, seven nozzles: Rare and are associated with Judaism because of the numerical connection with the seven branches or arms of the Menorah.
*Samaritan oil lamp: Characterized by a sealed filling hole, which was to be broken by the buyer. This was probably done to ensure ritual purity. They have a wider spout, and the concavities flanking the nozzle are almost always emphasized with a ladder pattern band. In general, the lamps are uncoated. The decorations are linear or geometric.
**Type I: A distinct channel runs from the pouring hole to the nozzle. They have a small knob handle, a ladder pattern around the nozzle and no ornamentation on the bottom of the base.
**Type II: Pear-shaped and elongated, with a lined channel that extends from the filling hole to the nozzle. Continued to be used up to the early Muslim period.
*Candle Stick oil lamp: Menorah design on the nozzle and bunch of grapes on the shoulders.
*Byzantine oil lamp: The upper parts and their handles are covered with braided patterns. All are made of a dark orange-red clay. A rounded bottom with a distinct X or cross appears inside the circled base.
*Early Islamic oil lamp: Large knob handle and the channel above the nozzle are the dominant elements of these. The handle is tongue-shaped, and decoration is rich and elegant. The lower parts are extremely broad and the nozzles are pointed.

=== India ===
In Vedic times, fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later, the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.

For , the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best (&#x27;donation&#x27;). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the ) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one (moonless) day in the month of Shravan. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality – &quot;&quot;.

Earlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later, they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the (&#x27;fish&#x27;), (&#x27;tortoise&#x27;) and other incarnations of god Vishnu. Lamps were also created in the shape of the many emblems of gods, like conch shells or lotuses. Birds such as swans, peacocks, or parrots, and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone (&#x27;towers of light&#x27;) were created.
Erecting a in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised brass lamp towers called can be seen. To adapt the design to households and smaller spaces, the (&#x27;tree of light&#x27;) was created. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with curvi-linear lines branching out from the base, each holding a lamp. The is another common design, where the goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.

Oil lamps also were included in proverbs. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, &quot;&quot;, &#x27;the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp ()&#x27;, meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (a lamp&#x27;s container casts a strong shadow).

== Tax ==
When the Big Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, was built 1010 AD, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.

<doc id="191939" wikidata="Q644392" url="?curid=191939" title="Malcolm Williamson">
<text>Malcolm Benjamin Graham Christopher Williamson, (21 November 19312 March 2003) was an Australian composer. He was the Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music from 1975 until his death. According to &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, although Williamson&#x27;s earlier compositions aligned with Serialist techniques, &quot;he later modified his approach to composition in the search of a more inclusive musical language that was fundamentally tonal and, above all, lyrical. In the 1960s, he was commonly referred to as the most often commissioned composer in Britain, and over his lifetime he produced more than 250 works in a wide variety of genres.&quot;

==Life and career==
Williamson was born in Sydney in 1931; his father was an Anglican priest, Rev. George Williamson. He studied composition and horn at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. His teachers included Eugene Goossens. In 1950 he moved to London where he worked as an organist, a proofreader, and a nightclub pianist. In 1952 he converted to Roman Catholicism. From 1953 he studied with Elisabeth Lutyens and Erwin Stein. His first major success was with his Piano Concerto No. 1, premiered by Clive Lythgoe at the 1958 Cheltenham Festival to a standing ovation. Williamson was a prolific composer at this time, receiving many commissions and often performing his own works, both on organ and piano.

In 1975, the death of Arthur Bliss left the title of Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music vacant. The selection of Williamson to fill this post was a surprise, over other composers such as Benjamin Britten (whose compositional inactivity and terminal illness were not then publicly known), Michael Tippett and Malcolm Arnold, such that William Walton had remarked that &quot;the wrong Malcolm&quot; had been chosen. In addition, Williamson was the first non-Briton to hold the post. He wrote a number of pieces connected to his royal post, including &quot;Mass of Christ the King&quot; (1978) (see below) and &quot;Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma&quot; (1980). However, controversy attended his tenure, notably his failure to complete the intended &quot;Jubilee Symphony&quot; for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. He became less prolific in &quot;Royal&quot; works during the last twenty years or so of his life, although he never completely ceased to take interest in writing music for the Royal Family (see list of Royal works below). His overall compositional output slowed considerably due to a series of illnesses. He died in 2003 in a hospital in Cambridge. He was widely reported to have been an alcoholic.

Williamson married an American, Dolores &quot;Dolly&quot; Daniel, in 1960 and they had one son and two daughters.

Williamson had a number of relationships with both sexes, both before and after his marriage. After his marriage broke down in the 1970s, “a deep relationship with musician and publisher Simon Campion helped sustain him through the inevitably stormy periods, both in Australia and in England, that characterised the final stages of his career.”

He had a series of strokes that left him needing a wheelchair, and he spent his final months in hospital. His funeral was not attended by any representatives of the Royal Family.

==Music==

Some of Williamson&#x27;s early works use the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg, but his greatest influence is often said to be Olivier Messiaen. He discovered Messiaen&#x27;s music shortly before converting to Roman Catholicism in 1952. He was also influenced by Benjamin Britten, as well as by jazz and popular music (this latter influence may have come in part from him working as a night club pianist in the 1950s).

Williamson wrote seven symphonies; four numbered piano concertos (plus the Concerto for Two Pianos and Strings, the Concerto for Two Pianos and Wind Quintet, after Alan Rawsthorne, and the Sinfonia Concertante), concertos for violin, organ, harp and saxophone; and many other orchestral works. He wrote ballets, including &quot;Sun into Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Display&quot;, many effective choral works, chamber music, music for solo piano, and music for film and television including the prologue and main title of &quot;Watership Down&quot;. His operas include &quot;English Eccentrics&quot;, to a libretto by Edith Sitwell; &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;, after the novel by Graham Greene; &quot;The Violins of Saint-Jacques&quot;, from Patrick Leigh Fermor&#x27;s novel; and two adaptations of plays by August Strindberg, &quot;Lucky Peter&#x27;s Journey&quot; after &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Growing Castle&quot; after &quot;A Dream Play&quot;. Williamson&#x27;s music for children includes the operas &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; (based on the story by Oscar Wilde) and &quot;Julius Caesar Jones&quot; as well as cassations, which are short operas with audience participation. The cassation &quot;The Valley and the Hill&quot; was written for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977 and performed by 18,000 children.

The composer&#x27;s largest choral work, his &quot;Mass of Christ the King&quot;, was commissioned by the Three Choirs Festival, also for the 1977 jubilee. It attracted attention partly because Williamson delivered it late. Scored for two sopranos, tenor, baritone; soprano, alto, tenor, bass (henceforth SATB) chorus; SATB echo choir; and large orchestra, the work received several performances over a few years, including a live BBC broadcast in 1981, but has more recently been overlooked. A recording of a performance at the Perth Festival 1981 can be found on YouTube.

Williamson became generally much less prolific in later life, although he had some very busy years. For example, in 1988 Williamson wrote a large-scale choral-orchestral work &quot;The True Endeavour&quot;, the orchestral &quot;Bicentennial Anthem&quot;, the &quot;Fanfare of Homage&quot; for military band, a ballet &quot;Have Steps Will Travel&quot; for John Alleyne and the National Ballet of Canada, &quot;Ceremony for Oodgeroo&quot; (Oodgeroo Noonuccal, formerly known as Kath Walker) for brass quintet, and also commenced work on a substantial new choral-symphony &quot;The Dawn is at Hand&quot; (to texts by Kath Walker), completed and performed in Australia the following year. Other works include the &quot;Requiem for a Tribe Brother&quot; (another Australian work, completed in 1992), a third string quartet (1993), a fourth piano concerto (1994, for Marguerite Wolff) and a symphony for solo harp, &quot;Day That I Have Loved&quot; (1994). The orchestral song cycle on texts by Iris Murdoch, &quot;A Year of Birds&quot;, premiered at The Proms in 1995. The same year also saw the premiere of an orchestral work &quot;With Proud Thanksgiving&quot;, commissioned for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, and dedicated to the memory of Williamson&#x27;s long-time friend, the UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson.

At the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, held on Monday, 19 September 2022, mourners filed into Westminster Abbey to &#x27;O Paradise&#x27; by Williamson.

==Honours==
Williamson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1976, and an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1987. Honorary awards of the Order of Australia are made only to people who are not citizens of Australia. It is not clear why Williamson did not qualify for a substantive award, as there appears to be nothing on the public record to suggest he ever relinquished his Australian citizenship. The citation for the award read &quot;For service to music and the mentally handicapped&quot;. He was the first Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music in over a century not to be knighted.

<doc id="191941" wikidata="Q194294" url="?curid=191941" title="Bioethics">
<text>Bioethics is both a field of study and professional practice, interested in ethical issues related to health (primarily focused on the human, but also increasingly includes animal ethics), including those emerging from advances in biology, medicine, and technologies. It proposes the discussion about moral discernment in society (what decisions are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and why) and it is often related to medical policy and practice, but also to broader questions as environment, well-being and public health. Bioethics is concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences, biotechnology, medicine, politics, law, theology and philosophy. It includes the study of values relating to primary care, other branches of medicine (&quot;the ethics of the ordinary&quot;), ethical education in science, animal, and environmental ethics, and public health.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;bioethics&quot; (Greek , &quot;life&quot;; , &quot;moral nature, behavior&quot;) was coined in 1927 by Fritz Jahr in an article about a &quot;bioethical imperative&quot; regarding the use of animals and plants in scientific research. In 1970, the American biochemist, and oncologist Van Rensselaer Potter used the term to describe the relationship between the biosphere and a growing human population. Potter&#x27;s work laid the foundation for global ethics, a discipline centered around the link between biology, ecology, medicine, and human values. Sargent Shriver, the spouse of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, claimed that he had invented the term &quot;bioethics&quot; in the living room of his home in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1970. He stated that he thought of the word after returning from a discussion earlier that evening at Georgetown University, where he discussed with others a possible Kennedy family sponsorship of an institute focused around the &quot;application of moral philosophy to concrete medical dilemmas&quot;.

== Purpose and scope ==

The discipline of bioethics has addressed a wide swathe of human inquiry; ranging from debates over the boundaries of lifestyles (e.g. abortion, euthanasia), surrogacy, the allocation of scarce health care resources (e.g. organ donation, health care rationing), to the right to refuse medical care for religious or cultural reasons. Bioethicists disagree among themselves over the precise limits of their discipline, debating whether the field should concern itself with the ethical evaluation of all questions involving biology and medicine, or only a subset of these questions. Some bioethicists would narrow ethical evaluation only to the morality of medical treatments or technological innovations, and the timing of medical treatment of humans. Others would increase the scope of moral assessment to encompass the morality of all moves that would possibly assist or damage organisms successful of feeling fear.

The scope of bioethics has evolved past mere biotechnology to include topics such as cloning, gene therapy, life extension, human genetic engineering, astroethics and life in space, and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, XNA and proteins. These (and other) developments may affect future evolution and require new principles that address life at its core, such as biotic ethics that values life itself at its basic biological processes and structures, and seeks their propagation. Moving beyond the biological, issues raised in public health such as vaccination and resource allocation have also encouraged the development of novel ethics frameworks to address such challenges. A study published in 2022 based on the corpus of full papers from eight main bioethics journals demonstrated the heterogeneity of this field by distinguishing 91 topics that have been discussed in these journals over the past half a century.

== Principles ==

One of the first areas addressed by modern bioethicists was human experimentation. According to the Declaration of Helsinki published by the World Medical Association, the essential principles in medical research involving human subjects are autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. 
The autonomy of individuals to make decisions while assuming responsibility for them and respecting the autonomy of others ought to be respected. For people unable to exercise their autonomy, special measures ought to be taken to protect their rights and interests.

In US, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was initially established in 1974 to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects. However, the fundamental principles announced in the Belmont Report (1979)—namely, respect for persons, beneficence and justice—have influenced the thinking of bioethicists across a wide range of issues. Others have added non-maleficence, human dignity, and the sanctity of life to this list of cardinal values. 
Overall, the Belmont Report has guided lookup in a course centered on defending prone topics as properly as pushing for transparency between the researcher and the subject. Research has flourished within the past 40 years and due to the advance in technology, it is thought that human subjects have outgrown the Belmont Report, and the need for revision is desired.

Another essential precept of bioethics is its placement of cost on dialogue and presentation. Numerous dialogue based bioethics organizations exist in universities throughout the United States to champion precisely such goals. Examples include the Ohio State Bioethics Society and the Bioethics Society of Cornell. Professional level versions of these organizations also exist.

Many bioethicists, in particular scientific scholars, accord the easiest precedence to autonomy. They trust that every affected person ought to decide which direction of motion they think about most in line with their beliefs. In other words, the patient should always have the freedom to choose their own treatment.

== Medical ethics ==
Medical ethics is a utilized department of ethics that analyzes the exercise of clinical medicinal drug and associated scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values. These values consist of the appreciation for autonomy, beneficence, and justice.
Ethics affects medical decisions made by healthcare providers and patients. Medical ethics is the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to medicine. The four main moral commitments are respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Using these four principles and thinking about what the physicians&#x27; specific concern is for their scope of practice can help physicians make moral decisions. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology.

Medical ethics tends to be understood narrowly as applied professional ethics; whereas bioethics has a more expansive application, touching upon the philosophy of science and issues of biotechnology. The two fields often overlap, and the distinction is more so a matter of style than professional consensus. Medical ethics shares many principles with other branches of healthcare ethics, such as nursing ethics. A bioethicist assists the health care and research community in examining moral issues involved in our understanding of life and death, and resolving ethical dilemmas in medicine and science. Examples of this would be the topic of equality in medicine, the intersection of cultural practices and medical care, ethical distribution of healthcare resources in pandemics, and issues of bioterrorism.

Medical ethical concerns frequently touch on matters of life and death. Patient rights, informed consent, confidentiality, competency, advance directives, carelessness, and many other topics are highlighted as serious health concerns.

The proper actions to take in light of all the circumstances are what ethics is all about. It discusses the difference between what is proper and wrong at a certain moment and a particular society. Medical ethics is concerned with the duties that doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers have to patients, society, and other health professionals.

The health profession has a set of ethical standards that are relevant to various organizations of health workers and medical facilities. Ethics are never stagnant and always relevant. What is seen as acceptable ethics now may not be so one hundred years ago. The hospital administrator is required to have a thorough awareness of their moral and legal obligations.

== Medical sociology ==
The practice of bioethics in clinical care have been studied by medical sociology. Many scholars consider that bioethics arose in response to a perceived lack of accountability in medical care in the 1970s. Studying the clinical practice of ethics in medical care, Hauschildt and Vries found that ethical questions were often reframed as clinical judgments to allow clinicians to make decisions. Ethicists most often put key decisions in the hands of physicians rather than patients.

Communication strategies suggested by ethicists act to decrease patient autonomy. Examples include, clinicians discussing treatment options with one another prior to talking to patients or their family to present a united front limited patient autonomy, hiding uncertainty amongst clinicians. Decisions about overarching goals of treatment were reframed as technical matters excluding patients and their families. Palliative care experts were used as intermediaries to guide patients towards less invasive end-of-live treatment. In their study, Hauschild and Vries found that 76% of ethical consultants were trained as clinicians.

Studying informed consent, Corrigan found that some social processes resulted in limitations to patients choice, but also at times patients could find questions regarding consent to medical trials burdensome.

The most prevalent subject is how social stratification (based on SES, gender, class, ethnicity, and age) affects patterns of behavior related to health and sickness, illness risk, disability, and other outcomes related to health care. The study of health care organization and provision, which encompasses the evolving organizational structures of health care organizations and the social psychology of health and health care, is another important approach. These latter research cover topics including connections between doctors and patients, coping mechanisms, and social support. The description of other important fields of medical sociology study emphasizes how theory and research have changed in the twenty-first century.

==Perspectives and methodology==
Bioethicists come from a wide variety of backgrounds and have training in a diverse array of disciplines. 
The field contains individuals trained in philosophy such as Baruch Brody of Rice University, Julian Savulescu of the University of Oxford, Arthur Caplan of NYU, Peter Singer of Princeton University, Frances Kamm of Rutgers University, Daniel Callahan of the Hastings Center, and Daniel Brock of Harvard University; medically trained clinician ethicists such as Mark Siegler of the University of Chicago and Joseph Fins of Cornell University; lawyers such as Nancy Dubler of Albert Einstein College of Medicine or Jerry Menikoff of the federal Office for Human Research Protections; political scientists like Francis Fukuyama; religious studies scholars including James Childress; and theologians like Lisa Sowle Cahill and Stanley Hauerwas.

The field, formerly dominated by formally trained philosophers, has become increasingly interdisciplinary, with some critics even claiming that the methods of analytic philosophy have harmed the field&#x27;s development. Leading journals in the field include &quot;The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy&quot;, the &quot;Hastings Center Report&quot;, the &quot;American Journal of Bioethics&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot;, &quot;Bioethics&quot;, the &quot;Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, Public Health Ethics,&quot; and the &quot;Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics&quot;. Bioethics has also benefited from the process philosophy developed by Alfred North Whitehead.

Another discipline that discusses bioethics is the field of feminism; the &quot;International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics&quot; has played an important role in organizing and legitimizing feminist work in bioethics.

Many religious communities have their histories of inquiry into bioethical issues and have developed rules and guidelines on how to deal with these issues from within the viewpoint of their respective faiths. The Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths have each developed a considerable body of literature on these matters. In the case of many non-Western cultures, a strict separation of religion from philosophy does not exist. In many Asian cultures, for example, there is a lively discussion on bioethical issues. Buddhist bioethics, in general, is characterized by a naturalistic outlook that leads to a rationalistic, pragmatic approach. Buddhist bioethicists include Damien Keown. In India, Vandana Shiva is a leading bioethicist speaking from the Hindu tradition.

In Africa, and partly also in Latin America, the debate on bioethics frequently focuses on its practical relevance in the context of underdevelopment and geopolitical power relations. In Africa, their bioethical approach is influenced by and similar to Western bioethics due to the colonization of many African countries. Some African bioethicists are calling for a shift in bioethics that utilizes indigenous African philosophy rather than western philosophy. Some African bioethicists also believe that Africans will be more likely to accept a bioethical approach grounded in their own culture, as well as empower African people.

Masahiro Morioka argues that in Japan the bioethics movement was first launched by disability activists and feminists in the early 1970s, while academic bioethics began in the mid-1980s. During this period, unique philosophical discussions on brain death and disability appeared both in the academy and journalism. In Chinese culture and bioethics, there is not as much of an emphasis on autonomy as opposed to the heavy emphasis placed on autonomy in Western bioethics. Community, social values, and family are all heavily valued in Chinese culture, and contribute to the lack of emphasis on autonomy in Chinese bioethics. The Chinese believe that the family, community, and individual are all interdependent of each other, so it is common for the family unit to collectively make decisions regarding healthcare and medical decisions for a loved one, instead of an individual making an independent decision for his or her self.

Some argue that spirituality and understanding one another as spiritual beings and moral agents is an important aspect of bioethics, and that spirituality and bioethics are heavily intertwined with one another. As a healthcare provider, it is important to know and understand varying world views and religious beliefs. Having this knowledge and understanding can empower healthcare providers with the ability to better treat and serve their patients. Developing a connection and understanding of a patient&#x27;s moral agent helps enhance the care provided to the patient. Without this connection or understanding, patients can be at risk of becoming &quot;faceless units of work&quot; and being looked at as a &quot;set of medical conditions&quot; as opposed to the storied and spiritual beings that they are.

=== Islamic bioethics ===
Bioethics in the realm of Islam differs from Western bioethics, but they share some similar perspectives viewpoints as well. Western bioethics is focused on rights, especially individual rights. Islamic bioethics focuses more on religious duties and obligations, such as seeking treatment and preserving life. Islamic bioethics is heavily influenced and connected to the teachings of the Qur&#x27;an as well as the teachings of Muhammad. These influences essentially make it an extension of Shariah or Islamic Law. In Islamic bioethics, passages from the Qur&#x27;an are often used to validate various medical practices. For example, a passage from the Qur&#x27;an states &quot;whosoever killeth a human being ... it shall be as if he had killed all humankind, and whosoever saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he saved the life of all humankind.&quot; This excerpt can be used to encourage using medicine and medical practices to save lives, but can also be looked at as a protest against euthanasia and assisted suicide. A high value and worth are placed on human life in Islam, and in turn, human life is deeply valued in the practice of Islamic bioethics as well. Muslims believe all human life, even one of poor quality, needs to be given appreciation and must be cared for and conserved.

The Islamic education on sensible problems associated to existence in normal and human lifestyles in unique can be sought in Islamic bioethics. As we will see later, due to the fact of interconnectedness of the Islamic regulation and the Islamic ethics, the Islamic bioethics has to reflect on consideration on necessities of the Islamic regulation (Shari‘ah) in addition to ethical considerations.

To react to new technological and medical advancements, informed Islamic jurists regularly will hold conferences to discuss new bioethical issues and come to an agreement on where they stand on the issue from an Islamic perspective. This allows Islamic bioethics to stay pliable and responsive to new advancements in medicine. The standpoints taken by Islamic jurists on bioethical issues are not always unanimous decisions and at times may differ. There is much diversity among Muslims varying from country to country, and the different degrees to which they adhere by Shariah. Differences and disagreements in regards to jurisprudence, theology, and ethics between the two main branches of Islam, Sunni, and Shia, lead to differences in the methods and ways in which Islamic bioethics is practiced throughout the Islamic world. An area where there is a lack of consensus is brain death. The Organization of Islamic Conferences Islamic Fiqh Academy (OIC-IFA) holds the view that brain death is equivalent to cardiopulmonary death, and acknowledges brain death in an individual as the individual being deceased. On the contrary, the Islamic Organization of Medical Sciences (IOMS) states that brain death is an &quot;intermediate state between life and death&quot; and does not acknowledge a brain dead individual as being deceased.

Islamic bioethicists look to the Qur&#x27;an and religious leaders regarding their outlook on reproduction and abortion. It is firmly believed that the reproduction of a human child can only be proper and legitimate via marriage. This does not mean that a child can only be reproduced via sexual intercourse between a married couple, but that the only proper and legitimate way to have a child is when it is an act between husband and wife. It is okay for a married couple to have a child artificially and from techniques using modern biotechnology as opposed to sexual intercourse, but to do this out of the context of marriage would be deemed immoral.

Islamic bioethics is strongly against abortion and strictly prohibits it. The IOMS states that &quot;from the moment a zygote settles inside a woman&#x27;s body, it deserves a unanimously recognized degree of respect.&quot; Abortion may only be permitted in unique situations where it is considered to be the &quot;lesser evil&quot;.

Islamic bioethics may be used to find advice on practical matters relating to life in general and human life in particular. As we will see later, Islamic bioethics must take into account both moral concerns and the requirements of the Islamic law (Shari&#x27;ah) due to the interdependence of Islamic law and Islamic ethics. In order to avoid making a mistake, everything must be thoroughly examined, first against moral criteria and then against legal ones. It appears that many writers on Islamic bioethics have failed to distinguish between the two.

Despite the fact that Islamic law and morality are completely in agreement with one another, they may have distinct prescriptions because of their diverse ends and objectives. One distinction, for instance, is that Islamic ethics seeks to teach those with higher desires how to become more perfect and closer to God, but Islamic law seeks to decrease criteria for perfection or pleasure in both realms that are doable for the average or even lower than average.

So whatever is deemed essential or required by Islamic law is undoubtedly viewed the same way by Islamic ethics. However, there may be situations where something is not against Islamic law but is nonetheless condemned by Islamic ethics. Or there can be circumstances that, while not required by Islamic law, are essential from an ethical standpoint. For instance, while idle conversation is not strictly forbidden by Islamic law, it is morally unacceptable since it wastes time and is detrimental to one&#x27;s spiritual growth. The night prayers are another illustration (which should be performed after midnight and before dawn).

Islamic bioethics&#x27; first influences Islamic bioethics is founded on the Qur&#x27;an, the Sunnah, and reason (al-&#x27;aql), much like any other inquiry into Islam. Sunni Muslims may use terms like ijmaa&#x27; (consensus) and qiyas in place of reason (analogy). Ijmaa&#x27; and qiyas as such are not recognized by Shi&#x27;a since they are insufficient proofs on their own.

=== Christian bioethics ===
In Christian bioethics it is noted that the Bible, especially the New Testament, teaches about healing by faith. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including Elijah, Jesus and Paul. The largest group of miracles mentioned in the New Testament involves cures, the Gospels give varying amounts of detail for each episode, sometimes Jesus cures simply by saying a few words, at other times, he employs material such as spit and mud.

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal. Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ&#x27;s redemption on the cross. Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation. , after describing Jesus exorcising at sunset and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in : &quot;He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases&quot;.

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), who &quot;bound up [an injured man&#x27;s] wounds, pouring on oil and wine&quot; (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot; in verse 29) to &quot;go, and do likewise&quot; in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).

The principle of the sacredness of human life is at the basis of Catholic bioethics. On the subject of abortion, for example, Catholics and Orthodox are on very similar positions. Catholic bioethics insists on this concept, without exception, while Anglicans, Waldensians and Lutherans have positions closer to secular ones, for example with regard to the end of life.

In 1936, Ludwig Bieler argued that Jesus was stylized in the New Testament in the image of the &quot;divine man&quot; (Greek: theios aner), which was widespread in antiquity. It is said that many of the famous rulers and elders of the time had divine healing powers.

Contemporary bioethical and health care policy issues, including abortion, the distribution of limited resources, the nature of appropriate hospital chaplaincy, fetal experimentation, the use of fetal tissue in treatment, genetic engineering, the use of critical care units, distinctions between ordinary and extraordinary treatment, euthanasia, free and informed consent, competency determinations, the meaning of life, are being examined within the framework of traditional Christian moral commitments.

=== Feminist bioethics ===
Feminist bioethics critiques the fields of bioethics and medicine for its lack of inclusion of women&#x27;s and other marginalized group&#x27;s perspectives. This lack of perspective from women is thought to create power imbalances that favor men. These power imbalances are theorized to be created from the androcentric nature of medicine. One example of a lack of consideration of women is in clinical drug trials that exclude women due to hormonal fluctuations and possible future birth defects. This has led to a gap in the research on how pharmaceuticals can affect women. Feminist bioethicists call for the necessity of feminist approaches to bioethics because the lack of diverse perspectives in bioethics and medicine can cause preventable harm to already vulnerable groups.

This study first gained prevalence in the field of reproductive medicine as it was viewed as a &quot;woman&#x27;s issue&quot;. Since then, feminist approaches to bioethics has expanded to include bioethical topics in mental health, disability advocacy, healthcare accessibility, and pharmaceuticals. Lindemann notes the need for the future agenda of feminist approaches to bioethics to expand further to include healthcare organizational ethics, genetics, stem cell research, and more.

Notable figures in feminist bioethics include Carol Gilligan, Susan Sherwin, and the creators of the &quot;International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics&quot;, Mary C. Rawlinson and Anne Donchin. Sherwin&#x27;s book &quot;No Longer Patient: Feminist Ethics in Health Care&quot; (1992) is credited with being one of the first full-length books published on the topic of feminist bioethics and points out the shortcomings in then-current bioethical theories. Sherwin&#x27;s viewpoint incorporates models of oppression within healthcare that intend to further marginalize women, people of color, immigrants, and people with disabilities. Since created in 1992, the &quot;International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics&quot; has done much work to legitimize feminist work and theory in bioethics.

By pointing out the male marking of its purportedly generic human subject and the fact that the tradition does not see women&#x27;s rights as human rights, feminist bioethics challenges bioethics. This article explores how the other gender becomes mute and invisible as a result of this unseen gendering of the universal. It demonstrates how the dehumanization of &quot;man&quot; is a root cause of illness on a social and personal level. Finally, it makes many recommendations for how representations of women&#x27;s experience and bodies could help to constructively reconsider fundamental ethical principles.

===Environmental bioethics===
Bioethics, the ethics of the life sciences in general, expanded from the encounter between experts in medicine and the laity, to include organizational and social ethics, environmental ethics. As of 2019 textbooks of green bioethics existed.

=== Ethical issues in gene therapy ===
Gene therapy involves ethics, because scientists are making changes to genes, the building blocks of the human body. Currently, therapeutic gene therapy is available to treat specific genetic disorders by editing cells in specific body parts. For example, gene therapy can treat hematopoietic disease. There is also a controversial gene therapy called &quot;germline gene therapy&quot;, in which genes in a sperm or egg can be edited to prevent genetic disorder in the future generation. It is unknown how this type of gene therapy affects long-term human development. In the United States, federal funding cannot be used to research germline gene therapy.

The ethical challenges in gene therapy for rare childhood diseases underscore the complexity of initiating trials, determining dosage levels, and involving affected families. With over a third of gene therapies targeting rare, genetic, pediatric-onset, and life-limiting diseases, fair participant selection and transparent engagement with patient communities become crucial ethical considerations. Another concern involves the use of virus-derived vectors for gene transfer, raising safety and hereditary implications. Additionally, the ethical dilemma in gene therapy explores the potential harms of human enhancement, particularly regarding the birth of disabled individuals. Addressing these challenges is vital for responsible development, application, and equitable access to gene therapies. The experience with human growth hormone further illustrates the blurred lines between therapy and enhancement, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in balancing therapeutic benefits and potential enhancements, especially in the rapidly advancing field of genomic medicine. As gene therapies progress towards FDA approval, collaboration with clinical genetics providers becomes essential to navigate the ethical complexities of this new era in medicine.

== Professional practice ==
Bioethics as a subject of expert exercise (although now not a formal profession) developed at the beginning in North America in the Nineteen Eighties and Nineteen Nineties, in the areas of clinical / medical ethics and research ethics. Slowly internationalizing as a field, since the 2000s professional bioethics has expanded to include other specialties, such as organizational ethics in health systems, public health ethics, and more recently Ethics of artificial intelligence. Professional ethicists may be called consultants, ethicists, coordinators, or even analysts; and they may work in healthcare organizations, government agencies, and in both the public and private sectors. They may also be full-time employees, unbiased consultants, or have cross-appointments with educational institutions, such as lookup centres or universities.

== Models of bioethics ==
According to Igor Boyko&#x27;s book &quot;Bioethics&quot;, there are three models of bioethics in the world:

* Model 1 is &quot;liberal&quot; when there are no restrictions. 
* Model 2 is &quot;utilitarian&quot;, when what is prohibited is allowed for one person or a group of persons, if it is useful and beneficial for the majority of people.
* Model 3 is &quot;personalistic&quot;, where the human person is considered a supernatural and inviolable integrity.

== Learned societies and professional associations ==
The field of bioethics has developed national and international learned societies and professional associations, such as the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities, the Canadian Bioethics Society, the Canadian Association of Research Ethics Boards, the Association of Bioethics Program Directors, the Bangladesh Bioethics Society and the International Association of Bioethics.

== Education ==
Bioethics is taught in courses at the undergraduate and graduate level in different academic disciplines or programs, such as Philosophy, Medicine, Law, Social Sciences. It has become a requirement for professional accreditation in many health professional programs (Medicine, Nursing, Rehabilitation), to have obligatory training in ethics (e.g., professional ethics, medical ethics, clinical ethics, nursing ethics). Interest in the field and professional opportunities have led to the development of dedicated programs with concentrations in Bioethics, largely in the United States, Canada (List of Canadian bioethics programs) and Europe, offering undergraduate majors/minors, graduate certificates, and master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees.

Training in bioethics (usually clinical, medical, or professional ethics) are part of core competency requirements for health professionals in fields such as nursing, medicine or rehabilitation. For example, every medical school in Canada teaches bioethics so that students can gain an understanding of biomedical ethics and use the knowledge gained in their future careers to provide better patient care. Canadian residency training programs are required to teach bioethics as it is one of the conditions of accreditation, and is a requirement by the College of Family Physicians of Canada and by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

==Criticism==
As a field of study, bioethics has also drawn criticism. For instance, Paul Farmer noted that bioethics tends to focus its attention on problems that arise from &quot;too much care&quot; for patients in industrialized nations while giving little or no attention to the ethical problem of too little care for the poor. Farmer characterizes the bioethics of handling morally difficult clinical situations, normally in hospitals in industrialized countries, as &quot;quandary ethics&quot;. He does not regard quandary ethics and clinical bioethics as unimportant; he argues, rather, that bioethics must be balanced and give due weight to the poor.

Additionally, bioethics has been condemned for its lack of diversity in thought, particularly concerning race. Even as the field has grown to include the areas of public opinion, policymaking, and medical decision-making, little to no academic writing has been authored concerning the intersection between race–especially the cultural values imbued in that construct–and bioethical literature. John Hoberman illustrates this in a 2016 critique, in which he points out that bioethicists have been traditionally resistant to expanding their discourse to include sociological and historically relevant applications. Central to this is the notion of white normativity, which establishes the dominance of white hegemonic structures in bioethical academia and tends to reinforce existing biases.

These points and critiques, along with the neglect of women&#x27;s perspectives within bioethics, have also been discussed amongst feminist bioethical scholars.

However, differing views on bioethics&#x27; lack of diversity of thought and social inclusivity have also been advanced. For example, one historian has argued that the diversity of thought and social inclusivity are the two essential cornerstones of bioethics, albeit they have not been fully realized.

In order to practice critical bioethics, bioethicists must base their investigations in empirical research, refute ideas with facts, engage in self-reflection, and be skeptical of the assertions made by other bioethicists, scientists, and doctors. A thorough normative study of actual moral experience is what is intended.

==Issues==
Research in bioethics is conducted by a broad and interdisciplinary community of scholars, and is not restricted only to those researchers who define themselves as &quot;bioethicists&quot;: it includes researchers from the humanities, social sciences, health sciences and health professions, law, the fundamental sciences, etc. These researchers may be working in specialized bioethics centers and institutes associated with university bioethics training programs; but they may also be based in disciplinary departments without a specific bioethics focus. Notable examples of research centers include, amongst others, The Hastings Center, the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, the Centre for Human Bioethics.

Areas of bioethics research that are the subject of published, peer-reviewed bioethical analysis include:

<text>Master of the King&#x27;s Music (or Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, or earlier Master of the King&#x27;s Musick) is a post in the Royal Household of the United Kingdom. The holder of the post originally served the monarch of England, directing the court orchestra and composing or commissioning music as required.

The post is broadly comparable to that of poet laureate. It is given to people eminent in the field of classical music; they have almost always been composers. Duties are not clearly stated, though it is generally expected the holder of the post will write music to commemorate important royal events, such as coronations, birthdays, anniversaries, marriages and deaths, and to accompany other ceremonial occasions. The individual may also act as the sovereign&#x27;s adviser in musical matters. Since 2004 the appointment has been for a fixed term of ten years rather than for life, as previously.

==The King&#x27;s Musick==

In the 14th century professional music-making in England was theoretically regulated by the Crown. Musicians known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Minstrels&quot; or the &quot;King&#x27;s Musick&quot; wore the royal livery and exercised some control of other musicians, although the musicologist Leonard Duck describes that control as &quot;nominal&quot;.

Henry VI appointed a Royal Commission to regulate unlicensed minstrelsy and in 1469 Edward IV granted the royal minstrels a Guild charter. According to the charter, &quot;no Minstrel of our Kingdom ... shall henceforth in any way practise or publicly exercise the art or occupation within our Kingdom aforesaid, unless he belong to the said Brotherhood or Guild&quot;. This led to legal difficulties between the royal minstrels and the City Company under the patronage of the City of London, chartered by James I in 1604 to perform in the City and outside it. The King&#x27;s Minstrels requested and received a charter from Charles I in 1635 to &quot;have the survey, scrutinie, correction and government of all and singular the musicians within the kingdome of England&quot;.

==First Masters of the King&#x27;s Musick==

The first appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Musick was the only one seriously to attempt to rule all the musicians in the kingdom as a guild. This was Nicholas Lanier, appointed by Charles I in 1626 as Master of the King&#x27;s Musick (the spelling was changed to &quot;Music&quot; in the 20th century, during Sir Edward Elgar&#x27;s tenure). At that time the holder of the post took charge of the monarch&#x27;s private band, a responsibility which continued until the band was dissolved in 1901 by Edward VII.

The position lapsed during the period of military rule following the Civil War, but on the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Lanier returned from exile to resume the revived post. After Lanier&#x27;s death in 1666, Charles II appointed a French violinist, Louis Grabu, to the post. Grabu was primarily concerned with organising the music for the court, and the Westminster musicians&#x27; guild fell into decline, coming to an end after 1697. Neither Grabu nor his successor Nicholas Staggins, who served from 1674 to 1700, was a talented composer; they turned to established composers such as Henry Purcell to supply music for important occasions.

==18th century==

Staggins was succeeded by John Eccles, who was appointed by William III in June 1700. Eccles was the longest-serving Master, holding the post for 35 years; he is also the only one to have served under four monarchs (William III, Anne, George I and George II). He was already a well-known composer before his appointment, described by &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; as &quot;undoubtedly the greatest of the Restoration theatre composers&quot; after Purcell. He nevertheless continued his predecessors&#x27; practice of commissioning works from other composers; George Frideric Handel in particular was given multiple commissions, including the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (1713) and the coronation anthems for the coronation of George II in 1727. Duck comments that Handel&#x27;s eminence as a composer &quot;evidently did not qualify him as a suitable candidate for the honour of Master of the King&#x27;s Music – the Hanoverian kings clearly played safe by choosing musicians of unimpeachable native breeding&quot;.

After Eccles&#x27;s death in 1735, his post was filled by Maurice Greene, who already held the posts of organist of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and organist and composer of the Chapel Royal. He held the post for twenty years, but his health was never robust, and he frequently called upon his former pupil William Boyce to compose music for the birthday and New Year odes written by the Poet Laureate in honour of the King. After Greene died in December 1755, Boyce succeeded him as Master of the King&#x27;s Musick, and later in the Chapel Royal appointment. It was probably in the latter capacity rather than the former that Boyce provided what &quot;Grove&quot; calls &quot;an imposing and deeply felt orchestral anthem&quot; for the funeral of George II on 11 November 1760, &quot;a splendid setting of &#x27;The King shall rejoice&quot;&#x27; for the wedding of King George III and Princess Charlotte on 8 September 1761, and eight anthems for the coronation of the King later in the same month.

Boyce died in 1779, and was succeeded as Master by another former pupil of Greene, John Stanley, who held the post until he died in 1786. He composed fifteen birthday and New Year odes, but none of them have survived. The last Master appointed in the 18th century was Sir William Parsons. He was viewed by his contemporaries as an affable man but a musician of limited ability, although his court music cannot be assessed, having mostly been lost. He is believed to be the first professional musician to have been knighted in Britain, although it was said that the honour was more for &quot;the score of his merits than because of the merits of his scores&quot;.

==19th century==

Parsons held the post of Master until 1817, when he was succeeded by William Shield, best known as a theatre composer: he composed or arranged music for at least thirty-six operas and seven pantomimes and ballets. Shield&#x27;s tenure is most notable for the abandonment of the traditional provision of court odes. By custom, the Poet Laureate of the day wrote the words for the odes, a task that the then holder, Robert Southey, found uncongenial. After the death of George III in 1820 the odes were discontinued. The post of Master of the King&#x27;s Musick continued because George IV maintained the traditional small orchestra, which Shield&#x27;s successor, Christian Kramer, directed. That remained the chief function of the Master through the tenures of Franz Cramer (Master 1834–48), George Frederick Anderson (Master 1848–70), and Sir William Cusins (Master 1870–93). The last of these produced a few works for royal occasions, including a jubilee cantata, &quot;Grant the Queen a Long Life&quot; (1887).

The last Master appointed in the 19th century was Sir Walter Parratt, organist of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. His tenure lasted thirty-one years from 1893, under the reigns of three monarchs – Queen Victoria, Edward VII and George V. In Duck&#x27;s view, Parratt&#x27;s role was chiefly that of musical adviser to the Crown. Among his actions in that capacity were inviting Elgar to set A. C. Benson&#x27;s verses as a Coronation Ode for Edward VII in 1901, and writing an anthem for the anniversary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s death in 1909. Parratt&#x27;s own official compositions included a contribution to a collection of choral songs by various composers in honour of Queen Victoria and a &quot;Confortare&quot; for the coronation service of Edward VII.

==20th century==

After Parratt&#x27;s death in 1924, there was a body of opinion that the position of Master was an anachronism, with neither a royal band to direct nor regular royal odes to compose. Elgar, who was well regarded by the royal family, pressed the case for retaining the post. According to the music writer Nicholas Kenyon, he also &quot;lobbied shamelessly&quot; for his own candidacy for it. Other names, including that of Ralph Vaughan Williams had been suggested, but George V and his advisers took the view that &quot;if the post is to go to the most eminent musician it would hardly be possible to go beyond Elgar.&quot; Elgar&#x27;s appointment was announced in May 1924; &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;it is entirely fitting that in the changed condition of the office he should be made Master of the King&#x27;s Musick and the Musician Laureate of the British people.&quot; Elgar was not required to write any official music in his new capacity, but in 1931, he dedicated his &quot;Nursery Suite&quot; to the Duchess of York and her two daughters. He used his influence as Master to track down the original instruments of Edward VII&#x27;s band, to ensure the royal music library was well ordered, and to secure recognition for other musicians, including a knighthood for Granville Bantock and the Companion of Honour for Frederick Delius. As musical aide to the King he gave advice about such topics as the foundation of a national opera company, the correct version of the national anthem to be broadcast by the BBC, and the musical events at which members of the royal family should be present.

Elgar died in 1934. He was succeeded by Sir Walford Davies, organist of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, who had been rumoured to be in the running for the post in 1924. In a 1966 retrospective of the various Masters, Charles Cudworth wrote that Davies was &quot;a fine musician, a good composer, and was even better-known as one of the world&#x27;s first great broadcasters, so the appointment was
popular.&quot; When Davies died in 1941, Sir Arnold Bax replaced him, to the surprise of many in the musical world, given his strong affinities with Ireland, and no record of writing occasional music. Bax did write a few pieces for royal occasions, including a march for the coronation of Elizabeth II.

Bax died in 1953; many expected his successor to be Sir William Walton, but to Walton&#x27;s own relief the post went to Sir Arthur Bliss. In &quot;The Times&quot;, the critic Frank Howes commented, &quot;The duties of a Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music are what he chooses to make of them, but they include the composition of ceremonial and occasional music&quot;. Bliss, who composed quickly and with facility, was able to discharge the calls on him as Master, providing music as required for state occasions, from the birth of a child to the Queen, and the funeral of Winston Churchill, to the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales.

When Bliss died in 1975, Walton and others lobbied for the appointment of Malcolm Arnold. There was some surprise that Bliss&#x27;s actual successor was the Australian composer Malcolm Williamson; Walton attributed the appointment to the need for &quot;cementing the cracks in the Commonwealth&quot;. Williamson held the post from 1975 until his death in 2003, composing works including &quot;Lament in Memory of Lord Mountbatten of Burma&quot; (1980), &quot;Ode for Queen Elizabeth&quot; (1980), and &quot;Songs for a Royal Baby&quot; (1985).

==21st century==

Sir Peter Maxwell Davies was appointed to the Mastership in 2004 in succession to Williamson. For the first time the appointment was for a fixed, ten-year, term rather than for life, with the aim of making the post more attractive to composers. Maxwell Davies&#x27; work as Master included a Christmas carol for the Queen which was recorded by the Chapels Royal, and a work to accompany a poem by the Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, to mark the Queen&#x27;s eightieth birthday in 2006. He played a key role in the creation of the Queen&#x27;s Medal for Music.

After the end of Maxwell Davies&#x27; term, Judith Weir was appointed in 2014, again for a ten-year term. Reporting the appointment, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that rather than only writing pieces for royal occasions,

Weir would concentrate on supporting and speaking up for her composer colleagues, challenging the function that contemporary music fulfils in society, and embarking on a nationwide exploration of the state of music education in order to create pieces that will be useful for schoolchildren and amateur musicians.
However, Weir has composed several works for state events, including &quot;The True Light&quot; for the First World War centenary in 2018, &quot;By Wisdom&quot; for the Platinum Jubilee and &quot;Like as the hart&quot; for the Queen&#x27;s state funeral.

In 2024, Errollyn Wallen was the first appointment to the office by King Charles III.

<doc id="191965" wikidata="Q947755" url="?curid=191965" title="The Phantom">
<text>The Phantom is an American adventure comic strip, first published by Lee Falk in February 1936. The main character, the Phantom, is a fictional costumed crime-fighter who operates from the fictional African country of Bangalla. The character has been adapted for television, film and video games.

The series began with a daily newspaper strip on February 17, 1936, followed by a color Sunday strip on May 28, 1939; both are still running as of . In 1966, King Features stated that &quot;The Phantom&quot; was being published in 583 newspapers worldwide. At its peak, the strip was read by over 100 million people daily.

Falk worked on &quot;The Phantom&quot; until his death in 1999; since his death, the comic strip has been written by Tony DePaul. Since 2016, it has been drawn by Mike Manley (Monday–Saturday) and, since 2017, Jeff Weigel (Sunday). Previous artists on the newspaper strip include Ray Moore, Wilson McCoy, Bill Lignante, Sy Barry, George Olesen, Keith Williams, Fred Fredericks, Graham Nolan, Eduardo Barreto, Paul Ryan, and Terry Beatty. In the strip, the Phantom was 21st in a line of crime-fighters which began in 1536, when the father of British sailor Christopher Walker was killed during a pirate attack. Swearing an oath on the skull of his father&#x27;s murderer to fight evil, Christopher began a legacy of the Phantom which would pass from father to son. Nicknames for the Phantom include &quot;The Ghost Who Walks&quot;, &quot;Guardian of the Eastern Dark&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Cannot Die&quot;.

Unlike many other superheroes, the Phantom has no superpowers; he relies on his strength, intelligence, skill at arms (he carries two holstered handguns, a revolver and a 1911 .45 autopistol, one on each hip, and is an expert marksman with both), and the myth of his immortality to take action against the forces of evil. The 21st Phantom is married to Diana Palmer; they met while he studied in the United States and they have two children, Kit and Heloise. He has a trained wolf named Devil and a horse named Hero, and like the 20 previous Phantoms he lives in the ancient Skull Cave.

The Phantom was the first fictional hero to wear the skintight costume which has become a hallmark of comic-book superheroes, and was the first shown in a mask with no visible pupils (another superhero standard). Comics historian Peter Coogan has described the Phantom as a &quot;transitional&quot; figure, since the Phantom has some of the characteristics of pulp magazine heroes such as The Shadow and the Spider and earlier jungle heroes such as Tarzan, as well as anticipating the features of comic book heroes such as Superman, Batman, and Captain America.

==Publication history==

===Creation===
After the success of &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot;, King Features Syndicate asked Falk to develop a new feature. His first effort was to write and draw a strip about King Arthur and his knights. When King Features rejected the strip, Falk developed the Phantom, a mysterious, costumed crime-fighter. He planned the first few months of the story, and drew the first two weeks as a sample.

Fascinated by myths and legends (such as King Arthur and El Cid) and the modern fictional characters Zorro, Tarzan and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; Mowgli, Falk envisioned the character as wealthy playboy Jimmy Wells by day and the crime-fighting Phantom by night. During his first story, &quot;The Singh Brotherhood&quot;, before disclosing that Wells was the Phantom, Falk changed the setting to a jungle and made the Phantom an apparently immortal, mythic figure. Thinking that there were already too many characters called &quot;the Phantom&quot; (including The Phantom Detective and The Phantom of the Opera), Falk considered calling his hero &quot;The Gray Ghost&quot;. However, he could not find a name he liked better and decided to stay with &quot;The Phantom&quot;.

In the A&amp;E American cable TV documentary &quot;The Phantom: Comic Strip Crusader&quot;, Falk explained that Greek busts inspired him to omit the Phantom&#x27;s pupils when the character was wearing his mask. He incorrectly believed that ancient Greek busts had no pupils (they were painted on originally and faded with time), which he said gave them an &quot;inhuman, awe-inspiring appearance.&quot; In an interview for &quot;Comic Book Marketplace&quot;, Falk said the Phantom&#x27;s skin-tight costume was inspired by Robin Hood, who wore tights in films and onstage.

Falk was a Shakespeare enthusiast, and the comic included several references to Shakespeare. These include the third Phantom playing Juliet in the original premiere of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, as well as marrying Shakespeare&#x27;s niece.

===Newspaper strips===

&quot;The Phantom&quot; began as a daily strip on February 17, 1936 with &quot;The Singh Brotherhood&quot;, written by Falk and drawn by him for two weeks and then by Ray Moore (assistant to artist Phil Davis on &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot;). That year, &quot;The Phantom&quot; was serialized in the &quot;Australian Woman&#x27;s Mirror&quot;. A Sunday &quot;Phantom&quot; strip was added on May 28, 1939.

During World War II Falk joined the Office of War Information, where he became chief of the radio foreign-language division. Moore also served during the war and left the strip to his assistant, Wilson McCoy. When Moore returned he worked sporadically on the strip until 1949, when McCoy succeeded him. During McCoy&#x27;s tenure, &quot;The Phantom&quot; appeared in thousands of newspapers worldwide and was smuggled by boat into Nazi-occupied Norway during the war; &quot;Phantom&quot; was a password for the Norwegian resistance movement.

McCoy died unexpectedly in 1961. Carmine Infantino and Bill Lignante (who later drew several Phantom stories for comic books) filled in before a successor was found in Sy Barry. During Barry&#x27;s early years he and Falk modernized the strip, laying the foundation for what is considered the Phantom&#x27;s modern look. Under Barry, Bangalla became a democracy and the character of President Lamanda Luaga was introduced. Barry worked on &quot;The Phantom&quot; for over 30 years until his 1994 retirement, drawing a total of about 11,000 strips.

His longtime assistant George Olesen remained on the strip as penciller, with Keith Williams inking the daily strip. The Sunday strip was inked by Eric Doescher until Fred Fredericks succeeded him in 1995.

Falk continued to script &quot;The Phantom&quot; and &quot;Mandrake&quot; until his death on March 13, 1999. His last daily Phantom strip story, &quot;Terror at the Opera,&quot; was finished by his wife, Elizabeth. After Falk&#x27;s death King Features cooperated with European comic publisher &quot;Egmont&quot;, publisher of the Swedish &quot;Fantomen&quot; magazine (which changed from publishing &quot;Phantom&quot; stories in comic-book format to providing the newspaper strip as well) by adapting their own &quot;Phantom&quot; comic-book stories into the strip format. &quot;Fantomen&quot; writers Tony DePaul and Claes Reimerthi alternated as writers of the newspaper strip after Falk died, with DePaul handling the daily strips and Reimerthi the Sunday ones. DePaul would later become the strip&#x27;s sole writer. Some stories were adapted from those originally published in &quot;Fantomen&quot;.

In 2000, Olesen and Fredericks retired from the Sunday strip. It was continued by comic-book artist Graham Nolan, who had drawn three &quot;Fantomen&quot; covers. In early 2005 Olesen and Williams left the daily strip after Olesen retired, and artist Paul Ryan (who had worked on the &quot;Fantomen&quot; comic stories and had been a fan of the character since childhood) took over the daily strip. Ryan succeeded Nolan as artist on the Sunday strip in 2007. On July 31, 2011, Eduardo Barreto became the Sunday-page artist. He died after only a few months, and Ryan temporarily took over the Sunday page again on January 15, 2012 (which featured a memorial to Barreto). Ryan also did the following week&#x27;s strip, before Terry Beatty became Barreto&#x27;s replacement.

Ryan died at his home unexpectedly on March 7, 2016. Mike Manley succeeded Ryan as artist on The Phantom, beginning with the strip dated May 30, 2016.

Beatty stepped down as Sunday artist in 2017, and was replaced by Jeff Weigel.

===Internationally===

====United States====
&quot;The Phantom&quot; has been published by a number of publishers in the United States. During the 1940s the strips were reprinted in &quot;Ace Comics&quot;, published by David McKay Publications. Harvey Comics published &quot;The Phantom&quot; during the 1950s. In 1962 Gold Key Comics took over, followed by King Comics in 1966 and Charlton in 1969. By 1977, a total of 73 issues were published. Principal &quot;Phantom&quot; artists during this period were Bill Lignante, Don Newton, Jim Aparo and Pat Boyette.

In 1943, Columbia Pictures released the 15-episode serial &quot;The Phantom&quot; starring Tom Tyler as &quot;The Phantom&quot; and Jeanne Bates as &quot;Diana Palmer&quot;.

DC Comics published a &quot;Phantom&quot; comic book from 1988 to 1990. The initial May–August 1988 miniseries was written by Peter David, penciled by Joe Orlando, and inked by Dennis Janke. A subsequent series, written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Luke McDonnell, ran for thirteen issues from March 1989 to March 1990. In the series, the Phantom fought racism, toxic dumping, hunger and modern-day piracy. According to Verheiden, the series ended as much because of licensing issues as falling sales. In the final panels of issue 13, the Phantom marries Diana.

In 1987, Marvel Comics published a four-issue miniseries written by Stan Lee and based on the &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; TV series. Another three-issue Marvel miniseries, &quot;The Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks&quot; (February–April 1995) followed which was written and drawn by David de Vries and Glenn Lumsden; it featured the 22nd Phantom with an updated, high-tech costume. Marvel later released a four-part miniseries (May–August 1995), pencilled by Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko, based on the &quot;Phantom 2040&quot; TV series. One issue featured a pin-up by the original two Spider-Man signature artists, Ditko and John Romita, Sr.

In the United States and Australia, &quot;The Phantom&quot; was released in theaters as a major motion picture starring Billy Zane as “The Phantom/Kit Walker,” the 21st Phantom. Opened June 7, 1996 nationwide in the aforementioned markets.

Moonstone Books published Phantom graphic novels beginning in 2002. Five books, written by Tom DeFalco, Ben Raab and Ron Goulart with art by Mike Collins were published. In 2003, Moonstone introduced a &quot;Phantom&quot; comic-book series written by Raab, Rafael Nieves and Chuck Dixon, and drawn by Pat Quinn, Jerry DeCaire, Nick Derington, Rich Burchett, and EricJ. After eleven issues Mike Bullock took over the scripting, with Gabriel Rearte and Carlos Magno creating the artwork before Silvestre Szilagyi became the regular artist in 2007. Bullock&#x27;s stories often feature topical issues, based on actual African conflicts. In a 2007 three-part story arc, &quot;Invisible Children&quot;, the Phantom fights a fictional warlord called &quot;Him&quot; (loosely based on Joseph Kony).

In 2006, Moonstone published a retcon of the Phantom&#x27;s origin, &quot;Legacy&quot;, by Raab and Quinn. Three years later the company reintroduced the series as &quot;The Phantom: Ghost Who Walks&quot;, beginning with issue 0 (a retelling of the first Phantom&#x27;s origin). The aim was to make the comic darker, grittier and more realistic, similar to the 1930s stories by Lee Falk and Ray Moore. It updated the Phantom, giving him modern accessories, and introduced a number of supporting characters and villains. In the series, the Phantom fights reality-based enemies such as modern terrorists, organ smugglers and Somali pirates.

Dynamite Entertainment introduced a monthly comic-book series, &quot;The Last Phantom&quot;, in August 2010. The series was written by Scott Beatty and drawn by Eduardo Ferigato, with covers painted by Alex Ross.

In 2013, the Phantom appeared in Dynamite&#x27;s five-issue miniseries, &quot;Kings Watch&quot;. In the series, written by Jeff Parker and drawn by Marc Laming, the Phantom joins Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician to fight Ming the Merciless and prevent his attempt to take over the planet. It was followed by the 2015 five-issue miniseries &quot;King: The Phantom&quot; in which Lothar as the new Phantom looks for the rightful heir to the legacy. In 2016, started a new crossover of King Features characters (The Phantom, Mandrake the Magician, Flash Gordon, Prince Valiant, Jungle Jim), &quot;Kings Quest&quot;.

In 2014, Hermes Press announced that it would publish a Phantom comic-book miniseries with new content, written by Peter David and illustrated by Sal Velluto, scheduled for publication in November 2014. It debuted October 31, 2014. For Free Comic Book Day 2015, Hermes published a Phantom comic book with art by Bill Lignante and samples of the new miniseries.

In 2024, Mad Cave Studios published a new Flash Gordon comic book, a trade paperback of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; series, and launched a new series of the team.

====Nordic region====
Egmont Publications has published original Phantom stories in a fortnightly &quot;Phantom&quot; comic book in Sweden as &quot;Fantomen&quot;, in Denmark and Norway as &quot;Fantomet&quot; and in Finland as &quot;Mustanaamio&quot; (&quot;Black Mask&quot;). The first issue of &quot;Fantomen&quot; was dated October 1950, and over 1,600 issues have been published. The first story created originally for &quot;Fantomen&quot; was published in 1963, and there are a total of over 900 &quot;Fantomen&quot; stories. The average &quot;Fantomen&quot; story is over 30 pages, compared to 20–24 pages for most American comics. Artists and writers who have created stories for &quot;Fantomen&quot; include Dick Giordano, Donne Avenell, Heiner Bade, David Bishop, Dai Darell, Georges Bess, Jaime Vallvé, Joan Boix, Tony DePaul, Ulf Granberg, Ben Raab, Rolf Gohs, Scott Goodall, Eirik Ildahl, Kari Leppänen, Hans Lindahl, Janne Lundström, Cesar Spadari, Bob McLeod, Jean-Yves Mitton, Lennart Moberg, Claes Reimerthi, Paul Ryan, Alex Saviuk, Graham Nolan, Romano Felmang and Norman Worker, and they have been nicknamed &quot;Team Fantomen&quot;. The team have experimented with the character and his surroundings, with Singh Brotherhood leader Sandal Singh taking over as President of Bangalla and the Phantom and Diana having marriage problems. In 2018, the Norwegian branch of Egmont issued a statement that the Norwegian Fantomet edition would get cancelled at the end of 2018, thus leaving the Swedish edition as the only remaining edition in Scandinavia. The Phantom has been a noticeable part of culture in Sweden especially. Between 1986 and 2010, there was even a &quot;Fantomenland&quot; (Phantom Land) at the Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna in Sweden.

====Australia====
In Australia, the &quot;Australian Woman&#x27;s Mirror&quot; began publishing the strip in 1936 and Frew Publications has published a fortnightly &quot;Phantom&quot; comic book since 1948, celebrating sixty years of uninterrupted publication in September 2008. Although Frew&#x27;s comic book primarily contains reprints from the newspaper strips, &quot;Fantomen&quot; (translated into English) and other Phantom comic books, it has occasionally included original stories drawn by Australian artists such as Keith Chatto. The editor-in-chief was Jim Shepherd until his death. Frew&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom&quot; is the longest-running comic-book series with the character in the world, and Australia&#x27;s bestselling comic book. Frew &quot;Phantom&quot; comics appear in a number of Sydney Royal Easter Show, Royal Adelaide Show, Melbourne Show and Perth Royal Show showbags.

In 2013, publisher Jim Shepherd, who had bought the rights from the original owners during the late 1980s, died of a heart attack. Shepherd had taken over the company and introduced some minor changes to placate King Features, which had become unhappy at Frew&#x27;s treatment of its character. Shepherd&#x27;s changes included glossy covers (replacing the standard newsprint covers), brief editorials, regular 100-page specials and, most significantly, an annual special of between 200 and 300 pages which included multiple stories and a standalone &quot;replica&quot; reprint of a very early Frew edition. Shepherd also embarked on an ambitious project to reprint the entire backlist of Lee Falk stories in their original formats: Frew&#x27;s reprints had often been heavily edited to fit its 32-page format. Following Shepherd&#x27;s death, Frew and &quot;The Phantom&quot; were continued by Shepherd&#x27;s wife Judith until she sold the business to artist Glenn Ford and Rene White in 2016. Since then, the new &quot;Frew Crew&quot; (with new publisher Dudley Hogarth) have introduced a range of innovations:
* &quot;Kid Phantom&quot;, a standalone quarterly all-colour, glossy comic book aimed at children, with original material, illustrated by Dr Paul Mason and written by Andrew Constant.
* &quot;Giant-Size Phantom&quot;, a standalone quarterly comic book series reprinting Frew&#x27;s other characters from the 1950s as well as &quot;The Phantom&quot;. The title revives an earlier title published by Frew between 1957 and 1960.
* &quot;Phantom&#x27;s World&quot;, a standalone quarterly comic book series which features Phantom stories from around the world, often seen for the first time in English, as well as original material.

====New Zealand====
King Features sold &quot;The Phantom&quot; to a number of New Zealand newspapers, included &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;. &quot;The Phantom&quot; also appeared in a successful comic from the Wellington-based Feature Publications during the 1950s. The Frew comics are also available in New Zealand.

====India====
In India, &quot;The Phantom&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot; in the 1950s. In 1964, the Indian publisher Indrajal Comics began publishing a &quot;Phantom&quot; comic book in English. Later Indrajal would also publish &quot;The Phantom&quot; in several Indian languages. Over the years, other Indian publishers have printed Phantom comic books, the most prominent being Diamond Comics, Euro Books (formerly Egmont Imagination India), and Rani Comics. The Telugu regional daily Eenadu published translated versions of Phantom comics during the early days of its Sunday supplements. Phantom is also published in Bengali and Hindi language in local newspapers. In Hindi it is published by Indrajal comics as character name Vetaal. They have also published it in Bengali as character name, Aranyadeb.

In the early 1990s, Regal Publishers from Kerala started publishing Phantom comics in Malayalam Language. After a gap, Regal Publishers have again started publishing Phantom comics in Malayalam in 2019. From August 2020 onwards Regal Publishers have started publishing Phantom comics in English.

Starting in 2021, Shakti Comics started publishing the Phantom along with Mandrake and Flash Gordon; they were published in English as well as Hindi and Bengali languages. Shakti Comics is the only publisher after Indrajal to publish phantom comics in Hindi and Bengali on monthly basis.

Leading Bengali publishing house, Anandabazar Patrika, had published the comics in Bengali, under the character name, Aranyadeb (the god of the jungle), in their elite magazine, &quot;Desh&quot;, later in their children&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Anandamela&quot;, and continue to publish the strips in their Bengali newspaper, &quot;Anandabazar Patrika&quot;.Gujarathi newspaper Mumbai Samachar also used to print the Phantom comics in their Sunday supplement named Utsav.

Also in 1939, the Phantom appeared in Turkey as &quot;Kizilmaske&quot;, which translates to &quot;Red Mask&quot; in Turkish, by publishers Tay Yayinlari. Originally, the publishers colored the hero&#x27;s costume in red on the covers, and decided to stay with that color throughout the history of the comic in Turkey, rather than use the original purple coloring. Under the name &quot;Kizilmaske&quot; and with color covers drawn by Turkish artists, older Lee Falk stories of the Phantom has since appeared in Turkish comic books primarily in black and white.

The character&#x27;s image is often painted on ceremonial shields or alongside other tribal art. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;tribal pop art&quot;.

<text>The Treaty of Paris of 1856, signed on 30 March 1856 at the Congress of Paris, brought an end to the Crimean War (1853–1856) between the Russian Empire and an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom, the Second French Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia.

The treaty diminished Russian influence in the region. It returned Sevastopol and other towns and cities in the south of Crimea to Russia, but prohibited Russia to establish naval or military arsenal on the coast of the Black Sea, that was made neutral territory, closing it to all warships and prohibiting fortifications and the presence of armaments on its shores.

The treaty also had Russia return to Moldavia part of its territory it had annexed in 1812 (to the mouth of the Danube, in southern Bessarabia). Russia lost any claim to influence the Danubian principalities and the Principality of Serbia, or to protect Christians in the Ottoman Empire.

==Summary==

The Treaty of Paris was signed on 30 March 1856 at the Congress of Paris with Russia on one side of the negotiating table and France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia on the other side. The treaty came about to resolve the Crimean War, which had begun on 23 October 1853, when the Ottoman Empire formally declared war on Russia after Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities.

The Treaty of Paris was seen as an achievement of the Tanzimat policy of reform. The Western European alliance powers pledged to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and restored the respective territories of the Russian and the Ottoman Empires to their pre-war boundaries. They also demilitarised the Black Sea to improve trade, which greatly weakened Russia&#x27;s influence in the region. Moldavia and Wallachia were recognized as quasi-independent states under Ottoman suzerainty. They gained the left bank of the mouth of the Danube and part of Bessarabia from Russia as a result of the treaty.

==Negotiations==

As the Crimean War ended, all sides of the war wanted to come to a lasting resolution due to the casualties and attrition suffered. However, competing ideas of war resolution inhibited the drafting of a lasting and definitive peace treaty. Even amongst the allies, disagreements between nations concerning the nature of the treaty created an uncertain peace, resulting in further diplomatic issues involving the Ottoman Empire, especially in terms of its relations with the Russian Empire and the Concert of Europe. Also, mistrust between the French and British allies during the war effort compounded problems in formulating a comprehensive peace. Thus, the terms of the treaty made future relations between the major powers uncertain.

==Peace aims==
===Russian aims===
When Alexander II took the crown of Russia in 1855, he inherited all the problems of an empire stretching from parts of Finland to Poland and Crimea, and losing this war. Alexander II pursued peace talks with Britain and France in Paris in 1856, seeking to keep some imperial possessions, to stop the deaths of thousands of its army reserves, and to prevent an economic crisis. Similarly, Russia wanted to maintain at least a pretence of military power, which had posed a formidable threat to the west European allies. It attempted &quot;to turn defeat into victory ... through ... peacetime [internal] reforms and diplomatic initiatives.&quot;

===Britain and France===
During the war Britain and France resumed their latent rivalry, largely derived from the Napoleonic Wars. The French blamed many of the defeats of the alliance on the fact that Britain had marched into war without a clear plan. Defeats including the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava highlighted the logistical and tactical failures of Britain, and spurred calls for increased army professionalism. The British were increasingly wary throughout the war that the French might capitalise on a weakened Russia and focus their attention on seeking revenge on the British for French military defeats at Trafalgar and Waterloo.

Although there was a call for the end of the war in Britain, including riots in London, there was support for its continuation, and expansion to punish Russia&#x27;s imperial ambition, particularly from the incumbent prime minister Lord Palmerston.

Britain and France desired to ensure a stable balance of power in Europe, meaning preventing the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire to get stronger at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. They hoped that peace and restricting Russian access to key areas, such as the Black Sea, would allow the Ottoman Empire to focus on internal issues including rising nationalism in many nations under the empire&#x27;s authority. Thus, the full removal of Russian presence in the Danubian principalities and the Black Sea served both to protect British dominance and to inhibit the Russian Empire from expanding its influence readily.

==Russian losses==
The Ottoman, British and French governments desired a more crushing defeat for Russia, which was still crippled in many key areas. The Russian Empire had lost over 500,000 troops and knew that pressing further militarily with their largely unprofessional army would have resulted in higher casualties and attrition.

Russia had to return to Moldavia part of its territory it had annexed in 1812 (to the mouth of the Danube, in southern Bessarabia). The Danubian principalities and the Principality of Serbia were given greater self-government, resulting in the Russian Empire having a diminished influence over them after the previous period of common tutelage for the Ottomans and the Congress of Great Powers.

Russia was forced to abandon its claim to protect Christians in the Ottoman Empire, which initially served as part of the pretext for the Crimean War.

Russian warships were banned from sailing the Black Sea, which greatly decreased Russian influence over the Black Sea trade.

The defeat accentuated the impediments of the Russian Empire, contributing to future reform including the emancipation of the serfs and the spread of revolutionary ideas.
==Short-term consequences==

The treaty reopened the Black Sea for international trade to be safe and effectual after both the naval warfare of the Crimean War and the presence of Russian warships had made trade difficult, including many trade disputes.

The Treaty of Paris was influenced by the general public in France and Britain because the Crimean War, was one of the first wars in which the general public received relatively prompt media coverage of the events. The British prime minister, Lord Aberdeen, who was viewed as being incompetent to lead the war effort, lost a vote in parliament and resigned in favour of Lord Palmerston, who was seen as having a clearer plan for victory. Peace was accelerated in part because the general population of the western allies had greater access to and understanding of political intrigue and foreign policy, and therefore demanded an end to the war.

==Long-term consequences==

Nationalism was bolstered in many ways by the Crimean War, and very little could be done at a systemic level to stem the tides of growing nationalist sentiment in many nations. The Ottoman Empire, for the next few decades until World War I, had to face a number of patriotic uprisings in many of its provinces. No longer capable of withstanding the internal forces tearing it apart, the empire was splintering, as many ethnic groups cried out for more rights, most notably self-rule. Britain and France may have allowed the situation in Europe to stabilise briefly, but the Peace of Paris did little to create lasting stability in the Concert of Europe. The Ottomans joined the Concert of Europe after the Peace was signed, but most European nations looked to the crumbling empire with either hungry or worried eyes.

The war revealed to the world just how important solving the &quot;Eastern Question&quot; was to the stability of Europe; however, the Peace of Paris provided no clear answer or guidance.

The importance of the Ottoman Empire to Britain and France in maintaining the balance of power in the Black and the Mediterranean Seas made many view the signing of the Treaty of Paris to be the entrance of the Ottoman Empire to the European international theatre. Greater penetration of European influence into Ottoman international law and a decline in emphasis of Islamic practices in their legal system illustrate more of an inclusion of the Ottoman Empire into European politics and disputes, leading to its major role in the First World War.

Simultaneously, defeating the Russian forces led the British Empire to believe that Russia was not as much of a threat as before. Great Britain&#x27;s interest within the region was to curb Russian expansionism and the Ottoman Empire, with their diminished military state, relied on their support for their existence. Surely but slowly, British forces would start to show less of an interest in allying with the Ottoman Empire and maintaining stability in their empire, especially later on during the later Russo-Turkish wars.
Austria and Germany were affected by nationalism as a result of the signing of the Peace of Paris. Austria was normally an ally of Russia but was neutral during the war, mobilized troops against Russia and sent at least an ultimatum asking the withdrawal of Russian armies from the Balkans.

After the Russian defeat, relations between the two nations, the most conservative in Europe, remained very strained. Russia, the gendarme of conservatism and the saviour of Austria during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, angrily resented the failure of Austria to help or assist its former ally, which contributed to Russia&#x27;s non-intervention in the 1859 Franco-Austrian War, ending Austrian influence in Italy; in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, with the loss of its influence over the German Confederation; and in the Ausgleich (compromise) with Hungary of 1867, which meant the sharing of the power in the empire with the Magyars. The status of Austria as a great power, after the unifications of Germany, Italy was now severely diminished. Austria slowly became little more than a German satellite state.

A unified and strengthened Germany was not a pleasant thought for many in Britain and France since it would pose a threat to both French borders and British political and economic interest in the East.

Essentially, the war that sought to stabilise power relations in Europe brought about by a temporary peace. The great powers only strengthened nationalist aspirations of ethnic groups, under the control of the victorious Ottomans and of the German states. By 1877, the Russians and the Ottomans would once again be at war.

==Provisions==

The treaty admitted the Ottoman Empire to the European concert, and the Powers promised to respect its independence and territorial integrity. Russia gave up some and relinquished its claim to a protectorate over the Christians in the Ottoman domains. The Black Sea was demilitarised, and a European commission was set up to guarantee freedom of commerce and navigation on the Danube River.

Moldavia and Wallachia would stay under nominal Ottoman rule but be granted independent constitutions and national assemblies, which were to be monitored by the victorious powers. A project of a referendum was to be set in place to monitor the will of the peoples on unification, which eventually happened on 1859. Moldavia recovered part of Bessarabia (including part of Budjak), which it had held prior to 1812, creating a buffer between the Ottoman Empire and Russia in the west. The United Principalities of Romania, which would later be formed from the two territories, would remain an Ottoman vassal state until 1877.

New rules of wartime commerce were set out in the Declaration of Paris: (1) privateering was illegal; (2) a neutral flag covered enemy goods except contraband; (3) neutral goods, except contraband, were not liable to capture under an enemy flag; (4) a blockade, to be legal, had to be effective.

The treaty also demilitarised the Åland Islands in the Baltic Sea, which belonged to the autonomous Russian Grand Duchy of Finland. The fortress Bomarsund had been destroyed by British and French forces in 1854, and the alliance wanted to prevent its future use as a Russian military base.

==Legacy==
* In 2006, Finland celebrated the 150th anniversary of the demilitarisation of the Åland Islands by issuing a commemorative coin. Its obverse depicts a pine tree, very typical in the Åland Islands, and the reverse features a boat&#x27;s stern and rudder, with a dove perched on the tiller, a symbol of 150 years of peace.

<doc id="191975" wikidata="Q6881495" url="?curid=191975" title="Union Bank of Switzerland">
<text>Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) was a Swiss investment bank and financial services company located in Switzerland. The bank, which at the time was the second largest bank in Switzerland, merged with Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998 to become UBS. This merger formed what was then the largest bank in Europe and the second largest bank in the world.

UBS was formed in 1912 through the merger of the Bank in Winterthur and Toggenburger Bank, both founded in the early 1860s. UBS then continued to grow through acquisitions, including Aargauische Kreditanstalt in 1919, in 1945, Interhandel Basel in 1967, Phillips &amp; Drew in 1986, and Schröder, Münchmeyer, Hengst &amp; Co. in 1997 among others.

The historical UBS logo comprises the initials &quot;UBS&quot; horizontally, crossed by vertical &quot;SBG&quot;, referring to the name of the bank in German. &quot;UBS&quot; ceased to be considered a representational abbreviation for the Union Bank of Switzerland after the bank&#x27;s 1998 merger with Swiss Bank Corporation and is today considered a standalone brand.

==1980–1998==

By the 1980s, the bank had undertaken a major push into the securities business internationally. The bank established a position as a leading European underwriter of Eurobonds and pulled off a major coup in 1985 by pricing a large bond offering for Nestlé, Rockwell, IBM, and Mobil at below market rates.

The bank also made two major acquisitions in 1986, first it purchased Phillips &amp; Drew an established British brokerage and asset management firm, founded in 1895. However, UBS initially had issues integrating Phillips &amp; Drew. The firm lost £15 million when a rush of orders overwhelmed the firm&#x27;s settlement system in 1987. Then the bank lost £48 million as a result of Philips &amp; Drew positions in the October 1987 stock market crash. Between April 1987 and February 1988, UBS was required to spend as much as £115 million to shore up Phillips &amp; Drew. Phillips &amp; Drew unit returned to profitability in 1992 after years of losses. UBS also expanded into West Germany, acquiring Deutsche Länderbank in 1986.

In 1991, UBS made its first acquisition in the United States, purchasing Chase Investors Management Corporation, the asset management business of Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase Investors, which was established in 1972, was subsequently folded into UBS Asset Management after the acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, which resulted in approximately US$100 million for Chase, the business managed in excess of US$30 billion in public and private pension plans, as well as various financial assets of corporations, governments, foundations and endowments.

UBS also entered the life insurance business in 1993 establishing UBS Life. UBS formed a joint venture with Swiss Life in 1995, known as UBS Swiss Life. UBS took a 25% ownership position in Swiss Life in exchange for a 50% share in the joint venture.

UBS entered the 1990s clearly the largest and most conservative of the three large Swiss Banks. Unlike Swiss Bank and Credit Suisse, which had both made aggressive international acquisitions in trading and investment banking, UBS&#x27;s investments had been more conservative in businesses such as asset management and life insurance while 60% of the bank&#x27;s profits came from its even more conservative Swiss banking operations. In 1993, Credit Suisse outbid UBS for Switzerland&#x27;s Swiss Volksbank, the fifth largest bank in Switzerland which had run into financial difficulties in the early 1990s. The acquisition propelled Credit Suisse ahead of UBS as the largest bank in Switzerland for the first time. UBS instead settled on a group of less audacious acquisitions, purchasing a group of smaller banks in Switzerland in 1994 and then acquiring the Cantonal Bank of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden in 1996.

In its final acquisition, prior to the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation, the bank acquired Schröder, Münchmeyer, Hengst &amp; Co. from Lloyds TSB in 1997 in order to further penetrate the German investment banking market as well as the market for wealthy private clients. Schröder Münchmeyer Hengst was formed through the 1969 merger of three German banks: Schroeder Brothers &amp; Co., Muenchmeyer &amp; Co. and Frederick Hengst &amp; Co. (formerly known as Bank Siegmund Merzbach).

==Merger with Swiss Bank Corporation==
During the mid-1990s, UBS came under fire from dissident shareholders, critical of bank&#x27;s relatively conservative management and lower return on equity. Martin Ebner, through his investment trust, BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank&#x27;s operations. The battles between Ebner and UBS management proved a distraction to the bank in the mid-1990s. Looking to take advantage of the situation, Credit Suisse approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996. UBS&#x27;s management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger. Ebner, who supported the idea of a merger, led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS&#x27;s chairman, Robert Studer. Studer&#x27;s successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation.

On 8 December 1997, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation announced an all-stock merger. At the time of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, respectively both trailing Credit Suisse. Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier, less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse&#x27;s merger overtures.

The all-stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG, a huge new bank with total assets of more than US$590 billion. Also referred to as the &quot;New UBS&quot; to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland, the combined bank became the second largest in the world, at that time, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Additionally, the merger pulled together the banks&#x27; various asset management businesses to create the world&#x27;s largest money manager, with approximately US$910 billion in assets under management.

The merger, which was billed as a merger of equals, resulted in UBS&#x27;s shareholders receiving 60% of the combined company and Swiss Bank&#x27;s shareholders receiving the remaining 40% of the bank&#x27;s common shares. UBS&#x27;s Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank while Swiss Bank&#x27;s Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer. However, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was Swiss Bank that was buying UBS as nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals. Additionally, UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions, particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses. The more severe cuts at UBS were an acknowledgment that prior to the merger Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business, Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S.G. Warburg in London. Swiss Bank was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business, particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform. UBS, on the other hand had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in Switzerland and both banks had notably strong asset management capabilities.

After the merger was completed, it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 was a contributing factor in pushing UBS management to consummate the merger. It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by Swiss Bank more readily than they otherwise would have.

==The company==
Prior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS operated as a full-service bank and a provider of wholesale financial services through its retail banking, commercial banking, investment banking, asset management and wealth management businesses. In 1997, prior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS operated 275 branches in Switzerland and 82 branches, subsidiaries and representative offices outside Switzerland. The company had approximately 27,611 employees, of which 19,355 worked in Switzerland and the remaining 8,256 employees were outside Switzerland. The bank had total assets of nearly CHF578 billion and shareholders&#x27; equity of nearly CHF28 billion as of the end of 1997.

==History==

===Origins of the Union Bank of Switzerland===


In 1862, The Bank in Winterthur was founded in Winterthur, Switzerland, with an initial share capital of CHF5 million. The Bank in Winterthur operated primarily as a commercial bank, providing financing for a range of companies and projects. The bank would be involved in funding the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works, the hotel Baur au Lac in Zürich and many other companies. The bank capitalized on its location at an important Swiss railroad junction and its large warehousing facilities allowed the bank to take advantage of the dramatic rise in cotton prices caused by the American Civil War. The Bank in Winterthur saw its share capital double by the end of the war.

Meanwhile, in 1863, the Toggenburger Bank was founded in Lichtensteig, Switzerland with an initial share capital of CHF1.5 million. The Toggenburger Bank was a savings and mortgage bank for individual customers with a branch office network in Eastern Switzerland. In 1882, Toggenburger Bank opened a branch in St. Gallen in eastern Switzerland and began to shift its operations there through the end of the 19th century.


The Union Bank of Switzerland was formed in 1912 when the Bank in Winterthur merged with the Toggenburger Bank. The combined bank had total assets of CHF202 million and a total shareholders&#x27; equity of CHF46 million. This combination was part of a larger trend toward concentration in the banking sector in Switzerland at the time. Through the next few years, the bank would begin to shift its operations to Zürich from its historical headquarters in the cities of Winterthur and St. Gallen, Switzerland. In 1917, UBS completed construction of a new headquarters in Zürich on Bahnhofstrasse, considered to be the Wall Street of Switzerland.

The new bank used different names in its three core languages: German, French and English. In German, the bank was Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft and was known by the initials SBG. The original English name for the combined bank was the Swiss Banking Association, but it was later changed to Union Bank of Switzerland in 1921 to mirror the French form of the name: Union de Banques Suisses. The bank&#x27;s logo, introduced in 1966, would later reflect both the German SBG and the English and French name UBS.

UBS acquired a number of banks in its first decade as a combined bank and expanded its branch network, establishing representation throughout Switzerland by 1923. UBS acquired a controlling interest in Aargauische Creditanstalt in 1913 and Banque Ch. Masson &amp; Cie. in 1916. Although the bank suffered during World War I and the postwar economic crises in Europe, UBS continued to make acquisitions after the conclusion of World War I. The bank purchased the remaining stake in Aargauische Creditanstalt in 1919 that it had not acquired in 1913. Also in 1919, the bank acquired Commandit-AG Weibel &amp; Cie. in Fleurier and William Cuénod &amp; Cie. In 1920, UBS acquired Banca Svizzera-Americana with branches in Locarno and Lugano; Unionbank Geneva and Banque Henry Rieckel &amp; Cie., based in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Three years later, in 1923, UBS acquired the Schweizerische Vereinsbank in Bern establishing representation in the last of the major cities in Switzerland.

Through the Great Depression, UBS pared its assets considerably shrinking from CHF993 million in 1929 to CHF441 million at the end of 1935. The bank saw its shareholders&#x27; capital decline from CHF100 million in 1929 to CHF80 million in 1933 and then further to CHF40 million by 1936. However, the bank continued to acquire smaller, weaker competitors, purchasing Banca Unione di Credito in Lugano and Chiasso in 1935 followed by Berner Handelsbank in Bern in 1938. In 1937, UBS established Intrag AG, an asset management business responsible for investment trusts (i.e., mutual funds) and set up the &quot;America-Canada Trust Fund AMCA&quot;. Over the years, Intrag would set up a series of other funds, including the &quot;Mutual Fund for Swiss Stocks FONSA&quot; and the &quot;South Africa Trust Fund SAFIT&quot;.

The Bank in Winterthur and the Toggenburger Bank merge to form the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft. Its French name is Union de Banques Suisses (UBS) and its Italian name is Unione di Banche Svizzere (UBS). The English name of the bank at first is Swiss Banking Association. In 1921 that somewhat inappropriate name is changed into Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).

The merged bank shows the following figures for 1912:
Total assets: CHF202 million. Shareholders&#x27; Equity: CHF46 million. Profit: CHF2.4 million.

Dr. Rudolf Ernst (1865–1956)

First Chairman of the Board of Directors of the merged bank from 1912 until 1941 is Rudolf Ernst, of Winterthur, until 1921 alternating with C. Emil Grob-Halter of Lichtensteig.

After the merger of the Bank in Winterthur and the Toggenburger Bank to form Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Dr. Rudolf Ernst became the merged bank&#x27;s first chairman in 1912. Following his resignation in 1941, he was elected as an Honorary chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland.

Rudolf Ernst joined the Bank in Winterthur in 1895. He was also financial director of the City of Winterthur for 16 years. At the young age of 36, he was elected in 1901 to the Board of Directors of the Bank in Winterthur and as its chairman at the same time. During his chairmanship, the bank changed its focus from its original lending business and began to expand its issuing and asset management franchise. With the acquisition of the Bank in Baden in 1906, the bank gained a branch in Zürich and a seat on the stock exchange, one of the cornerstones for the successful merger in 1912 with the Toggenburger Bank to form Union Bank of Switzerland. Rudolf Ernst also held directorships on the boards of various industrial and insurance companies. Between 1912 and his retirement in 1941, he was chairman of the Board of Union Bank of Switzerland, in an alternating capacity with Carl Emil Grob-Halter, who held the chairmanship in 1916 and 1918 as the representative of the merger partner Toggenburger Bank.

===Activities in World War II===
On the eve of World War II, UBS was the recipient of a large influx of foreign funds for safekeeping. During the war, the bank&#x27;s traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest clients. Still, unlike many of its peers, UBS&#x27;s business lagged through much of the war.

Decades after the war, it was demonstrated that Union Bank of Switzerland likely took active roles in trading stolen gold, securities and other assets during World War II. The issue of &quot;unclaimed property&quot; of Holocaust victims became a major issue for UBS in the mid-1990s and a series of revelations in 1997 brought the issue to the forefront of national attention in 1996 and 1997. UBS confirmed that a large number of accounts that had gone unclaimed as a result of the bank&#x27;s policy of requiring death certificates from family members to claim the contents of the account. UBS&#x27;s handling of these revelations were largely criticized and the bank received significant negative attention in the U.S. UBS came under significant pressure, particularly from American politicians, to compensate Holocaust survivors who were making claims against the bank.

In January 1997, Christoph Meili, a night watchman at the Union Bank of Switzerland, found employees shredding archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with Nazi Germany. The shredding was in direct violation of a recent Swiss law adopted in December 1996 protecting such material. UBS acknowledged that it had &quot;made a deplorable mistake&quot;, but an internal historian maintained that the destroyed archives were unrelated to the Holocaust. Criminal proceedings then began against the archivist for possible violation of a recent Federal Document Destruction decree and against Meili for possible violation of bank secrecy, which is a criminal offence in Switzerland. Both proceedings were discontinued by the District Attorney in September 1997.

Meili was suspended from his job at the security company that served UBS, following a criminal investigation. Meili and his family left Switzerland for the United States where they were granted political asylum. By contrast, in the U.S., Meili was largely regarded as a hero and whistleblower and received a particularly warm reception from the American Jewish community.

In 1997, the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks (WJC) was launched to retrieve deposits made by victims of Nazi persecution during and prior to World War II. Negotiations involving Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse, the WJC and Stuart Eizenstat, on behalf of the U.S., ultimately resulted in a settlement of US$1.25 billion in August 1998. The settlement, which coincided with UBS&#x27;s merger with Swiss Bank, together with the bank&#x27;s embarrassment in the Long Term Capital Management collapse in 1998 brought a degree of closure to the issue.

===1945–1979===

Shortly after the end of World War II, UBS completed the acquisition of Eidgenössische Bank, a large Zürich-based bank that became insolvent. As a result of the merger, UBS exceeded CHF1 billion of assets for the first time and completed the transition of its operations to Zürich. Although UBS opened an office in New York in 1946, the bank remained primarily focused on its domestic business. Prior to the end of World War II, the Swiss banking landscape was dominated by Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse. UBS was among the next group of large banks that included Schweizerische Volksbank (Swiss Volksbank or Swiss Popular Bank) and Bank Leu. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Union Bank of Switzerland, which was at best the third largest bank in Switzerland would catch up to its larger peers and by the 1970s surpass them in terms of size.

UBS opened branches and acquired a series of banks in Switzerland growing from 31 offices in 1950 to 81 offices by the beginning of the 1960s. Throughout the 1950s, UBS was the most acquisitive bank in Switzerland, acquiring Banque Palézieux &amp; Cie. (1948), Volksbank Interlaken (1952), Weck, Aebi &amp; Cie (1954), Banque Tissières fils &amp; Cie. (1956), Banque de Sion (1956), Banque de Brigue (1957), the Crédit Gruyérien (1957), Crédit Sierrois (1957), Bank Cantrade AG (1960) and Volksbank in Visp (1960).

In addition to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metal refinery founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery changing to Hereaus &amp; Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.

By 1962, UBS reached CHF6.96 billion of assets, narrowly edging ahead of Swiss Bank Corporation to become the largest bank in Switzerland temporarily. Through 1979, SBC was consistently the largest of the three major Swiss banks by assets, except for short periods in 1962 and then again in 1968 when UBS temporarily moved ahead of SBC. After 1979, UBS would firmly establish itself as the largest Swiss bank. UBS would retain this position for the next 15 years until Credit Suisse leapfrogged into the top spot following its 1993 acquisition of Schweizerische Volksbank (Swiss Volksbank) and later Winterthur Group.

UBS continued its rapid growth in the 1960s punctuated by the acquisition of Interhandel (Industrie- und Handelsbeteiligungen AG) in 1967. Interhandel, originally, was a large Swiss conglomerate that up until the 1960s had both financial as well as industrial holdings. Interhandel was the corporate successor of I.G. Chemie, which the U.S. government had claimed was a front for Germany&#x27;s I.G. Farben during World War II. During the war, the U.S. government seized General Aniline &amp; Film (later GAF Corporation), an Interhandel subsidiary, and it was not until 1963 that the long-running dispute between Interhandel and the U.S. government was resolved. The shares in GAF Corporation were sold in a highly competitive auction in 1965 and the proceeds were split between Interhandel and the U.S. government. As a result of the sale of GAF, at the time of its merger with UBS, Interhandel held substantial amounts of cash. The addition of the Interhandel capital, which propelled UBS into the top spot among Swiss banks in 1968, also made UBS one of the strongest banks in Europe and helped fuel the bank&#x27;s further expansion in the late 1960s and 1970s. UBS consolidated four affiliated mortgage lenders and assumed their domestic retail operations. The bank further expanded into consumer lending through the acquisition of a series of Swiss financial businesses in 1969, including Banque Orca, Abri Bank Bern, Aufina Bank and AKO Bank.

UBS also began to intensify its overseas expansion. In 1967, UBS opened a full branch office in London, its first such office outside Switzerland. Prior to this, UBS had operated through a series of correspondent banks and representative offices. Three years later, UBS opened a branch office in New York. The bank also established a UK subsidiary in 1975 and a U.S. subsidiary in 1979 to focus on building the bank&#x27;s presence in the underwriting of debt and equity securities. Nevertheless, UBS, which had traditionally concentrated its efforts on the domestic Swiss market, was the last of the three largest Swiss banks to establish a branch office in the U.S. and its securities operations were overshadowed by those of its two Swiss peers.

===1980–1998===
By the 1980s, the bank had undertaken a major push into the securities business internationally. The bank established a position as a leading European underwriter of Eurobonds and pulled off a major coup in 1985 by pricing a large bond offering for Nestlé, Rockwell, IBM, and Mobil at below market rates.

The bank also made two major acquisitions in 1986, first it purchased Phillips &amp; Drew an established British brokerage and asset management firm, founded in 1895. However, UBS initially had issues integrating Phillips &amp; Drew. The firm lost £15 million when a rush of orders overwhelmed the firm&#x27;s settlement system in 1987. Then the bank lost £48 million as a result of Philips &amp; Drew positions in the October 1987 stock market crash. Between April 1987 and February 1988, UBS was required to spend as much as £115 million to shore up Phillips &amp; Drew. Phillips &amp; Drew unit returned to profitability in 1992 after years of losses. UBS also expanded into West Germany, acquiring Deutsche Länderbank in 1986.

In 1991, UBS made its first acquisition in the United States, purchasing Chase Investors Management Corporation, the asset management business of Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase Investors, which was established in 1972, was subsequently folded into UBS Asset Management after the acquisition. At the time of the acquisition, which resulted in approximately US$100 million for Chase, the business managed in excess of US$30 billion in public and private pension plans, as well as various financial assets of corporations, governments, foundations and endowments.

UBS also entered the life insurance business in 1993 establishing UBS Life. UBS formed a joint venture with Swiss Life in 1995, known as UBS Swiss Life. UBS took a 25% ownership position in Swiss Life in exchange for a 50% share in the joint venture.

UBS entered the 1990s clearly the largest and most conservative of the three large Swiss Banks. Unlike Swiss Bank and Credit Suisse, which had both made aggressive international acquisitions in trading and investment banking, UBS&#x27;s investments had been more conservative in businesses such as asset management and life insurance while 60% of the bank&#x27;s profits came from its even more conservative Swiss banking operations. In 1993, Credit Suisse outbid UBS for Switzerland&#x27;s Swiss Volksbank, the fifth largest bank in Switzerland which had run into financial difficulties in the early 1990s. The acquisition propelled Credit Suisse ahead of UBS as the largest bank in Switzerland for the first time. UBS instead settled on a group of less audacious acquisitions, purchasing a group of smaller banks in Switzerland in 1994 and then acquiring the Cantonal Bank of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden in 1996.

In its final acquisition, prior to the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation, the bank acquired Schröder, Münchmeyer, Hengst &amp; Co. from Lloyds TSB in 1997 in order to further penetrate the German investment banking market as well as the market for wealthy private clients. Schröder Münchmeyer Hengst was formed through the 1969 merger of three German banks: Schroeder Brothers &amp; Co., Muenchmeyer &amp; Co. and Frederick Hengst &amp; Co. (formerly known as Bank Siegmund Merzbach).

===Merger with Swiss Bank Corporation===

During the mid-1990s, UBS came under fire from dissident shareholders, critical of bank&#x27;s relatively conservative management and lower return on equity. Martin Ebner, through his investment trust, BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank&#x27;s operations. The battles between Ebner and UBS management proved a distraction to the bank in the mid-1990s. Looking to take advantage of the situation, Credit Suisse approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996. UBS&#x27;s management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger. Ebner, who supported the idea of a merger, led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS&#x27;s chairman, Robert Studer. Studer&#x27;s successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with Swiss Bank Corporation.

On 8 December 1997, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation announced an all-stock merger. At the time of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland, respectively both trailing Credit Suisse. Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier, less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse&#x27;s merger overtures.

The all-stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG, a huge new bank with total assets of more than US$590 billion. Also referred to as the &quot;New UBS&quot; to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland, the combined bank became the second largest in the world, at that time, behind only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Additionally, the merger pulled together the banks&#x27; various asset management businesses to create the world&#x27;s largest money manager, with approximately US$910 billion in assets under management.

The merger, which was billed as a merger of equals, resulted in UBS&#x27;s shareholders receiving 60% of the combined company and Swiss Bank&#x27;s shareholders receiving the remaining 40% of the bank&#x27;s common shares. UBS&#x27;s Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank while Swiss Bank&#x27;s Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer. However, it quickly became evident that from a management perspective, it was Swiss Bank that was buying UBS as nearly 80% of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals. Additionally, UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions, particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses. The more severe cuts at UBS were an acknowledgment that prior to the merger Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business, Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S.G. Warburg in London. Swiss Bank was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business, particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform. UBS, on the other hand had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in Switzerland and both banks had notably strong asset management capabilities.

After the merger was completed, it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 was a contributing factor in pushing UBS management to consummate the merger. It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by Swiss Bank more readily than they otherwise would have.

===Long-Term Capital Management===

Union Bank of Switzerland, suffering criticism of its conservative business model, was looking for ways to catch up to its key Swiss rivals and viewed LTCM as the type of client that could help accelerate the bank&#x27;s growth. In 1997, UBS entered into a financing arrangement with LTCM and the hedge fund quickly became the bank&#x27;s largest client, generating US$15 million in fees for UBS. Union Bank of Switzerland sold LTCM a 7-year European call option on 1 million shares in LTCM, then valued at about US$800 million. It hedged this option by purchasing a US$800 million interest in LTCM and invested a further US$300 million in the hedge fund. Following the merger, Swiss Bank managers were surprised to discover the massive exposure to LTCM at UBS. Ultimately, UBS was unable to sell or hedge its interest in LTCM as its value declined in the summer of 1998.

By November 1998, UBS&#x27;s losses from its exposure to LTCM were estimated at CHF790 million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF950 million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625 billion by the hedge fund&#x27;s major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300 million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS along with three other executives.

===Acquisition history===
Union Bank of Switzerland, prior to its merger with Swiss Bank Corporation was the result of the combination of dozens of individual firms, many of which date to the 19th century. The following is an illustration of the company&#x27;s major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, although this is not necessarily a comprehensive list:

<text>The North Country Trail (NCT, officially designated the North Country National Scenic Trail) is a long-distance hiking trail in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States. The trail extends roughly from Lake Sakakawea State Park in North Dakota to the Appalachian Trail in Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont, passing through eight states along its route. As of 2023, most of the trail is in place, though about one-third of the distance consists of road walking; those segments are frequently evaluated for transfer to off-road segments on nearby public or private lands.

The trail was designated a National Scenic Trail by the United States Congress in 1980, and became an official unit of the National Park System in 2023. The NCT is administered by the National Park Service, managed by federal, state, and local agencies, and built and maintained primarily by volunteers coordinated by the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and affiliated local organizations.

The North Country Trail is generally limited to hiking, and some areas can support snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Some particular segments allow additional non-motorized uses such as bicycling and horseback riding, but only in areas specifically designed and permitted to withstand such use. The distance of the NCT is estimated and often changes, as volunteers develop new footpath segments and other options to reduce road walking.

==History==
The North Country Trail was proposed on March 5, 1980 via an amendment to the National Trails System Act. That year, a route was established that incorporated many preexisting trails along with plans for building new connecting segments or finding walkable routes on rural roads. In cooperation with local and state hiking organizations, the route of the NCT was superimposed on all of the Superior Hiking Trail in Minnesota, about of the Buckeye Trail in Ohio, and about of the Finger Lakes Trail in New York State. The NCT route also incorporated portions of many other shorter hiking trails and rail trails. In most such cases, the hiker follows signs denoting both the North Country Trail and the original trail. 

Planning and construction of additional off-road segments continues to the present day. The original proposed route of the NCT was from central North Dakota to northeastern New York State; a long-held goal to extend the eastern end of the route to the Appalachian Trail in Vermont commenced in 2017. That extension was approved by Congress in 2019 as part of the omnibus John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, and the extension was completed in 2021. In 2023, the National Park Service recognized the trail as a unit of the National Park System. 

==Route==

The route of the North Country Trail is described here from west to east. Along its total distance, the NCT traverses more than 150 public land units, including parks, forests, scenic attractions, wildlife refuges, game areas, and historic sites. Included at the federal level are ten National Forests. four units of the National Park system, and two National Wildlife Refuges. The trail also visits dozens of state parks, forests, gamelands, and historic areas, and several local/county forests and parks.

=== North Dakota ===
The North Country Trail spends about in North Dakota. The trail begins at Lake Sakakawea State Park in Mercer County and heads generally to the east, soon reaching Audubon National Wildlife Refuge. It walks alongside most of the McClusky Canal and traverses Lone Tree Wildlife Management Area (North Dakota&#x27;s largest). The trail traverses Sheyenne Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Fort Ransom State Park, and Sheyenne National Grassland. Near Abercrombie, the NCT uses a state highway to cross the Red River into Minnesota.

=== Minnesota ===
The North Country Trail spends about in Minnesota; this includes in conjunction with the Superior Hiking Trail. Much of the hike in the western part of the state is on rural roads, with an extended sojourn through Fergus Falls. After that city, the NCT visits many small lakes and passes through Maplewood State Park. Northeast of Frazee, the trail spends more than in a succession of mostly contiguous public lands that include a variety of state and federal parks, forests, and wildlife refuges.

The NCT enjoys a lengthy walk through Grand Rapids, and also visits Hibbing and Virginia in the northeastern part of the state, with a visit to Lake Vermilion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park. The trail later continues on extensive wilderness footpaths for about in Superior National Forest and various tracts of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, just south of the Canadian border, until reaching a junction with the Superior Hiking Trail (SHT). The NCT joins the preexisting SHT for the next 310 miles, heading southwest through more of Superior National Forest and six Minnesota state parks on or near Lake Superior. The NCT/SHT walks for a considerable distance through Duluth and its suburban areas, followed by a walk through Jay Cooke State Park to the Wisconsin border.

=== Wisconsin ===
The North Country Trail spends about in Wisconsin. Shortly after exiting Minnesota, the NCT briefly winds back across the state line for about then remains in Wisconsin. The trail traverses several locally-protected wetland and forest districts, and passes through Pattison State Park followed by Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway. Later there is an extensive hike on wilderness footpaths through Brule River State Forest. The wilderness footpaths continue through Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest, including sojourns through Rainbow Lake Wilderness and Porcupine Lake Wilderness. Near the Michigan border, the NCT briefly encounters the shore of Lake Superior at Saxon Harbor County Park, then joins a rural road to a remote crossing of the Montreal River at the state line.

The North Country Trail spends about in Michigan, and traverses both the Upper and Lower Peninsulas. After crossing the Montreal River out of Wisconsin, the NCT reaches Ottawa National Forest and continues on a lengthy hike along the Black River. The trail briefly encounters Lake Superior at Black River Harbor Recreation Area, then returns to the lake near Manabeznho Falls. The trail turns inland through remote national forest lands for more than , passing Lake of the Clouds. After leaving the national forest, the NCT continues through various locally-protected forest areas and walks through the large and remote Craig Lake State Park.
The NCT walks through Marquette for a considerable distance then reaches Laughing Whitefish Falls State Park. It then hikes about through Hiawatha National Forest, walks through Munising, and then follows the shore of Lake Superior for more than through Pictured Rocks National Seashore. The trail then passes through Grand Marais and walks alongside Lake Superior for about another through local forest districts. The NCT reaches the large and remote Tahquamenon Falls State Park, and then heads into another segment of Hiawatha National Forest and some more waking along the lakeshore. The NCT is in the national forest for more than , heading south to a near-encounter with Lake Michigan and a long walk along Brevoort Lake. The trail walks though St. Ignace and then Straits State Park. The hiker then climbs onto the Mackinac Bridge (I-75) for the crossing of the Straits of Mackinac to Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. This crossing for pedestrians and hikers is only permitted during special &quot;bridge walk&quot; events.

After the bridge, the NCT walks through Mackinaw City and continues through Wilderness State Park and various locally-protected forest districts. The trail encounters Lake Michigan at Petoskey State Park and then walks through the city of Petoskey. The trail continues south through more protected forests and walks through Kalkaska. The NCT next begins a sojourn of about through the Manistee sector of the Huron-Manistee National Forests and reaches the town of Cedar Springs, where it joins the White Pine Trail for about to Rockford. The trail then walks through Lowell and Middleville, where it joins the Paul Henry Trail for about . The NCT continues through Yankee Springs State Recreation Area, followed by Augusta and Fort Custer State Recreation Area, and then heads east through the city of Battle Creek, where it follows parklands along the Kalamazoo River for more than . The trail proceeds through several small towns in Hillsdale County, briefly follows the state line via a farm road just south of Waldron, and then crosses the border into Ohio.

=== Ohio ===
The North Country Trail spends about in Ohio, and about 90% of that distance is via the preexisting Buckeye Trail, which forms a large loop throughout the state. After entering Ohio, the NCT passes through Albion and West Unity, then temporarily joins multiple segments of the Wabash Cannonball Trail through Wauseon, Whitehouse, and Waterville. At the latter town, the NCT joins the route of the Buckeye Trail, and the two trails share the same path for more than ahead. In this area, the combined trail loosely follows the Maumee River and passes through Napoleon and Defiance. The trail continues to the south to Delphos, where it joins the Miami-Erie Canal Walkway to Spencerville in Allen County.

Still heading south, the trail walks through St. Marys, follows a long stretch of the former Miami and Erie Canal, and passes through Lake Loramie State Park. The trail walks through Piqua and then follows parklands alongside the Great Miami River, with walks through several small towns. The hiker then proceeds through extensive urban areas in Dayton, the biggest city to be found on the North Country Trail. The trail then walks through Yellow Springs and Xenia, after which it joins the paved Little Miami Scenic Trail for several dozen miles into the northeastern suburbs of the Cincinnati metro area. At Milford, the NCT switches to suburban streets and rural roads though various undeveloped districts, reaching East Fork State Park. Now heading east through southern Ohio, the trail follows a variety of rural roads interspersed with extended hikes through Shawnee State Park, two sectors of Wayne National Forest, and Wolf Run State Park.

Now trending to the north, the NCT walks alongside Senecaville Lake and then enjoys a lengthy hike through Salt Fork State Park. This is followed by rural road walking with visits to several lakes and reservoirs in east-central Ohio. At Zoar in Tuscarawas County, the North County Trail and Buckeye Trail finally separate after more than 900 miles together. The NCT uses rural roads through Waynesburg, Malvern, and Hanoverton. utilizing occasional local parklands and wilderness preserves. The NCT then reaches the Pennsylvania state line via a rural road to the north of Ohioville.

The North Country Trail spends about in Pennsylvania. After exiting Ohio, the NCT follows footpaths through state game lands and then walks through Darlington and Wampum. Next is McConnells Mill State Park, where the NCT joins the preexisting Slippery Rock Gorge Trail, followed by Moraine State Park, where it joins the preexisting Glacier Ridge Trail for about the next to Jennings Environmental Education Center. Following rural roads, the NCT next walks through Parker and then joins the Allegheny River Trail to follow that river to the north for about the next , traversing Foxburg, Emlenton, and three former railroad tunnels. The NCT then switches to an intersecting rail trail, the Sandy Creek Trail, followed by the Clarion Highlands Trail. After hiking through some more state game lands, the trail reaches Clear Creek State Forest where extended footpaths loosely follow the Clarion River. The NCT then reaches a junction with the preexisting Baker Trail, and the two trails follow the same path for about the next .

The NCT continues north through Cook Forest State Park, followed by additional state forest and game land districts. The trail crosses into Allegheny National Forest, through which it will hike for about the next about the next . Along the way, it briefly follows the same path as the popular Minister Creek Trail, and crosses the southeastern arm of the Allegheny Reservoir on a road bridge at Red Bridge Recreation Area. Near the New York Border, the NCT enters the northern segment of Allegheny National Recreation Area and uses a portion of the Tracy Ridge Hiking Trail System to walk alongside the reservoir for an extended distance. The NCT then reaches the New York border and continues as a footpath into Allegany State Park.

=== New York ===
The North Country Trail spends about in New York State. Upon leaving Pennsylvania and entering Allegany State Park, the NCT joins the preexisting Finger Lakes Trail, and the two trails follow the same path for about the next . North of the state park, the trail utilizes a combination of rural roads and footpaths through undeveloped areas in southwestern New York, and uses a drainage tunnel under I-86 near Almond Lake. The NCT continues in like fashion into the region south of the Finger Lakes, with a walk through downtown Watkins Glen and around the southern end of Seneca Lake. The trail continues through numerous state forest and wildlife management districts in the region south of Ithaca.

At Tioughnioga Wildlife Management Area in Madison County, the NCT and the Finger Lakes Trail finally separate, with the NCT continuing north via rural roads though Cazenovia and Canastota. Now trending to the east, the trail utilizes towpaths associated with the Erie Canal for several miles and then walks through Rome, with a visit to Fort Stanwix National Monument. After an extended distance on rural roads to Herkimer County, the trail enters Adirondack Park. The NCT spends about the next in Adirondack Park, largely via wilderness footpaths in the western districts of the park and then remote forest roads in the eastern districts. In this region, the North Country Trail Association plans to build footpaths through nearby wilderness areas. The NCT reaches the shore of Lake Champlain and then walks through Crown Point State Historic Park. The trail joins NY 185 for a half-mile-long bridge over the lake and into Vermont.

=== Vermont ===
The North Country Trail spends about miles in Vermont. After the bridge over Lake Champlain, the NCT briefly follows VT 17 and VT 125 through Chimney Point State Park and two wildlife management areas. The trail uses a series of rural roads to the east, walking through Middlebury and East Middlebury. The trail then enters Mooselamoo National Recreation Area and Green Mountain National Forest, following wilderness footpaths to the south and southeast. In the national forest, the NCT joins the preexisting Long Trail and the two trails follow the same path for the next 23 miles. At Blue Ridge Mountain in eastern Rutland County, the North Country Trail ends at the Maine Junction intersection with the Appalachian Trail.

<text>The Buckeye Trail is a hiking trail and long-distance trail that loops around the state of Ohio. Part of it is on roads and part is on wooded trail. Road portions of the trail are gradually being relocated to separate trail.

This trail passes through many of the most scenic locations in the state, such as the Hocking Hills region and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. It also goes through many small towns in Ohio, making this trail both an outdoor as well as a history experience.

The trail&#x27;s northern terminus is on Lake Erie in Headlands Beach State Park east of Cleveland. From the northern terminus, one branch leads south down the eastern edge of the state while another leads west across the north towards Toledo.

The two branches rejoin in southwestern Ohio in the city of Milford, where a single branch continues southwest to Eden Park in Cincinnati, the southern terminus.

Major portions of the trail follow the old canal routes including the Miami and Erie Canal and the Wabash and Erie Canal in the West and the Ohio and Erie Canal in the East. 

The North Country Trail coincides with the Buckeye Trail for a large part of its route, and the American Discovery Trail also coincides with it through southern Ohio.

The Buckeye Trail Association, a non-profit volunteer organization, maintains and develops the trail. The trail is identified by blue blazes, , on trees or poles. A single blaze marks the trail where the route is fairly straight or obvious, while a double blaze marks a turn with the upper blaze offset to indicate the new direction. A double blaze with no offset simply means pay attention - the trail route may not be obvious.

<text>William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Company (also known as William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company) was an American shipbuilding company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1830 by William Cramp. During its heyday in late 19th century, it was the preeminent American iron shipbuilder. 

==Company history==
William Cramp was born in the Kensington district of Philadelphia in 1807. In 1855, his sons Charles Henry (born 1828) and William C., became partners with their father. In 1872, his other sons Samuel H., Jacob C., and Theodore were taken into the firm. The company was incorporated under the name &quot;The William Cramp and Sons&#x27; Iron Shipbuilding and Engineering Company.&quot;

The pilot boat &quot;Thomas Howard&quot; was built by the Cramp shipyard in 1870 for the Delaware Bay &amp; River pilots. She was one of the Philadelphia port&#x27;s fastest pilot boats.

In 1890 the company built the battleships USS &quot;Indiana&quot; and USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, armored cruiser USS &quot;New York&quot;, and protected cruiser USS &quot;Columbia&quot;. Three of these ships took a part in the defeat of the Spanish fleet in 1898 at Santiago de Cuba. The victory in this battle heralded America&#x27;s emergence as a great power. In 1896 Cramps united their artillery arm, the Driggs-Schroeder Ordnance Company, with its main competitor Hotchkiss Gun Company and a projectile manufacturer from Massachusetts into American Ordnance Company. The American Shipping and Commercial Corporation bought the yard in 1919 but closed it in 1927 as fewer ships were ordered by the U.S. Navy after the adoption of the Naval Limitations Treaty in 1923.
In 1940, the Navy spent $22 million to reopen the yard as Cramp Shipbuilding to build cruisers and submarines. Cramp used the long slipways to construct two submarines at a time, with the intention of launching them simultaneously. However, the shipyard&#x27;s submarine construction program was not especially successful, as poor management hindered the delivery of the boats. The first delivery was made two years after keel laying, and fitting out was then done by Portsmouth Navy Yard. The best construction time for a submarine was 644 days.

Cramp closed in 1947 and the site, on the Delaware River in Philadelphia&#x27;s Port Richmond neighborhood, was turned into a residential estate in early 2020s.
