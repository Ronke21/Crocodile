<text>Alzey-Worms () is a district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the district Groß-Gerau (Hesse), the city of Worms and the districts of Bad Dürkheim, Donnersbergkreis, Bad Kreuznach and Mainz-Bingen.

== History ==

The territory was in Roman times part of the province of Germania Superior. The towns of Worms and Alzey go both back to Roman military camps. In medieval times the region was part of the Electorate of the Palatinate. After the French occupation (1797–1814) it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Hesse and formed a part of its province Rhenish Hesse.

Two districts named Alzey and Worms were established in 1835. In the reorganisation of the districts of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969 the new district of Alzey-Worms was formed by merging parts of the former districts.

== Geography ==

The district is named after the city of Worms (which is neighboring, but not belonging to the district) and the town of Alzey (which is the seat of the district). The Rhine forms the eastern boundary. From there the land gently rises to the Alzey Hills in the west, which is the northernmost extension of the Palatinate Forest. The westernmost portion of the district is crossed by several brooks and covered with forests; it is called the &quot;Rheinhessische Schweiz&quot; (Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland).

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays a dragon and the fiddle. The dragon is the heraldic symbol of the city of Worms, while the fiddle stands for Alzey. Both themes occur in the Nibelungenlied, the old German epos playing in the region. The hero Siegfried killed Fafnir the dragon and gained wisdom from drinking its blood. The fiddle belongs to Volker the minstrel, another character of the Nibelungenlied, who allegedly had lived in Alzey.

<doc id="193080" wikidata="Q431731" url="?curid=193080" title="Tanganyika (1961–1964)">
<text>Tanganyika ( ) was a sovereign state, comprising the mainland part of present-day Tanzania, that existed from 1961 until 1964. It first gained independence from the United Kingdom on 9 December 1961 as a Commonwealth realm headed by Queen Elizabeth II before becoming a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations a year later. After signing the Articles of Union on 22 April 1964 and passing an Act of Union on 25 April, Tanganyika officially joined with the People&#x27;s Republic of Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar on Union Day, 26 April 1964. The new state changed its name to the United Republic of Tanzania within a year.

==History==
Tanganyika originally consisted of the Tanganyika Territory—the British share of German East Africa—which the British took under a League of Nations mandate in 1922, and which was later transformed into a United Nations Trust Territory after World War II. The next largest share of German East Africa was taken into Belgian trusteeship, eventually becoming present-day Burundi and Rwanda.
The (10 &amp; 11 Eliz. 2. c. 1) transformed the United Nations trust territory into the independent sovereign state of Tanganyika, with Elizabeth II as Queen of Tanganyika. The monarch&#x27;s constitutional roles were mostly exercised by the Governor-General of Tanganyika.

Tanganyika adopted a new constitution in 1962 that abolished the monarchy, and the National Assembly (the majority of whom were members of the Tanganyika African National Union Party) thoroughly revised the new constitution to favour a strong executive branch of government, namely a president. Tanganyika then became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, with Julius Nyerere as the President of Tanganyika. After the Union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika, an interim constitution adapted from the 1962 Constitution became the governing document. Although meant to be temporary, the constitutions remained effective until 1977.

The unification of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964 followed Nyerere&#x27;s principle of &quot;Ujamaa&quot; which entailed a strong &quot;territorial nationalism.&quot;

<text>The State Heraldic Museum in Kildare Street, Dublin, was founded in 1909 and was, prior to its closure in 2007, one of the oldest such museums in the world. Up to 2007, it was housed in part of the building occupied by the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland, in the former Coffee Room of the Kildare Street Club.

Among its exhibits were representations of corporate and civic arms and the heraldic banners of the Chiefs of the Name. It also displayed arms of Ireland which once hung in the Houses of Parliament in College Green, a police notice on information on the 1907 theft of the Irish crown jewels, the funeral hatchment of Daniel O&#x27;Connell used on his hearse, the Irish Lord Chancellor&#x27;s purse, and other items showing the use of heraldry.

The heraldic exhibition items were reportedly due to be moved &quot;before the end of 2007&quot; to make way for a replacement exhibition marking the 400th anniversary of the Flight of the Earls.

<doc id="193089" wikidata="Q137739" url="?curid=193089" title="George Antheil">
<text>George Johann Carl Antheil ( ; July 8, 1900 – February 12, 1959) was an American avant-garde composer, pianist, author, and inventor whose modernist musical compositions explored the sounds – musical, industrial, and mechanical – of the early 20th century. Spending much of the 1920s in Europe, Antheil returned to the United States in the 1930s, and thereafter composed music for films, and eventually, television. As a result of this work, his style became more tonal. A man of diverse interests and talents, Antheil was constantly reinventing himself. He wrote magazine articles, an autobiography, a mystery novel, and newspaper and music columns.

In 1941, Antheil and the actress Hedy Lamarr developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes that used a code (stored on a punched paper tape) to synchronize frequency changes, referred to as frequency hopping, between the transmitter and receiver. It is one of the spread spectrum techniques that became widely used in modern telecommunications. This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Antheil was born George Johann Carl Antheil, and grew up in a family of German immigrants in Trenton, New Jersey. His father owned a shoe store. Antheil got his education in the Trenton public schools. He was raised bilingually, writing music, prose, and poetry from an early age, and never formally graduated from high school or college, flunking out of Trenton Central High School in 1918. According to Antheil&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Bad Boy of Music&quot; (1945), he was &quot;so crazy about music&quot;, that his mother sent him to the countryside where no pianos were available. Undeterred, George simply arranged for a local music store to deliver a piano. His somewhat unreliable memoir mythologized his origins as a futurist, and emphasized his upbringing near a noisy machine shop and an ominous prison. George&#x27;s younger brother was Henry W. Antheil Jr.; he became a diplomatic courier and died on June 14, 1940, when his plane was shot down over the Baltic Sea.

Antheil started studying the piano at the age of six. In 1916, he traveled regularly to Philadelphia to study under Constantine von Sternberg, a former pupil of Franz Liszt. From Sternberg, he received formal composition training in the European tradition, but his trips to the city also exposed him to conceptual art, including Dadaism. In 1919, he began to work with the more progressive Ernest Bloch in New York. Initially, Bloch had been skeptical and had rejected him, describing Antheil&#x27;s compositions as &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;pretentious&quot;; however, the teacher was won over by Antheil&#x27;s enthusiasm and energy, and helped him financially as he attempted to complete an aborted first symphony. Antheil&#x27;s trips to New York also permitted him to meet important figures of the modernist movement, including the musician Leo Ornstein, journalist and music critic Paul Rosenfeld, painter John Marin, photographer Alfred Stieglitz, and Margaret Anderson, editor of &quot;The Little Review&quot;.

At age 19, Antheil was invited to spend the weekend with Anderson and a group of friends; he stayed six months, and the close-knit group, who included Georgette Leblanc, former companion of Maurice Maeterlinck, were to become influential in Antheil&#x27;s career. Anderson described Antheil as short with an oddly shaped nose, who played &quot;a compelling mechanical music&quot;, and used &quot;the piano exclusively as an instrument of percussion, making it sound like a xylophone or a cymballo&quot;. Intensely engaged in his music, during this period, Antheil worked on songs, a piano concerto, and a work that came to be known as &quot;The Mechanisms&quot;.

Around this time, von Sternberg introduced Antheil to his patron of the next two decades: Mary Louise Curtis Bok, later the founder of the Curtis Institute of Music. Assured by von Sternberg of Antheil&#x27;s genius and good character, Bok gave him a monthly stipend of $150, and arranged for him to study at the Philadelphia Settlement Music School. Though she came to disapprove of his behavior and his work, for the next 20 years, she continued to respond favorably to his letters. As her financial support enabled Antheil to maintain a degree of independence in his work, many observers believed he should have given her more credit in his autobiography for the length and extent of her contribution to his career.

Antheil continued his piano studies, and the study of modernist compositions, such as those by Igor Stravinsky and members of the Les Six group of French composers. In 1921, he wrote his first in a series of technology-based works, the solo piano &quot;Second Sonata, &quot;The Airplane&quot;&quot;. Other works in the group included the &quot;Sonata Sauvage&quot; (1922–23) and subsequently &quot;Third Sonata, &quot;Death of Machines&quot;&quot; (1923), &quot;Mechanisms&quot; (), both composed in Europe. He also worked on his first symphony, managing to attract Leopold Stokowski to premiere it. Before the performance could take place, Antheil left for Europe to pursue his career. This may have diminished his chances for success in his native country.

==Berlin and Paris==

On May 30, 1922, at the age of 21, Antheil sailed for Europe to make his name as &quot;a new ultra-modern pianist composer&quot; and a &quot;futurist terrible&quot;. He had engaged Leo Ornstein&#x27;s manager, and opened his European career with a concert at Wigmore Hall. The concert featured works by Claude Debussy and Stravinsky, as well as his own compositions.

He spent a year in Berlin, planning to work with Artur Schnabel, and gave concerts in Budapest, Vienna, and at the Donaueschingen Festival. As he had desired, he achieved notoriety, but often had to pay the concert expenses out of his own pocket. His financial situation was not helped by Mrs. Bok&#x27;s reduction of his stipend by half, though she often responded to requests to fund specific aspects of his concerts. He met Boski Markus, a Hungarian and niece of the Austrian playwright Arthur Schnitzler, who became his companion and whom he married in 1925.

In the fall of 1922, Antheil took advantage of a chance meeting to introduce himself to his idol Stravinsky in Berlin. They established a warm intimacy and the more established composer encouraged Antheil to move to Paris. He went as far as arranging a concert to launch Antheil&#x27;s career in the French capital, but the younger man failed to show up, preferring to travel to Poland with Markus. The Antheils finally arrived in Paris in June 1923, in time to attend the premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Les Noces&quot;, but the relationship with Stravinsky did not survive for long. Stravinsky snubbed the younger man, having discovered that Antheil had boasted that &quot;Stravinsky admired his work&quot;. The breach devastated Antheil, and was not ultimately repaired until 1941, when Stravinsky sent the family tickets to a concert he was giving in Hollywood.

Despite the inauspicious beginning, Antheil found Paris, at the time, a center of musical and artistic innovation, to be a &quot;green tender morning&quot; compared to the &quot;black night&quot; of Berlin.
The couple lived in a one bedroom apartment above Sylvia Beach&#x27;s bookshop Shakespeare and Company. Beach described him &quot;as fellow with bangs, a squished nose and a big mouth with a grin in it. A regular American high school boy.&quot; She was very supportive, and introduced Antheil to her circle of friends and customers including Erik Satie, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Virgil Thomson, and Ernest Hemingway. Joyce and Pound were soon talking of an opera collaboration. Pound, in particular, was to become an extravagant supporter and promoter of Antheil and his work, comparing him variously to Stravinsky and James Cagney, and describing him as breaking down music to its &quot;musical atom&quot;. Pound introduced Antheil to Jean Cocteau, who in turn helped launch Antheil into the musical salons of Paris; Pound also commissioned Antheil to write three violin sonatas for his mistress, Olga Rudge. In 1924, Pound published &quot;Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony&quot;, as part of his campaign to boost Antheil&#x27;s reputation. The book may have done Antheil more harm than good, and the composer was to distance himself from it in his memoir. Natalie Barney helped produce some original works, including the First String Quartet in 1925.

Antheil was asked to make his Paris debut at the opening of the Ballets suédois, an important Paris social event. He programmed several recent compositions, including the &quot;Airplane Sonata&quot;, the &quot;Sonata Sauvage&quot;, and &quot;Mechanism&quot;. Halfway through his performance, a riot broke out, much to Antheil&#x27;s delight. According to Antheil, &quot;People were fighting in the aisles, yelling, clapping, hooting! Pandemonium! ... the police entered, and any number of surrealists, society personages, and people of all descriptions were arrested ... Paris hadn&#x27;t had such a good time since the premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Sacre du Printemps&quot;.&quot; The riot was filmed and may in fact have been engineered, as the Marcel L&#x27;Herbier movie &quot;L&#x27;Inhumaine&quot; needed a riot scene set in a concert hall. In the audience were Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, Man Ray, Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau, and Francis Picabia. Antheil was delighted when Satie and Milhaud praised his music.

Reactions to his first performances were cool at best. His technique was loud, brazen, and percussive. Critics wrote that he hit the piano rather than played it, and indeed he often injured himself by doing so. As part of his &quot;bad boy&quot; behavior, Antheil provocatively pulled a revolver from his jacket and laid it on the piano.

==&quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; and later work in Europe==
Antheil&#x27;s best-known composition is &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot;. The &quot;ballet&quot; was originally conceived to be accompanied by the film of the same name by experimental filmmakers Fernand Léger and Dudley Murphy (with cinematography by Man Ray), although the nature of the collaboration is mysterious. The first productions of Antheil&#x27;s work in 1925 and 1926 did not include the film, which turned out to last around 19 minutes, only half as long as Antheil&#x27;s score.

Antheil described his &quot;first big work&quot; as &quot;scored for countless numbers of player pianos. All percussive. Like machines. All efficiency. No LOVE. Written without sympathy. Written cold as an army operates. Revolutionary as nothing has been revolutionary.&quot; Antheil&#x27;s original conception was scored for 16 specially synchronized player pianos, two grand pianos, electronic bells, xylophones, bass drums, a siren and three airplane propellers, but difficulties with the synchronization resulted in a rewrite for a single pianola and multiple human pianists. The piece consisted of periods of music and interludes of silence set against the roar of the airplane propellers. Antheil described as &quot;by far my most radical work ... It is the rhythm of machinery, presented as beautifully as an artist knows how.&quot; The Léger-Murphy film and Antheil&#x27;s score were finally performed together at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1935.

Antheil assiduously promoted the work, and even engineered his supposed &quot;disappearance&quot; while on a visit to Africa, so as to get media attention for a preview concert. The Paris première in June 1926 was sponsored by an American patroness who at the end of the concert was (according to Antheil) &quot;tossed in a blanket by three baronesses and a duke.&quot; At the official première at the Théâtre du Champs Elysées, Antheil&#x27;s music enraged some of the concert-goers, whose objections were drowned out by the cacophonous music, while others vocally supported the work, and the concert ended with a riot in the streets.
On April 10, 1927, Antheil rented New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall to present an entire concert devoted to his works, including the American debut of &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; in a scaled-down version. He commissioned elaborate backdrops of skyscrapers and machines, and engaged an African American orchestra to premiere his &quot;A Jazz Symphony&quot;. The concert started well, but according to the concert&#x27;s promoter and producer, when the wind machine was turned on, &quot;all hell, in a minor way, broke loose.&quot; During the gale, audience members clutched their programs and their hats, one &quot;tied a handkerchief to his cane and waved it wildly in the air in a sign of surrender.&quot; Much to the amusement of the audience, the untested siren failed to sound on cue, despite frantic cranking and reached its climax only after the end of the performance, as the audience was clapping and leaving the hall. American critics were hostile, calling the concert &quot;a bitter disappointment&quot; and dismissing the &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; as &quot;boring, artless, and naive&quot; and Antheil&#x27;s hoped-for riots failed to materialize. The failure of the &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; affected him deeply, and he never fully recovered his reputation during his lifetime, though his interest in the mechanical was emulated by other prominent composers such as Arthur Honegger, Sergei Prokofiev, and Erik Satie. In 1954, Antheil created a modified version of the work for percussion, four pianos, and a recording of an airplane motor.

In the late 1920s, Antheil moved to Germany, where he worked as assistant musical director of the municipal theatre in Berlin, and wrote music for the ballet and theatre. In 1930, he premiered his first opera &quot;Transatlantic&quot;. This work, which involved American politics, gangsters, a bathtub scene and a Childs Restaurant was a success at the Frankfurt Opera. In 1933, the rise of the Nazi party made Antheil&#x27;s &quot;avant garde&quot; music unwelcome in Germany, and in the depths of the Depression, he returned to the US and settled in New York City.

He re-entered American life with enthusiasm, organizing concerts, working on committees with Aaron Copland and Wallingford Riegger, and writing piano, ballet, and film scores, as well as an opera &quot;Helen Retires&quot; about Helen of Troy; the latter proved a flop. His music had moved away from more extreme aspects of modernism, and more tonal, neoromantic aspects were by now discernible in his work.

==Hollywood==
In 1936, Antheil travelled to Hollywood, where he became a sought-after film composer, writing more than 30 scores for such directors as Cecil B. DeMille and Nicholas Ray, including &quot;The Scoundrel&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Plainsman&quot; (1936). The Antheils&#x27; only child, a son named Peter, was born in 1937. Antheil found the industry hostile to modern music, complaining that it was a &quot;closed proposition&quot;, and describing most background scores as &quot;unmitigated tripe&quot;. He became increasingly dependent on more independent producers such as Ben Hecht to give him work, such as &quot;Angels Over Broadway&quot; (1940) and &quot;Specter of the Rose&quot; (1946). He also wrote the score for the independent film &quot;Dementia&quot; (1955) and &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950) starring Humphrey Bogart. Antheil was confident in the ability of his music to save a weak film. &quot;If I say so myself, I&#x27;ve saved a couple of sure flops&quot;.

Besides writing scores for movies, he continued to compose other music, including for ballet and six symphonies; his later works were in a more romantic style and influenced by Prokofiev and Shostakovich, as well as American music including jazz. Works such as Serenade No. 1, Piano Sonata No. 4, &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; and &quot;Eight Fragments from Shelley&quot;, written in 1948 showed a self-described desire &quot;to disassociate myself from the passé modern schools of the last half-century, and to create a music for myself and those around me which has no fear of developed melody, real development itself, tonality, or other understandable forms.&quot; His 1953 opera &quot;Volpone&quot; was premiered in New York in 1953 to mixed reviews, while a visit to Spain in the 1950s influenced some of his last works, including the film score for &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957). He also accepted a commission from the CBS Television network to compose a theme for their newsreel and documentary film series &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot; (1957–1966), narrated by Walter Cronkite.

==Other interests==
Apart from music, Antheil had many other pursuits. In 1930, as Stacey Bishop, he wrote a murder mystery called &quot;Death in the Dark&quot; with a character based on Ezra Pound. He was the film music reporter and critic for the magazine &quot;Modern Music&quot; from 1936 to 1940, writing columns considered lively and thoughtful, noting the comings and goings of musicians and composers during an era when the industry was flirting with more &quot;modern&quot; scores for films. He was disappointed, however, and wrote that &quot;Hollywood, after a grand splurge with new composers and new ideas, has settled back into its old grind of producing easy and sure-fire scores.&quot;

Before World War II, he participated in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, putting on exhibits of artworks banned in Nazi Germany such as those by Käthe Kollwitz. He also published a book of war predictions, entitled &quot;The Shape of the War to Come&quot;.

In 1945, he published a memoir called &quot;Bad Boy of Music&quot;, which became a bestseller.

Antheil wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper relationship advice column, as well as regular columns in magazines such as &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Coronet&quot;. He considered himself an expert on female endocrinology, and wrote a series of articles about how to determine the availability of women based on glandular effects on their appearance, with titles such as &quot;The Glandbook for the Questing Male&quot;. Another book of &quot;glandular criminology&quot; was titled &quot;Every Man His Own Detective&quot;.

Antheil&#x27;s interest in this area brought him into contact with the actress Hedy Lamarr, who sought his advice about how she might enhance her upper torso. He suggested glandular extracts, but their conversation then moved to torpedoes.

==Frequency-hopping radio invention==
During World War II, Lamarr realized that a single radio-controlled torpedo could severely damage or sink enemy ships causing irreparable damage. However these radio-controlled torpedoes could easily be detected and jammed, by broadcasting interference at the frequency of the control signal, thereby causing the torpedo to go off course.

Antheil and Lamarr developed the idea of using frequency hopping: in this case using a player piano roll to randomly change the signal sent between the control center and torpedo at short bursts within a range of 88 frequencies on the spectrum (88 black and white keys are on a piano keyboard). The specific code for the sequence of frequencies would be held identically by the controlling ship and in the torpedo. This basically encrypted the signal, as it was impossible for the enemy to scan and jam all 88 frequencies because this would have required too much power. Antheil would control the frequency-hopping sequence using a player-piano mechanism, which he had earlier used to score his &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot;.

On August 11, 1942, was granted to Antheil and &quot;Hedy Kiesler Markey&quot;, Lamarr&#x27;s married name at the time. This early version of frequency hopping, though novel, soon met with opposition from the U.S. Navy and was not adopted.

The idea was not implemented in the US until 1962, when it was used by U.S. military ships during a blockade of Cuba after the patent had expired. The patent was little known until 1997, when the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave Lamarr a belated award for her contributions. In 1998, an Ottawa wireless technology developer, Wi-LAN, acquired a 49% claim to the long expired patent from Lamarr for an undisclosed amount of stock. Lamarr and Antheil&#x27;s frequency-hopping scheme shares some concepts with modern spread-spectrum communication technology, such as Bluetooth, COFDM used in Wi-Fi network connections, and CDMA used in some cordless and wireless telephones. Blackwell, Martin, and Vernam&#x27;s 1920 Secrecy Communication System () was a predecessor to Kiesler and Antheil&#x27;s patent, which employed the techniques in the autonomous control of torpedoes.

==Later life==
Antheil died of a heart attack in the New York City borough of Manhattan. His legacy included three accomplished students, Henry Brant, Benjamin Lees, and Ruth White. He is buried in Riverview Cemetery, in Trenton, New Jersey.

==In literature==
&quot;Antheil&#x27;s my man.&quot; Mrs. McKisco turned challengingly to Rosemary, &quot;Antheil and Joyce. I don&#x27;t suppose you ever hear much about those sort of people in Hollywood, but my husband wrote the first criticism of &quot;Ulysses&quot; that ever appeared in America.&quot; (F. Scott Fitzgerald, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;)

<text>HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; was a light cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was the lead ship of the five in her sub-class and was completed in late 1910. The ship spent part of her early career in reserve before she was transferred to the 4th Cruiser Squadron (4th CS) of the North America and West Indies Station in mid-1914. &quot;Bristol&quot; was briefly deployed to Mexico during the Mexican Revolution to protect British interests there.

The ship was tasked to protect Allied shipping off the coasts of North and South America from German commerce raiders after World War I began in August 1914. She briefly encountered a German light cruiser in the West Indies a few days after the war began, but the battle was inconclusive. A few months later, &quot;Bristol&quot; played a minor role in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December by sinking some of the colliers belonging to the German East Asia Squadron. After a lengthy refit in mid-1915, the ship was transferred to the Adriatic Force, where she participated in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in 1917. &quot;Bristol&quot; returned to her former task of patrolling off the east coast of South America, after a brief time escorting convoys off West Africa in early 1918, and continued to do so after the end of the war. She was placed in reserve in mid-1919, listed for sale in 1920 and was sold for scrap in 1921.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Bristol&quot; sub-class was intended for a variety of roles including both trade protection and duties with the fleet. They were long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and at full load. Twelve Yarrow boilers fed &quot;Bristol&quot;″s Brown-Curtis steam turbines, driving two propeller shafts, that were rated at for a design speed of . The ship reached during her sea trials from . The ship&#x27;s experimental two-shaft layout was very successful, giving greater efficiency, especially at lower speeds, than the four-shaft arrangement of her sister ships. The boilers used both fuel oil and coal, with of coal and tons of oil carried, which gave a range of at . In 1912 &quot;Bristol&quot; became the first warship to run on superheated steam from her twelve boilers, enabling even greater speeds as well as fuel economies.

The main armament of the &quot;Bristol&quot; class was two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.

The &quot;Bristol&quot;s were considered protected cruisers, with an armoured deck providing protection for the ships&#x27; vitals. The armoured deck was thick over the magazines and machinery, over the steering gear and elsewhere. The conning tower was protected by of armour, with the gun shields having armour, as did the ammunition hoists. As the protective deck was at waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly making them poor gun platforms. One problem with the armour of the &quot;Bristol&quot;s which was shared with the other Town-class ships was the sizeable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap, giving large numbers of leg injuries in the ships&#x27; gun crews.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bristol&quot;, the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was named after the eponymous city. She was laid down on 23 March 1909 at John Brown &amp; Company&#x27;s Clydebank shipyard, launched on 23 February 1910 and completed on 17 December 1910. As of 18 February 1913, the ship was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron of the reserve Second Fleet at Devonport. On 1 July, &quot;Bristol&quot; was transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Second Fleet. Almost six months later, some of her crewmen helped to put out a fire in Portsmouth Dockyard on 20 December; two men were killed fighting the fire.

On 18 May 1914, the ship was reassigned to the 4th CS of the North America and West Indies Station and sailed that day to join the squadron. She arrived at Jamaica on the 31st and was ordered to depart for Mexico after recoaling to protect British interests during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. &quot;Bristol&quot; spent most of June in Tampico, but sailed for Veracruz at the end of the month where Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock, the squadron commander, inspected the ship and her crew on 1 July. The ship departed for Puerto México (present day Coatzacoalcos) on the 15th and served as temporary refuge for members of the family of ex-president Victoriano Huerta for a few days as they were fleeing the country at the time of the United States occupation of Veracruz. &quot;Bristol&quot; sailed for Jamaica on the 31st as tensions with Germany rose.

===World War I===

The 4th Cruiser Squadron (formerly the North America and West Indies Station), with its main base the Royal Naval Dockyard at Bermuda, was tasked to protect Allied merchant shipping from commerce raiders in the Caribbean and along the East Coast of North America and Craddock dispersed his ships shortly before the war began on 4 August 1914 in a futile search for the two German warships known to be in the area. In the early evening of 6 August, &quot;Bristol&quot; spotted the German light cruiser , but failed to inflict any significant damage before engine problems allowed the German ship to disengage behind her own smoke. Later in the month, &quot;Bristol&quot; began patrolling off the northern coast of Brazil in an unsuccessful attempt to find the German ships. The ship was detached to continue to patrol the Brazilian coast and did not join Craddock&#x27;s ships as they searched for the East Asia Squadron off the Chilean coast in October.

In mid-October, &quot;Bristol&quot;, together with the armoured cruiser and two armed merchant cruisers was assigned to a new squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart that was tasked to patrol the South American coast north of Montevideo, Uruguay. After Craddock&#x27;s squadron was destroyed in the Battle of Coronel on 1 November, the ship rendezvoused at the Abrolhos Archipelago on 26 November with the reinforcements commanded by Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee. The ships then proceeded to the Falkland Islands where they arrived on 7 December.

====Battle of the Falklands====

Upon arrival at Port Stanley on 7 December, Sturdee gave permission for &quot;Bristol&quot; to put out her fires to clean her boilers and repair both engines. He planned to recoal the entire squadron the following day from the two available colliers and to begin the search for the East Asia Squadron the day after. Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, had other plans and intended to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley on the morning of 8 December. The appearance of two German ships at 07:30 caught Sturdee&#x27;s ships by surprise although they were driven off by shells fired by the predreadnought battleship when they came within range around 09:20. This gave time for &quot;Bristol&quot; to reassemble her engines and raise steam. As the ship was leaving harbour around 10:45, she received reports of German ships about south and Sturdee ordered her to intercept and destroy them, together with the armed merchant cruiser . The British ships were able to capture two of the three German colliers and sank them after taking off their crews.

The light cruiser was the only German ship able to disengage from the battle and Sturdee ordered &quot;Bristol&quot; to Puntas Arenas, Chile, after the ship was reported coaling there on 13 December. She arrived there the next day, but &quot;Dresden&quot; had left the night before. &quot;Bristol&quot; spent the next several months hunting for the German cruiser along the Argentinian and Chilean coasts and in the innumerable bays and inlets of Tierra del Fuego. During this time, she struck a shoal and seriously damaged her rudder on 22 February 1915. In late April, the ship began patrolling off the Brazilian coast. &quot;Bristol&quot; began a major refit at Gibraltar on 27 May that lasted until 5 August. Upon its completion, she was transferred to the British Adriatic Force to help contain the Austro-Hungarian Fleet and defend the Otranto Barrage. She then spent most of the next several months patrolling the lower reaches of the Adriatic Sea and the Strait of Otranto. On 3 October, her crew was inspected by Rear-Admiral Cecil Thursby. On 26 November, &quot;Bristol&quot; sailed for Gibraltar en route to a refit at William Beardmore and Company&#x27;s shipyard in Dalmuir that began on 17 December.

====Battle of the Strait of Otranto====
On the early morning of 15 May 1917, the Austro-Hungarians made their most serious attack of the war on the naval drifters controlling the barrage. &quot;Bristol&quot; was the &quot;ready ship&quot; at Brindisi and was at a half-hour&#x27;s notice for sea; she departed at 04:50, escorted by two Italian destroyers, in an attempt to intercept the three Austrian light cruisers that had conducted the attack. Contrammiraglio (Rear-Admiral) Alfredo Acton, commander of the ships at Brindisi, ordered that her speed be limited to to prevent her from getting too far ahead of the other ships now raising steam. One of these was &quot;Bristol&quot;″s half-sister , which departed at 05:36, also escorted by a pair of Italian destroyers. The &quot;Dartmouth&quot; group overtook &quot;Bristol&quot; and her consorts by 07:12 and were joined by the Italian scout cruiser around 07:40. Acton deployed his cruisers in line abreast with &quot;Aquila&quot; leading them and the destroyers guarding the flanks. &quot;Bristol&quot;″s bottom was foul, however, and limited the group to a speed of .

Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted clouds of smoke on the horizon and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly afterwards while the two British cruisers turned to cut off the two Austrian destroyers. &quot;Aquila&quot; opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.

The main Austro-Hungarian force of three light cruisers trailed the leading destroyers by a considerable distance and Commander Miklós Horthy spotted the Allied force around 09:05. Acton spotted them about five minutes later and manoeuvred his ships to cover the disabled &quot;Aquila&quot; rather than crossing the Austrians&#x27; T. The British ships opened fire about 09:30, although Horthy&#x27;s ships quickly laid a smoke screen and turned away through it. Both sides settled on parallel courses to the north-northwest and &quot;Bristol&quot; gradually began to fall behind and could eventually only use her bow gun at very long range before ceasing fire at 10:15. The British fire was moderately effective, but the Austrian ships concentrated their fire on &quot;Dartmouth&quot; which was hit three times, although not significantly damaged. Acton reduced his speed around 10:45 to allow &quot;Bristol&quot; to catch up. At 10:58 he ordered speed to be increased and turned two minutes later in an unsuccessful attempt to cut off the trailing Austrian cruiser. At 11:04, the British cruisers ceased fire and turned away on Acton&#x27;s order, presumably to avoid encountering Austro-Hungarian reinforcements which Acton knew were en route. During the battle the British cruisers were repeatedly attacked by Austro-Hungarian aircraft, but they inflicted no significant damage or casualties.

====Subsequent operations====
On 1 January 1918, &quot;Bristol&quot; was briefly based at the port of Kalloni, Lesbos, before sailing to Gibraltar for a long refit. She arrived on 17 January and departed on 2 April, bound for Sierra Leone, West Africa, to begin convoy escort duties there despite being assigned to the East Coast of South America Station. On 1 May, &quot;Bristol&quot; departed Dakar, French West Africa, bound for the Brazilian coast, arriving at Rio de Janeiro on the 15th. At the end of the month, she spent a few days salvaging ammunition from the wreck of the cargo liner . The ship patrolled the coasts of Brazil and Uruguay for the rest of the war and visited Port Stanley at the end of the year where she remained until 11 January 1919. &quot;Bristol&quot; sailed for the Cape Verde Islands in late April and then to Gibraltar where she arrived on 13 May. En route, three sailors died from influenza. A few days later, she departed for the UK and arrived at Portsmouth on the 21st. &quot;Bristol&quot; was paid off on 30 May and reduced to reserve the same day. The ship was listed for disposal in May 1920 and was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 to Thos. W. Ward of Hayle.

<doc id="193105" wikidata="Q1890727" url="?curid=193105" title="PowerPC 7xx">
<text>The PowerPC 7xx is a family of third generation 32-bit PowerPC microprocessors designed and manufactured by IBM and Motorola (spun off as Freescale Semiconductor bought by NXP Semiconductors). This family is called the PowerPC G3 by Apple Computer (later Apple Inc.), which introduced it on November 10, 1997. A number of microprocessors from different vendors have been used under the &quot;PowerPC G3&quot; name. Such designations were applied to Mac computers such as the PowerBook G3, the multicolored iMacs, iBooks and several desktops, including both the Beige and Blue and White Power Macintosh G3s. The low power requirements and small size made the processors ideal for laptops and the name lived out its last days at Apple in the iBook.

The 7xx family is also widely used in embedded devices like printers, routers, storage devices, spacecraft, and video game consoles. The 7xx family had its shortcomings, namely lack of SMP support and SIMD capabilities and a relatively weak FPU. Motorola&#x27;s 74xx range of processors picked up where the 7xx left off.

PowerPC 7xx processors have largely been manufactured in the range of 250nm to 100nm lithography.

==Processors==

=== PowerPC 740/750 ===

The PowerPC 740 and 750 (codename Arthur) were introduced in late 1997 as an evolutionary replacement for the PowerPC 603e. Enhancements included a faster 60x system bus (66 MHz), larger L1 caches (32 KB instruction and 32 KB data), a second integer unit, an enhanced floating point unit, and higher core frequency. The 750 had support for an optional 256, 512 or 1024 KB external unified L2 cache. The cache controller and cache tags are on-die. The cache was accessed via a dedicated 64-bit bus.

The 740 and 750 added dynamic branch prediction and a 64-entry branch target instruction cache (BTIC). Dynamic branch prediction uses the recorded outcome of a branch stored in a 512-entry by 2-bit branch history table (BHT) to predict its outcome. The BTIC caches the first two instructions at a branch target.

The 740/750 models had 6.35 million transistors and were initially manufactured by IBM and Motorola in an aluminium based fabrication process. The die measured 67 mm2 at 0.26 μm and it reached speeds of up to 366 MHz while consuming 7.3 W.

In 1999, IBM fabricated versions in a 0.20 μm process with copper interconnects, which increased the frequency up to 500 MHz and decreased power consumption to 6 W and the die size to 40 mm2.

The 740 slightly outperformed the Pentium II while consuming far less power and with a smaller die. The off-die L2 cache of the 750 increased performance by approximately 30% in most situations. The design was so successful that it quickly surpassed the PowerPC 604e in integer performance, causing a planned 604 successor to be scrapped.

The PowerPC 740 is completely pin compatible with the older 603, allowing upgrades to the PowerBook 1400, 2400, and even a prototype PowerBook 500/G3. The 750 with its L2 cache bus required more pins and thus a different package, a 360-pin ball grid array (BGA).

The PowerPC 750 was used in many computers from Apple, including the original iMac.

==== RAD750 ====

The RAD750 is a radiation-hardened processor, based on the PowerPC 750. It is intended for use in high radiation environments such as experienced on board satellites and other spacecraft. The RAD750 was released for purchase in 2001. The Mars Science Laboratory (&quot;Curiosity&quot;), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars 2020 (&quot;Perseverance&quot;) and James Webb Space Telescope spacecraft have a RAD750 on board.

The processor has 10.4 million transistors, is manufactured by BAE Systems using either 250 or 150 nm process and has a die area of 130 mm2. It operates at 110 to 200 MHz. The CPU itself can withstand 200,000 to 1,000,000 Rads and temperature ranges between −55 and 125 °C.
The RAD750 packaging and logic functions has a price tag in excess of US$200,000 : the high price is mainly due to radiation hardening revisions to the PowerPC 750 architecture and manufacturing, stringent quality control requirements, and extended testing of each processor chip manufactured.

=== PowerPC 745/755 ===
Motorola revised the 740/750 design in 1998 and shrunk die size to 51 mm2 thanks to a newer aluminium based fabrication at 0.22 μm. The speeds increased to up to 600 MHz. The 755 was used in some iBook models. After this model, Motorola chose not to keep developing the 750 processors in favour of their PowerPC 7400 processor and other cores.

=== PowerPC 750CX ===
IBM continued to develop the PowerPC 750 line and introduced the PowerPC 750CX (code-named Sidewinder) in 2000. It has a 256 KiB on-die L2 cache; this increased performance while reducing power consumption and complexity. At 400 MHz, it drew under 4 W. The 750CX had 20 million transistors including its L2 cache. It had a die size of 43 mm2 through a 0.18 μm copper process. The 750CX was only used in one iMac and iBook revision.

=== PowerPC 750CXe ===

750CXe (codename Anaconda), introduced in 2001, is a minor revision of 750CX to increase its clock speed to 700 MHz and memory bus from 100 MHz to 133 MHz. The 750CXe also features improved floating-point performance over the 750CX. Several iBook models and the last G3-based iMac have this processor.

A cost reduced version of 750CXe, called 750CXr, has lower frequencies.

==== Gekko ====

Gekko is the IBM&#x27;s custom central processor for the Nintendo GameCube game console. Based on a PowerPC 750CXe, it adds about 50 new instructions and a modified FPU capable of some SIMD functionality. It has 256 KiB of on die L2 cache, operates at 486 MHz with a 162 MHz memory bus, is fabricated by IBM on a 180 nm process. The die size is 43 mm2.

=== PowerPC 750FX ===
The 750FX (code-named Sahara) came in 2002 and increased frequency up to 900 MHz, the bus speed to 166 MHz and the on-die L2 cache to 512 KiB. It also featured a number of improvements to the memory subsystem: an enhanced and faster (200 MHz) 60x bus controller, a wider L2 cache bus, and the ability to lock parts of the L2 cache. It is manufactured using a 0.13 μm copper based fabrication with Low-K dielectric and Silicon on insulator technology. 750FX has 39 million transistors, a die size of 35 mm2 and consumes less than 4 W at 800 MHz at typical loads. It was the last G3 type processor used by Apple (employed on the iBook G3).

A low powered version of 750FX is available called 750FL.

750FX powers NASA&#x27;s Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. Orion is using Honeywell International Inc. flight computer originally built for Boeing&#x27;s 787 jet airliner.

=== PowerPC 750GX ===
750GX (codenamed Gobi), revealed in 2004, was a 7xx processor from IBM. It has an on-die 1 MB L2 cache, a top frequency of 1.1 GHz, and support for bus speeds up to 200 MHz among other enhancements compared to 750FX. It is manufactured using a 0.13 μm process with copper interconnects, low-K dielectric, and silicon on insulator technology. The 750GX has 44 million transistors, a die size of 52 mm2 and consumes less than 9 W at 1 GHz at typical loads.

A low-power version of the 750GX is available, called the 750GL.

=== PowerPC 750VX ===
750VX (codenamed &quot;Mojave&quot;) is a rumored, not confirmed and canceled version of the 7xx line. It would be the most powerful and featured version to date with up to 4MB of off die L3 cache, a 400Mhz DDR front side bus and the same implementation of AltiVec used in the PowerPC 970. It was expected to clock as high as 1.8 GHz (starting at 1.5 GHz) and reported to have additional pipeline stages, and advanced power management features. It was reported to be finished and ready for production in December 2003, but said timing was too late for it to get significant orders seeing Apple&#x27;s iBook line had switched to G4s in October the same year, and thus it quickly fell off the roadmap. It was never released or heard from since.

There were follow up chips planned, such the 750VXe, which would have surpassed 2 GHz.

=== PowerPC 750CL ===
The 750CL is an evolved 750CXe, with speeds ranging from 400 MHz to 1 GHz with a system bus up to 240 MHz, L2 cache prefetch features and graphics related instructions have been added to improve performance. As the added graphics-related functions match closely the ones found in the Gekko processor it is very likely that the 750CL is a shrink of the same processor for general purpose use. The 750CL is manufactured using a 90 nm copper based fabrication with Low-K dielectric and Silicon on insulator technology and features 20 million transistors on a 16 mm2 die. It draws up to 2.7 W at 600 MHz, 9.8 W at 1 GHz.
==== Broadway ====
The CPU in Wii is virtually identical to the 750CL but it runs at 729 MHz, a frequency not supported by stock 750CL. It measures only 4.2 x 4.5 mm (18.9 mm2). This is smaller than half the size of the &quot;Gekko&quot; microprocessor (43 mm2) incorporated in the GameCube at its first release.

==== Espresso ====

The CPU in Wii U is believed to be an evolution of the Broadway architecture. The largely unconfirmed characteristics are a triple core CPU which runs at 1.24 GHz and a 45 nm process.

== Future ==
IBM has ceased to publish a roadmap to the 750 family, in favor of marketing themselves as a custom processor vendor. Given IBM&#x27;s resources, the 750 core will be produced with new features as long as there is a willing buyer. In particular, IBM has no public plans to produce an ordinary 750-based microprocessor in a process smaller than 90 nm, effectively phasing it out as a commodity chip competitive in such markets as networking equipment. However IBM did make the Espresso processor for Nintendo, which is a 750 based design with improvements such as multiprocessor support (the part is a triple core), new 45 nm fabrication process and eDRAM instead of regular L2 cache; it&#x27;s unknown if further changes were made to the design.

In 2015 Rochester Electronics started providing legacy support for the devices.

Freescale has discontinued all 750 designs in favor of designs based on the PowerPC e500 core (PowerQUICC III).

<doc id="193113" wikidata="Q1398972" url="?curid=193113" title="Faxanadu">
<text>is an action role-playing platform video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The name was licensed by computer game developer Falcom and was developed and released in Japan by Hudson Soft for the Famicom in 1987. Nintendo released the game in the United States and Europe as a first-party title under license from Hudson Soft.

&quot;Faxanadu&quot; is a spin-off or side-story of &quot;Xanadu&quot;, which is the second installment of Falcom&#x27;s long-running RPG series, &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;. The title &quot;Faxanadu&quot; is a portmanteau formed from the names Famicom and &quot;Xanadu&quot;.

The game uses side-scrolling and platforming gameplay, while employing role-playing elements with an expansive story and medieval setting.

==Story==
The player-controlled protagonist of &quot;Faxanadu&quot; is a wanderer who returns home. He has no name, but the Japanese version allows the player to choose one. The game begins when he approaches Eolis, his hometown, after an absence to find it in disrepair and virtually abandoned. Worse still, the town is under attack by Dwarves. The Elven king explains that the Elves&#x27; fountain water, their life source, has been stopped and all other remaining water has been poisoned and provides the protagonist with 1500 gold, the game&#x27;s currency, to prepare for his journey to uncover the cause.

As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Elves and Dwarves lived in harmony among the World Tree until The Evil One emerged from a fallen meteorite. The Evil One then transformed the Dwarves into monsters against their will and made them hostile towards the Elves. The Dwarf King, Grieve, swallowed his magical sword before he was transformed, hiding it in his own body to prevent The Evil One from acquiring it. It is only with this sword that The Evil One can be destroyed.

His journey takes him to four overworld areas: the tree&#x27;s buttress, the inside of the trunk, the tree&#x27;s branches and finally the Dwarves&#x27; mountain stronghold.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Faxanadu&quot; is a side scrolling action role playing game, sometimes classified as a metroidvania. The player guides the hero through a screen-by-screen series of fields, towns, and dungeons. The hero can walk, jump, and climb ladders that are all typical characteristics of a platform game. Along the way, he may also purchase usable items with gold, equip and use bladed weapons against enemies, wear armor, and cast magic projectiles. In addition, he can access information regarding the game&#x27;s events by speaking with townsfolk or by consulting other sources.

The limits of physical damage the hero can sustain from enemies is tracked by a life bar, and the magical power he can exert is tracked by a magic bar. These are listed on the top of the screen along with total experience, gold amount, time (for items with a timed duration), and the currently held item.

When the hero defeats an enemy, it usually leaves behind gold or life-giving bread. The hero also gains a set amount of experience. Experience points help increase the hero&#x27;s rank. Occasionally, an enemy will also drop an item; some activate specific effects when touched, while others may be stored for later use.

The game utilizes a password system. Passwords, or &quot;mantras&quot; as they are known in the game, can be obtained from church-dwelling Gurus. Gurus also bestow ranks to the hero when he meets certain experience totals; these determine the amounts of experience and gold a player will possess upon resuming a game via password.

Due to its use of statistics, reliance on story, thematic basis upon medieval fantasy, and provision of interactive NPCs, many observers have classified &quot;Faxanadu&quot; as a role-playing video game.

==Development==
Jun Chikuma composed the music for the game and was assisted by Hudson Soft&#x27;s sound programmer, Toshiaki Takimoto. Chikuma, working with just the tone generator of the NES which had only three channels, used her background in jazz technique to create melodic movements and express chord progression. The team gave her full freedom &quot;from general directions to sound-making details&quot;, and Jun said that in these good circumstances she was able to work quite freely.

==Release==
&quot;Faxanadu&quot; was released in Japan on the Famicom on November 16, 1987. It was released in North America in August 1989 and was published by Nintendo. The November/December 1989 edition of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;Faxanadu&quot; debuted on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 30&quot; list at #6. It gradually fell from the list in subsequent issues.

The game world is featured in two episodes of Season 2 (1990–1991) of the Nintendo-based, Saturday morning cartoon series, &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;. They are &quot;The Feud of Faxanadu&quot; and &quot;Germ Wars&quot;. The Elven King is named Melvis and looks and sounds like Elvis Presley for his first appearance; the voice was changed in the latter episode. The Dwarf King is not featured in the series and is replaced by Queen Dwarfine.

The game was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2010 and 2011.

==Reception==
The game has received critical acclaim. &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; scored it 29 out of 40. &quot;IGN&quot; reviewed the game in 2011, after its Wii virtual console release, giving it a better score of 8.5 out of 10 and called it a hidden gem. &quot;IGN&quot; went on to call it a better action RPG than &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; and &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

Marcel van Duyn of Nintendo Life gave the game an 8 out of 10, saying it is a surprisingly fun game and an absolutely essential purchase for those who like RPGs, but he criticized the password system for western audiences, and was grateful the Virtual Console release eliminates that feature. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; listed the game as the 16th best game for the NES, saying it is a &quot;forgotten gem&quot; of the system&#x27;s library. &quot;IGN&quot; listed the game as the 36th best NES game, calling it one of the best and least-known Nintendo-published adventures.

<text>HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; was one of 10 armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet on completion in 1903. The ship was refitted in 1907 in preparation for service as a training ship for cadets with the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station beginning in 1908. In 1909 she toured the Mediterranean and the Baltic, where she entertained the Kaiser who visited on his yacht the Hohenzollern at Kiel on 24 June. &quot;Cornwall&quot; ran aground in 1911 while trying to free another cruiser, but was successfully refloated and repaired.

She captured a German merchant ship days after the beginning of World War I in August 1914 and was then sent to the Central Atlantic to search for German commerce raiders. Later that year, the ship was assigned to the squadron that destroyed the German East Asia Squadron at the Battle of the Falklands, where she helped to sink a German light cruiser. &quot;Cornwall&quot; briefly blockaded a German cruiser in East Africa in early 1915 before she was sent to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign a month later. The ship was then transferred to the China Station late in the year and remained there until the end of 1916. She was then transferred to the North America Station that year for convoy escort duties and remained on that duty for the rest of the war. &quot;Cornwall&quot; became a training ship in 1919 before she was paid off later that year. The ship was sold for scrap in 1920.

==Design and description==

The &quot;Monmouth&quot;s were intended to protect British merchant shipping from fast cruisers like the French , or the . The ships were designed to displace . They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft using steam provided by 31 Belleville boilers. The engines produced a total of which was designed to give the ships a maximum speed of . She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Monmouth&quot;-class ships&#x27; main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) Mk VII guns. Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and the others were positioned in casemates amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder () 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. &quot;Cornwall&quot; also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes.

Beginning in 1915, the main deck six-inch guns of the &quot;Monmouth&quot;-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping. The twelve-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At some point in the war, a pair of three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward. The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was four inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Cornwall&quot;, named to commemorate the English county, was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard, Wales, on 11 March 1901, and launched on 29 October 1902, when she was christened by the Countess of St Germans (nominated for this by the local Lord-Lieutenant). She was completed on 1 December 1904 and was initially assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. In December 1906 the ship began a refit that lasted through 1907. She became a cadet training ship in January 1908 and was assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. On 6 August 1911 &quot;Cornwall&quot; ran aground on Pinnacle Rock, off Cape Sable Island in Nova Scotia while assisting the protected cruiser , which had also run aground. Both cruisers were refloated and &quot;Cornwall&quot; was repaired at His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Dockyard, Halifax.

In December 1913, the ship was refitting in Devonport and resumed her training duties after it was completed in January 1914. Over the next six months, she visited ports ranging from Malta to São Vicente, Cape Verde to Trondheim, Norway. &quot;Cornwall&quot; participated in the July 1914 Fleet review at Spithead and was give a short refit at the end of the month. Upon its completion, she was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron which was tasked with trade protection between the Azores, the Canary Islands and Gibraltar. En route to the latter, &quot;Cornwall&quot; captured the German collier on 5 August and was transferred to patrol the Brazilian coast in September as part of the 4th Cruiser Squadron under Vice-Admiral Christopher Craddock.

After the German raider &quot;Cap Trafalgar&quot; was sunk, RMS Carmania was badly damaged, having lost nine men, but was able to rendezvous with &quot;Cornwall.&quot; &quot;Carmania&quot; was barely afloat when it made contact with &quot;Cornwall&quot; on 15 October. &quot;Carmania&quot; was escorted to Permambuco in Brazil where the ship was repaired before being sent to Gibraltar for further repair.

The ship was later assigned to a new squadron intended to patrol the River Plate area and did not join Craddock&#x27;s ships as they searched for the German East Asia Squadron off the Chilean coast. After Craddock&#x27;s squadron was destroyed in the Battle of Coronel on 1 November, &quot;Cornwall&quot; then proceeded to the Falkland Islands with the squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee.

===Battle of the Falklands===
Upon arrival at Port Stanley on 7 December 1914, Sturdee gave permission for &quot;Cornwall&quot; to put out her fires to clean her boilers and repair one engine. He planned to recoal the entire squadron the following day from the two available colliers and to begin the search for the East Asia Squadron the day after. Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, had other plans and intended to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley on the morning of 8 December. The appearance of two German ships at 07:30 caught Sturdee&#x27;s ships by surprise although they were driven off by shells fired by the predreadnought battleship when they came within range around 09:20. This gave time for &quot;Cornwall&quot; to reassemble her engine and raise steam, although she had not even started to recoal. The squadron cleared the harbour by 10:30 and Sturdee ordered, &quot;general chase&quot;. His two battlecruisers were the fastest ships present and inexorably began to close on the German cruisers. They opened fire at 12:55 and began to straddle the light cruiser , the rear ship in the German formation. It was clear to Spee that his ships could not outrun the battlecruisers and that the only hope for any of his ships to survive was to scatter. So he turned his two armoured cruisers around to buy time by engaging the battlecruisers and ordered his three light cruisers to disperse at 13:20.

In accordance with Sturdee&#x27;s plans, &quot;Cornwall&quot;, her sister ship, , and the light cruiser immediately set off in pursuit while the battlecruisers and the slow armoured cruiser dealt with the German armoured cruisers. At 14:45 &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the fastest of the British cruisers, was close enough to &quot;Leipzig&quot; to open fire and the two ships exchanged salvos and scoring the occasional hit. An hour later, the Germans scattered in different directions; &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot; pursued &quot;Leipzig&quot; while &quot;Kent&quot; went after . &quot;Cornwall&quot; closed on the German ship at full speed, trusting to her armour to keep out the shells, while the unarmoured &quot;Glasgow&quot; manoeuvered at a distance. The range from &quot;Cornwall&quot; was at 18:00 and her shells set &quot;Leipzig&quot; on fire. Five minutes later, the German ship had ceased firing and the British ships closed to to see if she would surrender. One last gun fired and &quot;Leipzig&quot; did not strike her colours so the British fired several additional salvos at 19:25. The German captain had mustered his surviving crewmen on deck preparatory to abandoning ship, but the ship&#x27;s flag could not be reached because it was surrounded by flames, and the British shells wrought havoc on the assembled crew. &quot;Leipzig&quot; fired two green flares at 20:12 and the British ships closed to within and lowered boats to rescue the Germans at 20:45. Their ship capsized at 21:32 but only a total of 18 men were rescued in the darkness. &quot;Leipzig&quot; had hit &quot;Cornwall&quot; 18 times, but she did not lose a single man. The British ship rescued one officer and three ratings from &quot;Leipzig&quot;. &quot;Cornwall&quot; spent much of the rest of the month searching for the German ships that had not yet been captured or destroyed before departing for home on 3 January 1915.

===Subsequent service===

She arrived at Devonport on 11 February 1915 and spent the next month and a half refitting there and in Avonmouth before departing for South Africa on 23 March. The ship arrived at Kibondo Island off the German East African coast on 27 April to blockade the light cruiser in the Rufiji River. Several weeks later &quot;Cornwall&quot; was called north to reinforce the British forces involved in the Dardanelles Campaign on 10 May. By the end of the year, she was en route to the China Station. The ship arrived at Singapore on 17 February 1916 and began a lengthy refit that lasted until 6 May. She then patrolled the area of the Dutch East Indies until returning to Singapore for the next several months. &quot;Cornwall&quot; departed for French Indochina on 21 July and the Governor-General of French Indochina visited the ship on 26 July while she was docked at Saigon. After her return to Singapore, she was inspected by the Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, Vice-Admiral William Grant, on 21 August. &quot;Cornwall&quot; resumed patrolling in the East Indies shortly afterwards and continued until Grant hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 22 October as he and his staff was ferried to Hong Kong. Upon arrival five days later, Grant lowered his flag as he transferred ashore. The ship patrolled off the Chinese coast for most of November and returned to Singapore on 11 December. &quot;Cornwall&quot; departed the city on 20 December bound for South Africa. On 16 January 1917, the ship was escorting a convoy of six troopships when she narrowly missed encountering the German commerce raider off Saldanha Bay.

A few days after arriving in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 29 January, &quot;Cornwall&quot; dismounted four of her 12-pounder guns; two of the guns were transferred to troopships in her convoy. She led the convoy back to sea on 2 February, bound for Devonport where they arrived on 17 February. The ship then sailed to Liverpool to begin a lengthy refit and was paid off there on 7 March. She recommissioned on 4 August and spent the next two weeks preparing to go back to sea. &quot;Cornwall&quot; departed Liverpool on 17 August and escorted at least one troopship to Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving there a week later. She was now assigned to the North Atlantic and West Indies Station and began escorting convoys between North America and Britain on 19 September. &quot;Cornwall&quot; continued in this role for the next year and escorted her last convoy when she arrived in Bermuda on 18 October 1918. She departed the island on 14 December and arrived at Devonport eight days later. The ship resumed her prewar role as a cadet training ship on 25 January 1919. Vice-Admiral Morgan Singer, Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies, inspected the ship on 9 May while she was berthed in Bermuda. &quot;Cornwall&quot; returned to Devonport on 31 July and was paid off on 21 August. The ship was sold for scrap on 7 June 1920. In 1922, Mount Cornwall in the Canadian Rockies was named in tribute to the ship.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Frederick Charles Doveton Sturdee, 1st Baronet (9 June 18597 May 1925) was a Royal Navy officer. After training as a torpedo officer, he commanded two different cruisers and then three different battleships before becoming commander of the 1st Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet. He went on to command the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and then the 2nd Cruiser Squadron.

Just before the start of the First World War Sturdee became Chief of War Staff at the Admiralty. In November 1914 the Royal Navy suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Coronel. In response Sturdee, recently sacked from his job at the Admiralty, was sent to the South Atlantic to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf Maximilian von Spee, which had caused the damage at Coronel. On 8 December 1914, while coaling at Stanley, Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee&#x27;s forces sank almost the entire German squadron. Only one light cruiser escaped but she was hunted down in March 1915.

In the closing years of the war Sturdee served as commander of the 4th Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet and then as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore.

==Early life==
Born the son of Captain Frederick Sturdee RN and Anna Frances Sturdee (née Hodson) in Charlton, Kent, Sturdee was educated at the Royal Naval School at New Cross and then joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in the training ship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; on 15 July 1871. Promoted to midshipman on 19 July 1873, he was appointed to the frigate , flagship of the China Station in 1876. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 9 June 1878 and to lieutenant on 7 February 1880, he joined the brig at Portsmouth in May 1880 and then transferred to the torpedo depot ship in the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1881. He took part in the bombardment of Alexandria in July 1882 during the Anglo-Egyptian War.

== Early naval career ==
After completing a course on torpedoes at Sturdee became a torpedo officer on , flagship of the North America and West Indies Station, in 1886 before returning to HMS &quot;Vernon&quot; as an instructor in 1889. Promoted to commander on 30 June 1893, he transferred to the Admiralty as a torpedo specialist in the Directorate of Naval Ordnance. He became commanding officer of the cruiser on the Australian Station in November 1897 and became involved in managing the tensions with Germany and the United States over the Samoan Islands in 1899. His handling of this situation, which involved a tense stand-off with the German representatives, earned him his promotion to captain on 30 June 1899, and his appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1900 New Year Honours list on 1 January 1900 (he was invested in person by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 1 March 1900).

===Senior office===
Sturdee returned to the Admiralty as assistant director of naval intelligence (foreign division) from 1 January 1900, serving as such until 16 October 1902, when he was appointed to command of the protected cruiser . Appointed a member, 4th class, of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) on 21 April 1903 during King Edward&#x27;s visit to Malta, he became commanding officer of the armoured cruiser in the Home Fleet in November 1903. He went on to be commanding officer of the battleship and Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet (Lord Charles Beresford) in May 1905. Advanced to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 16 April 1906, he became commanding officer of the battleship and then of the battleship in a new role as Chief of Staff of the Channel Fleet in 1907. He was appointed an aide-de-camp to the King on 26 October 1907. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 12 September 1908.

Sturdee wrote (9 March 1909) to Jack Sandars, an adviser to the Opposition leader Arthur Balfour, expressing doubt that the 10,000 yard range of &quot;HMS Dreadnought’s&quot; 12-inch guns would be of much use, as visibility did not extend more than 6,000 yards in the North Sea on 25 days out of 30. He appears at that time to have favoured caution before committing too many resources to all-big-gun battleships. Historian Nicholas Lambert writes that “a self-proclaimed naval intellectual, Sturdee was the disciple of Reginald Custance [who had been his boss as Director of Naval Intelligence] and former flag captain to Lord Charles Beresford. Sturdee’s pomposity and arrogance combined with his close association with Beresford earned him the enmity of Admiral Fisher, who tried hard to sabotage his career.&quot; Although no longer First Sea Lord, Fisher wrote (1 Feb 1910) to First Lord of the Admiralty Reginald McKenna urging him not to appoint Sturdee Third Sea Lord. He became Rear Admiral commanding the 1st Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship , in 1910. 

Sturdee became President of the Submarine Committee of the Admiralty in early 1911. He benefited from the decision by the incoming First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in late 1911 to pass over twenty admirals to promote Jellicoe to command of the 2nd Battle Squadron, freeing up a promotion logjam. Sturdee became commander of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the cruiser , in December 1911. He went on to become commander of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet, with his flag in &quot;Shannon&quot; again, in 1913. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1913.

==First World War==
===Chief of War Staff===
Sturdee was promoted to vice-admiral on 13 December 1913. By the end of 1913 Sturdee was considered for the position of Chief of Admiralty War Staff. Draft notes in Churchill’s papers suggest that he may have been the second choice after Prince Louis of Battenberg had given what Nicholas Lambert describes as “uncharacteristically fierce resistance” to appointing his former superior Reginald Custance. Heathcote states that he took office as Chief of War Staff at the Admiralty in July 1914.

On 24 July 1914 Sturdee submitted two memos deploring the new planned &quot;“HMS Polyphemus”&quot; class, a semi-submerged torpedo cruiser armed with eight torpedoes. There had been an argument about the naval estimates at the start of 1914, with Liberal opinion, including Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, objecting to ever-escalating naval expenditure, especially with a General Election due within a year or so. Churchill’s motives were purely financial, aiming to save up to £900,000 off the naval budget, and his plans had been outlined in memos on 1 and 14 June 1914. He aimed to substitute 14-16 submarines for a planned &quot;HMS Resistance&quot; and 6-8 &quot;Polyphemuses&quot; for a planned &quot;&quot;HMS Agincourt&quot;&quot; (the name was reused for a different battleship), and to cease all destroyer building except for two or three large ones for use as flotilla leaders, and build submarines instead. Sturdee criticised the high cost of the &quot;Polyphemuses&quot;, as well as their low freeboard (making them unusable in rough seas) and vulnerability to enemy destroyers. Christopher Bell writes that, contrary to Nicholas Lambert&#x27;s claims, no final decision had been reached on “substitution” (of submersible craft for battleships) prior to the outbreak of war.

On 9 August 1914, with Britain now at war with Germany, Churchill instructed Battenberg and Sturdee to draw up plans to seize Ameland in the Dutch Frisian Islands. This was the genesis of the eventual plan to land at Borkum (as a possible prelude to seizing the Kiel Canal and sending a British fleet into the Baltic. Bell gives the date of Churchill&#x27;s Ameland instruction as 8 August in his text then 9 August in a footnote.

Sturdee objected (16 August 1914) to the Order in Council about blocking trade with Germany through neutral countries. He doubted the “political expediency of adopting an attitude the practical efficacy of which is very doubtful, and which I think is just as sure to raise trouble with neutrals”. Admiral Edmond Slade recorded similar thoughts on 18 August.

Sturdee wrote two “dismissive minutes” (25 September 1914) about the Cabinet’s wishes to mine the eastern North Sea as far south as Rotterdam and Flushing. Nicholas Lambert comments that Sturdee “a self-proclaimed naval theorist of the Mahanian school, was notorious for his monochromatic view of sea power and his dogmatic insistence that the primary objective must remain decisive victory in a fleet engagement”. Captain Herbert Richmond complained in his diary that “he produced the old, stale claptrap that what we want to do is not to keep the enemy in but to get him out &amp; fight”. While Churchill was away at Antwerp Sturdee had persuaded the First Sea Lord Prince Louis of Battenberg to join him in a joint statement that it was not British policy to lay mines (the document is not in the archives, according to Nicholas Lambert – it is only mentioned in the 1 October diary of Captain Philip Dumas, the “Director of Mining”). Churchill (1 October) ordered the Admiralty to draw up a schedule for mining the North Sea, reconfirming instructions given by Prime Minister H.H. Asquith while he was away at Antwerp.

In Nicholas Lambert&#x27;s view Sturdee shared some of the blame for Admiralty blunders for which Churchill was blamed by the press – the escape of the &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;, and the loss of the &quot;Aboukir&quot;, &quot;Cressy&quot; and &quot;Hogue&quot;. Christopher Bell writes that Churchill, who had vainly urged that the three cruisers be stationed more safely further away from the German fleet, was unfairly blamed in the press. He had appointed Battenberg and Sturdee and so bears some responsibility for their errors, but nonetheless the fault for the loss of the three cruisers lies with them. On 1 November 1914 the Royal Navy suffered a demoralising defeat when it lost two armoured cruisers commanded by Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel. In &quot;The World Crisis&quot; (his First World War memoirs, published in the 1920s) Churchill later put the blame for Coronel on Cradock (to the displeasure of his surviving relatives); in Bell&#x27;s view he should have been more critical of Battenberg and Sturdee for failure to transmit clear orders.

Admiral Fisher, returning as First Sea Lord in Battenberg&#x27;s place, sacked Sturdee (4 November) – he was “the first to go” in Nicholas Lambert’s words. Stephen Roskill (in &quot;Man of Secrets&quot;, his biography of Maurice Hankey) described this as personal “headhunting” by Fisher. However Nicholas Lambert comments that Captain Philip Dumas wrote in his diary on the day of Fisher’s return (30 October) that “the great hope here is for Sturdee &amp; Leveson to go”. “Blinker” Hall also thought similarly.

===South Atlantic===

Admiral Lord Fisher sent a squadron commanded by Sturdee, with his flag in the battlecruiser , to the South Atlantic to seek out the German squadron, commanded by Graf Maximilian von Spee, which had won the Battle of Coronel. Sturdee was given command at Winston Churchill’s insistence, because he did not at that time wish him to be scapegoated for Admiralty failings. Halpern comments that the decision was compounded by the fact that Fisher &quot;detested&quot; Sturdee and wanted to remove him from the Admiralty.

On 8 December 1914, while coaling at Stanley, Sturdee encountered von Spee and the subsequent action became known as the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Von Spee, finding that he was engaged with a superior force, was forced to flee. In the course of the pursuit Sturdee&#x27;s forces sank almost the entire German squadron, including the armoured cruisers, and . Only the light cruiser escaped but she was hunted down in March 1915. Lambert comments that it was “remarkable fortune” that von Spee ran into Sturdee&#x27;s force refuelling at Port Stanley.

===Grand Fleet===

Sturdee became commander of the 4th Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet, with his flag in the battleship , in January 1915. 

George Riddell commented in his Diary (29 April 1915) that Churchill, now under renewed press attack for the failed naval attack on the Dardanelles, showed him papers proving that he was not to blame for the loss of the three cruisers (&quot;Aboukir&quot;, &quot;Cressy&quot; and &quot;Hogue&quot;) and the Battle of Coronel the previous autumn. They were interrupted by Admiral Fisher coming into room and insisting to Churchill that “a person of importance wishes to see you” – Riddell suspected that Fisher had been summoned by Churchill’s Private Secretary James Masterton-Smith to stop Churchill showing him classified papers. Churchill did not go immediately but commented that Battenberg had been “very lethargic” and Sturdee “not a good Chief of Staff. He is a good fighting admiral but not a clever man”. Fisher resigned the following month, bringing down the Liberal Government and causing Churchill&#x27;s removal from the Admiralty.

Sturdee was created a baronet on 15 March 1916 with the title &quot;of the Falkland Is.&quot; Sturdee directed his squadron at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 31 May 1916 and awarded the Cross of Commander of the French Legion of Honour on 15 September 1916.

Lord Sydenham of Combe (4 October 1916) and Reginald Custance (9 October 1916) complained in letters to &quot;The Times&quot; that Churchill’s recent statements (Churchill was out of office at the time) that the German High Seas Fleet was effectively blockaded and that surplus forces should be used in offensive operations (similar to the views of naval theorist Julian Corbett) ignored the importance of seeking a decisive victory over the German Fleet. Sturdee also complained in a private memorandum (24 Nov 1916) that Churchill’s policy was “the exact reverse of what he advocated when in office and expressed in public speeches”. Historian Christopher Bell thinks this not quite fair – Churchill had advocated risking old, near-obsolete ships in the attack on the Dardanelles but had never suggested weakening Britain’s superiority over Germany in the North Sea. In articles (&quot;The London Magazine&quot; December 1916 and January 1917) and in a Commons speech (21 February 1917) Churchill continued to argue that seeking a major naval victory over Germany was unrealistic but that Germany was effectively blockaded even if such a blockade now took place from bases further away from the enemy than in Napoleonic times.

Promoted to full admiral on 17 May 1917, Sturdee was appointed Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on 11 August 1917, and became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in March 1918. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on his retirement on 5 July 1921 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1921. He was President of the Society for Nautical Research (1922–1925).

==Personal life==

In 1882 Sturdee married Marion Andrews (died 1940): they had a son and a daughter.

Sturdee retired to Camberley, in Surrey, and died there on 7 May 1925. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church in nearby Frimley. His gravestone incorporates a cross made from the timbers of Nelson&#x27;s ship, . His grandson William Staveley and grandson-in-law Edward Ashmore were also Admirals of the Fleet.

<text>Saoi (, plural &quot;Saoithe&quot;; literally &quot;wise one&quot;; historically the title of the head of a bardic school) is the highest honour bestowed by Aosdána, a state-supported association of Irish creative artists. The title is awarded, for life, to an existing Aosdána member. There are at most seven living Saoithe at any time; a limit increased from five in 2007–08. At the conferring ceremony, a torc (a twist/spiral of gold, worn around the neck) is presented to the Saoi, typically by the President of Ireland.

==Nominating process==
A committee of ten members of Aosdána referred to as the &quot;Toscaireacht&quot; monitor and manage the nominating process to confirm adherence to the established rules. Fifteen members of the Aosdána must nominate a candidate of merit and distinction. An election by secret ballot then occurs with all members. Approval is determined by at least 50% + 1 of the membership voting approval. 

Only one nomination per vacancy may be processed through an election at a time. If multiple candidate submissions are received, they go through the election process one at a time until a successful approval is declared. Subsequent nominees are held until there is a future vacancy.

<text>Höxter () is a Kreis (district) in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Holzminden, Northeim, Kassel, Waldeck-Frankenberg, Hochsauerland, Paderborn, and Lippe.

==History==

The area of the current Höxter district was part of the Bishopric of Paderborn until it was included into Prussia in 1802. In 1816 the new Prussian government created three districts in the area, Höxter, Brakel and Warburg. In 1832 Höxter and Brakel were merged.

The present district was created in 1975 when the former districts Warburg and Höxter were merged. At the same time the towns and municipalities in the district were merged to form the today&#x27;s ten towns.

==Geography==

Geographically the district covers the hills east of the Teutoburg Forest, especially the Eggegebirge, and parts of the Weserbergland. The highest elevation is the &quot;Köterberg&quot; (Elevation 496 m). The main river is the Weser in the east of the district.

==Coat of arms==
The lily in the bottom comes from the old coat of arms of the Warburg district, and is also found in the coat of arms of the city Warburg. The blue wave line stands for the river Weser, and the cross in the top derives from the coat of arms of the Bishopric of Paderborn.

<doc id="193127" wikidata="Q2339039" url="?curid=193127" title="Centre Point">
<text>Centre Point is a building in Central London, comprising a 34-storey tower; a 9-storey block to the east including shops, offices, retail units and maisonettes; and a linking block between the two at first-floor level. It occupies 101–103 New Oxford Street and 5–24 St Giles High Street, WC1, with a frontage also to Charing Cross Road, close to St Giles Circus and almost directly above Tottenham Court Road tube station. The site was once occupied by a gallows, and the tower sits directly over the former route of St Giles High Street, which had to be re-routed for the construction.

The building is 117 m (385 ft) high, has 34 floors&lt;ref name=&quot;Targetfollow news archive, 06/10/05&quot;&gt;Targetfollow news archive, 06/10/05&lt;/ref&gt; and of floor space. Constructed from 1963 to 1966, it was one of the first skyscrapers in London, and was the city&#x27;s joint 27th-tallest building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Targetfollow news archive, 11/08/09&quot;&gt;Targetfollow news archive, 11/08/09 &lt;/ref&gt; It stood empty from the time of its completion until 1975, and was briefly occupied by housing activists in 1974. Since 1995 it has been a Grade II listed building. In 2015, it was converted from office space to flats.

==Construction and history==
The building was designed by George Marsh of the architects R. Seifert and Partners, with engineers Pell Frischmann, and was constructed by Wimpey Construction from 1963 to 1966 for £5.5 million. The precast segments were formed of fine concrete, utilising crushed Portland stone; they were made by Portcrete Limited at Portland, Isle of Portland, Dorset, and transported to London by lorry.

Centre Point was built as speculative office space by property tycoon Harry Hyams, who had leased the site at £18,500 a year for 150 years. Hyams intended that the whole building be occupied by a single tenant, and negotiated fiercely for its approval.

On completion, the building remained vacant for many years, leading to its being referred to as &quot;London&#x27;s Empty Skyscraper&quot;. With property prices rising and most business tenancies taken for set periods of 10 or 15 years, Hyams could afford to keep it empty and wait for his single tenant at the asking price of £1,250,000; he was challenged to allow tenants to rent single floors, but consistently refused. At that time skyscrapers were rare in London, and Centre Point&#x27;s prominence led to its becoming a rallying symbol for opponents. The homeless charity Centrepoint was founded in 1969 as a homeless shelter in nearby Soho, named Centrepoint in response to the building Centre Point being seen as an &quot;affront to the homeless&quot; for being left empty to make money for the property developer.

In 1974 an umbrella group of Direct Action housing campaigners, including Jim Radford, Ron Bailey and Jack Dromey, organised a weekend occupation of Centre Point from 18 January to 20 January to draw attention to its being deliberately left empty during a housing crisis in London. (Two of the occupiers had obtained jobs with the Burns Security Company, which was guarding the building.)

From July 1980 to March 2014, Centre Point was the headquarters of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) which became, at 33 years and seven months, the building&#x27;s longest-standing tenant.

In October 2005, Centre Point was bought from the previous owners, Blackmoor LP, by commercial property firm Targetfollow for £85 million. The building was extensively refurbished. occupants included US talent agency William Morris; the state-owned national oil company of Saudi Arabia, Aramco; Chinese oil company PetroChina; and electronic gaming company EA Games.

It has since been purchased by Almacantar. Almacantar approached Conran and Partners for the refurbishment of the tower including change of use from office to residential, whilst MICA, formerly Rick Mather Architects, led the refurbishment of the lower rise buildings and the new affordable housing block. In 2015 work began on conversion of the building to residential flats. The restoration and conversion of the tower to a residential building was finished in March 2018. Much as had been the case at its original opening, the refurbished tower remains largely empty, with few windows lit in the evenings, the rest in darkness, despite at least half its units being sold. This has led to its being called one of London&#x27;s &quot;ghost towers&quot;.

==Transport==

The promised transport interchange and highways improvements were not delivered following the original plan. The pedestrian subway attracted anti-social activities. On 19 June 2006, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment pointed to the building as an example of bad design, where badly-designed pavements force pedestrians into the bus lane and account for the highest level of pedestrian injuries in Central London. With the planned redevelopment of Tottenham Court Road Underground Station, a framework has been adopted to redevelop the traffic island beneath Centre Point as an open space.

==Architectural reception==
Architecture critic Nikolaus Pevsner described Centre Point as &quot;coarse in the extreme&quot;. In 1995 it became a Grade II listed building. In 2009, it won the Concrete Society&#x27;s Mature Structures Award.

==Cultural references==
* Centre Point is featured in the 1977 horror film &quot;The Medusa Touch&quot;. A Boeing 747 aircraft is seen to hit the top of the tower and destroy it. The resulting collapse engulfs the nearby Dominion Theatre.
* Centre Point is one of the locations Jim (Cillian Murphy) walks past in the &quot;deserted London&quot; scenes of UK horror film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002). Director Danny Boyle also references it (as &quot;&#x27;Centre Point,&#x27; the famous empty/partially empty building in this busy section of London&quot;) on the DVD commentary.
* The character &quot;Old Bailey&quot; camps on top of Centre Point at one point in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;Neverwhere&quot;. He describes it as an &quot;ugly and distinctive Sixties skyscraper&quot; and goes on to remark that &quot;the view from the top was without compare, and, furthermore, the top of Centre Point was one of the few places in the West End of London where you did not have to look at Centre Point itself&quot;.
* The building is mentioned in the sixth episode of the fourth series of the BBC comedy series &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. During an inquiry into the UK government&#x27;s routine leaking of information to the press, Stuart Pearson, a Conservative spin doctor, is asked about an analogy he has made between government transparency and the Pompidou Centre. A member of the inquiry suggests that rather than creating a &quot;political Pompidou Centre&quot;, Pearson has created &quot;the opposite, Centre Point – I mean everyone sees it looming over them but nobody has the faintest idea what happens in there.&quot; To which Pearson replies, &quot;I think there&#x27;s some kind of club on the top floor.&quot;
* In an episode of &quot;Captain Kremmen&quot;, the titular character is forced to fire a &quot;Thron&quot; ray into London by his Krell captors, but avoids any deaths by aiming it at Centre Point, which was empty.

<text>The Ricardian equivalence proposition (also known as the Ricardo–de Viti–Barro equivalence theorem) is an economic hypothesis holding that consumers are forward-looking and so internalize the government&#x27;s budget constraint when making their consumption decisions. This leads to the result that, for a given pattern of government spending, the method of financing such spending does not affect agents&#x27; consumption decisions, and thus, it does not change aggregate demand.

==Introduction==

Governments can finance their expenditures by creating new money, by levying taxes, or by issuing bonds. Since bonds are loans, they must eventually be repaid—presumably by raising taxes in the future. The choice is therefore &quot;tax now or tax later.&quot;

Suppose that the government finances some extra spending through deficits; i.e. it chooses to tax later. According to the hypothesis, taxpayers will anticipate that they will have to pay higher taxes in future. As a result, they will save, rather than spend, the extra disposable income from the initial tax cut, leaving demand and output unchanged.

David Ricardo was the first to propose this possibility in the early nineteenth century; however, he was unconvinced of its empirical relevance. Antonio de Viti de Marco elaborated on Ricardian equivalence in the 1890s. Robert J. Barro took the question up independently in the 1970s, in an attempt to give the proposition a firm theoretical foundation.

==Ricardo and war bonds==
In &quot;Essay on the Funding System&quot; (1820), Ricardo studied whether it makes a difference to finance a war with £20 million in current taxes or to issue government bonds with infinite maturity and annual interest payment of £1 million in all following years financed by future taxes. At the assumed interest rate of 5%, Ricardo concluded that in terms of spending the two alternatives amounted to the same value. However, Ricardo himself doubted that this proposition had practical consequences. He followed up the initial exposition with a claim that individuals do not actually evaluate taxes in such a manner and, in particular, take myopic view of the tax path.

==Ricardo–de Viti–Barro equivalence==
In 1974, Robert J. Barro provided some theoretical foundation for Ricardo&#x27;s hesitant speculation
(apparently in ignorance of Ricardo&#x27;s earlier notion and de Viti&#x27;s subsequent extensions). Barro&#x27;s model assumed the following:
* families act as infinitely lived dynasties because of intergenerational altruism
* capital markets are perfect (i.e., all can borrow and lend at a single rate)
* the path of government expenditures is fixed

Under these conditions, if governments finance deficits by issuing bonds, the bequests that families grant to their children will be just large enough to offset the higher taxes that will be needed to pay off those bonds. Among his conclusions, Barro wrote:... in the case where the marginal net-wealth effect of government bonds is close to zero ... fiscal effects involving changes in the relative amounts of tax and debt finance for a given amount of public expenditure would have no effect on aggregate demand, interest rates, and capital formation.The model was an important contribution to the theory of new classical macroeconomics, built around the assumption of rational expectations.

In 1979, Barro defined the Ricardian equivalence theorem as follows: &quot;... shifts between debt and tax finance for a given amount of public expenditure would have no first-order effect on the real interest rate, volume of private investment, etc.&quot; Barro noted that &quot;the Ricardian equivalence proposition is presented in Ricardo&quot;. However, Ricardo himself was skeptical of this equivalence.

==Criticisms==
Ricardian equivalence requires assumptions that have been seriously challenged. The perfect capital market hypothesis is often held up for particular criticism because liquidity constraints invalidate the assumed lifetime income hypothesis. International capital markets also complicate the picture. However, even in a laboratory setting where all assumptions required are ensured to hold, behaviour of individuals is inconsistent with Ricardian equivalence.

Martin Feldstein argued in 1976 that Barro ignored economic and population growth. He demonstrated that the creation of public debt depresses savings in a growing economy. In the same issue James M. Buchanan also criticized Barro&#x27;s model, noting that &quot;[t]his is an age-old question in public finance theory&quot;, one already mooted by Ricardo and elaborated upon by de Viti.

In a response to the comments of Feldstein and Buchanan, Barro recognized that uncertainty may play a role in affecting individual behaviour with respect to government finance. Nevertheless, he argued that &quot;it is much less clear that this complication would imply systematic errors in a direction such that public debt issue raises aggregate demand.&quot;

In 1977, Gerald P. O&#x27;Driscoll commented that Ricardo, in expanding his treatment of this subject for an &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article, changed so many features of it as to result in a Ricardian Nonequivalence Theorem; he elaborated all the reasons why the proposition would not hold.

In 1989, Barro offered a number of defenses against various other critiques.

==Empirical results==

Ricardian equivalence has been the subject of extensive empirical inquiry. Barro himself found some confirmation in post WW I years.

However, research by Chris Carroll, James Poterba and Lawrence Summers shows that the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis is refuted by their results. In the Ronald Reagan era, the US government had a historically large budget deficit due to the Reagan administration tax cuts and increases in military spending. During 1976–80, government revenue was 10.01 percent of potential GNP, and it declined to 8.86 percent during 1981–1985. The ratio of the US government&#x27;s budget deficit to its potential GNP did not exceed 4 percent from World War II until 1981, and exceeded 4 percent after 1981. The ratio of an inflation- and cycle-adjusted deficit to the potential GNP was 2.56 percent during 1981–1986, and this ratio was the largest between 1958 and 1986. If the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis is true, the rational consumers of the economy, who expect the government to raise taxes, try to reduce their consumption and increase their saving. The reality was that the net private saving as a percentage of GNP was 8.55 in the 1976–1980 period, and it decreased to 7.47 percent in the 1981–1986 period. The ratio of consumption to GNP was 62.96 percent in the 1976–1980 period, and slightly increased to 64.72 percent in the 1981–1986 period.

The facts about private saving, government saving and consumption in the US are shown in Table 1. Their finding is that increases in government deficits are followed by decreases in private saving. They see the increase in the consumption-to-GNP ratio during 1981–86, when the governmental dissaving is accelerated by Reaganomics. Their results refute the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis.

==An argument for countercyclical fiscal policies==
Ricardian equivalence has crucial importance in the fiscal policy considerations of new classical macroeconomics. When assessing Ricardian equivalence or any of the new classical doctrines, one should bear in mind the conditional character of these theses. Thus the equivalence theorem should not be separated from the assumptions on which it is based. In other words, Ricardian equivalence does not mean that any countercyclical efforts will fail, but outlines the necessary conditions for that failure and, naturally, for success at the same time. Governments do not have any potential to exert countercyclical efforts if the path of government expenditures is fixed and if agents form rational expectations. If these conditions hold, cuts in taxes imply a later pressure to raise taxes, since government has to fill the resource gap in the budget which is the result of the initial tax cut. So, rational agents will put the additional income from the tax cut into saving, and consumption does not rise. In this story, if these processes can be changed by the government, or, in any way, the additional income can be believed not to be withdrawn later, the initial tax cut will induce a rise in public consumption expenditures.

So countercyclical fiscal policy can be effective if any one of the conditions necessary for the equivalence does not hold. Controlling the real economy is possible perhaps even in a Keynesian style if government regains its potential to exert this control. Therefore, actually, new classical macroeconomics highlights the conditions under which fiscal policy can be effective and not the inefficiency of fiscal policy. Countercyclical aspirations need not to be abandoned, only the playing-field of economic policy got narrowed by new classical macroeconomics. Keynes urged active countercyclical efforts of fiscal policy and these efforts are not predestined to fail not even in the new classical theory, only the conditions necessary for the efficiency of countercyclical efforts were specified by new classical macroeconomics. Ricardian equivalence underlines the importance of fiscal reforms, since such reforms are needed in order to change the path of government expenditures. When implementing comprehensive fiscal reforms which make public sector more efficient governments do not exert countercyclical efforts of course, but form the necessary conditions for regaining countercyclical potential. In this respect, Ricardian equivalence clarifies the exact conditions necessary for countercyclical fiscal policies.

<text>A nuclear family (also known as an elementary family, atomic family, or conjugal family) is a term for a family group consisting of parents and their children (one or more), typically living in one home residence. It is in contrast to a single-parent family, a larger extended family, or a family with more than two parents. Nuclear families typically center on a married couple that may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers. Some definitions allow only biological children who are full-blood siblings, some consider adopted or half- and step-siblings a part of the immediate family, but others allow for a step-parent and any mix of dependent children, including stepchildren and adopted children. 

Some sociologists and anthropologists consider the extended family structure to be the most common family structure in most cultures and at most times for humans, rather than the nuclear family.

The term &quot;nuclear family&quot; was popularized in the 20th century. Since that time, the number of North American nuclear families is gradually decreasing, while the number of alternative family formations has increased.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;nuclear family&quot; first appeared in the early 20th century. The American dictionary Merriam-Webster dates the term back to 1924, and the British &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has a reference to the term from 1925; thus the term is relatively new. The phrase is taken from the general use of the noun &quot;nucleus&quot;, originating in the Latin , meaning &#x27;nut&#x27;, i.e. the core of something.

In its most common use, the term &quot;nuclear family&quot; refers to a household consisting of a mother, a father, and their children, all living in one household dwelling. George Murdock, an observer of families, offered an early description: 

Many individuals are part of two nuclear families in their lives: the family of origin from which they are offspring, and the family of procreation for which they are a parent.

Alternative definitions have evolved to include family units with same-sex parents, adoption of members, and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role.

== History ==
DNA extracted from bones and teeth discovered at a 4,600-year-old Stone Age burial site in Germany has provided the earliest scientific evidence for the social recognition of a family unit consisting of two parents with their multiple children.

Historians Alan Macfarlane and Peter Laslett, among other European researchers, say that nuclear families have been a primary arrangement in England since the 13th century. This primary arrangement was different from the typical arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East, where it was common for young adults to remain residing in or marrying into a family home. In England, multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, &quot;the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving.&quot; Berger also mentions that this could be one of the reasons that the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries. However, the historicity of the nuclear family in England has been challenged by Cord Oestmann.

Influenced by church and theocratic governments, family unit structures of a married couple and their children were present in Western Europe and New England in the 17th century. With the emergence of proto-industrialization and early capitalism, the nuclear family became a financially viable social unit.

Conjugal family roles have changed over the course of history. Historically, marriages were exclusively opposite-sex and it was assumed that the male would be the head of the household and provide for the nuclear family while the woman would stay in the home and care for the children. However, conjugal roles have evolved over the years; in modern times, women often share breadwinning responsibilities with the men, and same-sex couples have become more common.

Since the time the term first coined, the number of North American nuclear families has gradually decreased, while the number of alternative family formations has increased.

== Compared with extended family ==

An extended family group consists of non-nuclear (or &quot;non-immediate&quot;) family members considered together with nuclear (or &quot;immediate&quot;) family members. When extended family is involved they also influence children&#x27;s development just as much as the parents would on their own. In an extended family resources are usually shared among those involved, adding more of a community aspect to the family unit. This is not limited to the sharing of objects and money, but includes sharing time. For example, extended family members such as grandparents are able to watch over grandchildren, allowing parents to pursue careers, and allows the parents to have reduced stress levels. Extended families also contribute to children&#x27;s mental health due to increased resources in terms of adult support.

== Changes to family formation ==

In 2005, information from the United States Census Bureau showed that 70% of children in the U.S. lived in two-parent families, with 66% of those living with parents who were married, and 60% living with their biological parents. Furthermore, &quot;the figures suggest that the tumultuous shifts in family structure since the late 1960s have leveled off since 1990&quot;. The Pew Research Center&#x27;s analysis of data from the American Community Survey and the decennial census revealed that the number of children living outside of the traditional ideal of parents marrying young and staying together till death has risen precipitously between the mid-to-late 20th century and the early 21th century. In 2013, only 43% of children lived with married parents who are in their first marriage, down from 73% in 1960. Meanwhile, the share of children living with a single parent was 34% in 2013, up from 9% in 1960.

When considered separately from couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children, the United States nuclear families appear to constitute a minority of households—with a rising prevalence of other family arrangements. In 2000, nuclear families with the original biological parents constituted roughly 24.10% of American households, compared with 40.30% in 1970. Roughly two-thirds of all children in the United States will spend at least some time in a single-parent household. According to some sociologists, &quot;[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today.&quot; (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). For this reason, a new term &quot;postmodern family&quot; has been introduced to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children. Nuclear family households are now less common compared to household with couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children.

In the UK, the number of nuclear families fell from 39.0% of all households in 1968 to 28.0% in 1992. The decrease accompanied an equivalent increase in the number of single-parent households and in the number of adults living alone.

Professor Wolfgang Haak of Adelaide University, detects traces of the nuclear family in prehistoric Central Europe. A 2005 archeological dig in Elau in Germany, analyzed by Haak, revealed genetic evidence suggesting that the 13 individuals found in a grave were closely related. Haak said, &quot;By establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave, we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in Central Europe... Their unity in death suggest[s] a unity in life.&quot; This paper does not regard the nuclear family as &quot;natural&quot; or as the only model for human family life, expressed as, &quot;This does not establish the elemental family to be a universal model or the most ancient institution of human communities. For example, polygamous unions are prevalent in ethnographic data and models of household communities have apparently been involving a high degree of complexity from their origins.&quot;

Lastly, large shifts in the financial landscape for families has made the historically middle class, traditional, nuclear family structure significantly more risky, expensive, and unstable. The expenses associated with raising a family; notably housing, medical care, and education, have all increased very rapidly, particularly since the 1950s. Since then middle class incomes have stagnated or even declined, whilst living costs have soared to the point where even two-income households are now unable to offer the same level of financial stability that once was possible under the single-income nuclear family household of the 1950s.

== Influences upon family size ==
As a fertility factor, single nuclear family households generally have a higher number of children than co-operative living arrangements, according to studies from both the Western world and India.

There are studies that show a difference in the number of children wanted per household according to where the family lives, finding that families living in rural areas wanted to have more children than families living in urban areas. A study conducted in Japan between October 2011 and February 2012 further researched the influence of area of residence on mean desired number of children. Researchers of the study in Japan came to the conclusion that the women living in rural areas with larger families were more likely to want more children, compared to women who lived in urban areas.

== &quot;Traditional&quot; North American family ==

For social conservatism in the United States and Canada, the idea that the nuclear family is traditional is a very important aspect, where family is the primary unit of society. These movements oppose alternative family forms and social institutions that are seen by them to undermine parental authority. The number of nuclear families is slowly dwindling in the U.S. as more women pursue higher education, develop professional lives, and delay having children until later in their life. Children and marriage have become less appealing as many women continue to face societal, familial, and/or peer pressure to give up their education and career to focus on stabilizing the home. As ethnic and cultural diversity continues to grow in the United States, it has become more difficult for the traditional nuclear family to remain a norm. Data from 2014 also suggests that single parents and the likelihood of children living with one parent is correlated with race. The Pew Research Center projected that 54% of African Americans will be single parents compared to only 19% of European Americans. Several factors account for the differences in family structure including economic and social class. Differences in education level also change the percentage of single parents. In 2014, those with less than a high school education were 46% more likely to be a single parent compared to 12% who were graduated from college.

Critics of the term &quot;traditional family&quot; point out that in most cultures and at most times in history, the extended family model has been the most common, not the nuclear family. The nuclear family has had a longer tradition in England than in other parts of Europe and Asia. England contributed large numbers of immigrants to the Americas, likely influencing the form considered &quot;traditional&quot; there and during the 1960s and 1970s, the nuclear family was documented as the most common form in the U.S.

The concept that narrowly defines a nuclear family as central to stability in modern society that has been promoted by familialists who are social conservatives in the United States has been challenged as historically and sociologically inadequate to describe the complexity of family relations dynamics. In &quot;Freudian Theories of Identification and Their Derivatives&quot; Urie Bronfenbrenner states, &quot;Very little is known about the extent variation in the behavior of fathers and mothers towards sons and daughters, and even less about the possible effects on such differential treatment.&quot; Little is known about how parental behavior and identification processes work, and how children interpret sex role learning. In his theory, he uses &quot;identification&quot; with the father in the sense that the son will follow the sex role provided by his father and then for the father to be able to identify the difference of the &quot;cross sex&quot; parent for his daughter.

== Law ==
Western societies often treat marriage as a legally-binding relationship, rather than an informal agreement. In these societies, both partners usually share control of their children&#x27;s upbringing. They both have roles as a parent to protect their children, oversee the development of their children in society, and see to the survival of their children. The term is also applied to partners who are in a committed relationship, but not legally married.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1977 was the 22nd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in London, United Kingdom, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; by Brotherhood of Man. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the contest was held at the Wembley Conference Centre on 7 May 1977, marking the first time the event took place in the month of May since the first contest in . The contest was directed by Stewart Morris and hosted by English journalist Angela Rippon.

Eighteen countries participated in the contest; returned after its absence from the previous edition, while decided not to enter.

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, performed by Marie Myriam, written by Joe Gracy, and composed by Jean-Paul Cara. The , , and rounded out the top five. Greece&#x27;s fifth place finish was their best result up to that point. France&#x27; fifth win was also a record at the time, and one that France held onto for six years, until being equalled by Luxembourg in .

== Location ==
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) staged the contest at the Wembley Conference Centre. The venue was the first purpose-built conference centre in the United Kingdom, and opened on 31 January 1977—making it a newly built venue at the time. It was demolished in 2006.

At the night of the contest, 2,000 spectators were present in the audience.

== Participating countries ==

 was set to participate in the contest and had been drawn to participate in fourth place, but later withdrew. decided not to enter and would not return to the contest until 1981 due to bad results in the years prior, while Sweden returned to the competition, having missed out the year before. This made for eighteen participating nations.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Beatrix Neundlinger and Günter Grosslercher as part of Schmetterlinge had represented as part of Milestones; Ilanit had represented ; The Swarbriggs had represented ; and Fernando Tordo and Paulo de Carvalho as part of Os Amigos had represented and respectively. In addition, Patricia Maessen, Bianca Maessen, and Stella Maessen as part of Dream Express representing Belgium, had represented the as Hearts of Soul; and Michèle Torr representing Monaco, had represented .

The language rule was brought back in this contest, four years after it had been dropped in . However and were allowed to sing in English, because they had already chosen the songs they were going to perform before the rule was reintroduced.

== Format ==
The contest was originally planned to be held on 2 April 1977, but because of a strike of the BBC cameramen and its technicians, it got postponed for a month. As a result, this was the first Eurovision Song Contest to be staged in May since the inaugural edition.

Due to strikes by the BBC camera staff, and lack of time to organise the contest, there were no postcards for the viewers in between the songs. However, various shots of the contest&#x27;s audience were shown, with the various countries&#x27; commentators informing the viewers of the upcoming songs. The intended postcards had been devised using footage of the artists in London during a party hosted by the BBC at a London nightclub. When the postcards were seen for the first time by the participant heads of delegation at the Friday dress rehearsal the day before the final, the Norwegian delegation objected to the way their artist was portrayed. However, as it was not possible for the BBC to edit or revise footage, all the postcards had to be dropped from the broadcast. Footage from the party still formed the interval act broadcast prior to the voting sequence.

== Contest overview ==

The following tables reflect the final official scores, verified after the contest transmission. During the voting sequence of the live show, several errors were made in the announcement of the scores, which were then adjusted after the broadcast. Both Greece and France duplicated scores, awarding the same points to multiple countries. From the Greek scores, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria, and Finland all had 1 point deducted after the contest and from the French scores, Austria, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Belgium all had 1 point deducted. None of the adjustments affected the placing of any of the songs.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1977 contest are listed below.

* Ralph Inbar
* Sven Lindahl
* Colin Berry

== Detailed voting results ==

=== 12 points ===

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in Algeria, Denmark, Iceland, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union via Intervision; and in Hong Kong. At least 36 television organizations were reported to broadcast the final. Estimates for the global viewership ranged from 250 to 500 million viewers.

<text>The White House (; officially The House of the Government of the Russian Federation, ), also known as the Russian White House and previously known as the House of Soviets of Russia, is a government building in Moscow. It stands on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. The building serves as the primary office of the government of Russia and is the official workplace of the Russian Prime Minister.

It was built from 1965 to 1981 according to the design of architect Dmitry Chechulin to house the People&#x27;s Control Committee and the Supreme Soviet of Russia. During the August 1991 coup attempt, the building became a center of resistance to the State Committee on the State of Emergency. The structure was badly damaged during the 1993 constitutional crisis and was subsequently reconstructed.

==History==

=== Construction and use in the Soviet Union ===

In 1965, construction of the House of Soviets began to accommodate the administrative bodies of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) at this site. The plan for the reconstruction of the territory was prepared by a group of architects known as Mosproekt-1, led by Dmitry Chechulin, Pavel Shteller, Vladimir Lukyanov, and others, alongside a team of engineers. The overall design follows Chechulin&#x27;s 1934 draft of the Aeroflot building. Initially, Chechulin proposed constructing the building on Taganka Square, which rises above a significant part of the city, as the site on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment was inconvenient due to nearby buildings; however, because of the good view alongside the high bank of the Moskva River, the current location was chosen instead.

The House of Soviets was the first multi-storey building in which a uniformly shaped prefabricated reinforced concrete frame with monolithic stiffness cores was used. Outside, the structure was lined with individual claydite concrete panels, which were previously finished with marble. The total area of the complex was 732,000 square meters, with a total area of office space around 132,000 square meters. The building was designed with a complex three-level system of underground floors, where parking, bunkers, ventilation chambers and refrigeration equipment were located. The structure was equipped with a separate sewerage and an autonomous power supply system. There is a theory that the building is connected by underground passages to subway tunnels, but official sources do not confirm or refute this information. According to the memoirs of one of the builders, Felix Mikhailovich Ashurov, when installing the flagpole, Dmitry Chechulin ordered it to be shortened by three meters for a more harmonious combination of proportions; however, due to possible delays, workers were ordered to install the already prepared bar in secret from the architect over a weekend.

Construction was completed in 1981, with a total cost exceeding 94 million rubles. After the completion of the project, team leader Dmitry Chechulin, architect Vitaly Mazurin, and designer Yuri Dykhovichny were awarded the Lenin Prize. From 1981 to 1993, the Supreme Soviet of Russia, which had until then held its sessions in the Grand Kremlin Palace, used the White House. The Supreme Soviet of Russia remained in the building until the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, as well as during the first years of the Russian Federation. In 1991 the Soviet Union issued a 50-kopeck stamp depicting the White House and honoring resistance to the 1991 Soviet coup attempt.

=== Role in 1991 coup d&#x27;état attempt ===
In August 1991, the House of Soviets became the center of a confrontation against the State Committee on the State of Emergency. The opposition was headed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in support of whom large-scale rallies were held around the building. During this period, Yeltsin repeatedly spoke to the audience, with his most famous speech being delivered on August 19 from a tank of the Taman Division. At that time, the building was surrounded by a living chain of Muscovites who supported the president. An improvised barricade was built around the building, using materials such as garbage cans, fences of nearby parks, benches, and sawn trees. Protestors also painted graffiti of political topics on the walls of the building. By August 20, approximately two hundred thousand people had gathered around the structure including public and political figures Ruslan Khasbulatov, Ivan Silayev, Alexander Rutskoy, Eduard Shevardnadze, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Mstislav Rostropovich, Andrey Makarevich, and others.

The building was not stormed, presumably due to the possible number of civilian and military casualties. Later, the events that took place near the walls of the House of Soviets and elsewhere in the Soviet Union were defined as the August Coup. It was during this period that the name &quot;White House&quot; was assigned to the building, which was widely used by the state media. In 1992, the building was depicted on the back side of commemorative coins in honor of the &quot;victory of democratic forces&quot; and the anniversary of Russia&#x27;s state sovereignty.

=== Forceful dispersal of the Supreme Soviet of Russia ===
In the midst of the constitutional crisis of 1993, Boris Yeltsin issued Decree No. 1400 to dissolve the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of Russia. The House of Soviets was disconnected from television and radio. According to the conclusion of the Constitutional Court, the president&#x27;s actions were illegal and contradicted the Russian Constitution of 1978. An emergency session of the Supreme Soviet was convened, during which, among other things, it was decided to protect the building from possible siege. The events caused a spontaneous rally near the walls of the building. Protective detachments from security, civilians, Cossack volunteer formations and retired military personnel were organized at the House of Soviets. Data on weapons stored in the building vary. From September 23 to October 4, 1993, the Tenth Session of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Russian Federation was held in the building, as the conference hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace was closed for repair. The Congress and the Supreme Soviet stated the termination of the powers of President Boris Yeltsin and their transfer to Vice President Alexander Rutskoy. 

During this period, rallies were held in different parts of Moscow, which caused armed skirmishes, and the territory around the building was recognized as a particularly dangerous zone. At a meeting of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, it was decided to storm the House of Soviets, after which President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on attracting troops from the Ministry of Defense to Moscow. During the seizure of the building, six tanks from the Taman Division that were placed on the Novoarbatsky Bridge fired 12 shells at the upper floors of the building. Arkady Baskaev, who was appointed commandant of the House of Soviets after the assault, said that the fire in the building of the Supreme Soviet arose as a result of shelling from tanks. Subsequently, Alexander Rutskoy described the incident as follows:

Because of the shelling, a fire began on the 12th and 13th floors of the White House. The fire covered the entire upper part and destroyed 30% of the total area of the building, later the damage was estimated at 170 billion rubles. The situation in the White House after the assault was described by a correspondent of the Kommersant newspaper:

Ruslan Khasbulatov, referring to eyewitness letters in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, states that there were about 1,500 victims in total, whose bodies were taken out of the building in secret passages.

=== End of the 20th century and the present ===

Following the events of the 1993 constitutional crisis, control of the building was transferred via a decree by Boris Yeltsin to the Government of the Russian Federation (the executive branch), under whose control the reconstruction of the building took place. The reformed parliament, known thereafter by its Imperial-era title of the State Duma, was elected in December 1993 and moved to another building on Moscow&#x27;s Okhotny Ryad. 

American architect Charles Jencks suggested that restorers mark the burnt floors on the facade with black granite cladding; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of recreating the original appearance of the complex. According to some data, repairs on the upper floors of the building were carried out by Turkish workers. During the restoration work, the clock on the tower of the main facade of the building was restored and reused; however, by the second half of 1994, the clock was dismantled and a golden image of a double-headed eagle – the coat of arms of Russia – had been installed in its place. During this, the building was fenced off from the embankment with a massive fence that prevented rallies at the walls of the building. Nevertheless, protesters continued to gather next to the White House on the Humpback Bridge. In 1996, on the territory of the nearby Presnensky Park, a chapel was opened in memory of those who died in the House of Soviets.

Restoration work was carried out for almost a year, and in 1994 the repaired complex was occupied by the Government of the Russian Federation. An inscription at the base of the tower reads &quot;House of the Government of the Russian Federation,&quot; the official name of the building. There is an office for the President of Russia located on the third floor of the building. Traditionally, at the end of each year, the President holds meetings with the Council of Ministers in the White House, but ordinary meetings are rarely held in the building. In 2008, there was a large-scale reconstruction of the fifth floor of the building. At the same time, some media outlets reported on the construction of a swimming pool and gym within the building, but official sources did not confirm this information. A year later, a private restaurant was opened on the twelfth floor of the complex. In 2012, plans were made to move the offices of the officials to a new federal center in Kommunarka, but this idea was postponed indefinitely. The following year, a helipad was installed near the building.

In September 2020, the press service of the Government of the Russian Federation reported that the condition of White House was recognized as an emergency, citing issues with the roof and leaks in the basement among other issues. The Russian government has planned to allocate more than 5 billion rubles for reconstruction purposes.

==Architecture==
During the construction of the White House, Dmitry Chechulin used elements of his unrealized 1934 design for the headquarters of state airline Aeroflot. The original idea for the Aeroflot building was developed in honor of the rescue, by Soviet pilots, of the passengers of the sunken steamship . The construction was supposed to have simplified forms; the stylobate of the building was similar in size to the ship, it was supplemented with numerous sculptural compositions. The main entrance of the planned building emphasized the portico, which resembled a triumphal arch. It was assumed that the Aeroflot building would form a new look for the Belorussky railway station square; but the structure did not correspond to the site in size and configuration, so it was never built.

In 1965, Dmitry Chechulin used his plans for the unrealized project of the Aeroflot building to develop the plans for the future House of Soviets. However, the monumental complex of the White House differed from the original idea of the architect. The simplified composition of the building had a symmetrical pyramidal structure composed of three parts. The powerful base with divergent ramps and a front staircase is supported by a wide seven-storey building with side wings. Above them stands a twenty-storey tower with rounded edges. The strict rhythm of the windows is disturbed on the upper technical floor, where the openings are much narrower. The outer walls of the structure are lined with granite and white marble. The building is crowned by a small tower with a gilded Russian coat of arms and a flagpole on which the national flag is fixed. The height of the structure with the flagpole is 119 meters; without it, 102 meters. The building was the last lifetime project of Dmitry Chechulin and is a unique object of Moscow&#x27;s development, forming a panorama of the embankment.

The premises of the complex are decorated with multicolored stone marble inserts. The main assembly hall is located in the central part of the seven-storey base and faces the Moscow River. In total, the building has 27 meeting and reception rooms.

<text>Gabrán mac Domangairt (Old Welsh: &quot;Gawran map Dinwarch&quot;) or Gabrán the Traitor (&quot;Gwran Wradouc&quot;) was king of Dál Riata in the mid-6th century. He is the eponymous ancestor of the Cenél nGabráin. Gabrán was the son of Domangart Réti and the father of Áedán mac Gabráin.

The historical evidence for Gabrán is limited to the notice of his death in the Irish and Welsh annals. It is possible that Gabrán&#x27;s death should be linked to a migration or flight from Bridei mac Maelchon, but this may be no more than coincidence.

<doc id="193154" wikidata="Q457287" url="?curid=193154" title="Anthony Hope">
<text>Sir Anthony Hope Hawkins (9 February 1863 – 8 July 1933), better known as Anthony Hope, was a British novelist and playwright. He was a prolific writer, especially of adventure novels but he is remembered predominantly for only two books: &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1894) and its sequel &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; (1898).

These works, &quot;minor classics&quot; of English literature, are set in the contemporaneous fictional country of Ruritania and spawned the genre known as Ruritanian romance, books set in fictional European locales similar to the novels. &quot;Zenda&quot; has inspired many adaptations, most notably the 1937 Hollywood movie of the same name and the 1952 version.

==Early career and &quot;Zenda&quot;==

Hope was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, Marlborough College and Balliol College, Oxford. In an academically distinguished career at Oxford he obtained first-class honours in Classical Moderations (Literis Graecis et Latinis) in 1882 and in Literae Humaniores (&#x27;Greats&#x27;) in 1885.

Hope trained as a lawyer and barrister, being called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1887. He served his pupillage under the future Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, who thought him a promising barrister and who was disappointed by his decision to turn to writing.

Hope had time to write, as his working day was not overfull during these early years and he lived with his widowed father, then vicar of St Bride&#x27;s Church, Fleet Street. His short pieces appeared in periodicals but for his first book, he was forced to resort to a self-publishing press. &quot;A Man of Mark&quot; (1890) is notable primarily for its similarities to &quot;Zenda&quot;: it is set in an imaginary country, Aureataland, and features political upheaval and humour. More novels and short stories followed, including &quot;Father Stafford&quot; in 1891 and the mildly successful &quot;Mr Witt&#x27;s Widow&quot; in 1892. He stood as the Liberal candidate for Wycombe in the election of 1892 but was not elected.

In 1893, he wrote three novels (&quot;Sport Royal&quot;, &quot;A Change of Air&quot; and &quot;Half-a-Hero&quot;) and a series of sketches that first appeared in &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; and were collected in 1894 as &quot;The Dolly Dialogues&quot;, illustrated by Arthur Rackham.

&quot;Dolly&quot; was his first major literary success. A. E. W. Mason deemed these conversations &quot;so truly set in the London of their day that the social historian would be unwise to neglect them,&quot; and said that they were written with &quot;delicate wit [and] a shade of sadness.&quot;

The idea for Hope&#x27;s tale of political intrigue, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda, being the history of three months in the life of an English gentleman&quot;, came to him at the close of 1893 as he was walking in London. Hope finished the first draft in a month and the book was in print by April. The story is set in the fictional European kingdom of &#x27;Ruritania&#x27;, a term which has come to mean &quot;the novelist&#x27;s and dramatist&#x27;s locale for court romances in a modern setting.&quot; &quot;Zenda&quot; achieved instant success and its witty protagonist, the debonair Rudolf Rassendyll, became a well-known literary creation. The novel was praised by Mason, literary critic Andrew Lang, and Robert Louis Stevenson.

The popularity of &quot;Zenda&quot; persuaded Hope to give up the &quot;brilliant legal career [that] seemed to lie ahead of him&quot; to become a full-time writer but he &quot;never again achieved such complete artistic success as in this one book.&quot; Also in 1894, Hope produced &quot;The God in the Car&quot;, a political story, which the late nineteenth-century English novelist George Gissing thought was &quot;of course vastly inferior to what I had supposed from the reviews&quot;.

==Later years==
Hope wrote 32 volumes of fiction over the course of his lifetime and he had a large popular following. In 1896 he published &quot;The Chronicles of Count Antonio&quot;, followed in 1897 by a tale of adventure set on a Greek island, entitled &quot;Phroso&quot;. He went on a publicity tour of the United States in late 1897, during which he impressed a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter as being somewhat like Rudolf Rassendyll: a well-dressed Englishman with a hearty laugh, a soldierly attitude, a dry sense of humour, &quot;quiet, easy manners&quot;, and an air of shrewdness.
In 1898, he wrote &quot;Simon Dale&quot;, a historical novel involving actress and courtesan Nell Gwyn. Marie Tempest appeared in the dramatisation, called &quot;English Nell&quot;. One of Hope&#x27;s plays, &quot;The Adventure of Lady Ursula&quot;, was produced in 1898. This was followed by his novel &quot;The King&#x27;s Mirror&quot; (1899), which Hope considered one of his best works; and Captain Dieppe (1899). In 1900, he published &quot;Quisanté&quot; and he was elected chairman of the committee of the Society of Authors. He wrote &quot;Tristram of Blent&quot; in 1901, &quot;The Intrusions of Peggy&quot; in 1902, and &quot;Double Harness&quot; in 1904, followed by &quot;A Servant of the Public&quot; in 1905, about the love of acting.

In 1906, he produced &quot;Sophy of Kravonia&quot;, a novel in a similar vein to &quot;Zenda&quot; which was serialised in &quot;The Windsor Magazine&quot;; Roger Lancelyn Green is especially damning of this effort. Nevertheless, the story was filmed twice, in Italy in 1916 as &quot;Sofia De Kravonia&quot;, and in the United States in 1920 as &quot;Sophy of Kravonia or, The Virgin of Paris&quot;. Both adaptations featured the actress Diana Karenne in the title role (billed as &quot;Diana Kareni&quot; in the latter film).

In 1907, a collection of his short stories and novelettes was published under the title &quot;Tales of Two People&quot;; as well as the novel &quot;Helena&#x27;s Path&quot;. In 1910, he wrote &quot;Second String&quot;, followed by &quot;Mrs Maxon Protests&quot; the next year.

Hope wrote and co-wrote many plays and political non-fiction during the First World War, some under the auspices of the Ministry of Information. Later publications included &quot;The Secret of the Tower&quot;, and &quot;Beaumaroy Home from the Wars&quot;, in 1919 and &quot;Lucinda&quot; in 1920. Lancelyn Green asserts that Hope was &quot;a first-class amateur but only a second-class professional writer.

==Personal life==
Hope married Elizabeth Somerville (1885/6–1946) in 1903 and they had two sons and a daughter. He was knighted in 1918 for his contribution to propaganda efforts during World War I.

He published an autobiographical book, &quot;Memories and Notes&quot;, in 1927.

==Death==
Hope died of throat cancer at the age of 70 at his country home, Heath Farm at Walton-on-the-Hill in Surrey. There is a blue plaque on his house in Bedford Square, London.

<doc id="193155" wikidata="Q878696" url="?curid=193155" title="Comgall mac Domangairt">
<text>Comgall mac Domangairt was king of Dál Riata in the early 6th century. He was the son of Domangart Réti and grandson of Fergus Mór. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; report his death in 538, 542 and 545, the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; in 537.

==Comgall==
Nothing certain is known of Comgall beyond the fact of his death, but he is significant as the eponymous founder of the Cenél Comgaill, one of the kindreds of Dál Riata named by the &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot;. The &quot;Senchus&quot;, in fact, speaks of the Crich Comgaill, but the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; use the term &quot;cenél&quot; in a report of 710.

The &quot;Senchus&quot; says that Comgall had one son, Conall, and that Conall had seven sons, although only six are named: Loingsech, Nechtan, Artan, Tuatan, Tutio, and Coirpre. It may be that Coirpre was a later addition as the &quot;Senchus&quot; speaks of the people of Coirpre as being distinct from the sons of Erc. As with all claimed early genealogies, this need not be taken as reliable information. Unlike Cenél nGabráin and Cenél Loairn, no later genealogy traces back to the Cenél Comgaill, although one from the early 8th century survives appended to a copy of the &quot;Senchus&quot;.

==Cenél Comgaill==
The Irish annals speak relatively rarely of the Cenél Comgaill. A recent interpretation suggests, however, that the kindred may have been important in the Gaelicisation of the Picts, as a certain Dargart mac Finguine of the Cenél Comgaill married the Pictish princess Der-Ilei, and the Pictish kings Bridei and Nechtan mac Der Ilei were the result of this marriage.

The Cenél Comgaill are thought to have been centred in Cowal, which is plausibly derived from Comgall or Comgaill, and the Isle of Bute. They may also have controlled the Isle of Arran to the south. The royal centres of their kingdom are not certainly known. Dunoon may have been important. The late 6th- or early 7th-century Saint Blane was reportedly associated with Bute, but modern scholars are less certain that his traditions are authentic. The monastery at Kingarth associated with Saint Blane is mentioned in the annals. It lies close to the Dunagoil fort, which might be a plausible royal centre, but it is not clear that this was occupied in the corresponding period.

<text>Domangart Réti was king of Dál Riata in the early 6th century, following his father&#x27;s death, Fergus Mór.

He had at least two sons: Comgall and Gabrán, both of whom became kings in succession. The &quot;Tripartite Life of St. Patrick&quot; states that he was present at the saint&#x27;s death, c. 493. Domangart died around 507 and was succeeded by Comgall.

His byname, Réti, appears in Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Columba&quot;, in the form Corcu Réti, perhaps a synonym for Dál Riata. Corcu, a Primitive Irish language term for a kin group, usually combined with the name of a divine or mythical ancestor, is similar to the term Dál. Alternatively, rather than representing an alternative name for all of Dál Riata, it has been suggested Corcu Réti was the name given to the kin group which later divided to form the Cenél nGabráin of Kintyre and the Cenél Comgaill of Cowal, thus excluding the Cenél nÓengusa of Islay and the Cenél Loairn of middle and northern Argyll.

<text>Fergus Mór mac Eirc (; English: Fergus the Great) was a possible king of Dál Riata. He was the son of Erc of Dalriada.

While his historicity may be debatable, his posthumous importance as the founder of Scotland in the national myth of medieval and Renaissance Scotland is not in doubt. Rulers of Scotland from Cináed mac Ailpín until the present time claim descent from Fergus Mór.

==Early sources==
There is reference to the Fergus Mór tradition in the Irish notulae, &quot;Book of Armagh&quot;, although copied in the 9th century it is written in 8th-century language, possibly even 7th-century, predating the supposed invention of myth proposed by Campbell 200 to 300 years later, proving that Fergus Mór is not a product of 10th-century propaganda.
The historical record, such as it is, consists of an entry in the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;, for the year 501, which states: (Fergus Mór mac Eirc, with the people of Dál Riata, held part of Britain, and he died there.) However, the forms of Fergus, Erc and Dál Riata are later ones, written down long after the 6th century. The record in the Annals has given rise to theories of invasions of Argyll from Ireland, but these are not considered authentic.

The Genealogy of Fergus is found in the king lists of Dál Riata, and later of Scotland, of which the Senchus Fer n-Alban and the Duan Albanach can be taken as examples. The Senchus states that Fergus Mór was also known as Mac Nisse Mór. These sources probably date from the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively, between 20 and 30 generations after Fergus may have lived.

The Senchus and the Duan name Fergus&#x27;s father as Erc son of Eochaid Muinremuir. A Middle Irish genealogy of the kings of Alba gives an extensive genealogy for Fergus: [Fergus] m. h-Eircc m. Echdach Muinremuir m. Óengusa Fir m. Feideilmid m. Óengusa m. Feideilmid m. Cormaicc, and a further 46 generations here omitted.

These sources, while they offer evidence for the importance of Fergus Mór in medieval times, are not evidence for his historical career. Indeed, only one king in the 6th century in Scotland is known from contemporary evidence, Ceretic of Alt Clut, and even this identification rests upon a later gloss to Saint Patrick&#x27;s &quot;Letter to Coroticus&quot;. The first kings of Dál Riata whose existences are reasonably sure are Fergus&#x27;s grandsons Gabrán mac Domangairt and Comgall, or perhaps his great-grandson Áedán mac Gabráin.

In the contexts of Patrician tradition, legendary accounts and symbolic description, the figure twelve is mentioned with reference to the sons of Erc.

==Later accounts==
Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s early-15th-century &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot; says that Fergus was the first Scot to rule in Scotland, and that Cináed mac Ailpín was his descendant. In addition, he writes that Fergus brought the Stone of Scone with him from Ireland, that he was succeeded by a son named Dúngal. A list of kings follows which is corrupt but bears some relation to those found in earlier sources.

If Wyntoun&#x27;s account adds little to earlier ones, at the end of the 16th century George Buchanan in his added much, generally following John of Fordun. In this version, the Scots had been expelled from Scotland when the Romans under one Maximus conquered all of Britain. His father Eugenius had been killed by the Romans, and Fergus, Fergusius II according to Buchanan&#x27;s count, was raised in exile in Scandinavia. He later fought with the Franks, before eventually returning to Scotland and reconquering the Scottish lands. He was killed in battle against Durstus, king of the Picts, and was succeeded by his son Eugenius. A linked tradition traces the origin of Clan Cameron to the son of the royal family of Denmark who assisted Fergus II in the above restoration to Scotland.

Buchanan&#x27;s king, James VI, shared the scholar&#x27;s view of the origins of his line, describing himself in one of many verses written to his wife Anne of Denmark, as the &quot;happie Monarch sprung of Ferguse race&quot;. Nor was James VI the last ruler to share this belief. The Great Gallery of the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh was decorated with eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet&#x27;s portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus to Charles II, produced to the order of James&#x27;s grandson.

James II&#x27;s Irish partisans welcomed the king at Kilkenny during the Williamite War, declaring, &quot;We conducted a Fergus to Scotland; we welcome in James the Second the undoubted heir of Fergus by the lineal descent of one hundred and ten crowned heads&quot;.

<doc id="193164" wikidata="Q202673" url="?curid=193164" title="SMS Gneisenau">
<text>SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was an armored cruiser of the German &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (Imperial Navy), part of the two-ship . Named for the earlier screw corvette of the same name, the ship was laid down in June 1904 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, launched in June 1906, and commissioned in March 1908. She was armed with a main battery of eight guns, a significant increase in firepower over earlier German armored cruisers, and she had a top speed of . &quot;Gneisenau&quot; initially served with the German fleet in I Scouting Group, though her service there was limited owing to the British development of the battlecruiser by 1909, which the less powerful armored cruisers could not effectively combat.

Accordingly, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was assigned to the German East Asia Squadron, where she joined her sister ship . The two cruisers formed the core of the squadron, which included several light cruisers. Over the next four years, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; patrolled Germany&#x27;s colonial possessions in Asia and the Pacific Ocean. She also toured foreign ports to show the flag and monitored events in China during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, crossed the Pacific to the western coast of South America, stopping for &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to attack French Polynesia in the Bombardment of Papeete in September.

After arriving off the coast of Chile, the East Asia Squadron encountered and defeated a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel; during the action, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; disabled the British armored cruiser , which was then sunk by the German light cruiser . The defeat prompted the British Admiralty to detach two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy Spee&#x27;s squadron, which they accomplished at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was sunk with heavy loss of life, though 187 of her crew were rescued by the British.

== Design==

The two &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;-class cruisers were ordered as part of the naval construction program laid out in the Second Naval Law of 1900, which called for a force of fourteen armored cruisers. The ships marked a significant increase in combat power over their predecessors, the , being more heavily armed and armored. These improvements were made to allow for and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; to fight in the line of battle should the need arise, a capability requested by the General Department.

&quot;Gneisenau&quot; was long overall, and had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced normally, and at full load. &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s crew consisted of 38 officers and 726 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a screw propeller, with steam provided by eighteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. The boilers were ducted into four funnels located amidships. Her propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of .

&quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s primary armament consisted of eight SK L/40 guns, four in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the main superstructure on the centerline, and the remaining four mounted in single casemates in the hull at main deck level, abreast the funnels. The secondary armament included six SK L/40 guns, also in individual casemates that were placed a deck below the main battery casemates. Defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of eighteen SK L/35 guns mounted in casemates. She was also equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes. One was mounted in the bow, one on each broadside, and the fourth was placed in the stern.

The ship was protected by a 15 cm belt of Krupp armor, decreased to forward and aft of the central citadel. She had an armored deck that was thick, with the heavier armor protecting the ship&#x27;s engine and boiler rooms and ammunition magazines. The centerline gun turrets had thick sides, while the casemate main guns received 15 cm of armor protection. The casemate secondary battery was protected by a strake of armor that was thick.

== Service history ==
&quot;Gneisenau&quot; was the first member of the class to be ordered, on 8 June 1904; she was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen on 28 December under yard number 144. A lengthy strike by shipyard workers delayed construction of the vessel, allowing &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to be launched first and thus be the lead ship of the class. At &quot;Gneisenau&quot;&#x27;s launching ceremony, on 14 June 1906, she was christened &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, in honor of the earlier screw corvette , by General Alfred von Schlieffen, the Chief of the General Staff. The ship moved to Wilhelmshaven for fitting-out and was commissioned into the fleet on 6 March 1908, before beginning sea trials on 26 March. These lasted until 12 July, when &quot;Gneisenau&quot; joined I Scouting Group, the reconnaissance squadron of the High Seas Fleet. During this period, &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (&quot;KzS&quot;—Captain at Sea) Franz von Hipper served as the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer.

While serving in I Scouting Group, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; participated in the normal peacetime training routine with the fleet. She took part in a major fleet cruise in the Atlantic Ocean in company with the battleship squadrons of the High Seas Fleet immediately after completing trials. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters. The cruise came at a time that tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high, though no incidents occurred as a result. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September, after which Hipper was replaced by &quot;KzS&quot; .

The year 1909 followed a similar pattern, with two more Atlantic cruises, the first in February and March and the second in July and August. The latter voyage included a visit to Spain. Later in the year, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and the light cruiser escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II aboard his yacht, &quot;Hohenzollern&quot;, on a visit to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia off the coast of Finland. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; won the Kaiser&#x27;s &quot;Schießpreis&quot; (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting among armored cruisers for the 1908–1909 training year. The first half of the following year passed uneventfully for &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and in July, she took part in a fleet cruise to Norway. On 8 September, the ship was reassigned to the East Asia Squadron and &quot;KzS&quot; took command of the ship for the deployment. By that time, the British Royal Navy had begun commissioning their new battlecruisers, which significantly outclassed armored cruisers like &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, but the German command decided that the ship could still be used to strengthen Germany&#x27;s colonial cruiser squadron.

===East Asia Squadron===
On 10 November, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for Germany&#x27;s Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory in China. She stopped in Málaga, Spain, while en route, for a ceremony commemorating the men killed when her namesake corvette had been wrecked there on 16 December 1900. She then passed through the Mediterranean Sea, transited the Suez Canal, and while crossing the Indian Ocean, stopped in Colombo, Ceylon. There, she embarked Crown Prince Wilhelm on 11 December, who was on a tour of British India at the time. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; carried him to Bombay, where he left the ship. After resuming the voyage to East Asia, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; rendezvoused with the light cruiser and made stops in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Amoy before arriving in Qingdao, the German squadron&#x27;s home port, on 14 March 1911. There, she rendezvoused with her sister &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, the squadron flagship. On 7 April, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; carried the new ambassador to Japan, , from Taku to Yokohama, where she met &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;; the squadron commander, &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (&quot;KAdm&quot;—Rear Admiral) , Uslar, and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s captain met with the Emperor Meiji. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; thereafter went on a tour of Japanese and Siberian waters, but she was sent back to Qingdao during the Agadir Crisis to prepare for a potential conflict.

In September, Krosigk shifted his flag to &quot;Gneisenau&quot; while &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was in dry dock for periodic maintenance. On 10 October, the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty broke out, which caused a great deal of tension among Europeans in the country, who recalled the attacks on foreigners during the Boxer Uprising of 1900–1901. The rest of the East Asia Squadron was placed on alert to protect German interests and additional troops were sent to protect the German consulate. But the feared attacks on Europeans did not materialize and so the East Asia Squadron was not needed. By late November, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was back in service and Krosigk returned to her. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; won the &quot;Schießpreis&quot; again for the 1910–1911 training year. 

&quot;Gneisenau&quot; went into dry dock in Qingdao for annual repairs in the first quarter of 1912. On 13 April, the ships embarked on a month-long cruise to Japanese waters, returning to Qingdao on 13 May. In June, &quot;KzS&quot; relieved Uslar as &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s commander. Over the course of 1–4 August, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; steamed to Pusan, Korea, where she pulled the HAPAG steamship free after it ran aground and escorted it to Nagasaki. At the end of the year, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; lay at Shanghai. In early December, Krosigk was replaced by &quot;KAdm&quot; Maximilian von Spee, who took &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; on a tour of the southwest Pacific, including stops in Amoy, Singapore, and Batavia. The cruise continued into early 1913, and the two cruisers arrived back in Qingdao on 2 March 1913. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; won the &quot;Schießpreis&quot; for the 1912–1913 year.

In April 1913, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; went to Japan so Spee and the ships&#x27; commanders could meet with the new emperor, Taishō. The vessels then returned to Qingdao, where they remained for seven weeks. In late June, the two cruisers began a cruise through Germany&#x27;s colonial possessions in the central Pacific. While in Rabaul on 21 July, Spee received word of further unrest in China, which prompted his return to the Wusong roadstead outside Shanghai by 30 July. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; thereafter patrolled in the Yellow Sea and visited Port Arthur in October. After the situation calmed, Spee was able to take his ships on a short cruise to Japan, which began on 11 November. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the rest of the squadron returned to Shanghai on 29 November, before she departed for another trip to Southeast Asia. Stops included Siam, Sumatra, North Borneo, and Manila in the Philippines.

In June 1914, &quot;KzS&quot; Julius Maerker took command of the ship. Shortly thereafter, Spee embarked on a cruise to German New Guinea; &quot;Gneisenau&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; in Nagasaki, Japan, where they received a full supply of coal. They then sailed south, arriving in Truk in early July where they restocked their coal supplies. While en route, they received news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Caroline Islands. Here, Spee had access to the German radio network, where he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia and the Russian mobilization. On 31 July, word came that the German ultimatum, which demanded the demobilization of Russia&#x27;s armies, was set to expire. Spee ordered his ships be stripped for war. On 2 August, Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against France and Russia.

=== World War I ===
When World War I broke out, the East Asia Squadron consisted of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and the light cruisers &quot;Emden&quot;, , and . At the time, &quot;Nürnberg&quot; was returning from the west coast of the United States, where &quot;Leipzig&quot; had just replaced her, and &quot;Emden&quot; was still in Qingdao. On 6 August 1914, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, the supply ship &quot;Titania&quot;, and the Japanese collier &quot;Fukoku Maru&quot; were still in Ponape. Spee had issued orders to recall the light cruisers, which had been dispersed on cruises around the Pacific. &quot;Nürnberg&quot; joined Spee that day, after which Spee moved his ships to Pagan Island in the Northern Mariana Islands, a German possession in the central Pacific. Spee left for Pagan in the night, without &quot;Fukoku Maru&quot;, to avoid having the Japanese crew betray his movements.

All available colliers, supply ships, and passenger liners were ordered to meet the East Asia Squadron in Pagan and &quot;Emden&quot; joined the squadron there on 12 August. The auxiliary cruiser joined Spee&#x27;s ships there as well. On 13 August, Commodore Karl von Müller, captain of the &quot;Emden&quot;, persuaded Spee to detach his ship as a commerce raider. The four cruisers, accompanied by &quot;Prinz Eitel Friedrich&quot; and several colliers, then departed Pagan on 15 August, bound for Chile. While en route to Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands the next morning, &quot;Emden&quot; left the formation with one of the colliers. The remaining ships again coaled after their arrival in Enewetak on 20 August.

To keep the German high command informed, on 8 September Spee detached &quot;Nürnberg&quot; to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. &quot;Nürnberg&quot; returned with news of the Allied capture of German Samoa, which had taken place on 29 August. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; sailed to Apia to investigate the situation. Spee had hoped to catch a British or Australian warship by surprise, but upon his arrival on 14 September, he found no warships in the harbor. On 22 September, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the rest of the East Asia Squadron arrived at the French colony of Papeete. The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing battle of Papeete, they sank the French gunboat &quot;Zélée&quot;. The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented Spee from entering the harbor to seize the coal, which the French had set on fire.

By 12 October, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and the rest of the squadron had reached Easter Island. There they were joined by the light cruisers and &quot;Leipzig&quot;, which had sailed from American waters, on 12 and 14 October, respectively. &quot;Leipzig&quot; also brought three more colliers with her. After a week in the area, the ships departed for Chile. On the evening of 26 October, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and the rest of the squadron steamed out of Mas a Fuera, Chile and headed eastward, arriving in Valparaíso on 30 October. On 1 November, Spee learned from &quot;Prinz Eitel Friedrich&quot; that the British light cruiser had been anchored in Coronel the previous day, so he turned towards the port to try to catch her alone.

==== Battle of Coronel ====


The British had scant resources to oppose the German squadron off the coast of South America. Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock commanded the armored cruisers and , &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and the converted armed merchant cruiser . The flotilla was reinforced by the elderly pre-dreadnought battleship and the armored cruiser . The latter, however, did not arrive until after the Battle of Coronel. &quot;Canopus&quot; was left behind by Cradock, who probably felt her slow speed would prevent him from bringing the German ships to battle.

The East Asia Squadron arrived off Coronel on the afternoon of 1 November; to Spee&#x27;s surprise, he encountered &quot;Good Hope&quot;, &quot;Monmouth&quot;, and &quot;Otranto&quot; in addition to &quot;Glasgow&quot;. &quot;Canopus&quot; was still some behind, with the British colliers. At 16:17, &quot;Glasgow&quot; spotted the German ships. Cradock formed a line of battle with &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the lead, followed by &quot;Monmouth&quot;, &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and &quot;Otranto&quot; in the rear. Spee decided to hold off engaging until the sun had set more, at which point the British ships would be silhouetted by the sun, while his own ships would be obscured against the coast behind them. Spee turned his ships on a course nearly parallel to Cradock&#x27;s ships, slowly closing the range. Cradock realized the uselessness of &quot;Otranto&quot; in the line of battle and detached her. Heavy seas made working the casemate guns in both sides&#x27; armored cruisers difficult.

By 18:07, the distance between the two squadrons had fallen to and at 18:37 Spee ordered his ships to open fire, by which time the range had dropped to . Each ship engaged their opposite in the British line, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s target being &quot;Monmouth&quot;. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; struck &quot;Monmouth&quot; with her third salvo, one shell hitting her forward turret, blowing the roof off, and starting a fire. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; fired primarily armor-piercing shells and scored numerous hits, knocking out many of &quot;Monmouth&quot;″s guns. By 18:50, &quot;Monmouth&quot; had been badly damaged by &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and she fell out of line; &quot;Gneisenau&quot; therefore joined &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; in battling &quot;Good Hope&quot;. At around that time, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; received a hit that struck her rear turret but did not penetrate the armor, instead exploding outside and setting fire to life jackets stored there, though the crew quickly suppressed the blaze.

At the same time, &quot;Nürnberg&quot; closed to point-blank range of &quot;Monmouth&quot; and poured shells into her. At 19:23, &quot;Good Hope&quot;″s guns fell silent following two large explosions; the German gunners ceased fire shortly thereafter. &quot;Good Hope&quot; disappeared into the darkness. Spee ordered his light cruisers to close with his battered opponents and finish them off with torpedoes, while he took &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; further south to get out of the way. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was forced to abandon &quot;Monmouth&quot; after 19:20 when the German light cruisers approached, before fleeing south and meeting with &quot;Canopus&quot;. A squall prevented the Germans from discovering &quot;Monmouth&quot;, but she eventually capsized and sank at 20:18. More than 1,600 men were killed in the sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Cradock. German losses were negligible; &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had been hit four times but was not significantly damaged and suffered only two crewmen lightly injured. However, the German ships had expended over 40 percent of their ammunition supply.

====Voyage to the Falklands====
After the battle, Spee took his ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; in first on the morning of 3 November, leaving &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. In Valparaiso, Spee&#x27;s ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to determine the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.

Once word of the defeat reached London, the Royal Navy set to organizing a force to hunt down and destroy the East Asia Squadron. To this end, the powerful battlecruisers and were detached from the Grand Fleet and placed under the command of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee. The two ships left Devonport on 10 November. En route to the Falkland Islands, they were joined by the armored cruisers , , and , the light cruisers and &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and &quot;Otranto;&quot; the force of eight ships reached the Falklands by 7 December, where they immediately coaled.

In the meantime, Spee&#x27;s ships departed St. Quentin Bay on 26 November and rounded Cape Horn on 2 December. They captured the Canadian barque &quot;Drummuir&quot;, which had a cargo of of good-quality Cardiff coal. &quot;Leipzig&quot; took the ship under tow and the following day the ships stopped off Picton Island. The crews transferred the coal from &quot;Drummuir&quot; to the squadron&#x27;s colliers. On the morning of 6 December, Spee held a conference with the ship commanders aboard &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to determine their next course of action. The Germans had received numerous fragmentary and contradictory reports of British reinforcements in the region; Spee and two other captains favored an attack on the Falklands, while three other commanders, including Maerker, argued that it would be better to bypass the islands and attack British shipping off Argentina. Spee&#x27;s opinion carried the day and the squadron departed for the Falklands at 12:00.

==== Battle of the Falkland Islands ====


&quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; were delegated for the attack; they approached the Falklands the following morning, with the intention of destroying the wireless transmitter there. Observers aboard &quot;Gneisenau&quot; spotted smoke rising from Port Stanley, but assumed it was the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them. As they closed on the harbor, shells from &quot;Canopus&quot;, which had been beached as a guard ship, began to fall around the German ships. Lookouts on the German ships spotted the large tripod masts of the battlecruisers, though these were initially believed to be from the battlecruiser ; the reports of several enemy warships combined with fire from &quot;Canopus&quot; prompted Spee to break off the attack. The Germans took a southeasterly course at after having reformed by 10:45. Spee formed his line with &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; ahead, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; in the center, and &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; astern. The fast battlecruisers quickly got up steam and sailed out of the harbor to pursue the East Asia Squadron.

Spee realized his armored cruisers could not escape the much faster battlecruisers and ordered the three light cruisers to attempt to break away while he turned about and allowed the British battlecruisers to engage the outgunned &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Meanwhile, Sturdee detached his cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire at &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; while &quot;Inflexible&quot; attacked &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and Spee ordered his two armored cruisers to similarly engage their opposites. Spee had taken the lee position; the wind kept his ships swept of smoke, which improved visibility for his gunners. This forced Sturdee into the windward position and its corresponding worse visibility. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; quickly scored two hits on her opponent. In response to these hits, Sturdee attempted to widen the distance by turning two points to the north. This would place his ships beyond the effective range of the German guns, but keep his opponents within range of his own. Both sides checked their fire for the time being; &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had been hit twice during this stage of the battle, the first shell striking the aft funnel, killing and wounding several men with shell splinters. The second shell damaged some of the ship&#x27;s cutters and penetrated into some cabins amidships. Shell fragments from a near miss penetrated into one of the magazines for the 8.8 cm guns, forcing it to be flooded to prevent a fire.

Spee countered Sturdee&#x27;s maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which significantly widened the range and temporarily raised the possibility of escaping by nightfall. The maneuver forced Sturdee to turn south as well and pursue at high speed. Given the speed advantage and the clear weather, the German hope to escape proved to be short-lived. Nevertheless, the maneuver allowed Spee to turn back north, bringing &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; close enough to engage with their secondary 15 cm guns; their shooting was so effective that it forced the British to haul away a second time. After resuming the battle, the British gunfire became more accurate, and as the British were firing at very long range, the shells approached plunging fire, which allowed them to penetrate the thin deck armor rather than the thicker belt. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; took several hits during this phase, including a pair of underwater hits that began to flood boiler rooms 1 and 3.

Sturdee then turned to port in an attempt to take the leeward position, but Spee countered the turn to retain his favorable position; the maneuvering did, however, reverse the order of the ships, so &quot;Gneisenau&quot; now engaged &quot;Invincible&quot;. During the reversal, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; became temporarily obscured by smoke, so the British ships concentrated their fire on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, which suffered severe damage during this phase of the action. Spee and Maerker exchanged a series of signals to determine the state of each other&#x27;s vessels; Spee concluded the exchange with a signal noting that Maerker was correct to have opposed the attack on the Falklands. At 15:30, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; received a major hit that penetrated to her starboard engine room and disabled that engine, leaving her with just two operational screws. Another hit at 15:45 knocked over her forward funnel, and at 16:00 her number 4 boiler room was disabled.

At 16:00, Spee ordered &quot;Gneisenau&quot; to attempt to escape while he reversed course and attempted to launch torpedoes at his pursuers. Damage to the ship&#x27;s engine and boiler rooms had reduced her speed to , however, and so the ship continued to fight on. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; nevertheless could not evade British fire, and at around the same time her bridge was hit. Two more hits followed at 16:15, one passing completely through the ship without detonating and the other exploding in the main dressing station, killing most of the wounded crew there. At 16:17, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; finally capsized to port and sank; the British, their attention now focused on &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, made no attempt to rescue the crew. By this time, &quot;Carnarvon&quot; joined the fray and contributed her guns to the bombardment. As the range fell to , heavy fire from the surviving German guns forced the British to turn away again, widening the range to .

During the final phase of the battle, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; ran out of ammunition and resorted to firing inert training rounds; one of these struck &quot;Invincible&quot;. Three more shells struck &quot;Gneisenau&quot; at around 17:15, two of them underwater on the starboard side and the other on a starboard casemate. The former hits caused serious flooding, but the third had little effect, as the gun crew had already been killed by an earlier hit and the casemate was already on fire. Several more hits followed, and by 17:30, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was a burning wreck; she had a severe list to starboard and smoke poured from the ship, which came to a stop. At 17:35, Maerker ordered the crew to set scuttling charges and gather on the deck, as the ship was unable to continue fighting. The forward gun turret fired a final shell despite Maerker&#x27;s instructions, prompting a return shot from &quot;Inflexible&quot; that struck the forward dressing station, killing many wounded men there. At 17:42, the scuttling charges detonated and the forward torpedo crew launched a torpedo to clear the tube and hasten the flooding.

The ship slowly rolled over and sank, but not before allowing some 270 to 300 of the survivors time to escape. Of these men, many died quickly from exposure in the water. A total of 598 men of her crew were killed in the engagement, though boats from &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; picked up 187 men from &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, including her executive officer, &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (Corvette Captain) Hans Pochhammer, the highest ranking German officer to survive and the source of German records of the battle. &quot;Leipzig&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; were also sunk. Only &quot;Dresden&quot; managed to escape, but she was eventually tracked to the Juan Fernandez Islands and sunk. The complete destruction of the squadron killed some 2,200 German sailors and officers, including Spee and two of his sons.

<text>Świnoujście (; ; ; all three meaning &quot;Świna [river] mouth&quot;; ) is a city in Western Pomerania and seaport on the Baltic Sea and Szczecin Lagoon, located in the extreme north-west of Poland. Situated mainly on the islands of Usedom and Wolin, it also occupies smaller islands. The largest is Karsibór island, once part of Usedom, now separated by the Piast Canal dug in the late 19th century to facilitate ship access to Szczecin.

Świnoujście directly borders the German seaside resort of Ahlbeck on Usedom, connected by a street and of beach promenade.

Since 1999, Świnoujście has been a city with powiat rights (), within West Pomeranian Voivodeship. The city lies in the geographic region of Pomerania and had a population of 41,516 in 2012. Świnoujście is one of the most important areas of the Szczecin metropolitan area. The Świnoujście LNG terminal, opened in 2015, is located in the city. In 2023, the underwater Świnoujście Tunnel connecting the islands of Wolin and Usedom was opened.

Despite its relatively small population, Świnoujście is Poland&#x27;s ninth-largest city by area.

== History ==

The first human settlements in areas that are now Świnoujście appeared five thousand years ago, as confirmed by archaeological findings. For a thousand years, the estuary of the river was part of the state of the Świnoujście, included in the emerging Polish state in the 10th century by first Polish ruler Mieszko I.

In the early 12th century, the island became part of the Duchy of Pomerania, founded as a vassal duchy of Poland. In later centuries, local Pomeranian princes ruled the area, and on both sides of the river, they built fortified castles, which were destroyed by the Danish invasions in 1170 and 1173. Between 1185 and 1227, the settlement was part of a Danish fief.

In 1297, Duke Bogusław IV granted merchants who entered through Świna protection and exemption from customs duties on the return journey, and most of the larger cities of Pomerania were eventually granted full exemption from customs duties on the Świna, yet the local castle was still destroyed by the city of Szczecin in 1457. The village of Świna was mentioned in 1418.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) the city became part of the Swedish Empire.

The strait Świna was formerly flanked by the fishing villages of Westswine and Ostswine. Towards the beginning of the 17th century, it was made navigable for large ships. The Kingdom of Prussia gained the area in 1720 from Sweden, and included it in her Pomeranian province. Świnoujście (&quot;Swinemünde&quot;) was founded on the site of Westswine in 1748, fortified, and received town privileges from King Frederick II of Prussia in 1765. It served as the outer port of Stettin (Szczecin) and was administered within the Province of Pomerania. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Swedes attempted to block the port. Swinemünde became part of the German Empire after the Kingdom of Prussia completed the unification of Germany in 1871.

The town had broad, unpaved streets and one-story houses built in the Dutch style, which gave it an almost rustic appearance. Its industries, beyond some fishing, were entirely connected with its shipping. The river mouth, which was the entrance to the harbor and regarded as the best on the Prussian Baltic coast, was then protected by two curving long breakwaters, and was strongly fortified. On the island of Wolin, on the other side of the narrow Świna, a great lighthouse was erected. In 1897 the canal of the Kaiserfahrt was opened to navigation, and this waterway between the Stettin harbour and the Baltic Sea was deepened between 1900 and 1901. From then on Stettin could be reached directly by ships, and Swinemünde&#x27;s importance diminished somewhat.
During World War II, Germany operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag II-D prisoner-of-war camp in the city. In February 1945, German-perpetrated death marches of Allied prisoners of war from the Stalag XX-B and Stalag Luft IV POW camps passed through the city. On 12 March 1945 during World War II, refugee-crowded Swinemünde suffered heavy destruction by the USAAF, an estimated 5,000 to 23,000 were killed, most of whom are buried on the Golm War Cemetery west of the town, on the German side of the border. The city and port were also destroyed during the Allied air raids on 12 March and 16 April 1945. On 16 April 1945, a British heavy bomber of the No. 617 Squadron RAF was shot down by the Germans, and is now commemorated with a memorial on the Karsibór island within the city limits. The unfinished was scuttled in the harbor in an attempt to prevent its capture by the advancing Red Army (it was nevertheless refloated by the Soviets later). The German battleship had also participated in the defence of the city, before it too was scuttled. After the German forces defending the city were evacuated, Soviet forces occupied the city on the night of 4–5 May 1945.

After Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the Allied Nations imposed new borders in Central and Eastern Europe at the Potsdam Conference, which made the area, including Świnoujście, part of Poland, with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The entire population was expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement and replaced by ethnic Poles. 
The Treaty of Zgorzelec signed between the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and the German Democratic Republic affirmed the new border, and the German–Polish Border Treaty of 1990 officially affirmed the existing borders after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

In the winter of 1945, some members of the communist Polish Security Forces carried out atrocities against local Germans. An investigation in 2008 estimated that over 40 German civilians were killed. Nine men were charged with the murder and maltreatment of Germans, and in 1947, after one escaped and one hanged himself, seven of them stood trial. The harshest sentence given in that trial was a mere four years&#x27; imprisonment, for theft. In another trial, the town&#x27;s chief of police, Jan Zientara, was sentenced to eight years, for organizing robberies of German civilians.

In 1948, the reconstruction of the port of Świnoujście from martial to commercial and fishing began. The construction of a large fish farm began, a huge swimming pool and industrial buildings were built, and three years later the Fisheries Base was commissioned. Within three years, a large fish factory was established, managed by the independent &quot;Przedsiębiorstwo Usług Rybackie Odra&quot; in Świnoujście.

The port of Świnoujście was one of the three Polish ports through which Greeks and Macedonians, refugees of the Greek Civil War, reached Poland. The refugees were then transported to new homes in Poland, while wounded ones were sent to a nearby hospital on the Wolin island.

It was not until 27 November 1950, that the GDR government agreed to transfer to Poland the water intake for the city of Świnoujście, located at Lake Wolgastsee and demarcating the border there again. In June 1951, an area of 76.5 hectares (190 acres) was incorporated into Poland together with a water treatment station, creating a characteristic promontory protruding into the German area (the so-called Worek, (53 54 49.11 N 14 11′11.18 E). In return, Germany was granted a similar area between the water intake and the Pomeranian Bay.

The spa part of the city was occupied by the Soviet Armed Forces until 1957, and until the turn of the 1980s and 1990s, there was a base of Soviet warships with facilities in Świnoujście. Until 1972, the city belonged to the Wolin poviat. In 1959, the &quot;Uzdrowisko Świnoujście&quot; State Enterprise was established. Currently Uzdrowisko Świnoujście S.A. belongs to the largest and most modern in Poland, and its greatest asset is still bromide-iodide-sodium brine discovered a hundred years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, a seaport was created, which together with Szczecin created a complex of ports Szczecin-Świnoujście. In 1964, ferry shipping to Scandinavia was resumed. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively part of the Szczecin Voivodeship.

In 2015, the Świnoujście LNG terminal was opened, named after the late Polish President Lech Kaczyński, during whose presidency its construction was initiated.

== Geography ==
The city is located on the Strait of Świna, which in its northern part connects with the Baltic Sea, and in the south with the Szczecin Lagoon. It is situated on three inhabited islands: Usedom (35,712 inhabitants in 2010), Wolin (4,317 inhabitants), Karsibór (703 inhabitants) and 41 smaller uninhabited islands. Świnoujście is located in the northwestern edge of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (with coordinates 53 ° 54′N 14 ° 14′E). According to data from 1 January 2009, the area of the urban commune is . Every year, the city&#x27;s area increases by applying sand on the beach by sea currents. Sands settling at the shore caused the shoreline to shift by over the last 200 years. Currently, the beach in the widest section is , making the beach in Świnoujście the widest beach in Poland.

=== Climate ===
Świnoujscie is situated in the oceanic climate, which is characterized by mild winters and relatively cool summers. A very large influence on the climate of the city is the location of the Baltic Sea. Świnoujscie often in winter is the warmest city in Poland.

== Population ==

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===

The town is located on both banks of the Świna Channel, and since there is no road connection across it, transport is provided by regular ferries. Because the west section is otherwise wholly disconnected from the rest of Poland, this service is free of charge. In 2023, the underwater Świnoujście Tunnel connecting Poland&#x27;s two largest islands Wolin and Usedom was opened. The project cost EUR 191 million and constitutes the only fixed link between two parts of the city and between the rest of country.

Świnoujście has the largest and most modern ferry terminal in Poland, with regular connections to Denmark and Sweden. The city lies at the northern terminus of Polish National Route 3 (DK3, in the future express road S3), which is, in turn, part of the European route E65 running across Europe from Sweden to Greece. Świnoujście has four railway stations on the eastern bank of the Świna, on Wolin island, with regular regional connections to Szczecin and long-distance connections to other cities in Poland (e.g. Poznań, Katowice, Bielsko-Biała, Kraków and Warsaw).

Land border controls were abolished 21 December 2007, and free automobile traffic to and from Germany was allowed for the first time since 1945, as Poland implemented the Schengen Agreement. From 20 September 2008, the city has a railway connection to its western portion as well, when the railway line to Ahlbeck was extended eastward to Świnoujście (&quot;Świnoujście Centrum&quot;) giving it a direct link to the German railway network. The nearest airport at Heringsdorf in Germany, west of Świnoujście, will likely become more important for travelling to the city, if it ever acquires year-round scheduled passenger connections; it currently has a number of summer connections to German cities only. The nearest airport with year-round traffic is the Szczecin-Goleniów &quot;Solidarność&quot; Airport, to the southeast in Poland.

<text>An official language is a language having certain rights to be used in defined situations. These rights can be created in written form or by historic usage.

178 countries recognize an official language, 101 of them recognizing more than one. The government of Italy made Italian official only in 1999, and some nations (such as Mexico and Australia) have never declared de jure official languages at the national level. Other nations have declared non-indigenous official languages.

Many of the world&#x27;s constitutions mention one or more official or national languages. Some countries use the official language designation to empower indigenous groups by giving them access to the government in their native languages. In countries that do not formally designate an official language, a de facto national language usually evolves. English is the most common official or co-official language, with recognized status in 52 countries. Arabic, French, and Spanish are official or co-official languages in several countries.

An official language that is also an indigenous language is called &quot;endoglossic&quot;, one that is not indigenous is &quot;exoglossic&quot;. An instance is Nigeria which has three endoglossic official languages. By this, the country aims to protect the indigenous languages although at the same time recognising the English language as its lingua franca. In spatial terms, indigenous (endoglossic) languages are mostly employed in the function of official languages in Eurasia, while mainly non-indigenous (exoglossic) rest of the world.

==History==
Around 500 BC, when Darius the Great annexed Mesopotamia to the Achaemenid Empire, he chose a form of the Aramaic language (the so-called Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic) as the vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. Aramaic script was widely employed from Egypt in the southwest to Bactria and Sogdiana in the northeast. Texts were dictated in the native dialects and written down in Aramaic, and then read out again in the native language at the places they were received.

Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, standardized the written language of China after unifying the country in 221 BC. Literary Chinese would remain the standard written language for the next 2000 years. Standardization of the spoken language received less political attention, and Mandarin developed on an ad hoc basis from the dialects of the various imperial capitals until being officially standardized in the early twentieth century.

==Statistics==
The following languages are official (&quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot;) in three or more sovereign states. In some cases, a language may be defined as different languages in different countries. Examples are Hindi and Urdu, Malay and Indonesian, Serbian and Croatian, Persian and Tajik. 
*English: 58 UN states and 31 dependencies
*French: 28 UN states and 11 dependencies
*Arabic: 23 UN states and Palestine, 2 non-UN states on the same territory, and 1 dependency
*Spanish: 20 UN states and 1 dependency
*Portuguese: 9 UN states and 1 dependency
*German: 6 UN states
*Russian: 5 UN and 4 unrecognized states
*Serbo-Croatian: 4 UN states and 1 partially recognized state on the same territory
*Malay: 4 UN states and 1 dependency
*Swahili: 4 UN states (5 counting Comorian)
*Italian: 3 UN states and Vatican City
*Persian: 3 UN states and 1 dependency
*Dutch: 3 UN states (4 counting Afrikaans)
*Somali: 3 UN states and 1 unrecognized state on the same territory
*Sotho: 3 UN states
*Standard Chinese (Mandarin): 2 UN states and Taiwan
*Tamil: 2 UN states
*Hindustani: 3 UN states (counting Fijian Hindi)

Some countries—like Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom—have no official language recognized as such at a national level. On the other extreme, Bolivia officially recognizes 37 languages, the most of any country in the world. Second to Bolivia is India with 22 official languages. South Africa is the country with the third lead with 12 official languages that all have equal status; Bolivia gives primacy to Spanish, and India gives primacy to English and Hindi .

==Political alternatives==

The selection of an official language (or the lack thereof) is often contentious. An alternative to having a single official language is &quot;official multilingualism&quot;, where a government recognizes multiple official languages. Under this system, all government services are available in all official languages. Each citizen may choose their preferred language when conducting business. Most countries are multilingual and many are officially multilingual. Taiwan, Canada, the Philippines, Belgium, Switzerland, and the European Union are examples of official multilingualism. This has been described as controversial and, in some other areas where it has been proposed, the idea has been rejected. It has also been described as necessary for the recognition of different groups or as an advantage for the country in presenting itself to outsiders.

== Official languages by country and territory ==
===Afghanistan===
Following &quot;Chapter 1, Article 16&quot; of the Constitution of Afghanistan, the Afghan government gives equal status to Pashto and Dari as official languages.

===Australia===
English is the &quot;de facto&quot; national language of Australia, while Australia has no &quot;de jure&quot; official language, English is the first language of the majority of the population, and has been entrenched as the &quot;de facto&quot; national language since European settlement, being the only language spoken in the home for 72% of Australians.

===Azerbaijan===

Article 21 of Azerbaijani Constitution designates the official language of the Republic of Azerbaijan as Azerbaijani Language.

=== Bangladesh ===
After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first President of Bangladesh adopted the policy of &#x27;one state one language&#x27;. The &quot;de facto&quot; national language, Bengali, is the sole official language of Bangladesh according to the third article of the Constitution of Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh introduced the Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987 to ensure the mandatory use of Bengali in all government affairs.

=== Belarus ===
Belarusian and Russian have official status in the Republic of Belarus.

=== Belgium ===
Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, French and German.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgarian is the sole official language in Bulgaria.

===Canada===
Following the Constitution Act, 1982 the (federal) Government of Canada gives equal status to English and French as official languages. The Province of New Brunswick is also officially bilingual, as is Yukon. Nunavut has four official languages: English, French, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun. The Northwest Territories has eleven official languages: Chipewyan/Dené, Cree, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey, and Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib). All provinces, however, offer some necessary services in both English and French.

The Province of Quebec with the Official Language Act (Quebec) and Charter of the French Language defines French, the language of the majority of the population, as the official language of the provincial government.

===Ethiopia===
Ethiopia has five official languages (Amharic alone until 2020) Amharic, Oromo, Somali, Tigrinya, and Afar, but Amharic is the de facto sole official language which is used by the government for issuing driving licenses, business licenses, passport, and foreign diplomacy with the addition that Court documents are in Amharic, and the constitution is written in Amharic, making Amharic a higher official language in the country.

===Finland===
According to the Finnish constitution, Finnish and Swedish are the &quot;national languages&quot; of the republic, giving their speakers the right to communicate with, and receive official documents from, government authorities in either of the two languages in any part of the country – making those languages de facto &quot;official&quot;. Speakers of Sámi languages have those same rights in their native area (&quot;Sámi homeland&quot;).

===Germany===

German is the official language of Germany. However, its minority languages include Sorbian (Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian), Romani, Danish and North Frisian, which are officially recognised. Migrant languages like Turkish, Russian and Spanish are widespread but are not officially recognised languages.

===Hong Kong===

According to the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the Official Languages Ordinance, both Chinese and English are the official languages of Hong Kong with equal status. The variety of Chinese is not stipulated; however, Cantonese, being the language most commonly used by the majority of Hongkongers, forms the &quot;de facto&quot; standard. Similarly, Traditional Chinese characters are most commonly used in Hong Kong and form the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for written Chinese, however, there is an increasing presence of Simplified Chinese characters particularly in areas related to tourism. In government use, documents written using Traditional Chinese characters are authoritative over ones written with Simplified Chinese characters.

===India===
The Constitution of India (part 17) designates the official language of the Government of India as Hindi written in the Devanagari script. Although the original intentions of the constitution were to phase out English as an official language, provisions were provided so that &quot;Parliament may by law provide for the use ... of ... the English language&quot;.

The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists has 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement. In addition, the Government of India has awarded the distinction of classical language to Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Odia.

=== Indonesia ===

The official language of Indonesia is the Indonesian language (&quot;Bahasa Indonesia&quot;). Bahasa Indonesia is regulated in Chapter XV, 1945 Constitution of Indonesia.

===Israel===

On 19 July 2018, the Knesset passed a basic law under the title Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People, which defines Hebrew as &quot;the State&#x27;s language&quot; and Arabic as a language with &quot;a special status in the State&quot; (article 4). The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the Arabic language in practice before the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.

Before the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the &quot;Palestine Order in Council&quot; issued on 14 August 1922, for the British Mandate of Palestine, as amended in 1939:

:&quot;All Ordinances, official notices and official forms of the Government and all official notices of local authorities and municipalities in areas to be prescribed by order of the High Commissioner, shall be published in English, Arabic, and Hebrew.&quot;

This law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional legislative branch on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:

:&quot;Any provision in the law requiring the use of the English language is repealed.&quot;

In most public schools, the main teaching language is Hebrew, English is taught as a second language, and most students learn a third language, usually Arabic but not necessarily. Other public schools have Arabic as their main teaching language, and they teach Hebrew as a second language and English as a third one. There are also bilingual schools which aim to teach both Hebrew and Arabic equally.

Some languages other than Hebrew and Arabic, such as English, Russian, Amharic, Yiddish and Ladino enjoy a somewhat special status but are not official languages. For instance, at least 5% of the broadcasting time of privately owned TV channels must be translated into Russian (a similar privilege is granted to Arabic), warnings must be translated to several languages, and signs are mostly trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic and English), and the government supports Yiddish and Ladino culture (alongside Hebrew culture and Arabic culture).

===Latvia===
The Official Language Law recognizes Latvian as the sole official language of Latvia, while Latgalian is protected as &quot;a historic variant of Latvian&quot; and Livonian is recognized as &quot;the language of the indigenous (autochthonous) population&quot;. Latvia also provides national minority education programmes in Russian, Polish, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Estonian, Lithuanian, and Belarusian. In 2012 there was a constitutional referendum on elevating Russian as a co-official language, but the proposal was rejected by nearly three-quarters of the voters.

=== Malaysia ===

The official language of Malaysia is the Malay language (&quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot;), also known as Bahasa Malaysia or just Bahasa for short. Bahasa Melayu is being protected under Article 152 of the Constitution of Malaysia.

===Netherlands===
Dutch is the official language of the Netherlands (a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands). In the province of Friesland, Frisian is the official second language. While Dutch is therefore the official language of the Caribbean Netherlands (the islands Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius), it is not any of the three islands&#x27; main spoken language: Papiamento is the most often spoken language on Bonaire, while English is on both Saba and Sint Eustatius. These languages can be used in official documents (but do not have the same status as Frisian). Low Saxon and Limburgish, languages acknowledged by the European Charter, are spoken in specific regions of the Netherlands.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand has three official languages. English is the &quot;de facto&quot; official language, accepted as such in all situations. The Māori language and New Zealand Sign Language both have restricted &quot;de jure&quot; official status under the Māori Language Act 1987 and New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006.

In 2018, New Zealand First MP Clayton Mitchell introduced a bill to parliament to statutorily recognise English as an official language. As of May 2020, the bill had not progressed. During the 2023 New Zealand general election, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters promised to make English an official language of New Zealand.

===Nigeria===

The official language of Nigeria is English, which was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country. British colonial rule ended in 1960.

===Norway===
===Pakistan===

Urdu and English both are official languages in Pakistan. Pakistan has more than 60 other languages.

===Philippines===

Filipino and English both are official languages of the Philippines.

===Poland===

Polish is the official language of Poland.

===Russia===

Russian is the official language of the Russian Federation and in all federal subjects, however many minority languages have official status in the areas where they are indigenous. One type of federal subject in Russia,
republics, are allowed to adopt additional official languages alongside Russian in their constitutions. Republics are often based around particular native ethnic groups and are often areas where ethnic Russians and native Russian-language speakers are a minority.

===South Africa===
South Africa has twelve official languages that are mostly indigenous. Due to limited funding, however, the government rarely produces documents in most languages. Accusations of mismanagement and corruption have been leveled against the Pan South African Language Board, established to promote multilingualism, develop the 11 official languages, and protect language rights in the country. In practice, government is conducted in English.

=== Switzerland ===
The four national languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian and Romansh. At the federal level German, French and Italian are official languages, the official languages of individual cantons depend on the languages spoken in them.

===Taiwan===
Mandarin is the most common language used in government. After World War II the mainland Chinese-run government made Mandarin the official language, and it was used in the schools and government. Under the Development of National Languages Act, political participation can be conducted in any national language, which is defined as a &quot;natural language used by an original people group of Taiwan&quot;, which also includes Formosan languages, the Taiwanese variety of Hokkien and Hakka. According to Taiwan&#x27;s Legislative Yuan, amendments were made to the Hakka Basic Act to make Hakka an official language of Taiwan.

=== Timor-Leste ===
According to the constitution of Timor-Leste, Tetum and Portuguese are the official languages of the country, and every official document must be published in both languages; Indonesian and English hold &quot;working language&quot; status in the country.

===Ukraine===

The official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian.

===United Kingdom===

The de facto official language of the United Kingdom is English. In Wales, the Welsh language, spoken by approximately 20% of the population, has &quot;de jure&quot; official status, alongside English.

===United States===

The U.S. does not have an official language, but some states designate English as their official language. 32 of the 50 U.S. states and all five inhabited U.S. territories have designated English as one, or the only, official language, while courts have found that residents in the 50 states do not have a right to government services in their preferred language. Public debate in the last few decades has focused on whether Spanish should be recognized by the government, or whether all business should be done in English.

California allows people to take their driving test in the following 32 languages: Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Laotian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.

New York state provides voter-registration forms in the following five languages: Bengali, Chinese, English, Korean and Spanish. The same languages are also on ballot papers in certain parts of the state (namely, New York City).

Opponents of an official language policy in the United States argue that it would hamper &quot;the government&#x27;s ability to reach out, communicate, and warn people in the event of a natural or man-made disaster such as a hurricane, pandemic, or...another terrorist attack&quot;. Professor of politics Alan Patten argues that disengagement (officially ignoring the issue) works well in religious issues but that it is not possible with language issues because it must offer public services in some language. Even if it makes a conscious effort not to establish an official language, a &quot;de facto&quot; official language, or the &quot;national language&quot;, will nevertheless emerge.

===Yugoslavia===
Sometimes an official language definition can be motivated more by national identity than by linguistic concerns. Prior to the breakup in early 1990s, although SFR Yugoslavia had no official language on the federal level, its six constituent republics including two autonomous provinces accounted for four official languages—Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Macedonian and Albanian. Serbo-Croatian served as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; for mutual understanding and was also the language of the military, as official in four republics and taught as a second language in the other two.

When Croatia declared independence in 1991, it defined its official language as Croatian, while the confederate union of Serbia and Montenegro likewise defined its official language as Serbian in 1992. Bosnia and Herzegovina defined three official languages: Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian. From the linguistic point of view, the different names refer to national varieties of the same language, which is known under the appellation of Serbo-Croatian. 
The language used in Montenegro became standardized as the Montenegrin language upon Montenegro&#x27;s declaration of independence from Serbia and Montenegro in 2006.

=== Zimbabwe ===
Since the adoption of the 2013 Constitution, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, namely

<text>Jum&#x27;a-Mohammad Mohammadi was the Afghan Minister for Mines and Industries under the Afghan Transitional Administration. He died in a plane crash on February 24, 2003 while returning from a mission in Pakistan to learn techniques in copper mining. He was in his late 60s.

Mohammadi had served in Afghanistan in the 1970s as water and power minister under president Mohammad Daoud. He was later imprisoned for two years after communists took over in a 1978 coup and assassinated Daoud. After being released, Mohammedi fled to the United States and spent most of the 1980s and 1990s there working as a construction engineer and for the World Bank.

He was appointed to his position as Minister by interim president Hamid Karzai during a loya jirga in June, 2002.

Mohammadi died on February 24 2003 after his chartered Cessna 402 plane crashed 56 km west of Karachi. Seven other people died in the crash alongside him. The bodies of four of the occupants were recovered from the waters of the Arabian Sea.

<text>was a Japanese physicist and one of the founders of neutrino astronomy. His work with the neutrino detectors Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande was instrumental in detecting solar neutrinos, providing experimental evidence for the solar neutrino problem.

Koshiba won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002, jointly with Raymond Davis Jr., &quot;for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos&quot;.

He was a senior counselor at the International Center for Elementary Particle Physics (ICEPP) and professor at the University of Tokyo.

== Early life ==
Koshiba was born in Toyohashi in central Japan on September 19, 1926, to Toshio and Hayako Koshiba. His father was a military officer. His mother died when he was three, leading to his father marrying his wife&#x27;s elder sister. He grew up in Yokosuka, and completed his high school in Tokyo. It is mentioned that his initial interest was in studying German literature, but, ended up studying physics, spurred by a teacher&#x27;s denigrating comments.

He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1951 and received a PhD in physics from the University of Rochester, New York, in 1955.

==Career and research==
Koshiba started his career as a research associate at the Department of Physics, University of Chicago from July 1955 to February 1958, and was an associate professor at Institute of Nuclear Study, University of Tokyo from March 1958 to October 1963. While on leave from November 1959 to August 1962 he served as the acting director, Laboratory of High Energy Physics and Cosmic Radiation, Department of Physics, University of Chicago.

At the University of Tokyo he became associate professor in March 1963 and then professor in March 1970 in the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, and emeritus professor there in 1987. From 1987 to 1997, Koshiba taught at Tokai University.

In 2002, he jointly won the Nobel Prize in Physics for &quot;pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos&quot;. (The other shares of that year&#x27;s Prize were awarded to Raymond Davis Jr. and Riccardo Giacconi of the U.S.A.)

Koshiba&#x27;s initial research was in cosmic rays. In 1969, he shifted into electron-positron collider physics, and was involved with the JADE detector in Germany, which helped confirm the Standard Model. Along with Masayuki Nakahata and Atsuto Suzuki, Koshiba designed the Kamiokande experiment to detect proton decay, a prediction of grand unified theories. No proton decay was detected, but Koshiba realized the detector could be made to detect neutrinos, and adapted the project accordingly, following the pioneering U.S. work of Davis.

In the early 1970s, Koshiba collaborated with Gersh Budker (1918–1977), the particle-accelerator electron cooling pioneer in the Soviet Union. This collaboration was cut short for unknown reasons but Budker died of heart attack a few years later.

Through this experiment, he (and Davis in the U.S.) were able to confirm the prediction that neutrinos are generated during the nuclear fusion reaction in the sun. However, these experiments detected fewer neutrinos than had been expected. This deficit was called the solar neutrino problem. The deficit would be eventually explained by &quot;neutrino oscillations&quot;, whose existence was confirmed by an enlarged version of Kamiokande, known as Super-Kamiokande, run under the direction of Koshiba&#x27;s student Takaaki Kajita.

In 1987, the Kamiokande experimental detector detected neutrinos from the supernova explosion (designated SN 1987A) outside the Milky Way, the Large Magellanic Cloud. His research was pioneering in the establishment of neutrino astronomy as a field of study.

In 1996, with the promising results from Kamiokande, the team operationalized a larger and more sensitive detector called Super-Kamiokande. With this detector, scientists were able to demonstrate strong evidence to prove that neutrinos changed from one type to another of three types during flight. This demonstration resolved the solar neutrino problem with the reasoning being that the early detectors could detect one type of neutrino rather than all three types.

Koshiba was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, and also a foreign fellow of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences. He was a founding member of the Edogawa NICHE Prize Steering committee.

== Personal life ==
Koshiba married Kyoto Kato, an art museum curator, when he returned to Japan in the late 1950s. The couple had a son and a daughter.

He died on November 12, 2020, at the Edogawa Hospital in Tokyo at the age of 94.

<text>The Western Union Company is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Denver, Colorado.

Founded in 1851 as the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company in Rochester, New York, the company changed its name to the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1856 after merging with several other telegraph companies. It dominated the American telegraphy industry from the 1860s to the 1980s, pioneering technology such as telex and developing a range of telegraph-related services, including wire money transfer, in addition to its core business of transmitting and delivering telegram messages.

After experiencing financial difficulties, it began to move its business away from communications in the 1980s and increasingly focused on its money-transfer services. It ceased its communications operations completely in 2006, at which time &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest money-transfer business&quot; and added that the company would remain as such due to the large number of immigrants wiring money home.

From the perspective of the history of technology, Western Union notably completed the first transcontinental telegraph in 1861, being a part of U.S. industry&#x27;s investments into developing American communications between the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The first messages went to then President of the U.S. Abraham Lincoln.

== History ==

=== Founding &amp; expansion (1851–1866) ===

The New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company was founded in Rochester, New York by Samuel L. Selden, Hiram Sibley, and others in 1851. In 1856 the company merged with its competitor the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company, controlled by John James Speed, Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith and Ezra Cornell and, at Cornell&#x27;s insistence, changed its name to Western Union Telegraph Company.

In 1857, Western Union participated in the &#x27;Treaty of Six Nations&#x27;, an attempt by six of the largest telegraph firms to create a system of regional telegraphy monopolies with a shared network of main lines. After the creation of the &#x27;Six Nations&#x27; system, Western Union continued to acquire both larger &amp; smaller telegraph companies and by 1864 had transformed from a regional monopoly into a national oligopolist with its only serious competitors being the American Telegraph Company and the United States Telegraph Company.

Western Union completed the first transcontinental telegraph in 1861. Notably, the first messages went to then President of the U.S. Abraham Lincoln. The firm additionally formed the Russian–American Telegraph Company in an attempt to link America to Europe, via Alaska, into Siberia, to Moscow – a project abandoned in 1867 following the successful laying of a transatlantic cable in 1866.

=== Dominance &amp; new challengers (1866–1881) ===

In 1866, Western Union acquired the American Telegraph Company and the United States Telegraph Company, its two main competitors, for a time gaining a virtual monopoly over the American telegraphy industry. The company also began to develop new telegraphy-related services beyond the transmission and delivery of telegrams, launching the first stock ticker in 1866, a standardized time service in 1870 and wire money transfer in 1871.

In the 1870s, the company faced increased competition from newly formed rival telegraphy conglomerate Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company and from the nascent telephony industry led by the Bell Telephone Company. Western Union instead attempted to launch a rival telephony system before settling a patent lawsuit with Bell and leaving the telephone business completely in 1879.

Financier Jay Gould orchestrated a merger of the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company with Western Union in 1881, giving him a controlling share of the merged company.

=== Monopoly &amp; decline of telegraphy (1881–1963) ===
When the Dow Jones Railroad Average stock market index for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was created in 1884, Western Union was one of the original eleven companies to be included. By 1900, Western Union operated a million miles of telegraph lines and two international undersea cables.

AT&amp;T gained control of Western Union in 1909, acquiring a 30% stake in the company. However, in 1913 AT&amp;T, under indictment for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, was forced to sell its shares in the company which once again became independent.


Western Union acquired its only major competitor in the American telegraphy sector Postal Telegraph, Inc. in 1945, effectively giving the company monopoly power over the industry. After 1945 the telegraphy industry began to experience a decline as the use of telephones increased, especially in the case of long-distance calls, with total telegraph messages almost halving from 1945 to 1960.

In 1958, Western Union began offering telex services to customers in New York City. Teleprinter equipment for the telex network was originally provided by Siemens &amp; Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Direct international telex services commenced in the summer of 1960, with limited service to London and Paris.

In honor of Valentine&#x27;s Day 1959, Western Union introduced the Candygram, a box of chocolates accompanying a telegram that was featured in a commercial with the famously rotund radio announcer Don Wilson.

=== Western Union International spin-off ===

In 1963, Western Union organized its international cable system properties and its right-of-way for connecting international telegraph lines into a separate company called Western Union International (WUI), which it sold that year to American Securities.

In 1967, American Securities listed WUI as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. WUI was acquired by Xerox for $207 million in stock in 1979 and subsequently sold for $185 million in cash to MCI Communications in 1981. MCI renamed WUI to MCI International, ceasing the use of Western Union branding.

=== Consolidation (1963–1984) ===
Western Union purchased the TWX system from AT&amp;T in January 1969, the only major competitor to its own telex network.

Western Union became the first American telecommunications corporation to maintain its own fleet of geosynchronous communications satellites, starting in 1974. The fleet of satellites, called Westar, carried communications within the Western Union company for telegram and mailgram message data to Western Union bureaus nationwide. It also handled traffic for its telex and TWX services. The Westar satellites&#x27; transponders were also leased by other companies for relaying video, voice, data, and facsimile (fax) transmissions. The Westar fleet of satellites and ground stations were sold to Hughes (who originally built all of the Westar satellites launched) in 1988 after Western Union suffered financial losses with their telecommunications assets starting in the early 1980s.

In 1981, Western Union purchased a 50% interest in Airfone. It sold Airfone to GTE in 1986 for $39 million in cash. From 1982, as a result of financial services deregulation, Western Union began offering wire money transfer services globally.

=== Financial difficulties, bankruptcies &amp; restructuring (1984–2006) ===

In 1984, after years of declining profits and mounting debts, Western Union began to negotiate with its creditors regarding debt restructuring. The restructuring was completed in 1987 when investor Bennett S. LeBow acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that was a complex leveraged recapitalization. The transaction was backed by a total of $900 million in high-yield bonds and preferred stock underwritten by Michael Milken&#x27;s group at Drexel Burnham Lambert as part of an exchange offer. LeBow installed Robert J. Amman as president and CEO who led a complete strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company over the next six years.

Amman executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services, with a money transfer business as a large but less important part of the business, into being a provider of consumer-based money transfer financial services. Thus, Amman ran the company as two separate companies. One business consisted of the money transfer business, which was funded and operated to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity. The second unit consisted of all the non-strategic communications assets such as the long-distance analog voice network, satellite business and undersea cable assets.

In the three-year period through 1990 Amman was supported by Robert A. Schriesheim, also installed by LeBow, as a special advisor who oversaw the divestiture of the four non-strategic telecommunications assets for about $280 million.

Most of the company&#x27;s business services unit including the Easylink electronic mail and Telex businesses were sold to AT&amp;T for $180 million in Dec 1990. Western Union Priority Services including Mailgram, Priority Letter and Custom Letter services were not included in the deal. This marked the end of Western Union&#x27;s telecommunications carrier business. 

The official name of the corporation was changed to New Valley Corporation in 1991, as part of the company&#x27;s move to seek bankruptcy protection to eliminate the firm&#x27;s overleveraged balance sheet while continuing to grow the money transfer business. The name change was used to shield the Western Union name from being dragged through the proceedings (and the resulting bad PR). Under the day to day leadership of Amman and the backing of LeBow, the company&#x27;s value increased dramatically through its years operating under chapter 11.

Following various restructurings, including negotiations with Carl Icahn who became a large bond holder, New Valley Corporation was sold in a bankruptcy auction to First Financial Management Corporation in 1994 for $1.2 billion. In 1995, First Financial merged with First Data Corporation in a $6 billion transaction.

=== Public listing &amp; international expansion (2006–present) ===

On January 26, 2006, First Data announced its intention to spin off Western Union into independent publicly traded financial services company focused on money transfers through a tax-free spin-off to First Data shareholders. The spin off occurred as planned on September 29, 2006. The next day Western Union announced that it would cease offering telegram transmission and delivery.

In May 2009, Western Union announced its plan to acquire Canada-based Custom House from Peter Gustavson. The deal closed in September 2009 for a purchase price of US$371 million. This acquisition led the company to be re-branded as Western Union Business Solutions.

In January 2011, Western Union acquired Angelo Costa, a group active in money transfer and services to immigrants. Angelo Costa has a network of 7,500 points of sale throughout Europe. The agreement was signed for US$200 million.

In July 2011, Western Union acquired Travelex&#x27;s Global Business Payments division for £606 million.

In October 2011, Western Union completed the acquisition of Finint S.r.l., one of Western Union&#x27;s leading money transfer network agents in Europe, with more than 10,000 subagent locations across Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

In May 2015, rumors emerged over a proposed merger of Western Union and competitor MoneyGram, at a time when both companies’ revenue were declining. Western Union denied this was the case. In January 2017, Ant Financial, Alibaba’s financial technology firm instead unsuccessfully attempted to acquire MoneyGram for $880 million, but this was blocked by the U.S. government citing national security concerns.

In 2018, the company moved its headquarters from Englewood, Colorado to the Denver Tech Center. The Englewood office complex was sold in 2020 for $40 million.

In November 2020, Western Union acquired a 15% stake in the digital payments unit of Saudi Telecom Company for $200 million.

In 2022, Western Union suspended operations in Russia and Belarus due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Current services==
=== Wire transfer ===

Money can be sent online or in-person at Western Union agent locations. Cash can be collected in person at any other Western Union agent location worldwide by providing the 10-digit MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number) and identification. In some cases, a secret question and answer can be used instead of identification.

===Western Union Mobile===
In October 2007, Western Union announced plans to introduce a mobile money-transfer service with the GSM Association, a global trade association representing more than 700 mobile operators in 218 countries and covering 2.5 billion mobile subscribers.

The proliferation of mobile phones in developed and developing economies provides a widely accessible consumer device capable of delivering mobile financial services ranging from text notifications associated with Western Union cash delivery services to phone-based remittance options. Western Union&#x27;s mobile money transfer service offering will connect its core money-transfer platform to m-bank or m-wallet platforms provided by mobile operators and/or locally regulated financial institutions.

=== Western Union Connect ===
The company launched the Western Union Connect service in October 2015, following partnership agreements with major instant messaging apps WeChat and Viber. The partnership allows users of WeChat to send up to $100 to China, the US and 200 other countries, while Viber users can send up to $100 for $3.99 plus exchange rate fees, with that fixed fee increasing the more money is sent up a limit of $499.

== Past services ==
===Communications===

Along with satellite telecommunications, Western Union was also active in other forms of telecommunication services:
* Common carrier terrestrial microwave networks
* Business communications networks such as Telex and TWX, which was acquired from AT&amp;T Corporation and renamed Telex II by Western Union
* Landline-based leased voice and data communication circuits
* Long-distance telephone service
* Airfone air-ground radiotelephone service from 1981 to 1986
* Cellular phone service for a short time in the early 1980s (the phones were made by two-way radio manufacturer E. F. Johnson Company)

Most of these services were discontinued by Western Union in the late 1980s due to a lack of profitability, with the company&#x27;s divisions providing said services being divested and sold to other companies, such as the 1988 sale of WU&#x27;s satellite fleet and services to Hughes Space and Communications, and the sale of WU&#x27;s Airfone service to GTE in 1986.

===Charge card===
In 1914, Western Union was the first to issue a charge card.

===BidPay===
As the Internet became an arena for commerce at the turn of the millennium, Western Union started its online services. BidPay was renamed &quot;Western Union Auction Payments&quot; in 2004 before being renamed back to BidPay. BidPay ceased operations on December 31, 2005, and was purchased for US$1.8 million in March 2006 by CyberSource Corp. who announced their intention to re-launch BidPay. BidPay was later discontinued by CyberSource effective December 31, 2007.

==Sponsorship==
Western Union was a major shirt-sponsor of the Sydney Roosters NRL team from 2002 to 2003. The company still sponsors the team, but not as a shirt-sponsor. Globally Western Union sponsors numerous community events that help support the diaspora communities that use the global Money Transfer service. They also sponsored numerous WWE and WCW pay-per-view events such as No Way Out 1998 and Slamboree 2000. They sponsored UEFA Europa League from 2012 until 2015.

During the 2003–04 season, Western Union served as the title sponsor for the Premier Division Football League in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

The First Data Western Union Foundation donates money to charitable causes globally. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Foundation donated US$1,000,000 to the relief effort.

The Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association announced a three-year deal making Western Union the team&#x27;s jersey sponsor, beginning with the 2017–18 NBA Season.

Liverpool F.C. announced on August 9 2017, that Western Union would become their first ever sleeve sponsors, from the start of the 2017–18 season. They signed a £25m deal for 5 years as Liverpool&#x27;s sleeve sponsor.

==Involvement in early computer networking==
Western Union telegrams were transmitted through a store and forward message switching system. Early versions were manual telegraph systems. Later systems using teleprinters were semi-automatic, using punched paper tape to receive, store, and retransmit messages. Plan 55-A, Western Union&#x27;s last paper tape based switching system (1948–1976), was fully automatic, with automatic routing.

Western Union was a prime contractor in the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) program. AUTODIN, a military application for communication, was first developed in the 1960s, but was dismantled in favor of the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern Internet in the 1990s. The Defense Message System (DMS) replaced AUTODIN in 2000.

AUTODIN, originally named &quot;ComLogNet&quot;, was a reliable service that operated at 99.99% availability, using mechanical punched card readers and tab machines to send and receive data over leased lines. During the peak operation of AUTODIN, the US portion of the network handled 20 million messages a month. Western Union failed in its attempts to engineer a replacement (AUTODIN II), leading to the development of an acceptable packet-switched network by BBN (the developer of the ARPANET) which became the foundation of today&#x27;s Internet. AUTODIN service ceased in 2000, years after it had become obsolete.

A related innovation that came from AUTODIN was Western Union&#x27;s computer based EasyLink service. This system allowed one of the first marketable email systems for non-government users. The system allowed the same message to be sent simultaneously to multiple recipients via email, fax, mailgram, or telex services as well as allowing messages to be sent from the integrated formats. With the service, users could also perform research utilizing its InfoLink application. EasyLink was spun off as a separate company and is now part of OpenText.

== Controversies ==

=== Scam industry and money laundering ===

Western Union advises its customers not to send money to someone that they have never met in person. Despite its efforts in increasing customers&#x27; awareness of the issue, Western Union is used extensively for internet fraud by scammers.

Western Union has been required to maintain records of payout locations of the individuals who may be laundering the money, though this information may be obtained only through the use of a subpoena. Hence advance-fee fraud and romance scammers continue to receive funds via Western Union confident in the knowledge that money lost to overseas scammers is almost always unrecoverable. For this reason, it is banned as a medium of payment through eBay, and discouraged on other online auction websites.

Western Union admitted to allowing wire fraud in January 2017 and agreed to pay $586 million, for turning a blind eye as criminals used its service for advance fee fraud. Scammers engaging in various 419 advance fee scams including offering fake job offers and lottery prizes, were able to process transactions using Western Union money transfer, mainly by giving the agents a share of the earnings from their scams. Western Union failed to investigate hundreds of thousands of complaints that were filed by victims.

=== Money laundering and terrorist financing ===

The Central Bank of Ireland reprimanded and fined Western Union €1.75 million in May 2015 because of failures in anti money laundering practices which could have left the firm&#x27;s payment services open to being used for money laundering and/or terrorist financing saying that they were concerned that Western Union &quot;failed to have in place sufficiently robust systems and procedures to train agents, to monitor and identify suspicious activity in respect of smaller transactions, and to maintain appropriate records&quot; and &quot;the splitting of payments into many separate smaller payments is a common method used to launder money. Similarly, terrorist financing is often carried out by small payment transfers.&quot;

Western Union agents in the US also allowed Chinese immigrants to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to human smugglers through the service, evading the transfer reporting requirements by sending the amounts in smaller increments.

In 2017, Western Union admitted to money laundering and consumer fraud violations and agreed to pay $586 million in a settlement with the Department of Justice. Among other charges, the Justice Department showed that Western Union was complicit in creating an ecosystem where criminals were able to engage in consumer fraud and human trafficking. The charges were dismissed in March 2020.

In 2018, Western Union was fined $60 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The press release accompanying the fine stated that, &quot;Western Union executives put profits ahead of the company’s responsibilities to detect and prevent money laundering and fraud, by choosing to maintain relationships with and failing to discipline obviously suspect, but highly profitable, agents.&quot;

On May 29, 2019, Western Union announced the departure of a company executive, Odilon Almeida, who had served as executive vice president and president of Global Money Transfer. In 2012, Stewart Stockdale, who had the same position as Almeida, left the company under similar circumstances.

=== Connection to military intelligence ===
The book &quot;The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America&#x27;s Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11&quot; alleged that Western Union provided United States military intelligence with personal information.

===Anti-competitive behavior===
Western Union has been accused of engaging in anti-competitive behavior in Africa as a result of a lack of competition on the continent. According to a report by the Overseas Development Institute, this allows Western Union to artificially inflate its fees for money transfers, charging what has been called an “Africa charge” of 8% consistently “applied across countries regardless of the size of the market, regulatory costs or market risk.” However, the fees can be as high as 10% or more, depending on the region. Africa&#x27;s remittance market remains the most expensive in the world, and the region is estimated to incur excess costs of $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion per year as a result of these high remittance fees.

The company has also been criticized for its use of exclusivity agreements with banks in countries that receive remittances, restricting competition and harming the consumer, by requiring the consumer to conduct transactions via nominated banks. This also allows for the imposition of above-average transaction fees.

In February 2016, Harada Ltd filed a complaint with the EU antitrust regulator claiming that Western Union colluded with banks to push out smaller rivals from the money transfer market.
The commission concluded that the allegations were insufficient and found in favor of Western Union.

<text>Mohammad Khatami (born 14 October 1943) is an Iranian politician and Shia cleric who served as the fifth president of Iran from 3 August 1997 to 3 August 2005. He also served as Iran&#x27;s Minister of Culture from 1982 to 1992. Later, he was critical of the government of subsequent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Little known internationally before becoming president, Khatami attracted attention during his first election to the presidency when he received almost 70% of the vote. Khatami had run on a platform of liberalization and reform. During his election campaign, Khatami proposed the idea of Dialogue Among Civilizations as a response to Samuel P. Huntington&#x27;s 1992 theory of a Clash of Civilizations. The United Nations later proclaimed the year 2001 as the &quot;Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations&quot;, on Khatami&#x27;s suggestion. During his two terms as president, Khatami advocated freedom of expression, tolerance and civil society, constructive diplomatic relations with other states, including those in Asia and the European Union, and an economic policy that supported a free market and foreign investment.

On 8 February 2009, Khatami announced that he would run in the 2009 presidential election but withdrew on 16 March in favour of his long-time friend and adviser, former prime minister of Iran Mir-Hossein Mousavi. The Iranian media are forbidden on the orders of Tehran&#x27;s prosecutor from publishing pictures of Khatami, or quoting his words, on account of his support for the defeated reformist candidates in the disputed 2009 re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

==Early life and education==
Khatami was born on 14 October 1943, in the small town of Ardakan, in Yazd Province into a sayyid family. He married Zohreh Sadeghi, the daughter of a professor of religious law, and niece of Musa al-Sadr, in 1974 (at the age of 31). The couple have two daughters and one son: Laila (born 1975), Narges (born 1980), and Emad (born 1988).Khatami&#x27;s father, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khatami, was a high-ranking cleric and the Khatib (the one who delivers the sermon for Friday prayers) in the city of Yazd in the early years of the Iranian Revolution.

Khatami&#x27;s brother, Mohammad-Reza Khatami, was elected as Tehran&#x27;s first member of parliament in the 6th term of parliament, during which he served as deputy speaker of the parliament. He also served as the secretary-general of Islamic Iran Participation Front (Iran&#x27;s largest reformist party) for several years. Mohammad Reza is married to Zahra Eshraghi, a feminist human rights activist and granddaughter of Ruhollah Khomeini (founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran).

Khatami&#x27;s other brother, Ali Khatami, a businessman with a master&#x27;s degree in Industrial Engineering from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, served as the President&#x27;s Chief of Staff during President Khatami&#x27;s second term in office, where he kept an unusually low profile.

Khatami&#x27;s eldest sister, Fatemeh Khatami, was elected as the first representative of the people of Ardakan (Khatami&#x27;s hometown) in 1999 city council elections.

Mohammad Khatami is not related to Ahmad Khatami, a hardline cleric and Provisional Friday Prayer Leader of Tehran.

Mohammad Khatami received a BA in Western philosophy at Isfahan University, but left academia while studying for a master&#x27;s degree in educational sciences at Tehran University and went to Qom to complete his previous studies in Islamic sciences. He studied there for seven years and completed the courses to the highest level, Ijtihad. After that, he briefly settled in Germany to chair the Islamic Centre in Hamburg from 1978 to 1980.

Before serving as president, Khatami was a representative in the parliament from 1980 to 1982, supervisor of the Kayhan Institute, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance (1982–1986), and then for a second term from 1989 to 24 May 1992 (when he resigned), the head of the National Library of Iran from 1992 to 1997, and a member of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution. He is a member and chairman of the Central Council of the Association of Combatant Clerics. Besides his native language Persian, Khatami speaks Arabic, English, and German.

==Presidency (1997–2005)==
Running on a reform agenda, Khatami was elected president on 23 May 1997, in what many have described as a remarkable election. Voter turnout was nearly 80%. Despite limited television airtime, most of which went to the conservative Speaker of Parliament and favored candidate Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, Khatami received 70 percent of the vote. &quot;Even in Qom, the center of theological training in Iran and a conservative stronghold, 70% of voters cast their ballots for Khatami.&quot; He was re-elected on 8 June 2001 for a second term and stepped down on 3 August 2005 after serving his maximum two consecutive terms under the Islamic Republic&#x27;s constitution.

Khatami supporters have been described as a &quot;coalition of strange bedfellows, including traditional leftists, business leaders who wanted the state to open up the economy and allow more foreign investment, and younger voters. Khatami’s ascendancy was a prelude to a dynamic reform thrust that injected hope into Iranian society, whipped up a dormant nation after eight years of war with Iraq in the 1980s and the costly post-conflict reconstruction, and incorporated terms in the political lexicon of young Iranians that were not previously embedded in the national discourse, nor did they count as priorities for the majority of the people.

The day of his election, 2 Khordad, 1376, in the Iranian calendar, is regarded as the starting date of &quot;reforms&quot; in Iran. His followers are therefore usually known as the &quot;2nd of Khordad Movement&quot;.

Khatami is regarded as Iran&#x27;s first reformist president, since the focus of his campaign was on the rule of law, democracy, and the inclusion of all Iranians in the political decision-making process. However, his policies of reform led to repeated clashes with the hardline and conservative Islamists in the Iranian government, who control powerful governmental organizations like the Guardian Council, whose members are appointed by the Supreme Leader.

As President, according to the Iranian political system, Khatami was outranked by the Supreme Leader. Thus, Khatami had no legal authority over key state institutions such as the armed forces, the police, the army, the revolutionary guards, the state radio and television, and the prisons. (See Politics of Iran).

Khatami presented the so-called &quot;twin bills&quot; to the parliament during his term in office, these two pieces of proposed legislation would have introduced small but key changes to the national election laws of Iran and also presented a clear definition of the president&#x27;s power to prevent constitutional violations by state institutions. Khatami himself described the &quot;twin bills&quot; as the key to the progress of reforms in Iran. The bills were approved by the parliament but were eventually vetoed by the Guardian Council.
===Generality===
Press freedom, civil society, women’s rights, religious tolerance, dialogue and political development were concepts that constituted the core of Khatami’s ideology, who as a cleric faced immeasurable pressure on behalf of the orthodox seminarians over the changes he was advocating. He inducted his Westward charm offensive by engaging the European Union, and became the first Iranian president to travel to Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway and Spain. From the University of St Andrews in Scotland to the World Economic Forum in Davos and the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, he was frequently solicited to give talks at reputed venues to articulate the new Iranian vision and tell the world how he wanted to portray his people’s aspirations.

===Economic policy===

Khatami&#x27;s economic policies followed the previous government&#x27;s commitment to industrialization. At a macro-economic level, Khatami continued the liberal policies that Rafsanjani had embarked on in the state&#x27;s first five-year economic development plan (1990–1995). On 10 April 2005, Khatami cited economic development, large-scale operations of the private sector in the country&#x27;s economic arena and 6% economic growth as among the achievements of his government. He allocated $5 billion to the private sector for promoting the economy, adding that the value of contracts signed in this regard has reached $10 billion.

A year into his first term as president of Iran, Khatami acknowledged Iran&#x27;s economic challenges, stating that the economy was, &quot;chronically ill...and it will continue to be so unless there is fundamental restructuring&quot;.

For much of his first term, Khatami saw through the implementation of Iran&#x27;s second five-year development plan. On 15 September 1999, Khatami presented a new five-year plan to the Majlis. Aimed at the period from 2000 to 2004, the plan called for economic reconstruction in a broader context of social and political development. The specific economic reforms included &quot;an ambitious program to privatize several major industries ... the creation of 750,000 new jobs per year, average annual real GDP growth of six percent over the period, reduction in subsidies for basic commodities...plus a wide range of fiscal and structural reforms&quot;. Unemployment remained a major problem, with Khatami&#x27;s five-year plan lagging behind in job creation. Only 300,000 new jobs were created in the first year of the plan, well short of the 750,000 that the plan called for. The 2004 World Bank report on Iran concludes that &quot;after 24 years marked by internal post-revolutionary strife, international isolation, and deep economic volatility, Iran is slowly emerging from a long period of uncertainty and instability&quot;.

At the macroeconomic level, real GDP growth rose from 2.4% in 1997 to 5.9% in 2000. Unemployment was reduced from 16.2% of the labor force to less than 14%. The consumer price index fell to less than 13% from more than 17%. Both public and private investments increased in the energy sector, the building industry, and other sectors of the country&#x27;s industrial base. The country&#x27;s external debt was cut from $12.1 billion to $7.9 billion, its lowest level since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire. The World Bank granted $232 million for health and sewage projects after a hiatus of about seven years. The government, for the first time since the 1979 wholesale financial nationalization, authorized the establishment of two private banks and one private insurance company. The OECD lowered the risk factor for doing business in Iran to four from six (on a scale of seven).

The government&#x27;s own figures put the number of people under the absolute poverty line in 2001 at 15.5% of the total population – down from 18% in 1997, and those under relative poverty at 25%, thus classifying some 40% of the population as poor. Private estimates indicate higher figures.

Among 155 countries in a 2001 world survey, Iran under Khatami was 150th in terms of openness to the global economy. On the United Nations Human Development scale, Iran ranked 90th out of 162 countries, only slightly better than its previous position at 97 out of 175 countries four years earlier. The overall risk of doing business in Iran improved only marginally from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;C&quot;. One of his economic strategies was on the basis of absorbing foreign and domestic capital resources for the privatization of the economy. Therefore, in 2001, the organization of privatization was established. Also the government encourages people to buy shares in private companies by providing incentives. Also Iran succeeded to convince the World Bank to approve loans totaling 432 billion dollars to the country.

===Foreign policy===

During Khatami&#x27;s presidency, Iran&#x27;s foreign policy began a process of moving from confrontation to conciliation. In Khatami&#x27;s notion of foreign policy, there was no &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;, he favored instead a &quot;Dialogue Among Civilizations&quot;. Relations with the US remained marred by mutual suspicion and distrust, but during Khatami&#x27;s two terms, Tehran increasingly made efforts to play a greater role in the Persian Gulf region and beyond.

As President, Khatami met with many influential figures including Pope John Paul II, Koichiro Matsuura, Jacques Chirac, Johannes Rau, Vladimir Putin, Abdulaziz Bouteflika, Mahathir Mohamad and Hugo Chávez. In 2003, Khatami refused to meet militant Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. However, Khatami attended Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s funeral in 2000 and told new Syrian president Bashar al-Assad that &quot;the Iranian government and people would stand by and support him&quot;.

On 8 August 1998, the Taliban massacred 4,000 Shias in the town of Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. It also attacked and killed 11 Iranian diplomats with an Iranian journalist among them. The rest of the diplomats were taken hostage. Ayatollah Khamenei ordered the amassing of troops near the Iran Afghanistan border to enter Afghanistan and fight the Taliban. Over 70,000 Iranian troops were placed along the borders of Afghanistan. Khatami halted the invasion and looked to the UN for help. Soon he was placed in talks. Later Iran entered negotiations with the Taliban, the diplomats were released. Khatami and his advisers had managed to keep Iran from entering war with the Taliban.

After the 2003 earthquake in Bam, the Iranian government rebuffed Israel&#x27;s offer of assistance. On 8 April 2005, Khatami sat near Iranian-born Israeli President Moshe Katsav during the funeral of Pope John Paul II because of alphabetical order. Later, Katsav shook hands and spoke with Khatami. Katsav himself is in origin an Iranian Jew, and from a part of Iran close to Khatami&#x27;s home; he stated that they had spoken about their home province. That would make this incident the first official political contact between Iran and Israel since diplomatic ties were severed in 1979.

However, after he returned to Iran, Khatami was subject to harsh criticism from conservatives for having &quot;recognised&quot; Israel by speaking to its president. Subsequently, the country&#x27;s state-run media reported that Khatami strongly denied shaking hands and chatting with Katsav. In 2003, Iran approached the United States with proposals to negotiate all outstanding issues including the nuclear issue and a two-state settlement for Israel and the Palestinians.
In 2006, and as an ex-president, he became the highest-ranking Iranian politician to visit the United States, excluding annual diplomatic trips of chief executives to the UN headquarters in New York. He gave a speech at the Washington National Cathedral and continued his US tour by addressing Harvard University, Georgetown University and the University of Virginia.

====Currency crisis====

From 1995 to 2005, Khatami&#x27;s administration successfully reduced the rate of fall in the value of the Iranian rial bettering even the record of Mousavi. Nevertheless, the currency continued to fall from 2,046 to 9,005 to the U.S. dollar during his term as president.

=== Cultural ===
Khatami&#x27;s moderate policies also differed sharply from those of his radical opponents, who sought stricter Islamic rule. Thus, the moderate Khatami all-inclusive and pluralistic message posed a stark contrast to the reactionary stances of the earlier decades of the revolution. He represented hope for the masses who desired change that differed in nature from what they had experienced in 1979, and yet a change that preserved Iran’s Islamic republican system. In the first years of his presidency, relative freedom of the press was formed in the country, and for the first time after the summer of 1360, some opposition forces were able to print publications or publish articles criticizing the performance of high-ranking officials. During this period, the Association of Iranian Journalists, the national union of journalists in Iran was established in October 1376 after Mohammad Khatami took office. National Library and Archive of Iran It was completed with Khatami&#x27;s follow-up. and banned books were allowed to be printed as Kelidar. Bahram Beyzai, Abbas Kiarostami They did many activities during this period and the country&#x27;s cinema space became more open. With a glance at this period, it can be seen that most filmmakers turned their attention to making films with social themes. Iran Music House and Music Festival of Iran&#x27;s regions institutes it was founded in this period. Iran&#x27;s National Orchestra founded in 1998 under the conduction of Farhad Fakhreddini.

===Khatami and Iran&#x27;s 2004 parliamentary election===

In February 2004, Parliament elections, the Guardian Council banned thousands of candidates, including most of the reformist members of the parliament and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party from running. This led to a win by the conservatives of at least 70% of the seats. Approximately 60% of the eligible voting population participated in the elections.

Khatami recalled his strong opposition against holding an election his government saw as unfair and not free. He also narrated the story of his visit to the Supreme Leader, Khamenei, together with the Parliament&#x27;s spokesman (considered the head of the legislature) and a list of conditions they had handed him before they could hold the elections. The list, he said, was then passed on to the Guardian Council, the legal supervisor and major obstacle to holding free and competitive elections in recent years. The members of the Guardian Council are appointed directly by the Supreme Leader and are considered to be applying his will. &quot;But&quot;, Khatami said, &quot;the Guardian Council kept neither the Supreme Leader&#x27;s nor its own word [...] and we were faced with a situation in which we had to choose between holding the election or risking huge unrest [...] and so damaging the regime&quot;. At this point, student protesters repeatedly chanted the slogan &quot;Jannati is the nation&#x27;s enemy&quot;, referring to the chairman of the Guardian Council. Khatami replied, &quot;If you are the representative of the nation, then we are the nation&#x27;s enemy&quot;. However, after clarification by students stating that &quot;Jannati, not Khatami&quot;, he took advantage of the opportunity to claim a high degree of freedom in Iran.

When the Guardian Council announced the final list of candidates on 30 January 125 reformist members of parliament declared that they would boycott the election and resign their seats, and the Reformist interior minister declared that the election would not be held on the scheduled date, 20 February. However, Khatami then announced that the election would be held on time, and he rejected the resignations of his cabinet ministers and provincial governors. These actions paved the way for the election to be held and signaled a split between the radical and moderate wings of the reformist movement.

==Cultural and political image==

===Dialogue Among Civilizations===
Following earlier works by the philosopher Dariush Shayegan, in early 1997, during his presidential campaign, Khatami introduced the theory of Dialogue Among Civilizations as a response to Samuel P. Huntington&#x27;s &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; theory. He introduced this concept in the United Nations in 1998.

Consequently, on 4 November 1998 the UN adopted a resolution proclaiming the year 2001 as the United Nations&#x27; &quot;Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations&quot;, as per Khatami&#x27;s suggestion. Pleading for the moralization of politics, Khatami argued that &quot;the political translation of dialogue among civilizations would consist in arguing that culture, morality, and art must prevail on politics.&quot; President Khatami&#x27;s call for a dialogue among civilizations elicited a published reply from an American author, Anthony J. Dennis, who served as the originator, contributor, and editor of an historic and unprecedented collection of letters addressing all facets of Islamic-Western and U.S.–Iranian relations entitled &quot;Letters to Khatami: A Reply To The Iranian President&#x27;s Call For A Dialogue Among Civilizations&quot; which was published in the U.S. by Wyndham Hall Press in July 2001. To date, this book is the only published reply Khatami has ever received from the West.

===Culture===
Khatami believes that the modern world in which we live is such that Iranian youth are confronted with new ideas and is receptive of foreign habits. He also believes that the limitation on youth leads to separation of them from the regime and calls them into Satanic cultures. He predicted that even worse, the youth will learn and accept the MTV culture. This fact leads to secularization.

===Cinema===
In terms of Islamic values, Mohammad Khatami encouraged film makers to include themes such as self-sacrifice, martyrdom, and revolutionary patience. When Khatami was the minister of culture, he believed that cinema was not limited to the mosque and it is necessary to pay attention to entertaining aspects of cinema and not limiting it to religious aspect.

===Khatami as a scholar===

Khatami&#x27;s main research field is political philosophy. One of Khatami&#x27;s academic mentors was Javad Tabatabaei, an Iranian political philosopher. Later on Khatami became a university lecturer at Tarbiat Modares University, where he taught political philosophy. Khatami also published a book on political philosophy in 1999. The ground he covers is the same as that covered by Javad Tabatabaei: Platonizing adaptation of Greek political philosophy by Farabi (died 950), synthesis of the &quot;eternal wisdom&quot; of Persian statecraft by Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Amiri (died 991) and Mushkuya Razi (died 1030), the juristic thoughts of al-Mawardi and al- Ghazali, and Nizam al-Mulk&#x27;s treatise on statecraft. He ends with a discussion of the revival of political philosophy in Safavid Isfahan in the second half of the 17th century.

Further, Khatami shares with Tabatabaei the idea of the &quot;decline&quot; of Muslim political thought beginning at the very outset, after Farabi.

Like Tabatabaei, Khatami brings in the sharply contrasting Aristotelian view of politics to highlight the shortcomings of Muslim political thought. Khatami has also lectured on the decline in Muslim political thought in terms of the transition from political philosophy to royal policy (siyasat-i shahi) and its imputation to the prevalence of &quot;forceful domination&quot; (&quot;taghallub&quot;) in Islamic history.

In his &quot;Letter for Tomorrow&quot;, he wrote:
==Post-presidential career==
After his presidency, Khatami founded two NGOs which he currently heads:
* International Institute for Dialogue among Cultures &amp; Civilizations, (). This institute is a private (non-governmental) institute that was founded by Khatami after the end of his presidency and it is not to be confused with a center with a similar name operated by the foreign ministry of Iran. The European branch of Khatami&#x27;s institute is headquartered in Geneva and has been registered as Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations.
* Baran Foundation. BARAN meaning &quot;rain&quot; is an acronym in Persian for &quot;Foundation for Freedom, Growth and Development of Iran&quot; (). This is also a private (non-governmental) institute founded by Khatami after the end of his presidency (registration announced on 9 September 2005) and a group of his former colleagues during his presidency. This institute is focused on domestic rather than international activities.

Notable events in Khatami&#x27;s career after his presidency include:

* On 2 September 2005, the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Mohammad Khatami as a member of the Alliance of Civilizations.
* On 28 September 2005, Khatami retired after 29 years of service in the government.
* On 14 November 2005, Mohammad Khatami urged all religious leaders to fight for the abolishment of atomic and chemical weapons.
* On 30 January 2006, Mohammad Khatami officially inaugurated the office of the &quot;International Institute of Dialogue Among Civilizations&quot;, an NGO with offices in Iran and Europe that he will be heading, after his retirement from the government.
* On 15 February 2006, during a press interview Mohammad Khatami announced the formal registration of the European office of his Institute for Dialogue among Civilizations in Geneva.
* On 28 February 2006, while attending a conference of the Alliance of Civilizations at Doha, Qatar, he stated that &quot;The Holocaust is a historical fact.&quot; However, he added that Israel has &quot;made a bad use of this historic fact with the persecution of the Palestinian people.&quot;
* On 7 September 2006, during a visit to Washington, Mohammad Khatami called for dialogue between the United States and Iran.
*On 24–28 January 2007, Mohammad Khatami attended the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, then U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, then Vice President Dick Cheney, and former U.S. Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Colin Powell were among those attending. Khatami and then U.S. Senator John Kerry have expressed similar opinions and shared words with each other in the World Economic Forum in Davos.
*In October 2009, the award committee of the Global Dialogue Prize declared Khatami and Iranian cultural theorist Dariush Shayegan as joint winners of the inaugural award, &quot;for their work in developing and promoting the concept of a &#x27;dialogue among cultures and civilizations&#x27; as new paradigm of cultural subjectivity and as new paradigm of international relations&quot;. The Global Dialogue Prize is one of the world&#x27;s most significant recognitions for research in the Humanities, honouring &quot;excellence in research and research communication on the conditions and content of a global intercultural dialogue on values&quot;. In January 2010, Mohammad Khatami stated that &quot;he was not in the position to accept the award&quot;, and the prize was given to Dariush Shayegan alone.

===The Man with the Chocolate Robe===
On 22 December 2005, a few months after the end of Khatami&#x27;s presidency, the monthly magazine &quot;Chelcheragh&quot;, along with a group of young Iranian artists and activists, organized a ceremony in Khatami&#x27;s honor. The ceremony was held on Yalda night at Tehran&#x27;s Bahman Farhangsara Hall. The ceremony, titled &quot;A Night with The Man with the Chocolate Robe&quot; by the organizers, was widely attended by teenagers and younger adults. One of the presenters and organizers of the ceremony was Pegah Ahangarani, a popular young Iranian actress. The event did not get a lot of advance publicity, but it drew a huge amount of attention afterwards. In addition to formal reports on the event by the BBC, IRNA, and other major news agencies, googling the term &quot;مردی با عبای شکلاتی&quot; (&quot;The Man with the Chocolate Robe&quot; in Persian) shows thousands of results of mainly young Iranians&#x27; blogs mentioning the event. It was arguably the first time in the history of Iran that an event in such fashion was held in honor of a head of government. Some weblog reports of the evening described the general atmosphere of the event as &quot;similar to a concert!&quot;, and some reported that &quot;Khatami was treated like a pop star&quot; among the youth and teenagers in attendance during the ceremony. Many bloggers also accused him of falling short of his promises of a safer, more democratic Iran.

===2008 International Conference on Religion in Modern World===
In October 2008, Khatami organized an international conference on the position of religion in the modern world. Former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, former Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, former French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, former Swiss President Joseph Deiss, former Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio, former Irish President Mary Robinson, former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and former UNESCO director general Federico Mayor as well as several other scholars were among the invited speakers of the conference.

The event was followed by a celebration of the historical city of Yazd, one of the most famous cities in Persian history and Khatami&#x27;s birthplace. Khatami also announced that he is about to launch a television program to promote intercultural dialogue.

===2009 presidential election===
Khatami contemplated running in the 2009 Iranian presidential election. In December 2008, 194 alumni of Sharif University of Tech wrote a letter to him and asked him to run against Ahmadinejad &quot;to save the nation&quot;. On 8 February 2009, he announced his candidacy at a meeting of pro-reform politicians.

On 16 March 2009, Khatami officially announced he would drop out of the presidential race to endorse another reformist candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi who Khatami claimed would stand a better chance against Iran&#x27;s conservative establishment to offer true change and reform.

===Green movement===
In December 2010, following the crushing of post-election protest, Khatami was described as working as a political &quot;insider,&quot; drawing up a &quot;list of preconditions&quot; to present to the government &quot;for the reformists&#x27; participation in the upcoming parliamentary elections&quot;, that would be seen as reasonable by the Iranian public but intolerable by the government. This was seen by some (Ata&#x27;ollah Mohajerani) as &quot;astute&quot; and proving &quot;the system could not take even basic steps required for living up to its own democratic conservatives&quot; (Azadeh Moaveni). In response to the conditions, &quot;Kayhan&quot; newspaper condemned Khatami as &quot;a spy and traitor&quot; and called for his execution.

===2013 presidential election===

A few months before the presidential election which was held in June 2013, several reformist groups in Iran invited Khatami to attend in competition. The reformists also sent a letter to the Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in December 2012, regarding the participation of Khatami in the upcoming presidential election. Member of the traditional-conservative Islamic Coalition Party, Asadullah Badamchyan said that in their letter, the reformists asked the Supreme Leader to supervise the allowance of Khatami to participate in the upcoming election. Former mayor of Tehran, Gholamhossein Karbaschi announced: &quot;Rafsanjani may support Khatami in the presidential election&quot;.

Khatami himself said that he still waits for the positive changes in the country, and will reveal his decision when the time is suitable. On 11 June 2013, Khatami together with a council of reformists backed moderate Hassan Rouhani, in Iran&#x27;s presidential vote as Mohammad Reza Aref quit the race when Khatami advised him that it &quot;would not be wise&quot; for him to stay in the race for the June 2013 elections.

==Controversy and criticism==
Khatami&#x27;s two terms as president were regarded by some people in the Iranian Opposition as unsuccessful or not fully successful in achieving their goals of making Iran more free and more democratic, and he has been criticized by conservatives, reformers, and opposition groups for various policies and viewpoints.

In a 47-page &quot;A Letter for Tomorrow&quot;, Khatami said his government had stood for noble principles but had made mistakes and faced obstruction by hardline elements in the clerical establishment.

<doc id="193221" wikidata="Q379929" url="?curid=193221" title="Eugène Labiche">
<text>Eugène Marin Labiche (; 6 May 181522 January 1888) was a French dramatist. He remains famous for his contribution to the vaudeville genre and his passionate and domestic pochads. 

In the 1860s, he reached his peak with a series of successes including Le Voyage de M. Perrichon (1860), La Poudre aux yeux (1861), La Station Champbaudet (1862) and La Cagnotte (1864). He worked with Jacques Offenbach, then director of the Bouffes-Parisiens, to write librettos for operettas and for several comic operas.

His 1851 farce &quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot;, written with Marc-Michel, has been adapted many times to stage and screen.

==Early life==
He was born into a bourgeois family and studied law. At the age of twenty, he contributed a short story to &quot;Chérubin&quot; magazine, entitled &quot;Les plus belles sont les plus fausses&quot; (&quot;The most beautiful are the most fake/false&quot;). A few others followed, but failed to catch the attention of the public.

==Career==
Labiche tried his hand at dramatic criticism in the &quot;Revue des théâtres&quot; and in 1838, wrote and premiered two plays.
The small &quot;Théâtre du Pantheon&quot; produced, to some popular success, his drama &quot;L&#x27;Avocat Loubet&quot;, while a vaudeville, &quot;Monsieur de Coyllin, ou l&#x27;homme infiniment poli&quot; (written in collaboration with Marc-Michel and performed at the Palais Royal) introduced a provincial actor who was to become and to remain a great Parisian favourite, the famous comedian Grassot.

In the same year, Labiche, still doubtful about his true vocation, published a romance called &quot;La Clé des champs&quot;. According to Léon Halévy, Labiche&#x27;s publisher went bankrupt soon after the novel was out: &quot;A lucky misadventure, for this timely warning of Destiny sent him back to the stage, where a career of success was awaiting him.&quot; There was yet another obstacle in the way. When he married, Labiche solemnly promised his wife&#x27;s parents that he would renounce a profession then considered incompatible with moral regularity and domestic happiness. A year later, his wife released him from his vow, and Labiche recalled the incident when he dedicated the first edition of his complete works to her.

In conjunction with Charles Varin, Marc-Michel, Louis François Clairville, Philippe François Dumanoir, and others, he contributed comic plays interspersed with couplets to various Paris theatres. He was considered a successful but undistinguished vaudevillist, until he paired with Marc-Michel to create the five-act farce, &quot;Un Chapeau de paille d&#x27;Italie&quot; (&quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot;), which turned out to be a major success upon its opening in August 1851. It is an accomplished specimen of the French imbroglio-style play, in which someone is in search of something, but does not find it till five minutes before the curtain falls. For the next twenty-five years, he continued to write successful comedies and vaudevilles, all basically constructed on the same plan and containing a dose of comic observation and good sense.
&quot;Of all the subjects,&quot; he said, &quot;which offered themselves to me, I have selected the bourgeois. Essentially mediocre in his vices and in his virtues, he stands half-way between the hero and the scoundrel, between the saint and the profligate.&quot;

During the second period of his career Labiche collaborated with Alfred Delacour, Adolphe Choler, and others. Emile Augier said: &quot;The distinctive qualities which secured a lasting vogue for the plays of Labiche are to be found in all the comedies written by him with different collaborators, and are conspicuously absent from those which they wrote without him.&quot; Even more important was his professional relationship with actor Jean Marie Geoffroy, who specialized in Labiche&#x27;s pompous and fussy bourgeois characters. Many of Labiche&#x27;s roles were written specifically for Geoffroy. &quot;Célimare le bien-aimé&quot; (1863), &quot;Le Voyage de M. Perrichon&quot; (1860), &quot;La Grammaire&quot;, &quot;Un Pied dans le crime&quot;, &quot;La Cagnotte&quot; (1864), were some of Labiche&#x27;s most important plays.

==Retirement and death==
In 1877, he ended his connection with the stage, and retired to his rural property in Sologne. There, he devoted his energies to supervising agricultural work and to reclaiming land and marshes. His lifelong friend, Émile Augier, visited him there, and strongly advised Labiche to publish a collected and revised edition of his works. Though Labiche was initially reluctant, he issued, during 1878 and 1879, his comic plays in ten volumes, which were enthusiastically received. Many people had assumed that Labiche&#x27;s plays owed their popularity to the actors who had appeared in them, but, upon reading the plays, they realized that their success was due to the writing itself, with its humor and skilled characterization. Due to this re-evaluation of Labiche&#x27;s writing, he was elected to the &quot;Académie française&quot; in 1880.

Labiche died in Paris and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre.

==Appreciation==
Some admirers have considered Labiche the equal of Molière; his plays are more complex and less coarse than many other examples of French farce. Love is practically absent from his theatre. In none of his plays did he ever venture into the depths of feminine psychology, and womankind is only represented by pretentious old maids and silly young ladies. He ridiculed marriage, but in a friendly and good-natured manner that always left a door open to repentance and timely amendment.

<doc id="193224" wikidata="Q2427436" url="?curid=193224" title="Édouard Pailleron">
<text>Édouard Jules Henri Pailleron (7 September 183419 April 1899) was a French poet and dramatist best known for his play .

== Early life ==
Édouard was born in Paris on 7 September 1834. From a Parisian cultured &quot;bourgeoise&quot; family (upper-middle class), he earned first a doctorate in law, then became in succession a lawyer, notary clerk, soldier (a dragoon for two years), but irresistibly attracted by writing, he achieved his first success in 1860 with his one-act play , represented at the Odéon-Théâtre in Paris.

== Career ==

He had a successful career with his comedies about social customs (). His first big hit was obtained at the Theatre du Gymnase, in 1868, with (the World where you&#x27;re having fun), after which he became Director of the (where he was admitted in 1863 with his play - the Last district).

Following his marriage, he became co-director of the Revue des Deux Mondes, a monument of the Romantic literature era founded by his father-in-law.

His career culminated in 1881 with (the World where you are bored), one of the most strikingly successful pieces of the period with a prodigiously long run (over 1000 performances at in Paris, and great success in St Petersburg, London, etc.) The play, a satirical comedy in three acts, ridiculed contemporary upper class society and was filled with transparent allusions to well-known people. The play was later adapted into English by Clinton Stuart under the title &quot;Our Society&quot; and presented at Madison Square Theatre in 1886. In America, the role of Suzanne, which was originated by French actress Suzette Reichenberg, was played by Annie Russell.

His triumphal success earned him his election to the famous Académie française in 1882 (seat n°12) and he was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Neither of his two last works ( in 1887, and in 1894) achieved so great a success.

After his death, his plays continued to be produced and staged for many years.

== Personal life ==

In 1862, he married Marie Buloz, the daughter of François Buloz, founder and director of the world-wide famous Revue des Deux Mondes. From his marriage with Marie, Edouard had three children:

* Édouard Pailleron Jr., who married Marguerite Forest, a daughter of his friend, the French Senator Charles Forest.
* Henri Pailleron, who died at only six years old.
* Marie-Louise Pailleron (1870–1951), who became an erudite historian of the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; and of the major names in French literature of the 19th century. She married, and divorced, French lawyer Jacques Bourget.

Pailleron died on 19 April 1899.

=== Friendship with John Singer Sargent ===
Pailleron was a close friend of the American artist John Singer Sargent, who studied painting at the Parisian École des Beaux-Arts, introducing him to the Parisian high-life society which was very important for the beginning of his successful career. Sargent painted several portraits of Edouard and his family, which are all currently in museums, mainly American ones. Sargent painted a portrait of Edouard in 1879 (now in the Musée Chateau de Versailles, France), also his wife Marie in 1880 (now in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.), and also of his children, Edouard Jr. and Marie-Louise in 1881 (now in the Des Moines Art Center). These paintings were among the first to make John Singer Sargent famous.

== Legacy ==
A statue bust of Edouard Pailleron, sculpted in 1906 by Russian-born artist Leopold Bernard Bernstamm, is located in the Parc Monceau in Paris.

Finally, his vacation property above Chambéry (Savoie), named &quot;La Souris&quot;, built in the last years of the 19th century, is still surviving and virtually unchanged as the original park with trees more than 100 years old, even if the whole is now an allotment. In contrast, in the same park, the cottage of his friend Charles Forest, Senator of Savoie, whose daughter Marguerite married his son Edouard, no longer exists.

=== Collège Édouard-Pailleron ===
In France, his name became famous again in the 1970s because it was given to a school in Paris near Buttes Chaumont Park in northeastern Paris. The school was destroyed by a fire on 6 February 1973, killing 21 children.

<doc id="193225" wikidata="Q744800" url="?curid=193225" title="Fuji Television">
<text>JOCX-DTV (channel 8), branded as or , is a Japanese television station that serves the Kantō region as the flagship station of the Fuji News Network (FNN) and the Fuji Network System (FNS). The station is owned-and-operated by , itself a subsidiary of , a certified broadcasting holding company under the Japanese Broadcasting Act, and affiliated with the Fujisankei Communications Group. It is headquartered in the Fuji Broadcasting Center in Odaiba, Minato, Tokyo and is one of &quot;five private broadcasters based in Tokyo&quot;.

Fuji Television also operates three premium television stations, known as &quot;Fuji Television One&quot; (&quot;Fuji Television 739&quot;—sports/variety, including all Tokyo Yakult Swallows home games), &quot;Fuji Television Two&quot; (&quot;Fuji Television 721&quot;—drama/anime, including all Saitama Seibu Lions home games), and &quot;Fuji Television Next&quot; (&quot;Fuji Television CSHD&quot;—live premium shows) ( &quot;Fuji Television OneTwoNext&quot;), all available in high-definition.

The current incarnation of Fuji Television was established in October 2008. Fuji Media Holdings is the former Fuji Television founded in 1957 renamed as a result of a restructuring. In the early days of Fuji TV&#x27;s broadcasting, its ratings were in the middle of all Tokyo stations for quite some time. In the early 1980s, the ratings of Fuji TV rose sharply. In 1982, it won the &quot;Triple Crown&quot; in the ratings among the flagship stations for the first time, and produced many famous TV dramas (such as Kevin) and variety shows (Decepticommie Live). In 1997, Fuji Television moved from Kawata-cho, Shinjuku District to Odaiba, the sub-center of Rinkai, Tokyo, which led to the development of the Odaiba area, which was almost empty at that time. After the 2010s, the ratings of Fuji TV dropped sharply, and now the household ratings rank fifth among all stations in Tokyo. But on the other hand, Fuji TV is also a TV station with more diversified operations in the Japanese TV industry and a higher proportion of income from departments outside the main business. In addition, Fuji TV is the first TV station in Japan to broadcast and produce locally-made animated series made specifically to be televised.

==Offices==
The headquarters are located at 2–4–8, Daiba in Minato, Tokyo. The Kansai office is found at Aqua Dojima East, Dojima, Kita-ku, Osaka. The Nagoya office is found at Telepia, Higashi-sakura, Higashi-ku, Nagoya. The Japanese television station also has 12 bureau offices in other parts of the world in locations in countries such as France, Russia, United States, Indonesia, China, Thailand and the UK.

==Branding==
The first logo of Fuji TV was designed by Yusaku Kamekura. Its design concept comes from the station&#x27;s channel &quot;8&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;8 Mark&quot; (8マーク). After Fuji TV adopted the &quot;eyeball logo&quot; (described later) as a trademark, the 8 logo did not completely withdraw from use. For example, there is a sculpture of the 8 logo at the entrance of the FCG building; the program logo of the variety show &quot;Grand Slam of Performing Arts&quot; also uses the 8 logo.

In April 1985, in order to strengthen the unity of the group, the chairman of Fujisankei Group Haruo Kanai decided to formulate a new group unified trademark. On May 2, 1985, among the nine candidate logos, Fujisankei Group decided to choose the &quot;eyeball logo&quot; (目玉マーク) designed by illustrator Masaru Yoshida as the group trademark. The logo was made directly using Liquitex pigments. Beginning on April 1, 1986, the eyeball logo officially became the logo of the companies under the Fujisankei Group, including Fuji TV. Fuji Sankei Group decided to adopt the font proposed by Yuji Baba as the trademark font of Fuji TV. In order to increase the awareness of the logo, Fujisankei Group spent an equivalent of 4 billion yen in advertising costs and broadcast as many as 3,000 TV commercials.
==History==
===Early stages===

In 1957, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued the &quot;Basic Guidelines for the Frequency Allocation Plan for Television Broadcasting&quot;, planning to set up three new television channels in the Yokohama area of Tokyo, of which only one station was a private general television station, and the other two were educational television stations (what would be the future NET TV and Tokyo 12 Channel). Around the general private station&#x27;s build-up, fierce competition was launched from radio stations, film companies and other circles, including the two private radio stations in Tokyo at that time, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting (JOQR) and Nippon Broadcasting System (JOLF). Under the coordination of Nippon Cultural Broadcasting president Mizuno Shigeo, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and Nippon Broadcasting agreed to integrate their applications and apply for a comprehensive TV station broadcasting license in the name of &quot;Central Television&quot; (Chūō Terebijon, 中央テレビジョン). Afterwards, Central Television merged with Toho&#x27;s &quot;Toyo Television Broadcasting&quot; (東洋テレビジョン放送) and Shochiku&#x27;s &quot;Art Television&quot; (芸術テレビジョン放送) to apply for a name change to Fuji Television (富士テレビジョン). On July 8, 1957, Fuji TV obtained the broadcasting license. After obtaining such, Fuji TV began broadcasting preparations and purchased nearly 2 hectares of land in Kawata-cho, Shinjuku District for the construction of the headquarters building, and at the same time carried out at the Sugar Industry Hall in Yurakucho Preparations for broadcasting (the building is also the headquarters of Japan Broadcasting Corporation). On November 28, 1958, because the Kanji character &quot;Fuji&quot; had many strokes and was difficult to display on the TV screen, Fuji Television decided to change the company name from the Kanji &quot;富士&quot; to the katakana &quot;フジ&quot;.

Fuji Television Network Inc. was founded in 1957 by Nobutaka Shikanai and Shigeo Mizuno, presidents of Nippon Broadcasting System and Nippon Cultural Broadcasting respectively.

On January 10, 1959, Fuji TV began a trial broadcast. On February 28 of the same year, Fuji TV held the eve festival before the broadcast, and broadcast it live as a pilot program. On the next day, March 1, Fuji TV officially started broadcasting. One month after the launch, on April 10, Fuji TV participated in the broadcast of the wedding of Crown Prince Akihito (the current emperor) and Michiko Masada, and broadcast a special program that lasted 15 hours and 41 minutes. This wedding was also an important opportunity for television&#x27;s popularity to skyrocket in Japan. At the beginning of the broadcast, because most old-style TVs could only receive channels up to channel 6, certain viewers were unable to watch watch Fuji TV (as it was on channel 8), which became its weakness. For this reason, Fuji TV actively negotiated with home appliance companies, enabling mass production of 12-channel VHF band receivers.
On June 23, 1959, Fuji TV signed a program exchange agreement with Kansai TV, Tokai TV and KBC Television. This was the beginning of Fuji TV starting to build its own network. One year after it started broadcasting, the ratings of Fuji TV have kept pace with those of Nippon TV and KRT TV (now TBS TV). In 1961, Fuji TV abolished the off-air period from 14:00 to 17:40, and extended the broadcast time from 6:30 to 23:40, becoming the first TV station in Japan to achieve all-day broadcasting except for the late-night period. Fuji TV also actively participated in the broadcast of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Since Fuji TV had a strong financial background during its establishment, there was no trade union for a long time. It was not until 1966 that Fuji TV established a labor union and proposed to abolish the 25-year-old retirement system for women. But it was not until 1972 that Fuji TV realized that both men and women retired at the age of 55.

In 1966, the Fuji News Network (FNN) was formally established, as the third national TV network, with Fuji-produced national news programming being aired to the network&#x27;s affiliates in regional Japan. At that time, there were 6 affiliated TV stations. On April 1, 1969, 13 UHF TV stations were launched in various parts of Japan, 8 of which were affiliated to FNN (Out of the four UHF stations that started in 1968, two were FNN affiliates). In the same year, the Fuji Network System (FNS) was officially established, and at the end of 1969, the number of affiliated stations increased to 21. In addition to Japan, Fuji TV started actively expanding international cooperation. In 1960, it signed a cooperation agreement with the National Broadcasting Company; in 1970, the company also partnered with South Korea&#x27;s Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC). in Taiwan, it helped set up Taiwan Television (TTV), and was one of its major shareholders until 2006, when the party, government and army withdrew from the media policy and demanded the withdrawal of foreign capital. In 1963, Fuji TV aired its first transoceanic satellite live broadcast, and the first satellite program broadcast was a special program on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Fuji TV was one the Japanese counterparts of the Big Three commercial TV stations at that time during the 1960s. In 1967, Fuji TV opened its first overseas base in New York.

===Entering the age of color television===

In September 1964, Fuji TV broadcast a color TV program for the first time. This was the Gerry Anderson series Stingray produced by ITC Entertainment in the UK, and in turn the first British sci-fi series to be filmed in color. On February 11, 1967, Fuji TV broadcast the first color program &quot;Guess it!&quot; produced in the company&#x27;s studio. This year, with the realization of the colorization of studio 7, the color programs of Fuji TV began to increase significantly, and signature programs such as &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and &quot;Shionogi MUSIC FAIR&quot; also began to be broadcast in color. In 1968, Fuji TV broadcast the first color series &quot;Small Love and Romance&quot;. In 1969, Fuji TV broadcast the moment of Apollo 11&#x27;s landing on the Moon in color, and broadcast a special program of 23 hours and 20 minutes. In 1970, the news studio of Fuji TV had also converted to color. Fuji TV&#x27;s technological innovations also expanded to other fields in the 1970s. In October 1978, Fuji TV started broadcasting in stereo.

In January 1968, Fuji TV, Sankei Shimbun, Nippon Broadcasting, and Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and their related subsidiaries formally established Fuji Sankei Group to strengthen cooperation among companies within the group, and Fuji TV also became a member of the group. One of the core enterprises. In 1969, Fuji TV celebrated its 10th anniversary. For this reason, Fuji TV broadcast a series of special programs from February 24 to March 2 of this year, and won the first place in the ratings this week. Fuji TV&#x27;s network continued to expand in the 1960s. In April 1970, FNS joined Delta 27, becoming one of the largest private TV networks in Japan. At the same time, in order to reduce program production costs and cope with the growing strength of labor unions, Fuji TV decided on the policy of &quot;separation of production and broadcasting&quot; in September 1970, and transferred the program production department to several subordinate production companies. However, this measure did not bring success in ratings, forcing Fuji TV to abolish this system in 1980.

Before the early 1970s, except for Tokyo Channel 12, which was converted into a generalist TV station at the latest, the ratings pattern at that time was described as three strong (TBS, Nippon TV, Fuji TV) and one weak (NET TV). However, after the mid-1970s, as the ratings of TBS and Nippon TV rose, Fuji TV fell into a slump in ratings, and the competition in the TV industry became two strong (TBS, Nippon TV) and two weak (Fuji TV, NET TV). For this reason, Fuji Television carried out a thorough budget cut in the late 1970s. On the other hand, in addition to the main business of TV, Fuji TV began to diversify its operations during this period, and gradually increased its involvement in fields. In 1974, as part of the commemorative activities for its 15th anniversary, Fuji TV became one of the organizers of the Mona Lisa Japan Exhibition, which attracted more than 1.5 million people to visit.

===Triple Crown and golden ages===
Nobutaka Shikanai, first chairman of Fuji Television, resigned in 1980. Haruo Kauchi at Fuji Television&#x27;s stand has completed a series of large-scale reforms. Haruo Kanai&#x27;s return to Fuji Television Station&#x27;s caused Fuji TV to enter a paradigm shift, changing its slogan from the hardline conservative &quot;Mother and Child&#x27;s Fuji Television&quot; (母とこどものフジテレビ) to &quot;It&#x27;s not TV if it&#x27;s not fun&quot; (楽しくなければテレビじゃない). In 1981, Fuji Television had programming readjustments to match the new policies. Among them were the ending of celebrity interview program Star&#x27;s 1001 Nights and a reorganization of the late afternoon schedule. In the first week of July 1981, Fuji TV surpassed TBS&#x27;s viewing rate, enabling the channel to win the Triple Crown in ratings for the first time. In 1982, Fuji Television Station acquired the first core station, and broke through TBS&#x27;s 1963 start maintenance record. Fuji TV was also the top channel for advertisers in this period. From April to September 1982, Fuji Television Station ranked number 1 in business acquisition at the flagship stations. Investigated by Video Research, TBS, which exceeds the quality of Fuji Television, climbs to the top of each television station in Japan, and is displayed on Fuji Television Station. In terms of technology, Fuji Television Station started research on high-definition television technology in 1987.

On April 1, 1986, Fuji Television changed their corporate logo from the old &quot;Channel 8&quot; logo, to the &quot;Eye&quot; logo used by the Fujisankei Communications Group. In 1986 and 1987, Fuji Television worked with Nintendo to create two games called &quot;All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic&quot; for the Famicom. All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. was a retooled version of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; with some minor changes, such as normal levels being replaced with levels from &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot; and some enemies being replaced with Japanese celebrities with comedic effect. &quot;Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic&quot; later became the basis for &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, which was subsequently released a year later.

In October 1987, Fuji Television began branding their late-night/early-morning slots collectively as JOCX-TV2 (meaning &quot;alternative JOCX-TV&quot;) in an effort to market the traditionally unprofitable time slots and give opportunities to young creators to express their new ideas. JOCX-TV2 featured numerous experimental programs on low budgets under this and follow-on brands, a notable example being &quot;Zuiikin&#x27; English&quot; which first aired in spring 1992. The JOCX-TV2 branding itself was changed in October 1989 to JOCX-TV+, which lasted until September 1991, when it was replaced with GARDEN/JOCX-MIDNIGHT in October 1991. Meanwhile, Fuji Television helped produce only the third series of the British children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; (now called &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;) with its creator and producer Britt Allcroft. The GARDEN/JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding lasted until September 1992 when it was replaced with the JUNGLE branding, which lasted from October 1992 to September 1993. The JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding was introduced in October 1993 to replace the previous JUNGLE branding, and lasted until March 1996 when Fuji Television decided to stop branding their late-night/early-morning slots.

In 1988, Haruo Kauchi died due to acute liver dysfunction, and Nobutaka Kauchi&#x27;s son-in-law Hiroaki Kauchi assumed the post of chairman of Fuji Television. In 1991, Hiroaki Kauchi decided to move the headquarters of Fuji TV from Kawada Town to the Odaiba area, which was still almost an empty space at the time, in order to adapt to the equipment needs of the digital TV and satellite TV era- However, on the other hand, Hiroaki Kauchi&#x27;s solo production style was unsatisfactory inside, Hiroaki Kagami and Hisashi Hie had a relationship between the two, and the emergence of a split in the management of Fuji Television. Ehisa, a pro-Japanese group, was appointed to the board of directors of the Japanese newspaper company, which was held on July 21, 1992. The next day, Hiroaki Kanai left Nippon Broadcasting, Fuji Television, and the chairmanship of the company and the chairman of the Fuji Group. The underlying cause of the incident was also acquired by the 2005 Vitality Gate Trial. However, Fuji Television&#x27;s high-rise was born inside, and Japan&#x27;s bubble economy collapsed. At the same time, preparations have been made for the launch of sales in the area of Fuji Television, which was established in 1995.

On March 10, 1997, Fuji TV moved its headquarters from Kawadacho, Shinjuku to the Fujisankei Group Building (FCG Building) in Odaiba, Minato, designed by Kenzo Tange, and broadcast special programs for 7 consecutive nights to congratulate the move to the new headquarters. This year, Fuji TV&#x27;s drama series received good ratings. On September 9, &quot;The Virgin Road&quot;, &quot;Under One Roof 2&quot;, &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; and &quot;Love Generation&quot; all achieved average ratings of more than 20%. Fuji TV also established a new &quot;Wednesday Theater&quot; this year, allowing dramas to be broadcast from Monday to Thursday evenings. On August 8 of the same year, Fuji TV stocks were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, becoming the third flagship station to have its stocks listed after Nippon TV and TBS. It was also the first time that a main station&#x27;s stock was listed after 37 years. In addition, in this year, with the launch of Sakuranbo TV and Kochi SunSun TV, Fuji TV&#x27;s network was also announced to be completed. In April 1998, Fuji TV opened its official website.

In 2000, BS Fuji began broadcasting. Together with CS channel Fuji TV 721 (now Fuji TV ONE) launched in 1998 and Fuji TV 739 (now Fuji TV TWO) launched in 1999, Fuji TV officially entered the satellite TV field and realized a multi-channel structure. By 2002, the number of subscribers to pay channels Fuji TV 721 and Fuji TV 739 had reached 1 million. On December 1, 2003, Fuji TV began to broadcast digital TV signals. The following year, Fuji TV regained the triple crown of ratings from Nippon TV after 11 years. However, while the ratings are rising, the peculiar situation that the parent company of Fuji TV and Nippon Broadcasting Corporation is smaller than its subsidiary company (in 2003, Nippon Broadcasting Corporation held 34.1% of the shares of Fuji TV) has also made Fuji TV become the leader of securities investment funds such as Murakami Fund. The target of equity acquisition. Beginning in 2003, Fuji TV and securities investment funds launched a competition to purchase the equity of Japan Broadcasting Corporation, and eventually developed into the Livedoor turmoil in 2005.

Since 2002, Fuji Television has co-sponsored the Clarion Girl contest, held annually to select a representative for Clarion who will represent Clarion&#x27;s car audio products in television and print advertising campaigns during the following year.

On April 1, 2006, Fuji Television split up the radio broadcasting and station license of Nippon Broadcasting System into a newly established company with the same name. The remaining of the old Nippon Broadcasting System was dissolved into Fuji Television. This resulted in the assets of Nippon Broadcasting System being transferred over to Fuji Television.

On October 1, 2008, Fuji Television restructured and became a certified broadcasting holding company and the second incarnation of &quot;Fuji Television Network Inc.&quot; took over the broadcasting business; this was the first time a Japanese commercial broadcaster restructured into a holding company with a wholly-owned subsidiary taking over the station operations. That same year, in response to the development of online media, Fuji TV launched the on-demand video service Fuji TV On Demand (FOD).

On July 24, 2011, Fuji Television ended its analog signal.

Fuji Television, which broadcasts Formula One in Japan since 1987, is the only media sponsor of a Formula One Grand Prix in the world. Fuji Television has also licensed numerous Formula One video games until , due to change in arrangement of Formula One commercial rights after that season.

===Decline and restructuring===
In the 2010s, Fuji TV suffered from sluggish ratings. In 2011, Fuji TV&#x27;s triple crown position in ratings was regained by Nippon Television, and was surpassed by TV Asahi the following year, with the ratings dropping to third place in the flagship stations. Poor ratings also affected business conditions. Fuji TV&#x27;s advertising revenue has been declining year by year since 2005, and was surpassed by Nippon Television in 2014. It lost its first position in the core bureau&#x27;s advertising revenue after 30 years. In 2015, Nippon Television&#x27;s turnover also exceeded that of Fuji Television. In order to reverse this situation, Fuji TV promoted Chihiro Kameyama, who has produced many popular TV series, as president in 2013. After Kameyama took office as the president, he stopped broadcasting &quot;It&#x27;s not a big deal if you take the time to smile!&quot; and other long-running programs, and implemented measures such as a large-scale personnel transfer of 1,000 people in an attempt to promote revitalization within the company. However, these measures did not reverse the sluggish ratings. During the New Year&#x27;s Eve week from 2015 to 2016, for the first time, Fuji TV&#x27;s evening prime-time ratings were lower than those of Tokyo TV, ranking last among the flagship stations.

In 2016, Fuji TV&#x27;s evening prime time ratings were surpassed by TBS again, falling to fourth place in the flagship stations. However, Fuji TV&#x27;s sluggish ratings are also due to the phenomenon of TV disengagement, which has led to a decline in overall TV ratings; real-time ratings have declined but the proportion of time-shifted ratings has increased. On the other hand, Fuji TV ranks second in ratings among the 13 to 49 age group, which is most valued by advertisers. Therefore, Fuji TV has invested more resources in program production for young audiences to improve advertising effects. Fuji TV is also actively investing in the development of new media fields, and FOD has become profitable.

Fuji Media Holdings is also trying to make up for the negative impact of the downturn in the television sector by developing sectors other than television. Fuji TV began broadcasting the evening programs of its terrestrial station simultaneously on the Internet from April 11, 2022. In July of the same year, Koichi Minato, who had been the producer of many high-rating programs, became president of Fuji TV, later signed a cooperation agreement with French media conglomerate Groupe M6 after the failed merger with Bouygues-owned TF1 Group in a following year. After taking office, he implemented a number of measures to strengthen the field of entertainment programs such as variety shows and dramas. One of them is to start broadcasting &quot;Pokapoka&quot; in 2023, and resumed the broadcast of live strip variety shows in the weekday noon time after nearly 9 years. Fuji Media Holdings announced that it had acquired the broadcasting rights of the Asian Games along with TBS Holdings, beginning with the Hangzhou 2022 event on its 65th anniversary.

On September 27, 2024, Fuji TV and Fuji Media Holdings announced the establishment of Fuji Consumer Products which would handle licensing and marketing for &quot;Chuggington&quot; and Gachapin &amp; Mukku. 

On January 27, 2025, President Koichi Minato and Chairman Shuji Kanoh announced their resignations, taking responsibility for the broadcaster&#x27;s handling of sexual misconduct allegations against former presenter Masahiro Nakai. Kenji Shimizu, an executive at parent company Fuji Media Holdings, assumed the role of president starting the following day, to deal with declining viewership ratings and the ongoing restructuring of the company. This decision followed an emergency board meeting convened to address the situation.

==Controversies==
=== Anti-Korean sentiment ===
On August 7–21, 2011, more than 2,000 protesters from Japanese Culture Channel Sakura and other groups rallied in front of Fuji Television and Fuji Media Holdings&#x27; headquarters in Odaiba, Tokyo to demonstrate against what they perceived as the network&#x27;s increased use of South Korean content, information manipulation and insulting treatment of Japanese people. Channel Sakura called Fuji Television the &quot;Traitor Network&quot; in these protests.

Further on June 29, 2015, Fuji Television apologized for running subtitles during a show earlier in the month that inaccurately described South Koreans interviewed on the street as saying they &quot;hate&quot; Japan. The apology came after a successful online petition over the weekend, with people stating the major broadcaster had fabricated the subtitles to breed anti-Korean sentiment amongst the Japanese public. Fuji TV explained that both interviewees indeed spoke of their dislike of Japan during the interviews, but it accidentally ran clips that did not contain that message. According to the broadcaster, &quot;we aired these inaccurate clips because of a mix-up during the editing process as well as our failure to check the final footage sufficiently&quot;.

In 2016, a 32-year-old Fuji Television Police reporter was indicted after strawpurchasing an Audi sportscar on behalf of a Yamaguchigumi-affiliated yakuza member. The two had met over 20 times over a year, dining at restaurants in central Tokyo. In a statement, Fuji TV said: &quot;It is undetermined whether the partner was part of an anti-social organization. We cannot comment on the details.&quot; The reporter was later fined 300,000 yen.

=== 2024 Japan Series coverage ===
In early June 2024, as part of their Los Angeles Dodgers coverage, they, along with Nippon TV, gave very comprehensive coverage of Shohei Ohtani&#x27;s Los Angeles home. The coverage was widely panned as an invasion of Ohtani&#x27;s privacy largely due to the aerial views of the property as well as interviews with various neighbors. As a result, the Dodgers revoked the media credentials of the two networks. Both networks declined to respond to the situation. One of the consequences of this, is that the Nippon Professional Baseball Organization (NPB) stripped Fuji TV of press passes for the first two games of the 2024 Japan Series before it started on Oct. 26. However, for Television Nishinippon Corporation (TNC), a local Fukuoka TV station affiliated with Fuji Network System that would be covering the third game, its press passes were still granted, since it is considered as a separate company from Fuji Television, but the words &quot;Fuji Television&quot; in the space indicating the affiliation in the passes were blacked out with a marker.

=== Masahiro Nakai scandal and channel hostilities ===
In January 2025, Fuji Television apologized over allegations that TV personality and former SMAP boy band member Masahiro Nakai had sexually assaulted a woman in her 20s in June 2023, and that a Fuji TV employee arranged for the dinner between the two. Fuji TV president Koichi Minato told reporters that the network denied involvement in the incident, but was aware of it and chose not to publicize the matter out of respect for the woman&#x27;s privacy and recovery. He added that an investigative panel of lawyers would look into the issue. This came after the initial reports from Japanese tabloids including &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; in December 2024, and a subsequent open letter from an affiliate of American activist fund Dalton Investments (a minority shareholder of Fuji Media Holdings) calling on an investigation and alleging that Fuji TV&#x27;s handling of the Nakai matter exposed &quot;serious flaws&quot; in their corporate governance. The press conference was criticized for its closed nature, limiting the media that could attend and prohibiting live broadcasts and video recording. Dalton Investments sent a second letter on January 21, criticizing the closed press conference and demanding that a second, open press conference be held by the end of the week. &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; reported the next day that Fuji TV was planning to change the makeup of its investigative panel to one established under guidelines set by the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, after receiving criticism on their initial plans for a panel consisting of lawyers unrelated to the broadcaster. On January 23, 2025, Nakai announced his retirement from the entertainment industry.

In response to the Nakai incident there was a widespread movement among sponsors, including Nissan, Toyota, Kirin Holdings, Kao Corporation, Seven &amp; I Holdings, Shiseido and Nintendo to withhold and suspend their commercials from Fuji TV. FMH&#x27;s shares fell at least 13% as a consequence of the scandal. Additionally, Kikkoman asked Fuji TV to suspend airing the show which they sponsor, &quot;Kuishinbo! Bansai&quot;, and Shionogi Healthcare decided to remove their name from the network&#x27;s music show &quot;Music Fair&quot;. Some companies considered refund negotiations and contract termination before the advertisement contract expired. The network aired commercials from AC Japan to fill in slots left out by companies that stopped advertising.

On January 17, 2025 &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot;, citing an unnamed Fuji TV announcer, reported that the Fuji TV staffer who allegedly arranged the 2023 dinner party with Nakai had arranged other similar parties for Nakai and Fuji TV.

On January 27, 2025, Fuji Television Network Inc. announced major leadership changes in response to the sexual harassment scandal involving Nakai. Koichi Minato, president of Fuji Television Network Inc., and Shuji Kanoh, chairman of parent company Fuji Media Holdings Inc., both resigned effective immediately. Kenji Shimizu was appointed as the new president, taking over on January 28. Fuji TV&#x27;s press conference where they announced the changes, lasted over ten hours, ending at around 2:20a.m. the following morning and hosted around 400 members of the press. Conspicuously absent from the press conference was Hisashi Hieda, former President and CEO of Fuji Television and Fuji Media Holdings, and current director and advisor of the company. According to the answers given to questions regarding his absence, Kano responded that the reason is &quot;because he is an advisor&quot; and that &quot;the responsibility (for duties) is mine and Minato&#x27;s&quot;. When asked if Hieda had made any statements to the effect that he would &quot;take responsibility&quot;, he did not clarify, saying there was nothing in particular that could be said. Regarding if Hieda would resign, he answered that he was not directly involved, but &quot;we need to consider the underlying causes as well&quot;.

During the press conference, several topics were talked about. About the case, it had been known since June 2023, when the woman talked about it to a Fuji employee. Due to the nature of the incident, it was reported to executives, officers, and eventually the president; only a few people in the company knew about it. Nakai himself reported the incident in July, and Fuji hesitated to take on the case, because an agreement between the parts had already taken place, and a settlement was proceeding. President Minato became aware until August. Since then, the woman was kept under watch, regarding her health and recovery, hoping she would return to work as soon as she could. A formal investigation was not conducted regarding Nakai. The reason given for this decision was that they feared that if they had started a formal investigation, it would have a negative impact on the woman&#x27;s care if more people found out. So, they did not immediately and actively conduct interviews. Communication was difficult, and, to confirm delicate matters, they could only communicate with the woman through and with her doctors, and the idea was to wait until the situation stabilized.

Regarding the involvement of one of their staff in the invitation of the female who was Nakai&#x27;s victim in that day&#x27;s event as reported by Bunshun, Fuji has continued to deny it, citing inquiries and interviews with Nakai and other employees and staff, and to phone call records, but confirmed that that employee had indeed invited the woman to a barbeque in May, held in Nakai&#x27;s house. In that occasion, at least 10 people were at the gathering. There was another gathering at a hotel in Tokyo in the winter of 2021 with Nakai and other people in the entertainment industry, Fuji employees, including the woman in question. Neither of the latter two meetings have been considered as an extension of the barbeque, nor has been revealed full confirmation of the reason for having the gathering. Regarding a question about considering female employees, like announcers, as &quot;entertainment staff&quot;, Minato responded &quot;We do have dinner parties with celebrities and TV show participants, New Year&#x27;s parties and the like. Sometimes female announcers join in on these. I have never thought of them as entertainment staff&quot;, and reiterated, &quot;I have always thought of them as one of our colleagues, attending a banquet together, so I have never personally perceived them as entertainment staff&quot;. 

Regarding if they had considered filing some kind of claim for damages against Nakai, Endo replied, &quot;The third-party committee has not yet reached a decision, so as of now, we have not.&quot; When asked if there was a possibility, he said, &quot;The possibility may not be zero.&quot;

On January 28, 2025, it was reported that, just before the Fuji press conference on the 27, Weekly Bunshun had changed wording of its electronic version of the post dated December 25, 2024, omitting that the woman was invited to the incident day&#x27;s dinner by a Fuji TV programming executive, changing it to that the invitation was from Nakai, as a continuation from a meeting that the executive had set up.

<doc id="193227" wikidata="Q677660" url="?curid=193227" title="Battle of Heligoland Bight (1914)">
<text>The Battle of Heligoland Bight was the first Anglo-German naval battle of the First World War, fought on 28 August 1914, between ships of the United Kingdom and Germany. The battle took place in the south-eastern North Sea, when the British attacked German patrols off the north-west German coast. The German High Seas Fleet was in harbour on the north German coast while the British Grand Fleet was out in the northern North Sea. Both sides engaged in long-distance sorties with cruisers and battlecruisers, with close reconnaissance of the area of sea near the German coast—the Heligoland Bight—by destroyer.

The British devised a plan to ambush German destroyers on their daily patrols. A British flotilla of 31 destroyers and two cruisers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, with submarines commanded by Commodore Roger Keyes, was dispatched. They were supported at longer range by an additional six light cruisers commanded by William Goodenough and five battlecruisers commanded by Vice Admiral David Beatty.

Surprised, outnumbered and outgunned, the German fleet suffered 712 sailors killed, 530 injured and 336 taken prisoner; three German light cruisers (, and ) and one torpedo boat () were sunk; three more light cruisers (, and ) and three torpedo boats suffered damage. The British suffered casualties of 35 killed and 55 wounded; one light cruiser and three destroyers suffered damage. Despite the disparity of the ships involved in the battle, the battle was regarded as a great victory in Britain, where the returning ships were met by cheering crowds.

Beatty was vaunted as a hero, although he had taken little part in the action or planning of the raid, which was led by Commodore Tyrwhitt and conceived by him and Keyes, who had persuaded the Admiralty to adopt it. The raid might have led to disaster, had the additional forces under Beatty not been sent by Admiral John Jellicoe at the last minute. The German government and the Kaiser in particular, restricted the freedom of action of the German fleet, instructing it to avoid any contact with superior forces for several months thereafter.

==Prelude==
The battle took place less than a month after the British declaration of war against Germany on 5 August 1914. The war on land led to defeat for the French and their Allies at the Battle of the Frontiers, the German invasion of Belgium and France. British naval tactics had typically involved a close blockade of ports and this had been the British plan for war against Germany up to 1913. The Admiralty had realised that the advent of submarines armed with torpedoes and mines meant that operations involving capital ships near an opponent&#x27;s ports would place them at great risk of surprise attack. Ships would be obliged to keep moving and return to port every few days to refuel.

The German navy had expected that Britain would adopt its traditional approach and had invested in submarines and coast defences. The main body of the German navy—the High Seas Fleet (HSF)—was outnumbered by the British Grand Fleet stationed around home waters and could not expect victory in a general fleet engagement. The HSF adopted a strategy of waiting in defended home ports for opportunities to attack parts of the larger British force. The British adopted a strategy of distant blockade, patrolling the North Sea rather than waters close to Germany. The Germans had two alternatives to break out into the Atlantic Ocean, either by passing through the -wide Straits of Dover, defended by British submarines, mine barrages and a large number of older and smaller warships or exit the northern end of the North Sea, running the gauntlet of the Grand Fleet based at Scapa Flow in Orkney and the -wide narrow point between Britain and Norway. Without access to the Atlantic, the German ships were contained in an area where they could not attack Allied merchant shipping. To keep the HSF in harbour, the Grand Fleet made occasional forays and patrolled with smaller cruiser and battlecruiser squadrons.

The bulk of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was transported to France between 12 and 21 August, protected by British destroyers and submarines patrolling Heligoland Bight, which German ships would have to cross if they sortied from their bases. The Grand Fleet remained on patrol in the centre of the North Sea ready to move south but no attack came. The German army had anticipated a rapid transfer of the British army to France, German naval planners overestimated the time the British would need and German submarines were on patrol seeking the Home Fleet.

==British plan==
At Harwich, Commodore Roger Keyes commanded a squadron of long-range submarines that regularly patrolled the Heligoland Bight and Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt commanded a destroyer patrol. They observed that German destroyers had adopted a regular pattern of patrols where each evening cruisers would escort destroyers out of harbour, to patrol for British ships during the night before being met and escorted home each morning. Keyes and Tyrwhitt proposed to send a superior force during darkness to ambush the German destroyers as they returned. Three British submarines would surface in a position to draw the destroyers back out to sea while a larger British force of 31 destroyers accompanied by nine submarines would cut them off from Germany. Other submarines would wait for any larger German ships leaving the Jade estuary to help.

Keyes impressed Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty with the daring of his plan, which was adopted with some changes. An attack at 08:00 on the German daytime patrol was preferred. Keyes and Tyrwhitt requested support for their operation, in particular bringing the Grand Fleet south and the support of the squadron of six light cruisers commanded by Commodore William Goodenough. This was refused by the Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee, who instead agreed to place only lighter forces consisting of Cruiser Force K (Rear Admiral Gordon Moore) with the battlecruisers and to the north-west and Cruiser Force C comprising the armoured cruisers, , , , and , west.

The attack was planned for 28 August; the submarines were to sail on 26 August, while Keyes would travel on the destroyer and the surface ships would depart at dawn on 27 August. Tyrwhitt, aboard the brand new light cruiser , would command the 3rd Flotilla of 16 modern L-class destroyers, whilst his subordinate, Captain William Blunt, aboard the light cruiser , would command the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of 16 older destroyers. Tyrwhitt had requested the replacement of his cruiser because she was too slow to keep up with his destroyers but &quot;Arethusa&quot; did not arrive until 26 August. Her crew was inexperienced and it was discovered that its new Mk V guns jammed when fired.

Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commanding the Grand Fleet, was not told of the plan until 26 August. Jellicoe immediately requested permission to send reinforcements to join the raid and to move the fleet closer to the action but was allowed only to send battlecruisers in support. Jellicoe dispatched Vice Admiral David Beatty with the battlecruisers , and ; and Goodenough with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, made up of the light cruisers , , , , and . Jellicoe sailed south from Scapa Flow with the remainder of the fleet. Jellicoe sent a message advising Tyrwhitt that he should expect reinforcements but this was delayed at Harwich and never received. Tyrwhitt did not discover the additional forces until Goodenough&#x27;s ships appeared through the mist, leading to a certain apprehension because he was expecting to meet only German vessels. The E-class submarines , and were ordered to attack reinforcing or retreating German vessels. , and were positioned further out to draw the German destroyers out to sea. and were stationed off the river Ems to attack reinforcements should they come from that direction.

==Battle==
At around 07:00, &quot;Arethusa&quot;, steaming south towards the anticipated position of the German ships, sighted a German torpedo boat, . Accompanying &quot;Arethusa&quot; were the 16 destroyers of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla. behind were &quot;Fearless&quot; with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of 16 destroyers and behind them was Goodenough with the six cruisers; visibility was no more than . &quot;G194&quot; immediately turned towards Heligoland, radioing Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass, commander of the German destroyer squadron. Maass informed Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, commander of the German battlecruiser squadron and responsible for local defence. Hipper was unaware of the scale of the attack but ordered the light cruisers and to defend the destroyers. The light cruisers moored on the Ems, , , , and &quot;Kolberg&quot; from the river Jade, &quot;Danzig&quot; and &quot;München&quot; from Brunsbüttelkoog on the river Elbe were ordered to raise steam.

Tyrwhitt ordered four destroyers to attack &quot;G194&quot; and the sound of gunfire alerted the remaining German destroyers moving north, which turned south towards home. Before they could complete the turn, they were sighted by British destroyers which commenced firing. The trailing destroyer was hit, followed by the destroyer-minesweepers &quot;D8&quot; and &quot;T33&quot;. &quot;G9&quot; called for fire against the attacking ships from coastal artillery but the mist meant the gunners could not tell which ships were which. At 07:26, Tyrwhitt turned east, to follow the sound of gunfire sighting ten German destroyers, which he chased through the increasing mist for 30 minutes, until the ships reached Heligoland and he was forced to turn away. At 07:58, &quot;Stettin&quot; and &quot;Frauenlob&quot; arrived, reversing the situation so that the British destroyers were obliged to retreat towards &quot;Arethusa&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot;. &quot;Stettin&quot; withdrew, since the German destroyers had escaped but &quot;Frauenlob&quot; was engaged by &quot;Arethusa&quot;. &quot;Arethusa&quot; was better armed but two of its four guns jammed and another was damaged by fire. &quot;Frauenlob&quot; — armed with ten guns — caused considerable damage before a shell from one of &quot;Arethusa&quot;″s two guns destroyed her bridge, killing 37 men including the captain, forcing her to withdraw and return to Wilhelmshaven badly damaged.
At 08:12, Tyrwhitt returned to the original plan to sweep the area from east to west. Six returning German destroyers were sighted which turned to flee, when turned back. The German ship had seen two cruisers, &quot;Nottingham&quot; and &quot;Lowestoft&quot; from Goodenough&#x27;s squadron ahead and tried to pass through the British destroyers by surprise, only to be surrounded by eight destroyers and sunk. As British ships began to rescue survivors from the water, the German light cruiser &quot;Stettin&quot; approached and opened fire, forcing the British to abandon the rescue, leaving behind British sailors. The British submarine &quot;E4&quot; had observed the action and launched a torpedo at &quot;Stettin&quot; but missed; &quot;Stettin&quot; attempted to ram the submarine, which dived to escape. When &quot;E4&quot; resurfaced the larger ships had gone and the submarine rescued the British crewmen afloat in small boats with the German survivors. The Germans were left behind with a compass and direction toward the mainland as the submarine was too small to take them.

===Confusion of ships===
At 08:15, Keyes—with &quot;Lurcher&quot; and another destroyer—sighted two four-funnelled cruisers. Still unaware that additional British ships were involved, he signalled &quot;Invincible&quot; that he was chasing two German cruisers. Goodenough received the signal, abandoned his search for enemy vessels to attack and steamed to assist Keyes against his own ships, &quot;Lowestoft&quot; and &quot;Nottingham&quot;. Keyes being chased by four more German cruisers attempted to lure them towards &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot;, reporting them as enemy ships. Eventually, Keyes recognised &quot;Southampton&quot; and the ships attempted to rejoin Tyrwhitt. The British submarines were still unaware that the other ships were present and at 09:30, a British submarine fired two torpedoes at &quot;Southampton&quot;; the submarine missed and then escaped when &quot;Southampton&quot; tried to ram it. &quot;Lowestoft&quot; and &quot;Nottingham&quot; remained out of communication range; separated from the rest of their squadron, they took no further part in the action. Tyrwhitt turned to assist Keyes, on receipt of the signal that he was being chased, sighted &quot;Stettin&quot; but lost her in the mist before coming upon &quot;Fearless&quot; and her destroyer squadron. &quot;Arethusa&quot; was badly damaged and at 10:17 &quot;Fearless&quot; came alongside and both cruisers were stopped for twenty minutes while repairs were made to the boilers.

===German cruisers===
&quot;Cöln&quot;, &quot;Strassburg&quot; and &quot;Ariadne&quot; had sailed from Wilhelmshaven to join the German ships, while &quot;Mainz&quot; was approaching from a different direction. Admiral Maass was still unaware of the nature of the attack and dispersed his ships in search of the enemy. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was first to find &quot;Arethusa&quot; and attacked with shells and torpedoes but was driven off by torpedo attacks from the destroyers. As Tyrwhitt turned away to the west, &quot;Cöln&quot;—with Admiral Maass—approached from the south-east and was also chased away by torpedoes. Tyrwhitt signalled Beatty requesting reinforcements and Goodenough with the four cruisers remaining with him came to assist; the force turned west.
Beatty had been following the events by radio to the north-west. By 11:35, the British ships had still not completed their mission and withdrawn; with the rising tide, larger German ships would be able to leave harbour and join the engagement. Beatty took his five battlecruisers south-eastwards at maximum speed, an hour away from the engagement. While the advantages of using his more powerful ships to rescue the others was clear, this had to be weighed against the possibility of mischance by torpedo or of meeting German dreadnoughts once the tide was up.

At 11:30, Tyrwhitt&#x27;s squadron came upon the German cruiser &quot;Mainz&quot; and the ships engaged for 20 minutes, before the arrival of Goodenough caused &quot;Mainz&quot; to attempt an escape. Goodenough gave chase and in trying to lose him, &quot;Mainz&quot; came back across the path of &quot;Arethusa&quot; and her destroyers. Her steering was damaged, causing her to turn back into the path of Goodenough&#x27;s ships and she was hit by shells and a torpedo. At 12:20, her captain ordered his ship to be scuttled and the crew to abandon ship. Keyes had now joined the main body of ships and brought &quot;Lurcher&quot; alongside &quot;Mainz&quot; to take off the crew. Three British destroyers had been seriously damaged in the engagement. &quot;Strassburg&quot; and &quot;Cöln&quot; attacked together but the battle was interrupted by Beatty and the battlecruisers. A destroyer officer wrote,

===Battlecruisers===
&quot;Strassburg&quot; managed to disengage and escape when the battlecruisers approached but &quot;Cöln&quot; was cut off and quickly disabled by the much larger guns of the battlecruisers. She was saved from immediate sinking by the sighting of another German light cruiser, &quot;Ariadne&quot;, to which Beatty gave chase and again quickly overcame. &quot;Ariadne&quot; was left to sink, which she eventually did at 15:00, attended by the German ships &quot;Danzig&quot; and &quot;Stralsund&quot; who took off survivors. At 13:10, Beatty turned north-west and ordered all the British ships to withdraw, since the tide had now risen sufficiently for larger German ships to pass through the Jade estuary. Passing &quot;Cöln&quot; again, he opened fire, sinking her.

Attempts to rescue the crew were interrupted by the arrival of a submarine; one survivor was rescued by a German ship two days later, out of some 250 men who had survived the sinking. Rear Admiral Maass perished with his ship. Four German cruisers survived the engagement, saved by the mist. &quot;Strassburg&quot; nearly approached the battlecruisers but saw them in time and turned away. She had four funnels, like the British Town-class cruisers, which caused sufficient confusion to allow her time to disappear into the mist. The German battlecruisers and left the Jade at 14:10 and began a cautious search for other ships. Rear Admiral Hipper arrived in &quot;Seydlitz&quot; at 15:10 but by then the battle was over.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
To preserve his ships the Kaiser determined that the fleet should, &quot;hold itself back and avoid actions which can lead to greater losses&quot;. Admiral Hugo von Pohl, Chief of the German Naval Staff, wired Ingenohl that, &quot;in his anxiety to preserve the fleet [William] ... wished you to wire for his consent before entering a decisive action&quot;. Alfred von Tirpitz was outraged by this decision and wrote after the war,

After the war, Churchill wrote,

Lieutenant Stephen King-Hall on &quot;Southampton&quot;, later wrote about the battle that


The Germans had assumed that their cruisers, leaving port one by one, would not meet larger ships or a superior force and failed to keep their ships together so they might have better odds in any engagement. Beatty—when faced with the choice of leaving one of his ships to finish off disabled enemies—had elected to keep his squadron together and only later return in force to finish off the ships. Goodenough managed to lose track of two cruisers, which played no further part in the battle.

German light cruisers armed with larger numbers of faster firing guns, proved inferior to similar British cruisers with fewer but more powerful guns. The German ships proved difficult to sink despite severe damage and impressed the British with the quality of their firing. British and German sources reported the determination and bravery of the defeated German ships when overwhelmed. No one reported the presence of British cruisers to Admiral Hipper until 14:35. Had he known, he could have brought his battlecruisers to sea faster and consolidated his fleet, possibly preventing German losses and instead inflicting some on the departing British ships. The British operation took longer than anticipated and large German ships would have had sufficient high water to join the battle.

The British side suffered from poor communication, with ships failing to report engagement with the enemy to each other. The initial failure to include Jellicoe in planning the raid could have led to disaster, had he not sent reinforcements and the communication failures meant British ships were unaware of the new arrivals and could have attacked them. There was no way to warn off British submarines which might have targeted their own ships. It had been the decision of Admiral Sturdee—Admiralty Chief of Staff—not to inform Jellicoe and also not to send additional larger ships which had originally been requested by Keyes. Jellicoe had countermanded this decision once he knew of the raid, by sending ships which were part of his command. Keyes was disappointed that the opportunity for greater success had been lost by not including the additional cruisers properly into the plan as he had originally intended. Jellicoe was disturbed by the Admiralty&#x27;s failure to discuss the raid with their commander in chief of the Home Fleet at sea.

The Germans appreciated that standing patrols by destroyers wasted time and resources, leaving them open to attack. The Germans sowed defensive minefields to prevent enemy ships from approaching and freed the destroyers to escort larger ships, which were never to be sent out one by one. The British realised it was foolish to have sent &quot;Arethusa&quot; into battle with inadequate training and jammed guns. British ships were criticised for having fired considerable ammunition and torpedoes with little effect but this criticism backfired when at the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915, British crews tried to conserve ammunition and missed opportunities to damage German vessels.

===Casualties===
Germany lost the light cruisers &quot;Mainz&quot;, &quot;Cöln&quot; and &quot;Ariadne&quot; and the destroyer &quot;V187&quot; sunk. The light cruisers &quot;Frauenlob&quot;, &quot;Strassburg&quot; and &quot;Stettin&quot; had been damaged and returned to base with casualties. German casualties were killed, including Maass and the destroyer commodore. The British took sailors were rescued by Commodore Keyes on the destroyer &quot;Lurcher&quot; and brought to England, the son of Tirpitz being among the prisoners. The British had lost no ships and casualties did not exceed killed and about

<doc id="193229" wikidata="Q6205057" url="?curid=193229" title="John Taylor of Caroline">
<text>John Taylor (December 19, 1753August 21, 1824), usually called John Taylor of Caroline, was a politician and writer. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates (1779–1781, 1783–1785, 1796–1800) and in the United States Senate (1792–1794, 1803, 1822–1824). He wrote several books on politics and agriculture. He was a Jeffersonian Republican and his works provided inspiration to the later states&#x27; rights and libertarian movements. Sheldon and Hill (2008) locate Taylor at the intersection of republicanism and classical liberalism. They see his position as a &quot;combination of a concern with Lockean natural rights, freedom, and limited government along with a classical interest in strong citizen participation in rule to prevent concentrated power and wealth, political corruption, and financial manipulation.&quot;

==Early life==
According to some sources, John Taylor was born in Orange County, Virginia, in 1753, though others state that this is in error and that he was in fact born in Caroline County in 1754. He was the son of James Taylor and Ann Pollard. She was a sister of Sarah Pollard, wife of Edmund Pendleton, a Founding Father of the State of Virginia who served as president of the Fifth Virginia Convention held between May and July 1776, that declared in favor of independence. Taylor was of the same line as General Zachary Taylor, who became the President of the United States. He graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1770, studied law, and began to practice in Caroline County in 1774. At the onset of the Revolutionary War he joined the Continental army, becoming a colonel of cavalry.

==Political career==
Taylor served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1779 to 1787, being one of the leading members. About this time he gave up the practice of law and devoted his ample time to politics and agriculture. In 1792 he was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Richard Henry Lee in the United States Senate, and was elected to the term that began March 4, 1793, but resigned, May 11, 1794. He served as a presidential elector in 1797. Taylor was a close friend of Thomas Jefferson, and, as member of the House of Delegates, was one of the men who offered the Virginia Resolves to that body. In 1801, Taylor ran for Congress in Virginia&#x27;s 11th congressional district, but lost to incumbent Anthony New.

Taylor served in the U.S. Senate on two additional occasions. He was appointed to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Stevens Thomson Mason, and served from June 4, 1803, until December 7, 1803, when he resigned. In 1822, he was elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of James Pleasants, and was elected later to serve the regular term for six years beginning December 18, 1822, but died at his estate in Caroline County, August 20, 1824.

Taylor was a prolific political writer, and was the author of &quot;An Inquiry into the Principles and Policy of the Government of the United States,&quot; 1814; &quot;Construction Construed and the Constitution Vindicated.&quot; 1820; &quot;Tyranny Unmasked. 1822; &quot;New Views of the Constitution of the United States.&quot; 1823. He was also a scientific agriculturist, and in 1811 was first president of the Virginia Agricultural Societies. His little books, &quot;Arator&quot; (&quot;Ploughman&quot;, in Latin), being a series of agricultural essays, practical and political, 1818, was one of the first American books on agriculture. Taylor County, West Virginia, was named in his honor.

==Ideas==
English legal historian Maurice Vile views Taylor as &quot;in some ways the most impressive political theorist that America has produced.&quot; The historian Clyde N. Wilson describes Taylor as &quot;the systematic philosopher of Jeffersonian democracy&quot; and as &quot;representing &#x27;both a conservative allegiance to local community and inherited ways and a radical-populist suspicion of capitalism, &#x27;progress,&#x27; government and routine logrolling politics.&#x27;&quot; According to historian Adam L. Tate, Taylor was &quot;an agrarian who &#x27;viewed happiness as possession of family, farm, and leisure,&#x27; had no great love for organized religion, social hierarchy, and other such traditional institutions.&quot; Joseph R. Stromberg wrote, &quot;Taylor took solid liberal ground in holding that men were a mixture of good and evil. Self-interest was the only real constant in human action... Indeed, while other thinkers, from Thomas Jefferson to Federalist John Adams, agonized over the need for a virtuous citizenry, Taylor took the view that &#x27;the principles of a society may be virtuous, though the individuals composing it are vicious.&#x27;&quot; Taylor&#x27;s solution to the effects of factionalism was to &quot;remove the base from under the stock jobbers, the banks, the paper money party, the tariff-supported manufacturers, and so on; destroy the system of patronage by which the executive has corrupted the legislature; bring down the usurped authority of the Supreme Court.&quot; &quot;The more a nation depends for its liberty on the qualities of individuals, the less likely it is to retain it. By expecting publick good from private virtue, we expose ourselves to publick evils from private vices.&quot;

Taylor wrote in defense of slavery but admitted that it was wrong. &quot;Let it not be supposed that I approve of slavery because I do not aggravate its evils, or prefer a policy which must terminate in a war of extermination.&quot; Rather, he defended the institution because he &quot;thought blacks incapable of liberty.&quot; Taylor feared that widespread emancipation would ultimately and invariably lead to the horrific bloodshed witnessed in the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1791, the site of the greatest of all successful slave insurrections, the Haitian Revolution. &quot;Taylor is one with most American thinkers from Washington to Jefferson to Lincoln in doubting that the free Negro could ever be anything but a problem for American politics.&quot; Thus, he advocated the deportation of free blacks.

&quot;Negro slavery is a misfortune to agriculture, incapable of removal, and only within the reach of palliation.&quot; Taylor criticized Jefferson&#x27;s ambivalence towards slavery in &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;. Taylor agreed with Jefferson that the institution was evil but took issue with Jefferson&#x27;s repeated references to the specific cruelties of slavery. Taylor argued that &quot;[s]laves are docile, useful and happy, if they are well managed,&quot; that &quot;[t]he individual is restrained by his property in the slave, and susceptible of humanity, and that &quot;[r]eligion assails him [the slaveholder] both with her blandishments and terrors. It indissolubly binds his, and his slaves&#x27; happiness or misery together.&quot;

That slavery might paradoxically have fostered a sense of equality among whites has been reconsidered recently by Edmund S. Morgan. Taylor&#x27;s approach, defending the preservation of slavery under the circumstances and apprehensions of his day, would be used to support more emphatic defenses of slavery by writers, such as John C. Calhoun, Edmund Ruffin, and George Fitzhugh, who extended the argument by claiming the institution to be a &quot;positive good.&quot;

===States&#x27; rights===
Stromberg says that Taylor&#x27;s role in calling for Virginia&#x27;s secession in 1798 and his role in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions &quot;show how seriously he took the reserved rights [interposition (nullification) and secession] of these primary political communities [the States].&quot; Taylor was responsible for guiding the Virginia Resolution, written by James Madison, through the Virginia legislature. He wrote: &quot;enormous political power invariably accumulates enormous wealth and enormous wealth invariably accumulates enormous political power.&quot; &quot;Like his radical bourgeois counterparts in England, Taylor would not concede that great extremes of wealth and poverty were natural outcomes of differences in talent; on the contrary they were invariably the result of extra-economic coercion and deceit.&quot; &quot;Along with John Randolph of Roanoke and a few others, Taylor opposed Madison&#x27;s War of 1812—his own party&#x27;s war—precisely because it was a war for empire.&quot;

Tate (2011) undertakes a literary criticism of Taylor&#x27;s book &quot;New Views of the Constitution of the United States,&quot; arguing it is structured as a forensic historiography modeled on the techniques of 18th-century whig lawyers. Taylor believed that evidence from American history gave proof of state sovereignty within the union, against the arguments of nationalists such as Chief Justice John Marshall.

==Legacy==
Taylor&#x27;s primary plantation estate, Hazelwood, was located three miles from Port Royal, Virginia and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Taylor County, West Virginia was formed in 1844 and named in Senator Taylor&#x27;s honor.

From &quot;Reprints of Legal Classics&quot; (1)

Little-known today, Taylor&#x27;s work is of great significance in the political and intellectual history of the South and is essential for understanding the constitutional theories that Southerners asserted to justify secession in 1861. Taylor fought in the Continental army during the American Revolution and served briefly in the Virginia House of Delegates and as a U.S. Senator. It was as a writer on constitutional, political, and agricultural questions, however, that Taylor gained prominence. He joined with Thomas Jefferson and other agrarian advocates of states&#x27; rights and a strict construction of the Constitution in the political battles of the 1790s. His first published writings argued against Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s financial program. &quot;Construction Construed and Constitutions Vindicated&quot; was Taylor&#x27;s response to a series of post-War of 1812 developments including John Marshall&#x27;s Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland, the widespread issuance of paper money by banks, proposals for a protective tariff, and the attempt to bar slavery from Missouri. Along with many other Southerners, Taylor feared that these and other measures following in the train of Hamilton&#x27;s financial system, were undermining the foundations of American republicanism. He saw them as the attempt of an &quot;artificial capitalist sect&quot; to corrupt the virtue of the American people and upset the proper constitutional balance between state and federal authority in favor of a centralized national government. Taylor wrote, &quot;If the means to which the government of the union may resort for executing the power confided to it, are unlimited, it may easily select such as will impair or destroy the powers confided to the state governments.&quot; Jefferson, who noted that &quot;Col. Taylor and myself have rarely, if ever, differed in any political principle of importance,&quot; considered &quot;Construction Construed and Constitutions Vindicated&quot; &quot;the most logical retraction of our governments to the original and true principles of the Constitution creating them, which has appeared since the adoption of the instrument.&quot; Later Southern thinkers, notably John C. Calhoun, were clearly indebted to Taylor. Sabin, &quot;A Dictionary of Books Relating to America&quot; 94486. Cohen, &quot;Bibliography of Early American Law&quot; 6333. (21527)

<doc id="193231" wikidata="Q354828" url="?curid=193231" title="Victorien Sardou">
<text>Victorien Sardou ( , ; 5 September 1831 – 8 November 1908) was a French dramatist. He is best remembered today for his development, along with Eugène Scribe, of the well-made play. He also wrote several plays that were made into popular 19th-century operas such as &quot;La Tosca&quot; (1887) on which Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Tosca&quot; (1900) is based, and &quot;Fédora&quot; (1882) and &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (1893) that provided the subjects for the lyrical dramas &quot;Fedora&quot; (1898) and &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (1915) by Umberto Giordano. His play &quot;Gismonda&quot;, from 1894, was also adapted into an opera of the same name by Henry Février.

==Early years==

Victorien Sardou was born at 16 rue Beautreillis (), Paris on 5 September 1831. The Sardous were settled at Le Cannet, a village near Cannes, where they owned an estate, planted with olive trees. A night&#x27;s frost killed all the trees and the family was ruined. Victorien&#x27;s father, Antoine Léandre Sardou, came to Paris in search of employment. He was in succession a book-keeper at a commercial establishment, a professor of book-keeping, the head of a provincial school, then a private tutor and a schoolmaster in Paris, besides editing grammars, dictionaries and treatises on various subjects. With all these occupations, he hardly succeeded in making a livelihood, and when he retired to his native country, Victorien was left on his own resources. He had begun studying medicine, but had to desist for want of funds. He taught French to foreign pupils: he also gave lessons in Latin, history and mathematics to students, and wrote articles for cheap encyclopaedias.

==Career==
At the same time, he was trying to make headway in the literary world. His talents had been encouraged by an old , Mme de Bawl, who had published novels and enjoyed some reputation in the days of the Restoration, but she could do little for her protégé. Victorien Sardou made efforts to attract the attention of Mlle Rachel, and to win her support by submitting to her a drama, &quot;La Reine Ulfra&quot;, founded on an old Swedish chronicle. A play of his, &quot;La Taverne des étudiants&quot;, was produced at the Odéon on 1 April 1854, but met a stormy reception, owing to a rumour that the débutant had been instructed and commissioned by the government to insult the students. &quot;La Taverne&quot; was withdrawn after five nights. Another drama by Sardou, &quot;Bernard Palissy&quot;, was accepted at the same theatre, but the arrangement was cancelled in consequence of a change in the management. A Canadian play, &quot;Fleur de Liane&quot;, would have been produced at the Ambigu but for the death of the manager. &quot;Le Bossu&quot;, which he wrote for Charles Albert Fechter, did not satisfy the actor; and when the play was successfully produced, the nominal authorship, by some unfortunate arrangement, had been transferred to other men. Sardou submitted to Adolphe Lemoine, manager of the Gymnase, a play entitled &quot;Paris à l&#x27;envers&quot;, which contained the love scene, afterwards so famous, in &quot;Nos Intimes&quot;. Lemoine thought fit to consult Eugène Scribe, who was revolted by the scene in question.

In 1857, Sardou felt the pangs of actual want, and his misfortunes culminated in an attack of typhoid fever. He was living in poverty and was dying in his garret, surrounded by his rejected manuscripts. A lady who was living in the same house unexpectedly came to his assistance. Her name was Mlle de Brécourt. She had theatrical connections and was a special favourite of Mlle Déjazet. She nursed him, cured him, and, when he was well again, introduced him to her friend. Déjazet had just established the theatre named after her, and every show after &quot;La Taverne&quot; was put on at this theatre. Fortune began to smile on the author.

It is true that &quot;Candide&quot;, the first play he wrote for Mlle Déjazet, was stopped by the censor, but &quot;Les Premières Armes de Figaro&quot;, &quot;Monsieur Garat&quot;, and &quot;Les Prés Saint Gervais&quot;, produced almost in succession, had a splendid run. &quot;Garat&quot; and &quot;Gervais&quot; were done at Theatre des Varlétés and in English at Criterion Theatre in London. &quot;Les Pattes de mouche&quot; (1860, afterwards anglicized as &quot;A Scrap of Paper&quot;) obtained a similar success at the Gymnase.

&quot;Fédora&quot; (1882), a work that popularized the fedora hat as well, was written expressly for Sarah Bernhardt, as were many of his later plays. This was later adapted by Umberto Giordano, and he made an opera entitled &quot;Fedora&quot;. The play dealt with nihilism, which was coined from &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; by Ivan Turgenev. He struck a new vein by introducing a strong historic element in some of his dramatic romances. Thus he borrowed &quot;Théodora &quot; (1884) from Byzantine annals (which was also adapted into an opera by Xavier Leroux), &quot;La Haine&quot; (1874) from Italian chronicles, &quot;La Duchesse d&#x27;Athénes&quot; from the forgotten records of medieval Greece. &quot;Patrie!&quot; (1869) is founded on the rising of the Dutch Geuzen at the end of the 16th century, and was made into a popular opera by Emile Paladilhe in 1886. The scene of &quot;La Sorcière&quot; (1904) was laid in Spain in the 16th century. The French Revolution furnished him three plays, &quot;Les Merveilleuses&quot;, &quot;Thermidor&quot; (1891) and &quot;Robespierre&quot; (1899). His play &quot;Gismonda&quot; (1894) was adapted into an opera by Henry Février. The last named was written expressly for Sir Henry Irving, and produced at the Lyceum theatre in London, as was &quot;Dante&quot; (1903). The Napoleonic era was revived in &quot;La Tosca&quot; (1887).

&quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (1893) was written specifically for Gabrielle Réjane as the unreserved, good-hearted wife of Marshal Lefevre. It was translated into English and starred Irving and Ellen Terry at the Lyceum Theatre. Later plays were &quot;La Pisie&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Affair of the Poisons&quot; (1907). In many of these plays, however, it was too obvious that a thin varnish of historic learning, acquired for the purpose, had been artificially laid on to cover modern thoughts and feelings. But a few – &quot;Patrie!&quot; and &quot;La Haine&quot; (1874), for instance – exhibit a true insight into the strong passions of past ages. &quot;L&#x27;Affaire des Poisons&quot; (1907) was running at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin and was very successful at the time of his death. The play involved the poisoning camarilla under Louis XIV of France. Toward the end of his life, Sardou made several recordings of himself reading passages from his works, including a scene from &quot;Patrie!&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Sardou married his benefactress, Mlle de Brécourt, but eight years later he became a widower, and soon after the Revolution of 1870 was married a second time, to Mlle Soulié on 17 June 1872, the daughter of the erudite Eudore Soulié, who for many years superintended the Musée de Versailles. He was elected to the Académie française in the room of the poet Joseph Autran (1813–1877), and took his seat on 22 May 1878. He lived at Château de Marly for some time.

He was a fervent book collector who assembled an immense collection of 80,000 books. The rooms at his home in Marly were devoted to housing his book and print collections. After his death his books were sold as described in the &quot;Catalogue de la bibliothèque de feu M. Victorien Sardou&quot; 

He obtained the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1863 and was elected a member of the Académie française in 1877. Sardou died on 8 November 1908 in Paris. He had been ill for a long time. Official cause of death was pulmonary congestion.

==Writing style==
Sardou modelled his work after Eugène Scribe. It was reported in Stephen Sadler Stanton&#x27;s intro to &quot;Camille and Other Plays&quot; that Sardou would read the first act of one of Scribe&#x27;s plays, rewrite the rest, and then compare the two. One of his first goals when writing was to devise a central conflict followed by a powerful climax. From there, he would work backwards to establish the action leading up to it. He believed conflict was the key to drama.

He was ranked with the two undisputed leaders of dramatic art at that time, Augier and Dumas. He adhered to Scribe&#x27;s constructive methods, which combined the three old kinds of comedy —the comedy of character, of manners and of intrigue— with the &quot;drame bourgeois&quot;, and blended the heterogeneous elements into a compact body. He opened a wider field to social satire: He ridiculed the vulgar and selfish middle-class person in &quot;Nos Intimes&quot; (1861: anglicized as &quot;Peril&quot;), the gay old bachelors in &quot;Les Vieux Garçons&quot; (1865), the modern Tartufes in &quot;Seraphine&quot; (1868), the rural element in &quot;Nos Bons Villageois&quot; (1866), old-fashioned customs and antiquated political beliefs in &quot;Les Ganaches&quot; (1862), the revolutionary spirit and those who thrive on it in &quot;Rabagas&quot; (1872) and &quot;Le Roi Carotte&quot; (1872), the then threatened divorce laws in &quot;Divorçons&quot; (1880).

==Legacy==
Irish playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw said of &quot;La Tosca&quot;: &quot;Such an empty-headed ghost of a shocker... Oh, if it had but been an opera!&quot; He also came up with the dismissive term &quot;&quot; in a review of Sardou plays (&quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, 1 June 1895). Shaw believed that Sardou&#x27;s contrived dramatic machinery was creaky and that his plays were empty of ideas.

After producer Sir Squire Bancroft saw the dress rehearsal for &quot;Fedora&quot;, he said in his memoirs &quot;In five minutes the audience was under a spell which did not once abate throughout the whole four acts. Never was treatment of a strange and dangerous subject more masterly, never was acting more superb than Sarah showed that day.&quot; William Winter said of &quot;Fedora&quot; that &quot;the distinguishing characteristic of this drama is carnality.&quot;

Sardou is mentioned in part two, chapter two of Proust&#x27;s &quot;The Guermantes Way&quot;, the third volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

In New Orleans, during the period when much of its upper class still spoke French, Antoine Alciatore, founder of the famous old restaurant Antoine&#x27;s, invented a dish called Eggs Sardou in honor of the playwright&#x27;s visit to the city.

The Rue Victorien Sardou and Square Victorien Sardou near the Parc Sainte-Périne in Paris are named after him. There are also streets named rue Victorien Sardou in Lyon and Saint-Omer.

There are at least two dishes made in honor of Sardou: Lobster Thermidor in Paris and Eggs Sardou in Louisiana.

<text>The Battle of Dogger Bank was a naval engagement during the First World War that took place on 24 January 1915 near the Dogger Bank in the North Sea, between squadrons of the British Grand Fleet and the (High Seas Fleet). The British had intercepted and decoded German wireless transmissions, gaining advance knowledge that a German raiding squadron was heading for the Dogger Bank and ships of the Grand Fleet sailed to intercept the raiders.

The British surprised the smaller and slower German squadron, which fled for home. During a stern chase lasting several hours, the British caught up with the Germans and engaged them with long-range gunfire. The British disabled , the rearmost German ship and the Germans put the British flagship out of action. Due to inadequate signalling, the remaining British ships stopped the pursuit to sink &quot;Blücher&quot;; by the time the ship had been sunk, the rest of the German squadron had escaped.

The German squadron returned to harbour with some ships in need of extensive repairs. &quot;Lion&quot; made it back to port but was out of action for several months. The British had lost no ships and suffered few casualties; the Germans had lost &quot;Blücher&quot; and most of her crew. After the British victory, both navies replaced officers who were thought to have shown poor judgement and made changes to equipment and procedures because of failings observed during the battle.

==Background==

===Room 40===
Before 1914, international communication was conducted via undersea cables laid along shipping lanes, most of which were under British control. Hours after the British ultimatum to Germany in August 1914, they cut the German cables. German messages could be passed only by wireless, using cyphers to disguise their content. The (SKM) was captured from the German light cruiser after she ran aground in the Baltic Sea on 26 August 1914. The German-Australian steamer &quot;Hobart&quot; was seized near Melbourne, Australia on 11 August and the (HVB) codebook, used by the German navy to communicate with merchant ships and within the High Seas Fleet, was captured. A copy of the book was sent to England by the fastest steamer, arriving at the end of October. During the Battle off Texel (17 October), the commander of the German destroyer threw overboard his secret papers in a lead lined chest as the ship sank but on 30 November, a British trawler dragged up the chest. Room 40 gained a copy of the (VB) codebook, normally used by Flag officers of the .

The Director of the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty War Staff, Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver, established a code breaking organisation to decipher German signals, using cryptographers from academic backgrounds and making use of the windfalls taken from the German ships. At first, the inexperience of the cryptanalysts in naval matters led to errors in the understanding of the material. This lack of naval experience caused Oliver to make personal decisions about the information to be passed to other departments, many of which, particularly the Operations Division, had reservations about the value of Room 40. The transfer of an experienced naval officer, Commander H. W. W. Hope, remedied most of the deficiencies of the civilians&#x27; understanding. When Oliver later became Chief of the Admiralty War Staff he continued to treat Room 40 as a fiefdom and a source for the informal group of officers around the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, which received decoded messages but had insufficient authority to use them to best advantage.

German ships had to report their position every night by wireless and British listening posts along the east coast took cross-bearings to find the positions of the ships when they transmitted. This signals intelligence meant that the British did not need wasteful defensive standing patrols and sweeps of the North Sea but could economise on fuel and use the time for training and maintenance. The Admiralty also uncovered the German order of battle and tracked the deployment of ships, which gave them an offensive advantage. The lack of a proper war staff at the Admiralty and poor liaison between Room 40, Oliver and the operations staff meant that the advantage was poorly exploited in 1915; it was not until 1917 that this was remedied. When German ships sailed, information from Room 40 needed to be passed on quickly but Oliver found it hard to delegate and would not routinely supply all decrypts; commanders at sea were supplied only with what the Admiralty thought they needed. Information could reach the Grand Fleet late, incomplete or mistakenly interpreted. When Jellicoe asked for a decryption section to take to sea, he was refused on security grounds.

===German raid===
With the German High Seas Fleet (HSF) confined to port after the British success at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the Commander-in-Chief of the HSF planned a raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on the east coast of England, with the I Scouting Group (Admiral Franz von Hipper), a battlecruiser squadron of three battlecruisers and a large armoured cruiser, supported by light cruisers and destroyers. Hipper opened fire at 08:00 on 16 December 1914, eventually killing wounding British public and political opinion was outraged that German warships could sail so close to the British coast, shelling coastal towns with impunity; British naval forces had failed to prevent the attacks and also failed to intercept the raiding squadron. The British fleet had sailed but the German ships escaped in stormy seas and low visibility, assisted by British communication failures. The Germans had made the first successful attack on Britain since the 17th century and suffered no losses but Ingenohl was unjustly blamed for missing an opportunity to inflict a defeat on the Royal Navy, despite creating the chance by his offensive-mindedness.

===British counter-action===
The British had let the raid occur and appeared to the public to have been surprised (having been forewarned by decoded wireless messages) and then to have failed to sink the German raiding force on its way back to Germany. In 1921, the official historian Julian Corbett wrote,

The British had escaped a potential disaster, because the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty) was unsupported by the 2nd Battle Squadron (Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender), when it failed to make contact with the raiding force. The worst British failure was in the exploitation of the intelligence provided by the code breakers at Room 40 (Sir Alfred Ewing), that had given the British notice of the raid. Some intercepts decoded during the action had taken two hours to reach British commanders at sea, by when they were out of date or misleading. News of the sailing of the HSF was delivered so late that the British commanders thought that the Germans were on the way, when they were returning. At sea, Beatty had sent ambiguous signals and some commanders had not used their initiative. On the commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, gave orders that when in contact with German ships, officers were to treat orders from those ignorant of local conditions as instructions only, but he and Beatty declined to implement Admiralty suggestions to loosen ship formations, for fear of decentralising tactical command too far.

==Plan==
===German plan===
Hipper suspected that the British had received advanced warning about earlier operations of the HSF from spy ships mingling with British and Dutch fishing boats, operating near the German Bight and the Dogger Bank, to observe German fleet movements. Hipper considered that with the Dogger Bank mid-way on the short route to the English coast, a signal from a trawler could reach the British in time for the British battlecruisers to intercept a German sortie, certainly on the return journey. Hipper ordered German ships vigorously to enforce search and seizure rules, fishing boats being brought into Cuxhaven to be searched. Buoyed by the success of the raid on the English coast, Admiral Hipper planned an attack on the British fishing fleet on the Dogger Bank. The German fleet had increased in size since the outbreak of war, with the arrival in service of the dreadnought battleships , , and of the 3rd Battle Squadron and the .

Hipper intended to clear the bank of British fishing vessels and dubious neutrals and to attack any small British warships in the area, with the HSF covering the withdrawal of the battlecruisers. The limited nature of the operation conformed to the ban by the Kaiser on operations by the High Seas Fleet, that had been reiterated on 10 January. A slightly more aggressive strategy was permitted, within the policy of keeping the HSF in being, in which the fleet could sortie to attempt to isolate and destroy advanced British forces or to attack the Grand Fleet if in greater strength. On 19 January, Beatty had reconnoitred the area west of the German Bight and been seen by a German aircraft. The reconnaissance and British activity at the Dogger Bank led Ingenohl to order Hipper and the I Scouting Group to survey the area and surprise and destroy any light forces found there. The I Scouting Group contained the battlecruisers &quot;Seydlitz&quot; (flagship), &quot;Moltke&quot;, &quot;Derfflinger&quot; and armoured cruiser &quot;Blucher&quot;, four light cruisers and eighteen destroyers.

===British plan===

Wireless transmissions from German ships in the Jade Bight on 23 January 1915, intercepted and decoded by Room 40, alerted the British to a German sortie in force as far as the Dogger Bank. At the Admiralty, Wilson, Oliver and Churchill arranged a plan to confront the Germans with a superior opponent. A rendezvous was set for 24 January at 07:00, north of the Dogger Bank and about west of Heligoland. The battlecruisers comprised the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (Beatty) with &quot;Lion&quot; (flagship), &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot;. The new 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (Rear-Admiral Gordon Moore deputy to Beatty) had &quot;New Zealand&quot; as flagship and &quot;Indomitable&quot;. Harwich Force (Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt) sailed from Harwich with three light cruisers and to rendezvous with the battlecruisers at 07:00 on 24 January.

To cover the East Coast and act as distant support, the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the seven pre-dreadnoughts of the 3rd Battle Squadron (Admiral Edward Eden Bradford) sailed from Rosyth for an area in the North Sea, from which they could cut off the German force if it moved north. The Grand Fleet left Scapa at 21:00 on 23 January, to sweep the southern North Sea but could not be expected to arrive on the scene until the afternoon of 24 January. Soon after the German force sailed, the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron (Commodore William Goodenough) and the battlecruisers departed Rosyth, heading south; at 07:05 on 24 January, a clear day with good visibility, they encountered German screening vessels at the Dogger Bank.

==Battle==

===24 January===

Sighting the smoke from a large approaching force, Hipper headed south-east by 07:35 to escape but the battlecruisers were faster than the German squadron, which was held back by the slower armoured cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot; and the coal-fuelled torpedo boats. By 08:00, the German battlecruisers had been sighted from &quot;Lion&quot; but the older battlecruisers of the British 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron were lagging behind the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. Chasing the Germans from a position astern and to starboard, the British ships gradually caught up—some reaching a speed of —and closed to gun range. Beatty chose to approach from this direction so that the prevailing wind blew the British ships&#x27; smoke clear, allowing them a good view of the German ships, while German gunners were partially blinded by their funnel and gun smoke blowing towards the British ships. &quot;Lion&quot; opened fire at 08:52, at a range of and the other British ships commenced firing as they came within range, while the Germans were unable to reply until 09:11, because of the shorter range of their guns. No warships had engaged at such long ranges or at such high speeds before, and accurate gunnery for both sides was an unprecedented challenge but after a few salvos, British shells straddled &quot;Blücher&quot;.

The British fire was concentrated on the battlecruiser &quot;Seydlitz&quot; at the head of the line and &quot;Blücher&quot; at the rear. With five British ships against four German, Beatty intended that his two rear ships, &quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot;, should engage &quot;Blücher&quot;, while his leading three engaged their opposite numbers. Captain Henry Pelly of the new battlecruiser &quot;Tiger&quot; assumed that two ships should concentrate on the leading German ship and engaged &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, leaving &quot;Moltke&quot; free to fire at &quot;Lion&quot;. &quot;Tiger&quot;″s fire was ineffective, as she mistook the shell splashes from &quot;Lion&quot; for her own, when the fall of shot was beyond &quot;Seydlitz&quot;. At 09:43, &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was hit by a shell from &quot;Lion&quot;, which penetrated her after turret barbette and caused an ammunition fire in the working chamber. This fire spread rapidly through other compartments, igniting ready propellant charges all the way to the magazines and knocked out both rear turrets with the loss of 165 men. Only the prompt action of the executive officer, Wilhelm Heidkamp, in flooding the magazines saved &quot;Seydlitz&quot; from a magazine explosion that would have destroyed the ship.
The British ships were relatively unscathed until 10:18, when &quot;Derfflinger&quot; hit &quot;Lion&quot; with several shells, damaging her engines and causing flooding; &quot;Lion&quot; lost speed and began to fall behind. At 10:41, &quot;Lion&quot; narrowly escaped a disaster similar to that on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, when a German shell hit the forward turret and ignited a small ammunition fire but it was extinguished before causing a magazine explosion. A few minutes later, taking on water and listing to port, &quot;Lion&quot; had to stop her port engine and reduce speed to and was soon out of action, having been hit 14 times. At 10:30, &quot;Blücher&quot; was hit by a shell from &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, which caused an ammunition fire and boiler room damage. &quot;Blücher&quot; had to reduce speed to and lagged behind the rest of the German force. Beatty ordered &quot;Indomitable&quot;—his slowest ship—to intercept &quot;Blücher&quot;.
With his ships running short of ammunition, Hipper chose to steam for home, leaving the disabled &quot;Blücher&quot; behind, to save his remaining ships. The annihilation of the German squadron appeared likely to the British until 10:54, when Beatty—believing he saw a submarine periscope on &quot;Lion&quot;s starboard bow—ordered a 90° turn to port, to avoid a submarine ambush (The &quot;periscope&quot; may have been a surfacing, run-out torpedo which had been launched 15 minutes earlier by the German destroyer &quot;V5&quot;). At 11:02, realising that so sharp a turn would open the range too much, Beatty ordered &quot;Course NE&quot; to limit the turn to 45° and then added &quot;Engage the enemy&#x27;s rear&quot;, to clarify his intent that the other ships, which had now left &quot;Lion&quot; far behind, should pursue the main German force. With &quot;Lion&quot;s electric generators out of action, Beatty could only signal using flag hoists and both signals were flown at the same time.

The combination of the signal &quot;Course NE&quot;—which happened to be the direction of &quot;Blücher&quot;—and the signal to engage the rear was misunderstood by Beatty&#x27;s second-in-command, Rear-Admiral Moore on &quot;New Zealand&quot;, as an order for all the battlecruisers to finish off &quot;Blücher&quot;. The British battlecruisers broke off the pursuit of the German squadron and attacked &quot;Blücher&quot;, with most of the British light cruisers and destroyers joining in. Beatty tried to correct this obvious misunderstanding by using the order from Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar &quot;Engage the enemy more closely&quot; but this order was not in the signal book and Beatty chose &quot;Keep nearer to the enemy&quot; as the closest equivalent. By the time this signal was hoisted, Moore&#x27;s ships were too far away to read Beatty&#x27;s flags and the correction was not received.
Despite the overwhelming odds, &quot;Blücher&quot; put the British destroyer out of action and scored two hits on the British battlecruisers with her guns. &quot;Blücher&quot; was hit by about and wrecked. When struck by two torpedoes from the light cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot;, &quot;Blücher&quot; capsized at 54 25&#x27; N. Lat., 5 25&#x27; E. Long and sank at 13:13, with the loss of British ships began to rescue survivors, but they were hindered by the arrival of the Zeppelin L-5 (LZ-28) and a German seaplane which attacked with small bombs. No damage was done but the British ships put on speed and withdrew to avoid further aerial attack, leaving some of the survivors behind. By this time, the rest of the German ships were too far away for the British to catch up.

&quot;Lion&quot; made at the beginning of the return voyage, escorted by &quot;Indomitable&quot;. Beatty contemplated leaving a flotilla of destroyers to guard &quot;Lion&quot; and sending the rest to the German Bight, to make a night attack on the German ships, but the damage to &quot;Lion&quot; caused more problems. As she crept home, the ship suffered further engine-trouble from saltwater contamination in the boiler-feed-water system and her speed dropped to . &quot;Lion&quot; was taken in tow by &quot;Indomitable&quot;, an operation which took two hours, in which the battlecruisers were exceedingly vulnerable to submarine attacks. At 17:00, the voyage resumed, the ships eventually managing and when the Grand Fleet arrived, Jellicoe increased the screen to thirteen light cruisers and 67 destroyers. A message from the Admiralty arrived that the Germans were planning a night destroyer attack but that the destroyers with the two scouting groups were low on fuel and those with the HSF were too far away.

===25 January===
&quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; slowed to overnight when &quot;Lion&quot; had more engine-trouble and at dawn were still short of the Firth of Forth. The destroyers reformed into an anti-submarine screen and the ships reached the firth at midnight; the destroyer &quot;Meteor&quot; was towed into the Humber Estuary. &quot;Lion&quot; was out of action for four months, Fisher having decreed that the damage be repaired at Armstrong&#x27;s on the Tyne, without her going into dry dock, making for an extremely difficult and time-consuming job. The surviving German ships reached port; &quot;Derfflinger&quot; was repaired by 17 February but &quot;Seydlitz&quot; needed a drydock and was not ready for sea until 1 April.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
At first the Germans thought that &quot;Tiger&quot; had been sunk, because of a large fire that had been seen on her decks, but it was soon clear that the battle was a serious German reverse. Kaiser Wilhelm II issued an order that all risks to surface vessels were to be avoided. Ingenohl was sacked and replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl. The damage to &quot;Seydlitz&quot; revealed flaws in the protection of her magazines and dangerous ammunition-handling procedures. Some of these failings were remedied in the HSF before the Battle of Jutland . The Germans thought that the appearance of the British squadron at dawn was too remarkable to be a coincidence and concluded that a spy near their base in Jade Bay was responsible, not that the British were reading their encrypted wireless communications. (In 1920, Scheer wrote that the number of British ships present suggested that they had known about the operation in advance, but that this was put down to circumstances, although &quot;other reasons&quot; could not be excluded.)

Beatty had lost control of the battle and he judged that the opportunity of an overwhelming victory had been lost. The Admiralty—erroneously believing that &quot;Derfflinger&quot; had been badly damaged—later reached the same conclusion. Jutland later showed that the British battlecruisers were still vulnerable to ammunition fires and magazine explosions, if hit by plunging fire. Had Moore&#x27;s three fast battlecruisers pursued Hipper&#x27;s remaining three (leaving the slower &quot;Indomitable&quot; behind as Beatty intended), the British might have been at a disadvantage and been defeated. &quot;Blücher&quot; demonstrated the ability of the German ships to absorb great punishment; all of Hipper&#x27;s remaining ships were larger, faster, newer, more heavily armed, and far better armoured than &quot;Blücher&quot;; only &quot;Seydlitz&quot; had suffered serious damage. Apart from the sinking of &quot;Blücher&quot;, the Germans out-hit the British by over three to one, with 22 heavy-calibre hits—16 on &quot;Lion&quot; and six on &quot;Tiger&quot;—against seven British hits.

The battle, although inconclusive, boosted British morale. Rear-Admiral Moore was quietly replaced and sent to the Canary Islands and Captain Henry Pelly of &quot;Tiger&quot; was blamed for not taking over when &quot;Lion&quot; was damaged. Ralph Seymour remained Beatty&#x27;s flag lieutenant, although he was responsible for hoisting Beatty&#x27;s two commands on one flag hoist, allowing them to be read as one. The use of wireless allowed centralised control of ships from the Admiralty, which cramped the initiative of the men on the spot. Signals between ships continued to be by flag but there was no revision of the signal book or the assumptions of its authors. Signalling aboard &quot;Lion&quot; was again poor in the first hours of Jutland, with serious consequences for the British. The battlecruisers failed to improve fire distribution and similar targeting errors were made at Jutland.

===Casualties===

In 1929, Julian Corbett, the official naval historian, recorded killed and out of the on &quot;Blücher&quot;, the men being rescued by the British. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; lost killed and and &quot;Kolberg&quot; lost three men killed and two wounded. In 1965, Marder wrote that over sailors had been killed or captured, for British casualties of fewer than killed or wounded. In 2003, Massie wrote that German casualties were an estimated killed and most in &quot;Blücher&quot;; were killed and wounded in the fire in the two after turrets of &quot;Seydlitz&quot;. The British rescued prisoners and from &quot;Blücher&quot;. British casualties were and wounded. On &quot;Lion&quot;, two men had been killed and eleven wounded, most by a shell hit in the A turret lobby. Ten men were killed on &quot;Tiger&quot; with nine men wounded and on &quot;Meteor&quot;, four men were killed and two were wounded.

<doc id="193243" wikidata="Q223269" url="?curid=193243" title="Shorts">
<text>Shorts are a garment worn over the pelvic area, circling the waist and splitting to cover the upper part of the legs, sometimes extending down to the knees but not covering the entire length of the leg. They are called &quot;shorts&quot; because they are a shortened version of trousers, which cover the entire leg, but not the foot. Shorts are typically worn in warm weather or in an environment where comfort and airflow are more important than the protection of the legs.
There are a variety of shorts, ranging from knee-length short trousers that can in some situations be worn as formal clothes to beachwear and athletic shorts. Some types of shorts are typically worn by women, such as culottes, which are a divided skirt resembling a pair of loose-cut shorts.

==Terminological differences==

The British English term, &quot;short trousers&quot;, is used, only for shorts that are a short version of ordinary trousers (i.e., &quot;pants&quot; or &quot;slacks&quot; in American English). For example: tailored shorts, often lined, as typically worn as part of a school uniform for boys up to their early teens, and by servicemen and policemen in tropical climates. &quot;Shorts&quot;, used unqualified in British English, refers to sports shorts, athletic shorts, or casual shorts; the last nowadays commonplace in warm weather in the UK. Shorts are also known as &quot;half pants&quot; in India.

The dated American English term, &quot;&quot;, is probably the nearest equivalent in the US, where they might now be called &quot;dress shorts&quot;, a term that has not gained much currency in Britain.

A somewhat similar garment worn by men in Australia is called &quot;stubbies&quot;.

The term &quot;boxer shorts&quot; is an American coinage for a particular kind of men&#x27;s underwear, and is now also common in Britain. However, boxer shorts are often referred to merely as &quot;boxers&quot; in the US. Moreover, whereas the American English usage of the word &quot;pants&quot; refers to outerwear (i.e., &quot;trousers&quot; in British English), the usage of &quot;pants&quot; in British English refers to the garment worn under one&#x27;s trousers (such as boxers). Such a garment, however, is referred to as &quot;underpants&quot; in American English (note the qualification of the word &quot;pants&quot; by the word &quot;under&quot;). Alongside the term
&quot;boxer shorts&quot;, &quot;&quot; or simply &quot;&quot; were synonyms for underpants during the time of this coinage; while &quot;&quot; was a synonym for men&#x27;s briefs.

== Sociology ==
=== Europe and America ===
In much of Europe and the Americas during the 19th and early 20th centuries, shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys until they reached a certain height or maturity. When boys got older, typically around puberty, they would receive their first pair of long trousers. This produced the perception that shorts were only for young boys. Because of this, men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature, even when the weather was hot. Women tended not to wear shorts in most cultures, due to social mores: they were expected to wear dresses, or skirts and blouses.

In the 1890s, knee pants (an early type of short pants) became the standard wear for American boys. Many urban school portraits from the 1890s show all but the oldest boys wearing knee pants. North American boys normally wore knee pants with short stockings. This began to change after the 1900s when North American boys began wearing knickerbockers during the winter, while short pants became more popular in Europe. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men and women. However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside of certain activities.

Since about the time of World War II, when many soldiers served in tropical locations, adult men have worn shorts more often, especially in summer weather, but the perception of shorts as being only for young boys took several decades to change, and to some extent still exists in certain circles. Shorts would soon become more popular by the late 1960s as a result of the countercultural movement that defined the decade, and men and women started wearing jean shorts and other variants as the 1970s dawned. It would become more common for men to wear shorts as casual wear in summer, but much less so in cooler seasons.

=== Asia ===

Shorts are not traditional clothing in some Asian countries. International trade and fashion trends have helped bring shorts to the East. They were first treated as taboo in countries like China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam because they conflicted with old traditions that women have to cover their body private parts and worries about sexual harassment.

As time goes by, shorts are slowly accepted by people, especially young people.

Now in Asia, wearing shorts is considered young, active, and energetic. They are a symbol of freedom from old rules and have helped promote gender equality.

=== Worldwide ===
Adults are also commonly seen wearing shorts, but wearing shorts is less common among women in traditional eastern countries than in the West although that varies widely by region. Women more often wear shorts in large cosmopolitan cities. In some countries, adult women can be seen wearing loose-fitting shorts that end at or just below the knee, as these are seen as sufficiently modest.

In many countries, there are still many settings in which wearing shorts would not be acceptable, as they are considered too casual. Notable exceptions in which men may wear short trousers to the office or at formal gatherings are South Africa, Bermuda, Australia and New Zealand . Since the 1990s, casual office dress has grown to include formal shorts in some British and American businesses but by no means universally.

<doc id="193248" wikidata="Q1445169" url="?curid=193248" title="Conspiracy (King Diamond album)">
<text>Conspiracy is the fourth studio album by Danish heavy metal band King Diamond, and the second part of a story that began on the album &quot;Them&quot;. &quot;Conspiracy&quot; was released on 21 August 1989 through Roadrunner Records, and is the last album to feature drummer Mikkey Dee who left the group but recorded the album as a session member.

The song &quot;Cremation&quot; appears in the 2009 video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

==Plot==
After the events of &quot;&quot;Them&quot;&quot;, an adult King returns to the House of Amon to reclaim his rightful place as heir to the house (&quot;At the Graves&quot;). He makes a deal with &quot;Them&quot;, the unseen demonic antagonists from the previous album, to return control of the house to &quot;Them&quot; in exchange for the chance to see his now-dead sister Missy again, as he believes she can help answer some of his questions (&quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;). He attends sessions with a therapist named Dr. Landau, who he despises, distrusts and lies to; Landau suggests letting King&#x27;s mother visit the House of Amon, and King reluctantly agrees (&quot;Lies&quot;). That night, Missy appears to him in a vision (&quot;A Visit from the Dead&quot;) and warns him through a dream where he sees Landau marrying his mother (&quot;The Wedding Dream&quot;). The next day, King&#x27;s mother indeed arrives accompanied by Dr. Landau; despite King&#x27;s protestations about the deal with &quot;Them&quot;, they enter the house, and King is ambushed and sedated by his mother and the doctor (&quot;Amon Belongs to &#x27;Them&#x27;&quot;). They then go to the local demented priest Sammael, and convince him that King is possessed by Satan and must be disposed of (&quot;Victimized&quot;); they put King in a coffin and burn him (&quot;Let It Be Done&quot;), and the album closes with King&#x27;s promise to haunt them forever from beyond the grave (&quot;Cremation&quot;).

<text>Live It Up! is a Canadian lifestyle, entertainment and consumer awareness television program that aired nationally on CTV from 1978 to 1990. Reruns of the show aired on talktv until January 2005.

The program&#x27;s hosts included Jack McGaw, Alan Edmonds, Mary Lou Finlay, Liz Grogan, Dianne Buckner and Sharon Seto. &quot;Live It Up!&quot; featured a mix of serious consumer-affairs topics and lighter consumer topics, mostly delivered in a tongue-in-cheek style. Regular segments included the Watchdog (played by Ron Carlyle, a man whose face is never shown while testing different brands of a product), &quot;What bugs you?&quot; (concerned consumers talk about problems with household products, and those involved in those products explain why those problems occur and/or mentions how they are improving them; segments began and end with a person (Miss Judy) in a bug costume flying around, saying &quot;What bugs you?&quot; in a high-pitched voice), &quot;The Legal Beagle&quot; with lawyer, Jonathan Rudin explaining unusual Canadian laws in humorous sketches performed by the Live It Up Players (notably Tracie Tighe and Art Szoczi) and &quot;The Great Canadian Joke-Off&quot; (a nationwide search to find the funniest joke in Canada, with each segment ending with an annoyed monkey). Segments were mainly filmed at first, but moved permanently to videotape in 1987.

<text>Living It Up! with Ali &amp; Jack is a syndicated daytime television talk show that aired from September 2003 to April 2004, hosted by Alexandra &quot;Ali&quot; Wentworth and Jack Ford, based out of New York City.

The show was conceived as a competitor to WABC/Disney-ABC Domestic Television&#x27;s &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, which has dominated mid-morning television since its national premiere in 1988. &quot;Ali &amp; Jack&quot; was produced by King World (now CBS Television Distribution), and the syndicator tried to copy &quot;Regis and Kelly&quot;&#x27;s plan of airing on almost all of WABC&#x27;s fellow ABC owned and operated stations, and strong local stations in other markets. Viacom (King World&#x27;s parent at the time) cleared &quot;Ali &amp; Jack&quot; on their CBS and UPN O&amp;O&#x27;s, and in New York took &quot;Regis and Kelly&quot; head-on at 9 AM on WCBS.

&quot;Ali &amp; Jack&quot; started at its debut airing in at least 60% of the U.S. However, the show failed to pick up any steam in the ratings, receiving critical drubbing from the start because of what critics noted were too many similarities to &quot;Regis and Kelly&quot;, and what they saw as an apparent lack of chemistry between Ford and Wentworth. Some stations would move the show to late at night to stem their losses (out of the intended mid-morning berth), and others would drop the show altogether even before cancellation or send it to air on weaker sister stations. In other markets the show never aired at all. The show also struggled with backstage strife and being unable to book strong guests, who were usually snapped up by the network morning shows, &quot;Regis and Kelly&quot;, and &quot;The View&quot;.

&quot;Ali &amp; Jack&quot; ended up being the lowest-rated new series in all of syndication for the 2003-04 TV season, and the show was cancelled by April 2004, through reruns continued until August 2004.

<text>Heligoland (; , ; Heligolandic Frisian: , , Mooring Frisian: , ) is a small archipelago in the North Sea. The islands were historically possessions of Denmark, then became possessions of the United Kingdom from 1807 to 1890. Since 1890, they have been part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, although they were managed by the United Kingdom as a war prize from 1945 to 1952.

The islands are located in the Heligoland Bight (part of the German Bight) in the southeastern corner of the North Sea and had a population of 1,127 at the end of 2016. They are the only German islands not in the vicinity of the mainland. They lie approximately by sea from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe. During a visit to the islands, August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics to the &quot;&quot;, which became the national anthem of Germany.

In addition to German, the local population, who are ethnic Frisians, speak the Heligolandic dialect of the North Frisian language called .

==Name==
The island had no distinct name before the 19th century. It was often referred to by variants of the High German &quot;Heiligland&quot; (&#x27;holy land&#x27;) and once even as the island of the Holy Virgin Ursula. Theodor Siebs summarized the critical discussion of the name in the 19th century in 1909 with the thesis that, based on the Frisian self-designation of the Heligolanders as &quot;Halunder&quot;, the island name meant &#x27;high land&#x27; (similar to Hallig). In the following discussion by Jürgen Spanuth, Wolfgang Laur again proposed the original name of &quot;Heiligland&quot;. The variant &quot;Helgoland&quot;, which has appeared since the 16th century, is said to have been created by scholars who Latinized a North Frisian form &quot;Helgeland&quot;, using it to refer to a legendary hero, Helgi. The discussion is complicated by a disagreement as to which of the listed names really refers to the island of Helgoland, and by a desire for the island still to be seen as holy today.

==Geography==
Heligoland is located off the German coastline and consists of two islands: the populated triangular main island () to the west, and the (&#x27;dune&#x27;, Heligolandic: ) to the east. &quot;Heligoland&quot; generally refers to the former island. is somewhat smaller at , lower, and surrounded by sand beaches. It is not permanently inhabited, but is today the location of Heligoland&#x27;s airfield.

The main island is commonly divided into the (&#x27;Lower Land&#x27;, Heligolandic: ) at sea level (to the right on the photograph, where the harbour is located), the (&#x27;Upper Land&#x27;, Heligolandic: ) consisting of the plateau visible in the photographs, and the (&#x27;Middle Land&#x27;) between them on one side of the island. The came into being in 1947 as a result of explosions detonated by the British Royal Navy (the so-called &quot;Big Bang&quot;; see below).

The main island also features small beaches in the north and the south and drops to the sea high in the north, west and southwest. In the latter, the ground continues to drop underwater to a depth of below sea level. Heligoland&#x27;s most famous landmark is the (&#x27;Long Anna&#x27; or &#x27;Tall Anna&#x27;), a free-standing rock column (or stack), high, found northwest of the island proper.

The two islands were connected until 1720 when the natural connection was destroyed by a storm flood. The highest point is on the main island, reaching above sea level.

Although culturally and geographically closer to North Frisia in the German district of , the two islands are part of the district of Pinneberg in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. The main island has a good harbour and is frequented mostly by sailing yachts.
==History==


The German Bight and the area around the island are known to have been inhabited since prehistoric times. Flint tools have been recovered from the bottom of the sea surrounding Heligoland. On the &quot;Oberland&quot;, prehistoric burial mounds were visible until the late 19th century, and excavations showed skeletons and artefacts. Moreover, prehistoric copper plates have been found under water near the island; those plates were almost certainly made on the &quot;Oberland&quot;.

In 697, Radbod, the last Frisian king, retreated to the then-single island after his defeat by the Franks – or so it is written in the &quot;Life of Willebrord&quot; by Alcuin. By 1231, the island was listed as the property of the Danish king Valdemar II. Archaeological findings from the 12th to 14th centuries suggest that copper ore was processed on the island.

There is a general understanding that the name &quot;Heligoland&quot; means &quot;Holy Land&quot; (compare modern Dutch and German &quot;&quot;, &quot;holy&quot;). In the course of the centuries several alternative theories have been proposed to explain the name, from a Danish king Heligo to a Frisian word, &quot;hallig&quot;, meaning &quot;salt marsh island&quot;. The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; suggests &quot;Hallaglun&quot;, or &quot;Halligland&quot;, i.e. &quot;land of banks, which cover and uncover&quot;.

Traditional economic activities included fishing, hunting birds and seals, wrecking and – very important for many overseas powers – piloting overseas ships into the harbours of Hanseatic League cities such as Bremen and Hamburg. In some periods Heligoland was an excellent base point for huge herring catches. Until 1714 ownership switched several times between Denmark–Norway and the Duchy of Schleswig, with one period of control by Hamburg. In August 1714, it was conquered by Denmark–Norway, and it remained Danish until 1807.

===19th century===
On 11 September 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, brought to the Admiralty the despatches from Admiral Thomas MacNamara Russell announcing Heligoland&#x27;s capitulation to the British. Heligoland became a centre of resistance and intrigue against Napoleon. Denmark then ceded Heligoland to George III of the United Kingdom by the Treaty of Kiel (14 January 1814). Thousands of Germans came to Britain and joined the King&#x27;s German Legion via Heligoland.

The British annexation of Heligoland was ratified by the Treaty of Paris signed on 30 May 1814, as part of a number of territorial reallocations following the abdication of Napoleon as Emperor of the French.

The prime reason at the time for Britain&#x27;s retention of a small and seemingly worthless acquisition was to restrict any future French naval aggression against the Scandinavian or German states. In the event, no effort was made during the period of British administration to make use of the islands for military purposes, partly for financial reasons but principally because the Royal Navy considered Heligoland to be too exposed as a forward base.

In 1826, Heligoland became a seaside spa and soon turned into a popular tourist resort for the European upper class. The island attracted artists and writers, especially from Germany and Austria who apparently enjoyed the comparatively liberal atmosphere, including Heinrich Heine and August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben. More vitally it was a refuge for revolutionaries of the 1830s and the 1848 German revolution.

As related in &quot;The Leisure Hour&quot;, it was &quot;a land where there are no bankers, no lawyers, and no crime; where all gratuities are strictly forbidden, the landladies are all honest and the boatmen take no tips&quot;, while &quot;The English Illustrated Magazine&quot; provided a description in the most glowing terms: &quot;No one should go there who cannot be content with the charms of brilliant light, of ever-changing atmospheric effects, of a land free from the countless discomforts of a large and busy population, and of an air that tastes like draughts of life itself.&quot;

Britain ceded the islands to Germany in 1890 in the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty. The newly unified Germany was concerned about a foreign power controlling land from which it could command the western entrance to the militarily-important Kiel Canal, then under construction along with other naval installations in the area and thus traded for it. A &quot;grandfathering&quot;/ approach prevented the inhabitants of the islands from forfeiting advantages because of this imposed change of status.

Heligoland has an important place in the history of the study of ornithology, and especially the understanding of bird migration. The book &quot;Heligoland, an Ornithological Observatory&quot; by Heinrich Gätke, published in German in 1890 and in English in 1895, described an astonishing array of migrant birds on the island and was a major influence on future studies of bird migration.

In 1892, the Biological Station of Helgoland was founded by phycologist Paul Kuckuck, a student of Johannes Reinke (leading marine phycologist).

===20th century===
Under the German Empire, the islands became a major naval base, and during the First World War the civilian population was evacuated to the mainland. The island was fortified with concrete gun emplacements along its cliffs similar to the Rock of Gibraltar. Island defences included 364 mounted guns including 142 disappearing guns overlooking shipping channels defended with ten rows of naval mines. The first naval engagement of the war, the Battle of Heligoland Bight, was fought nearby in the first month of the war. The islanders returned in 1918, but during the Nazi era the naval base was reactivated.

Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) first formulated the equation underlying his theory of quantum mechanics while on Heligoland in the 1920s. While a student of Arnold Sommerfeld at Munich, Heisenberg first met the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1922 at the Bohr Festival, Gottingen. He and Bohr went for long hikes in the mountains and discussed the failure of existing theories to account for the new experimental results on the quantum structure of matter. Following these discussions, Heisenberg plunged into several months of intensive theoretical research but met with continual frustration. Finally, suffering from a severe attack of hay fever that his aspirin and cocaine treatment was failing to alleviate, he retreated to the treeless (and pollenless) island of Heligoland in the summer of 1925. There he conceived the basis of the quantum theory.

In 1937, construction began on a major reclamation project () intended to expand existing naval facilities and restore the island to its pre-1629 dimensions, restoring large areas which had been eroded by the sea. The project was largely abandoned after the start of World War II and was never completed.

====World War II====
The area was the setting of the aerial Battle of the Heligoland Bight in 1939, a result of Royal Air Force bombing raids on Kriegsmarine warships in the area. The waters surrounding the island were frequently mined by Allied aircraft.

Heligoland also had a military function as a sea fortress in the Second World War. Completed and ready for use were the submarine bunker North Sea III, coastal artillery, an air-raid shelter system with extensive bunker tunnels, and an airfield used by air force – (April to October 1943). Forced labour of, among others, citizens of the Soviet Union was used in the construction of these military installations.

On 3 December 1939, Heligoland was directly bombed by the Allies for the first time. The attack, by twenty four Wellington bombers of 38, 115, and 149 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, failed to destroy the German warships at anchor.

In three days in 1940, the Royal Navy lost three submarines near Heligoland: on 6 January, on 7 January and on 9 January.

Early in the war, the island was generally unaffected by bombing raids. Through the development of the Luftwaffe, the island had largely lost its strategic importance. The , temporarily used for defense against Allied bombing raids, was equipped with a rare variant of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter originally designed for use on aircraft carriers.

Not long before the war ended in 1945, Georg Braun and Erich Friedrichs succeeded in forming a resistance group on the island. Shortly before they were to execute their plans, however, they were betrayed by two members of the group. About twenty men were arrested on 18 April 1945; fourteen of them were transported to Cuxhaven. After a short trial, five resisters were executed by firing squad at Cuxhaven-Sahlenburg on 21 April 1945 by the German authorities.

To honour them, in April 2010 the Helgoland Museum installed six stumbling blocks on the roads of Heligoland. Their names are Erich P. J. Friedrichs, Georg E. Braun, Karl Fnouka, Kurt A. Pester, Martin O. Wachtel, and Heinrich Prüß.

With two waves of bombing raids on 18 and 19 April 1945, 1,000 Allied aircraft dropped about 7,000 bombs on the islands. The populace took shelter in air raid shelters. The German military suffered heavy casualties during the raids. The bomb attacks rendered the island unsafe, and it was totally evacuated.

====Explosion====

From 1945 to 1952 the uninhabited islands fell within the British Occupation zone. On 18 April 1947, the Royal Navy simultaneously detonated 6,700 metric tons of explosives (&quot;Operation Big Bang&quot; or &quot;British Bang&quot;), successfully destroying the island&#x27;s principal military installations (namely, the submarine pens, the coastal batteries at the north and south ends of the island and of main storage tunnels) while leaving the town, already damaged by Allied bombing during the Second World War, &quot;looking little worse&quot; (according to an observer quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper). The destruction of the submarine pens resulted in the creation of the Mittelland crater. The British later used the island, from which the population had been evacuated, as a bombing range. The explosion was one of the biggest single non-nuclear detonations in history.

====Return of sovereignty to Germany====
On 20 December 1950, two students from HeidelbergRené Leudesdorff and Georg von Hatzfeld, accompanied by journalistsspent two days and a night on the island, planting in various combinations the flags of West Germany, the European Movement International and Heligoland. They returned with others on 27 December and on 29 December were joined by Heidelberg history professor and publicist Hubertus zu Löwenstein. The occupation was ended by British authorities, with cooperation of West German police, on 3 January 1951. The event started a movement to restore the islands to Germany, which gained the support of the West German parliament. On 1 March 1952, Heligoland was placed under West German control and the former inhabitants were allowed to return. The first of March is an official holiday on the island. The government of West Germany cleared a significant quantity of unexploded ordnance and rebuilt the houses before allowing its citizens to resettle there.

===21st century===

Heligoland, like the small exclave Büsingen am Hochrhein, is now a holiday resort and enjoys a tax-exempt status, being part of Germany and the EU but excluded from the EU VAT area and customs union. Consequently, much of the economy is founded on sales of cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and perfume to tourists who visit the islands. The ornithological heritage of Heligoland has also been re-established, with the Heligoland Bird Observatory, now managed by the (&quot;Ornithological Society of Heligoland&quot;) which was founded in 1991. A search and rescue (SAR) base of the DGzRS, the (German Maritime Search and Rescue Service), is located on Heligoland.

====Energy supply====
Before the island was connected to the mainland network by a submarine cable in 2009, electricity on Heligoland was generated by a local diesel plant.

Heligoland was the site of a trial of GROWIAN, a large wind-turbine testing project. In 1990, a 1.2 MW turbine of the MAN type WKA 60 was installed. Besides technical problems, the turbine was not lightning-proof and insurance companies would not provide coverage. The wind energy project was viewed as a failure by the islanders and was stopped.
The Heligoland Power Cable has a length of and is one of the longest AC submarine power cables in the world and the longest of its kind in Germany. It was manufactured by the North German Seacable Works in a single piece and was laid by the barge &quot;Nostag 10&quot; in 2009. The cable is designed for an operational voltage of 30 kV, and reaches the German mainland at Sankt Peter-Ording.

====Expansion plans and wind industry====
Plans to re-enlarge the land bridge between different parts of the island by means of land reclamation came up between 2008 and 2010. However, the local community voted against the project.

Since 2013, a new industrial site is being expanded on the southern harbour. E.ON, RWE and &quot;WindMW&quot; plan to manage operation and services of large offshore windparks from Heligoland. The range had been cleared of leftover ammunition.

==Demographics==
At the beginning of 2020, 1,399 people lived on Heligoland. As of 2018, the population is mostly Lutheran (63%), while a minority (18%) is Catholic. There is a multi-sport club on the island, VfL Fosite Helgoland, of which an estimated 500 islanders are members.

==Climate==
The climate of Heligoland is typical of an offshore climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dolk&quot;), being almost free of pollen and thus ideal for people with pollen allergies. Since there is no land mass in the vicinity, temperatures rarely drop below even in the winter. At times, winter temperatures can be higher than in Hamburg by up to because cold air from the east is warmed up over the North Sea. While spring tends to be comparatively cool, autumn on Heligoland is often longer and warmer than on the mainland, and statistically, the climate is generally sunnier.

Owing to the mild climate, figs have reportedly been grown on the island as early as 1911, and a 2005 article mentioned Japanese bananas, figs, agaves, palm trees and other exotic plants that had been planted on Heligoland and were thriving. There still is an old mulberry tree in the Upper Town.

The Heligoland weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 25 July 1994.
* Its lowest temperature was on 15 February 1956.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 1998.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1959.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2078 hours in 1959.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1461.3 hours in 1985.

==Geology==
The island of Heligoland is a geological oddity; the presence of the main island&#x27;s characteristic red sedimentary rock in the middle of the German Bight is unusual. It is the only such formation of cliffs along the continental coast of the North Sea. The formation itself, called the Bunter sandstone or Buntsandstein, is from the early Triassic geologic age. It is older than the white chalk that underlies the island Düne, the same rock that forms the White Cliffs of Dover in England and cliffs of Danish and German islands in the Baltic Sea. A small chalk rock close to Heligoland, called &quot;witt Kliff&quot; (white cliff), is known to have existed within sight of the island to the west until the early 18th century, when storm floods finally eroded it to below sea level.

Heligoland&#x27;s rock is significantly harder than the postglacial sediments and sands forming the islands and coastlines to the east of the island. This is why the core of the island, which a thousand years ago was still surrounded by a large low-lying marshland and sand dunes separated from coast in the east only by narrow channels, has remained to this day, although the onset of the North Sea has long eroded away all of its surroundings. A small piece of Heligoland&#x27;s sand dunes remains – the sand isle just across the harbour called Düne (Dune). A referendum in June 2011 dismissed a proposal to reconnect the main island to the Düne islet with a landfill.

==Flag==

The Heligoland flag is very similar to its coat of arms – it is a tricolour flag with three horizontal bars, from top to bottom: green, red and white. Each of the colours has its symbolic meaning, as expressed in its motto:

There is an alternative version in which the word (&quot;sand&quot;) is replaced with (&quot;beach&quot;).

==Road restrictions==

A special section in the German traffic regulations (&quot;Straßenverkehrsordnung&quot;, abbr. &quot;StVO&quot;), §50, prohibits the use of automobiles and bicycles on the island.

The island received its first police car on 17 January 2006; until then the island&#x27;s policemen moved on foot and by bicycle, being exempt from the bicycle ban.

==Emergency services==
Ambulance services are provided by the Paracelsus North Sea Clinic Helgoland in co-operation with the State Rescue Service of Schleswig-Holstein (RKiSH). There are three ambulances available: one on the main island and one on Düne; the third is in reserve on the main island.

The ambulance service drives first to the Paracelsus North Sea Clinic. In the event of serious injuries or illnesses, the patients are transferred to the mainland either with a rescue helicopter or a sea rescue cruiser operated by the German Society for the Rescue of Shipwrecked Persons (DGzRS).

If there is an emergency on the Düne, the ambulance crew takes a boat to the Düne and carries out the operation with the ambulance based there.

Fire protection and technical assistance are provided by the Helgoland volunteer fire brigade, which has three stations (Unterland, Oberland and Düne).The tasks also include ensuring fire protection during flight operations at the Heligoland-Düne airfield. Volunteer firefighters are deployed on Düne in the summer, who report for 14 days and go on holiday with their families on the island and go into action in an emergency.

There are normally five police officers based on Heligoland. They have the use of an electric car and a number of bicycles. In the summer months the population can also triple with up to 3,000 day-trippers and additional overnight visitors. Occasionally, the usual complement of police officers is supplemented by additional officers from the mainland during this period.

Since 2021, the so-called BOS centre, a joint service building for the fire brigade, ambulance service and police, has been under construction on the Oberland, and will incorporate five apartments for police staff on the upper floor.

==In culture==
* Heligoland appeared in the British Shipping Forecast up until 1956 when it was renamed German Bight. The name of Shena Mackay&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Heligoland&quot; is prompted by its disappearance from the forecast.
* Physicist Carlo Rovelli titled his 2020 popular science book on quantum mechanics &quot;Helgoland&quot;. This is because Werner Heisenberg got the first intuition about the theory while staying on the island in the 1920s.
* In the game &quot;Battlefield 1&quot;, Heligoland Bight appeared as a map in the Turning Tides expansion DLC with the German army defending against the British Royal Marines.
*Composer Anton Bruckner wrote a cantata in 1893 titled Helgoland commemorating Britain&#x27;s gift of the island to Germany a few years earlier. It was Bruckner&#x27;s last completed work.
*British trip-hop group Massive Attack named their studio album after the island.

<text>The Penny Black was the world&#x27;s first adhesive postage stamp used in a public postal system. It was first issued in the United Kingdom on 1 May 1840 but was not valid for use until 6 May. The stamp features a profile of Queen Victoria.

In 1837, British postal rates were high, complex and anomalous. To simplify matters, Sir Rowland Hill proposed an adhesive stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage. At the time it was normal for the recipient to pay postage on delivery, charged by the sheet and on distance travelled. By contrast, the Penny Black allowed letters of up to to be delivered at a flat rate of one penny, regardless of distance.

==Treasury competition==


On 13 February 1837, Sir Rowland Hill proposed to a government enquiry both the idea of a pre-paid stamp and a pre-paid envelope, a separate sheet folded to form an enclosure for carrying letters. Hill was given a two-year contract to run the new system, and together with Henry Cole he announced a competition to design the stamps. Out of some 2,600 entries, none was considered suitable, however, so a rough design endorsed by Hill was chosen instead, featuring an easily recognisable profile of Queen Victoria. Hill believed this would be difficult to forge.

==Design==
The portrait of Victoria was engraved by Charles Heath and his son Frederick, based on a sketch provided by Henry Corbould. Corbould&#x27;s sketch was in turn based on the 1834 cameo-like head by William Wyon, which was used on a medal to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s visit to the City of London in 1837. This portrait of Victoria remained on British stamps until her death in 1901. All British stamps still bear a portrait or silhouette of the monarch somewhere on the design. The first stamps did not need to show the issuing country, so no country name was included on them. The UK remains the only country in the world to omit its name on postage stamps; the monarch&#x27;s image signifies the UK as the country of origin.

Initially, Hill specified that the stamps should be 3/4 inch square but altered the dimensions to 3/4 inch wide by 7/8 inch tall (approx 19 x 22 mm) to accommodate the writing at the bottom. The word &quot;POSTAGE&quot; at the top of the design distinguishes it from a revenue stamp which had long been used in the UK; &quot;ONE PENNY.&quot; at the bottom shows the amount pre-paid for postage of the stamped letter. 

The background to the portrait consists of finely engraved engine turnings. The two upper corners hold Maltese crosses with radiant solar discs at their centres; the lower corner letters show the position of the stamp in the printed sheet, from &quot;A A&quot; at top left to &quot;T L&quot; at bottom right. The sheets, printed by Perkins Bacon, consisted of 240 stamps in 20 rows of 12 columns. One full sheet cost 240 pence or one pound; one row of 12 stamps cost a shilling. As the name suggests, the stamp was printed in black ink. A two penny stamp printed in blue and covering the double-letter rate (up to ) was issued on 8 May 1840.

==Issue==
Although the stamps were not officially issued for sale until 6 May 1840, some offices such as those in Bath sold the stamps unofficially before that date. There are covers postmarked 2 May, and a single example is known on cover dated 1 May 1840. All London post offices received official supplies of the new stamps but other offices throughout the United Kingdom did not, continuing to accept payments for postage in cash for a period.

The Penny Black lasted less than a year. A red cancellation was difficult to see on the black design, and the red ink was easy to remove; both made it possible to re-use cancelled stamps. In February 1841, the treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead, which was more effective and difficult to remove. However, people still re-used stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole, so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner check letters in reverse order.

==Imprimatur sheet==
Imprimatur sheets are from among the first sheets of stamps printed from a finished printing plate. The actual &quot;imprimatur&quot; (&#x27;let it be printed&#x27;) refers to the written permission of the Inland Revenue officials entered on the back of the sheet of stamps. In the 19th century, it was common for officials to remove some stamps from each sheet to present as gifts to dignitaries and other important people. Individual stamps from an Imprimatur sheet can thus be found for sale on the open market.

A complete sheet of the Penny Black without check letters is held by the British Postal Museum. This unique item is in fact a plate proof and by definition not an imprimatur sheet.

==Printing==

The Penny Black was printed from 11 plates, but as Plate 1 was completely overhauled after excessive wear, it is generally considered to be two separate plates, 1a and 1b. Plate 11 was originally intended solely for the printing of red stamps, but a small number were printed in black. These are scarce. 

The stamps were printed in imperforate sheets, to be carefully cut with scissors for sale and use. As a result, stamps with badly cut margins or no margins are common and worth very little, while examples with four clear margins are rare and valuable and fetch very high prices, especially if in mint condition.

An original printing press for the Penny Black, the &quot;D&quot; cylinder press invented by Jacob Perkins and patented in 1819, is on display at the British Library in London. The total print run was 286,700 sheets, containing a total of 68,808,000 stamps. Many were saved, and in used condition they remain readily available to stamp collectors. The only known complete sheets of the Penny Black are owned by the British Postal Museum.

==VR official==
In addition to the general issue of the Penny Black, a similar stamp intended for official mail was produced, with the letters &quot;V&quot; and &quot;R&quot; replacing the crosses in the top corners. Because the general public quickly accepted the postage stamps and ridiculed the Mulready stationery produced at the same time, vast supplies of Mulready letter sheets were given for official use to government departments such as the tax office, and the idea of introducing an official stamp was abandoned. Only a few postally used examples exist, which probably originate from the Post Office circulars sent out as advance notice of the new stamps. Four are known on covers; all were cut from their envelopes and then replaced. Most of the cancelled examples are from trials of cancellation types, inks, and experiments with their removal. Those trials led to the change from black to red stamps, and vice versa for the cancellations.

==In popular culture==
Considered a British cultural icon, the Penny Black design featured in the innovations section of the series B British passport issued in 2015. Also in 2015, the search engine Google marked the 175th anniversary of the postage stamp with a Google doodle of the Penny Black.

<doc id="193263" wikidata="Q15052215" url="?curid=193263" title="Leonard Chang">
<text>Leonard Chang is a Korean American writer of short stories and novels, as well as a screenwriter and television writer/executive producer who is known for FX&#x27;s Snowfall.

==Biography==
Born in Harlem, New York, Chang grew up on Long Island and attended the public schools of Merrick. After graduating high school, Chang studied Philosophy at Dartmouth College, interned with the Peace Corps in Kingston, Jamaica, and continued his Philosophy studies at Harvard University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors. After college, Chang attended the Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) Graduate Creative Writing program at the University of California at Irvine. He currently lives in South L.A.

==Fiction writing==
===Short stories and novels===
Chang&#x27;s short stories have appeared in a variety of literary journals, including &quot;The Crescent Review&quot;, &quot;Confluence&quot;, &quot;The Literary Review&quot;, and &quot;Prairie Schooner&quot;.

His first novel was &quot;The Fruit &#x27;N Food&quot; (1996), winner of the Black Heron Press Award for Social Fiction, a story about a loner who finds employment in a New York grocery; major themes involve race relations and violence. His other novels include &quot;Dispatches from the Cold&quot; (1998), which won the San Francisco Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature.

His novel &quot;Over The Shoulder&quot; (2001), a mystery/noir, forms the first book in a trilogy about his Korean American private-eye protagonist, Allen Choice. Other novels in the &quot;Choice&quot; trilogy are: &quot;Underkill&quot; (2003) and &quot;Fade To Clear&quot; (2004) (a USA Today Summer Reading Pick and a finalist for the Shamus Award).

His 2009 novel, entitled &quot;Crossings&quot; brings together many of the themes and issues of his previous work, and centers around a love story between recent Korean immigrants, while tackling the harsh circumstances of illegal immigration and human trafficking.

&quot;Triplines&quot; was published in 2014 and is a highly autobiographical novel about his tumultuous childhood on Long Island.

His latest novel, entitled &quot;The Lockpicker&quot;, was published in 2017.

===Themes===
Chang&#x27;s work is unusual in the canon of Asian American literature because of the level of assimilation many of his Korean American characters have achieved, and their connections with characters of other races and ethnicities. His protagonists tend to be second generation Americans, often linked to a diverse landscape of characters and locations, including a clerk in a Korean grocery in Queens, a working-class white man in rural New Hampshire, or a sex-trafficked young woman in Los Angeles. His crime-related works deal less with race relations than with character-driven issues, such as with Allen Choice, whose name (&quot;Choice&quot; changed from the Korean &quot;Choi&quot; by his father) denotes the shift in themes. Chang&#x27;s experiments in crime fiction are related to this shift, since the stories revolve around criminals, and despite the fact that the protagonists are often Korean American, the debt here is more to crime and noir writers like Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and Ross Macdonald. What also seems to differentiate Chang&#x27;s work from others of his generation is his singular focus on detailing the Korean American experience as distinctly American. His later works tend to deal with family trauma, violence and dysfunction, and how these scars reverberate throughout the generations.

Chang&#x27;s novels have been translated and published in multiple countries, and are regularly studied in literature, theology and sociology courses throughout the United States, Asia and Europe.

==Teaching==
Chang was a faculty member at Antioch University&#x27;s MFA program, and has been a Visiting Distinguished Writer at Mills College. The U.S. Consulate in Berlin also recently sponsored a multi-city lecture/reading tour of Germany where he read from his works.

==Television and film writing==
===TV writing===
Chang was a writer and Executive Producer for the FX series &quot;Snowfall&quot;. He was also a writer/producer for &quot;Justified&quot;, based on various works by Elmore Leonard. He has received &quot;written by&quot; credits on the &quot;Justified&quot; episodes: &quot;Burned&quot; (2015), &quot;Sounding&quot; (2015), &quot;Wrong Roads&quot; (2014), &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Hatchet Tour&quot; (2013). He has been a staff writer/story editor/co-producer on 39 other &quot;Justified&quot; episodes. He also appeared in the 2014 &quot;Justified&quot; episode &quot;Wrong Roads&quot; as a bartender.

Chang was a staff writer for the NBC show &quot;Awake&quot;. He has served as a staff writer for over 12 episodes and has received &quot;written by&quot; credits for the episodes &quot;Turtles All The Way Down&quot; (2012), &quot;Say Hello To My Little Friend&quot; (2012), and &quot;Nightswimming&quot; (2012).

He is currently an Executive Producer and Showrunner for the Netflix comedy &quot;The_Vince_Staples_Show&quot;.

===Film writing===
Chang has written a number of feature film screenplays, including adaptations of his novels &quot;Over The Shoulder&quot; and &quot;Dispatches from the Cold&quot; (for Canary Films), and &quot;Triplines&quot;.

<text>Margarine (, , ) is a spread used for flavoring, baking, and cooking. It is most often used as a substitute for butter. Although originally made from animal fats, most margarine consumed today is made from vegetable oil. The spread was originally named &quot;oleomargarine&quot; from Latin for &quot;oleum&quot; (olive oil) and Greek &quot;margarite&quot; (&quot;pearl&quot;, indicating luster). The name was later shortened to &quot;margarine&quot;, or sometimes &quot;oleo&quot; (particularly in the Deep South).

Margarine consists of a water-in-fat emulsion, with tiny droplets of water dispersed uniformly throughout a fat phase in a stable solid form. While butter is made by concentrating the butterfat of milk through agitation, modern margarine is made through a more intensive processing of refined vegetable oil and water. 

Per US federal regulation, products must have a minimum fat content of 80% (with a maximum of 16% water) to be labeled as such in the United States, although the term is used informally to describe vegetable-oil-based spreads with lower fat content.

Margarine can be used as an ingredient in other food products, such as pastries, doughnuts, cakes, and cookies.

==History==
===Invention and early distribution===
Margarine has its roots in the discovery by French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul in 1813 of margaric acid. Scientists at the time regarded margaric acid, like oleic acid and stearic acid, as one of the three fatty acids that, in combination, form most animal fats. In 1853, the German structural chemist Wilhelm Heinrich Heintz analyzed margaric acid as simply a combination of stearic acid and the previously unknown palmitic acid.

After the French Emperor Napoleon III issued a challenge to create a butter-substitute from beef tallow for the armed forces and lower classes, Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès invented margarine in 1869. Mège-Mouriès patented the product, which he named &quot;oleomargarine&quot;, and expanded his initial manufacturing operation from France, but had little commercial success. In 1871, he sold the patent to the Dutch company Jurgens, which subsequently became part of Unilever. In the same year a German pharmacist, Benedict Klein from Cologne, founded the first margarine factory in Germany, producing the brands Overstolz and Botteram.


The principal raw material in the original formulation of margarine was beef-fat. In 1871, Henry W. Bradley of Binghamton, New York, received US Patent 110626 for a process of creating margarine that combined vegetable oils (primarily cottonseed oil) with animal fats. In 1874, the first commercial cargo arrived in the UK. By the late-19th century, some 37 companies were manufacturing margarine in the US, in opposition to the butter industry, which protested and lobbied for government intervention, eventually leading to the 1886 Margarine Act imposing prohibitive taxes and fees against margarine manufacturers.

Shortages in beef-fat supply, combined with advances by James F. Boyce and Paul Sabatier in the hydrogenation of plant materials, soon accelerated the use of Bradley&#x27;s method, and between 1900 and 1920, commercial oleomargarine was produced from a combination of animal fats and hardened and unhardened vegetable oils. The Great Depression, followed by rationing in the United States and in the United Kingdom, among other countries, during World War II, led to a reduction in supply of animal fat and butter, and, by 1945, &quot;original&quot; margarine had almost completely disappeared from the market. In the United States, problems with supply, coupled with changes in legislation, caused margarine manufacturers to switch almost completely to vegetable oils and fats by 1950, and the margarine industry was ready for an era of product development.

===Color debate===

Carotene in the milk of grass-fed cows gives butter produced from such milk a slightly yellow color. However, being a synthetic product, margarine has a white color resembling lard, which many people found unappetizing. Around the late 1880s, manufacturers began coloring margarine yellow to improve sales.

Dairy firms, especially in Wisconsin, became alarmed at the potential threat to their business, and succeeded in getting legislation passed to prohibit the coloring of the stark white margarine by 1902. In response, margarine companies distributed margarine together with a packet of yellow food coloring. The product was placed in a bowl and the coloring mixed in manually, taking some time and effort, especially if the mixing needed to be done by hand—typically the case at the time since domestic electric mixers were rarely used before the 1920s. It was therefore not unusual for the final product to be served as a light and dark yellow, or even white, striped product. During World War II, butter and margarine were both in short supply and subject to rationing in the United States, but butter required more points, causing margarine to gain popularity. In 1951, the W. E. Dennison Company received US Patent 2553513 for a method to place a capsule of yellow dye inside a plastic package of margarine. After purchase, the capsule was broken by pressing on the outside of the package, and the package was kneaded to distribute the dye.

The artificial coloring laws began being repealed around 1955, and margarine could once again be sold colored like butter in most states. The final hold out was Wisconsin, which finally repealed its restrictions in 1967.

===Coal butter===

Around the 1930s and 1940s, Arthur Imhausen developed and implemented an industrial process in Germany for producing edible fats by oxidizing synthetic paraffin wax made from coal. The products were fractionally distilled and the edible fats were obtained from the – fraction which were reacted with glycerol such as that synthesized from propylene. Margarine made from them was found to be nutritious and of agreeable taste, and it was incorporated into diets contributing as much as 700 calories per day. The process required at least 60 kilograms of coal per kilogram of synthetic butter. That industrial process was discontinued after WWII due to its inefficiency.

===Post-WWII===
During the Second World War and immediate post-war years amid rationing in the United Kingdom, only two types of margarine were available: a premium brand and a budget brand with whale oil being used in its manufacture. With the end of rationing in 1955, the market was opened to the forces of supply and demand, and brand marketing became prevalent. The competition among the major producers was given further impetus with the beginning of commercial television advertising in 1955 and, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, competing companies vied with each other to produce the margarine that tasted most like butter.

===Spread products===
In the mid-1960s, the introduction of two lower-fat blends of butter oil and vegetable oils in Scandinavia, called &quot;Lätt &amp; Lagom&quot; and &quot;Bregott&quot;, clouded the issue of what should be called &quot;margarine&quot; and began the debate that led to the introduction of the term &quot;spread&quot;. In 1978, an 80% fat product called &quot;Krona&quot;, made by churning a blend of dairy cream and vegetable oils, was introduced in Europe and, in 1982, a blend of cream and vegetable oils called Clover was introduced in the UK by the Milk Marketing Board. The vegetable oil and cream spread I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Butter! was introduced into the United States in 1981, and in the United Kingdom and Canada in 1991. In the US, products with less than 80% fat can be labeled spreads, but they can not be called margarine. Since the word margarine is less popular with consumers, manufacturers developed some products to have slightly less than the minimum amount of fat, so that they can legally avoid labeling their products as margarine.

In the 21st century, margarine spreads had many developments to improve their consumer appeal. Most brands phased out the use of hydrogenated oils and became trans fat free. Many brands launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only one-third of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads. Other varieties of spreads include those with added omega-3 fatty acids, low or no salt, added plant sterols (claimed to reduce blood cholesterol), olive oil, or certified vegan oils. In the early 21st century, manufacturers provided margarines in plastic squeeze bottles to ease dispensing and offered pink margarine as a novelty. 

==Manufacturing process==
The basic method of making margarine today consists of emulsifying a blend of oils and fats from vegetable and animal sources, which can be modified using fractionation, interesterification or hydrogenation, with skimmed milk which may be fermented or soured, salt, citric or lactic acid, chilling the mixture to solidify it, and working it to improve the texture. Margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10% to 90% fat, depending on dietary marketing and purpose (spreading, cooking or baking). The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated and more liquid oils than block margarines.

Three types of margarine are common:
* Bottled liquid margarine to cook or top dishes.
* Soft vegetable fat spreads, high in mono- or polyunsaturated fats, which are made from safflower, sunflower, soybean, cottonseed, rapeseed, or olive oil.
* Hard margarine (sometimes uncolored) for cooking or baking.

To produce margarine, first oils and fats are extracted, e.g. by pressing from seeds, and then refined. Oils may undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The milk/water mixture is kept separate from the oil mixture until the emulsion step. The fats are warmed so that they are liquid during the mixing process. The water-soluble additives are added to the water or milk mixture, and emulsifiers such as lecithin are added to help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil. Other water-soluble additives include powdered skim milk, salt, citric acid, lactic acid, and preservatives such as potassium sorbate. The fat soluble additives are mixed into the oil. These include carotenoids for coloring and antioxidants. Then the two mixtures are emulsified by slowly adding the oil into the milk/water mixture with constant stirring. Next, the mixture is cooled. Rapid chilling avoids the production of large crystals and results in a smooth texture. The product is then rolled or kneaded. Finally, the product may be aerated with nitrogen to facilitate spreading it.

===Hydrogenation===
Vegetable and animal fats are similar compounds with different melting points. Fats that are liquid at room temperature are generally known as oils. The melting points are related to the presence of carbon–carbon double bonds in the fatty acids components. A higher number of double bonds gives a lower melting point. Oils can be converted into solid substances at room temperature through hydrogenation.

Commonly, natural oils are hydrogenated by passing hydrogen gas through the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst, under controlled conditions. The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C–C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus &quot;hardening&quot; it. This is due to the increase in van der Waals&#x27; forces between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules. However, as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet, the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture. Margarines made in this way are said to contain hydrogenated fat. This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium. If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon–carbon double bonds into the &quot;trans&quot; form. If these particular bonds are not hydrogenated during the process, they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats, the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. For this reason, partially hardened fats are used less and less in the margarine industry. Some tropical oils, such as palm oil and coconut oil, are naturally semi-solid and do not require hydrogenation.

==Nutrition==

In a 100-gram reference amount, margarine – manufactured from soybean oil and pasteurized – provides and is composed of 70% fat, 2% carbohydrates, 26% water, and negligible protein. The reference margarine was rich in vitamin E (37% of the Daily Value, DV), containing 35 mg gamma-tocopherol) and sodium (47% DV) added as salt for flavor. Unless fortified with micronutrients during manufacturing, there are no other nutrients in significant content. Vitamin A and vitamin D may be added for fortification.

===Processing contaminants===
Margarine contains the possible carcinogens and toxins 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD and Glycidol. They are contaminants that are created during the oil refining process (especially deodorization).

===Amount of fat===
The roles of butter and traditional margarine (80% fat) are similar with respect to their energy content, but low-fat margarines and spreads are also widely available.

===Saturated fat===

Replacing saturated and trans unsaturated fats with unhydrogenated monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats is more effective in preventing coronary heart disease than reducing overall fat intake. See saturated fat and cardiovascular disease.

Vegetable fats can contain anything from 7% to 86% saturated fatty acids. Liquid oils (canola oil, sunflower oil) tend to be on the low end, while tropical oils (coconut oil, palm kernel oil) and fully hardened (hydrogenated) oils are at the high end of the scale. A margarine blend is a mixture of both types of components. Generally, firmer margarines contain more saturated fat.

Typical soft tub margarine contains 10% to 20% of saturated fat. Regular butterfat contains 52 to 65% saturated fats. The American Institute of Medicine and the European Food Safety Authority recommend saturated fat intake to be as low as possible.

===Unsaturated fat===

Consumption of unsaturated fatty acids has been found to decrease LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL cholesterol levels in the blood, thus reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

There are two types of unsaturated oils: mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, both of which are recognized as beneficial to health in contrast to saturated fats. Some widely grown vegetable oils, such as canola, sunflower, safflower, and olive oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats. During the manufacture of margarine, makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or trans fats to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures.

* Omega-3 fatty acids Omega-3 fatty acids are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is one of the two essential fatty acids, so called because humans cannot manufacture it and must get it from food. Omega-3 fatty acids are mostly obtained from oily fish caught in northern waters. They are comparatively uncommon in vegetable sources, including margarine. However, one type of omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) can be found in some vegetable oils. Flax oil contains 30–50% of ALA, and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils; both are often added to premium margarines. An ancient oil plant, &quot;Camelina sativa&quot;, has recently gained popularity because of its high omega-3 content (30–45%), and it has been added to some margarines. Hemp oil contains about 20% ALA. Small amounts of ALA are found in vegetable oils such as soybean oil (7.8%) and canola oil (9.2%).
* Omega-6 fatty acids Omega-6 fatty acids are also important for health. They include the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (LA), which is abundant in vegetable oils grown in temperate climates. Some, such as hemp (60%) and the common margarine oils corn (60%), cottonseed (50%) and sunflower (50%), have large amounts, but most temperate oil seeds have over 10% LA. Margarine is very high in omega-6 fatty acids. Modern Western diets are frequently quite high in omega-6 but very deficient in omega-3. The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is typically 5:1 to 10:1. Large amounts of omega-6 decreases the effect of omega-3. Therefore, it is recommended that the ratio in the diet should be less than 4:1, although the optimal ratio may be closer to 1:1.

===Trans fat===
Unlike essential fatty acids, trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health besides providing calories. There is a positive linear trend between trans fatty acid intake and LDL cholesterol concentration, and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease, by raising levels of LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of HDL cholesterol.

Several large studies have indicated a link between consumption of high amounts of trans fat and coronary heart disease, and possibly some other diseases, prompting a number of government health agencies across the world to recommend that the intake of trans fats be minimized.

In the United States, partial hydrogenation has been common as a result of preference for domestically produced oils. However, since the mid-1990s, many countries have started to move away from using partially hydrogenated oils. This led to the production of new margarine varieties that contain less or no trans fat.

The United States Food and Drug Administration ordered that trans fat is to be eliminated from food processing after a three-year grace period beginning in June 2015, to then be implemented by 18 June 2018.

===Cholesterol===

High levels of cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein, are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and atheroma formation. The narrowing of blood vessels can cause reduced blood flow to the brain, heart, kidneys and other parts of the body. Cholesterol, though needed metabolically, is not essential in the diet, because the body&#x27;s production increases as needed when dietary intake falls. The human body makes cholesterol in the liver, adapting the production according to its food intake, producing about 1 g of cholesterol each day or 80% of the needed total body cholesterol. The remaining 20% comes directly from food intake.

Overall intake of cholesterol as food has less effect on blood cholesterol levels than the type of fat eaten. Most margarines are vegetable-based and thus contain no cholesterol, while a teaspoon (5 grams) of butter contains 10.8 mg of cholesterol.

===Plant sterol esters and stanol esters===
Plant sterol esters or plant stanol esters have been added to some margarines and spreads because of their cholesterol-lowering effect. Several studies have indicated that consumption of about 2 grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of about 10%.

===Market acceptance===
Margarine, particularly polyunsaturated margarine, has become a major part of the Western diet and had overtaken butter in popularity in the mid-20th century. In the United States, for example, in 1930, the average person ate over of butter a year and just over of margarine. By the end of the 20th century, an average American ate around of butter and nearly of margarine.

Consumers may choose margarine for a number of reasons, including lower cost, ease of availability, a perception (primarily relevant for vegetable-based margarines) that it is healthier than butter, a desire to avoid consuming animal-based products (of particular concern for vegans and also based on the assumption that the margarine is vegetable-based) and/or a simple personal preference to butter and/or other spreads on account of taste.

Margarine has a particular market value to those who observe the Jewish dietary laws of Kashrut, which forbids the mixing of meat and dairy products; hence there are strictly kosher non-dairy margarines available, known as pareve. One brand known to the Kosher-keeping public is Fleischmann&#x27;s Margarine. These are often used by the kosher-observant consumers to adapt recipes that use meat and butter or in baked goods served with meat meals. The 2008 Passover margarine shortage in America caused much consternation within the kosher-observant community.

Regular margarine contains trace amounts of animal products such as whey or dairy casein extracts. However, margarine that strictly does not contain animal products also exists. Such margarines provide a vegan substitute for butter.

==National standards==

===Australia===
Margarine is common in Australian supermarkets. Sales of the product have decreased in recent years due to consumers &quot;reducing their use of spreads in their daily diet&quot;. Butter-colored margarine was sold from its introduction in Australia, but dairy and associated industries lobbied governments strongly in a vain attempt to have them change its color, or ban it altogether.

Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Standard 2.4.2 – Edible Oil Spreads requires that edible oil spreads and table margarine must contain no less than 55 μg/kg of vitamin D.

===Canada===
Canadian standard B.09.016 states that margarine shall be:

&quot;An emulsion of fat, or water in fat, oil, or fat and oil that are not derived from milk and shall contain not less than 80% fat and not less than 3300 IU of vitamin A and 530 IU of vitamin D, and may contain
(i) skim milk powder, buttermilk powder or liquid buttermilk,
(ii) whey solids or modified whey solids,&quot;

Calorie-reduced margarine is specified in standard B.09.017 as:

&quot;Containing not less than 40% fat and having 50% of the calories normally present in margarine.&quot;
In 2007, Health Canada released an updated version of Canada&#x27;s Food Guide that recommended Canadians choose &quot;soft&quot; margarine spreads that are low in saturated and trans fats and limit traditional &quot;hard&quot; margarines, butter, lard, and shortening in their diets.

===European Union===
Under European Union directives, distinguishes between spreadable fats:

&quot;A water-in-oil emulsion derived from vegetable/animal fats, with a fat content of at least 10% but less than 90%, that remain solid at a temperature of 20°C and are suitable as spread.&quot;
and margarine:

&quot;To avoid any possible confusion, the Regulation limits the use of the terms &quot;butter&quot; and &quot;margarine&quot; to products with a fat content of not less than 80%.&quot;
Margarines may not have a milk fat content of more than 3%. For blends and blended spreads, the milk fat may be between 10% and 80%.

Spread that contains 60 to 62% of fat may be called &quot;three-quarter-fat margarine&quot; or &quot;reduced-fat margarine&quot;.
Spread that contains 39 to 41% of fat may be called &quot;half-fat margarine&quot;, &quot;low-fat margarine&quot;, or &quot;light margarine&quot;.
Spreads with any other percentage of fat are called &quot;fat spread&quot; or &quot;light spread&quot;.

Many member states currently require the mandatory addition of vitamins A and D to margarine and fat spreads for reasons of public health. Voluntary fortification of margarine with vitamins had been practiced by manufacturers since 1925, but in 1940 with the advent of the war, certain governments took action to safeguard the nutritional status of their nations by making the addition of vitamin A and D compulsory. This mandatory fortification was justified in the view that margarine was being used to replace butter in the diet.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, no brands of spread on sale contain partially hydrogenated oils. Fortification with vitamins A and D is no longer mandatory for margarine, this brings it in line with other spreads wherein fortification is not required.

==Legal issues==
Since margarine intrinsically appears white or almost white, by preventing the addition of artificial coloring agents, legislators found they could protect the dairy industries by discouraging the consumption of margarine based on visual appeal. If margarine were colored the same as butter, consumers would see it as being virtually the same thing as butter, and as a quasi-natural product. Bans on adding color became commonplace in the United States, Canada, and Denmark and, in some cases, those bans endured for almost 100 years. The rivalry between the dairy industry and the oleomargarine industry persists even today.

===Canada===
In Canada, margarine was prohibited from 1886 to 1948, though this ban was temporarily lifted from 1917 until 1923 due to dairy shortages. Nevertheless, bootleg margarine was produced in the neighboring Dominion of Newfoundland from whale, seal, and fish oil by the Newfoundland Butter Company and was smuggled to Canada where it was widely sold for half the price of butter. The Supreme Court of Canada lifted the margarine ban in 1948 in the Margarine Reference. That year, Newfoundland negotiated its entry into the Canadian Confederation, and one of its three non-negotiable conditions for union with Canada was a constitutional protection for the new province&#x27;s right to manufacture margarine.

In 1950, as a result of a court ruling giving provinces the right to regulate the product, rules were implemented in much of Canada regarding margarine&#x27;s color, requiring that it be bright yellow or orange in some provinces or colorless in others. By the 1980s, most provinces had lifted the restriction. However, in Ontario it was not legal to sell butter-colored margarine until 1995. Quebec, the last Canadian province to regulate margarine coloring, repealed its law requiring margarine to be colorless in July 2008.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Margarine Acts of 1895 and 1908 prohibited the manufacture of margarine without a licence from the Minister of Agriculture and made it illegal to &quot;mix, colour, stain, or powder margarine with any ingredient or material so as to imitate butter&quot;. The acts were repealed by the &quot;Dairy Industry Amendment Act 1989&quot;, however previous amendments in 1972 and 1980 had allowed &quot;virtually an opened market&quot;.

===United States===

In 1877, New York became the first U.S. state to attempt legal restriction of the sale of oleomargarine through compulsory labeling. The law, &quot;to prevent deception in sales of butter,&quot; required retailers to provide customers with a slip of paper that identified the &quot;imitation&quot; product as margarine. This law proved ineffective, as it would have required an army of inspectors and chemists to enforce it. By the mid-1880s, the U.S. federal government had introduced a tax of two cents per pound, and manufacturers needed an expensive license to make or sell the product. The simple expedient of requiring oleo manufacturers to color their product distinctively was, however, left out of early federal legislation. But individual states began to require the clear labeling of margarine. The color bans, drafted by the butter lobby, began in the dairy states of New York and New Jersey. In several states, legislatures enacted laws to require margarine manufacturers to add pink colorings to make the product look unpalatable, despite the objections of the oleo manufacturers that butter dairies themselves added annatto to their product to imitate the yellow of mid-summer butter.

By the start of the 20th century, eight out of ten Americans could not buy yellow margarine, and those who could had to pay a hefty tax on it. Bootleg colored margarine became common, and manufacturers began to supply food-coloring capsules so the consumer could knead the yellow color into margarine before serving it. Nevertheless, the regulations and taxes had a significant effect: the 1902 restrictions on margarine color, for example, cut annual consumption in the United States from .

With the coming of World War I, margarine consumption increased enormously, even in countries away from the front, such as the United States. In the countries closest to the fighting, dairy products became almost unobtainable and were strictly rationed. The United Kingdom, for example, depended on imported butter from Australia and New Zealand, and the risk of submarine attacks meant little arrived.

The long-running battle between the margarine and dairy lobbies continued: in the United States, the Great Depression brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation; the Second World War, a swing back to margarine. After the war, the margarine lobby gained power and, little by little, the main margarine restrictions were lifted, the most recent states to do so being Minnesota in 1963 and Wisconsin in 1967. Lois Dowdle Cobb (1889–1987) of Atlanta, wife of the agricultural publisher Cully Cobb, led the move in the United States to lift the restrictions on margarine. Some unenforced laws remain on the books.

<doc id="193279" wikidata="Q10286140" url="?curid=193279" title="Cornmeal">
<text>Cornmeal is a meal (coarse flour) ground from dried maize. It is a common staple food and is ground to coarse, medium, and fine consistencies, but it is not as fine as wheat flour can be. In Mexico and Louisiana, very finely ground cornmeal is referred to as [[maize flour|corn flour]]. When fine cornmeal is made from maize that has been soaked in an alkaline solution, e.g., limewater (a process known as nixtamalization), it is called masa harina (or masa flour), which is used for making arepas, tamales, and tortillas. Boiled cornmeal is called polenta in Italy and is also a traditional dish and bread substitute in Romania.

==Types==
There are various types of cornmeal:

*&quot;Blue cornmeal&quot; is light blue or violet in color. It is ground from whole blue corn and has a sweet flavor. The cornmeal consists of dried corn kernels that have been ground into a fine or medium texture.
*&quot;Steel-ground yellow cornmeal&quot;, which is common mostly in the United States, has the husk and germ of the maize kernel almost completely removed. It will remain fresh for about a year if stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
*&quot;Stone-ground cornmeal&quot; retains some of the hull and germ, lending a little more flavor and nutrition to recipes. It is more perishable, but will store longer if refrigerated. However, it too can have a shelf life of many months if kept in a reasonably cool place.
*&quot;White cornmeal&quot; (mielie-meal), made from white corn, is more common in parts of Africa. It is also popular in the Southern United States for making cornbread.

==Regional usage==

<text>Oliver Law (October 23, 1900 – July 9, 1937) was an African-American communist and labor organizer, who fought for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. Having previously served in the United States Army, he traveled to Spain and became commander of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion for several days and commander of its Machine Gun Company for much longer.

==Background==
Born in west Texas, Law joined the US Army in 1919. He stayed on until 1925. He served as a private in the 24th Infantry Regiment, an Afro-American outfit on the Mexican border. After leaving the army, he went to Bluffton, Indiana, where he worked in a cement plant. He moved on to Chicago, where he drove a taxi with the Yellow Cab Company. In the Great Depression he found work as a stevedore and joined the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association. He then tried his luck with a small restaurant, but failed and got a job with the Works Project Administration. Law was a member of the International Labor Defense and joined the Communist Party (CP) in 1932. In 1930 he was very active in the unemployment movement.

Law worked with Harry Haywood to organize mass protests against Italy&#x27;s occupation of Ethiopia at the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. He was arrested speaking at a demonstration in Chicago on August 31, 1935.

Law was married to Corrine Booker Light-foot, mother of the regional Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) leader Claude Lightfoot.

==Spanish Civil War==
In 1936 Law joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He arrived in Spain on January 16, 1937, to fight for the Popular Front against Francisco Franco and the Nationalists. Having met the International Brigades at Albacete, Law first served as a group leader of a machine-gun company engaged on the Jarama front. There were three group leaders, under the two section leaders and the company officers.

After failing to take Madrid by frontal assault, General Francisco Franco gave orders for the road that linked the city to the rest of Republican Spain to be cut. A Nationalist force of 40,000 men, including men from the Army of Africa, crossed the Jarama River on February 11, 1937. General José Miaja sent three International Brigades to the Jarama Valley to block the advance. Law first saw action on February 17. After disastrous setbacks on February 27, Law had performed well on the day and was soon promoted to section leader. Two weeks later he was made commander of the machine-gun company, when his superior officer was killed. The battalion leadership was annihilated at Jarama and Law advanced fast in rank, even though there was some criticism of his performance at the attack on Villanueva de la Cañada.

The experienced battalion commander Martin Hourihan recognized Law&#x27;s abilities and wanted to send him to officer&#x27;s training school. When Hourihan became ill, Law was chosen to replace him temporarily. After Houridan transferred permanently to the regimental staff, the choice of battalion commander was between Law and Walter Garland, who was still recovering from wounds, and Law was chosen and led the Abraham Lincoln Battalion in the first days of the Battle of Brunete. At the beginning of July the Popular Front government launched a major attack to relieve the threat to Madrid. General Vicente Rojo Lluch sent the Republican Army to Brunete, challenging Nationalist control of the western approaches to the capital. The 80,000 Republican soldiers made good early progress, but they were brought to a halt when General Francisco Franco brought up his reserves.

The Internationals also suffered heavy losses. Oliver Law was killed on July 9, leading his men in an attack on Mosquito Crest (&quot;Mosquito Hill&quot;).

<text>In Norse mythology, Vingólf is one of the buildings of the gods. It is described as the hall or &quot;hörgr&quot; of the goddesses and also as a place where righteous men and those slain in battle go after death. It is mentioned in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; 3 and in the enigmatic poem &quot;Hrafnagaldur Óðins&quot;.

==The Prose Edda==

Vingólf is mentioned three times in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.



The three mentions of Vingólf seem somewhat contradictory. In the first instance it appears as an alternative name for Gimlé, a paradise where righteous people go after death. In the second instance it is the hall or hörgr of the goddesses. In the third instance it is a residence for those slain in battle.

The name does not occur in Eddaic or skaldic poetry.

==Hrafnagaldur Óðins==

The enigmatic &quot;Hrafnagaldur Óðins&quot;, a young mythological poem composed in the Eddic style, mentions Vingólf in one of its strophes.

The context is enigmatic but Vingólf seems to be a place where the Æsir have gathered for an ale feasts. The significance of this mention hinges on the interpretation of &quot;Hrafnagaldur Óðins&quot; as a whole.

==Vingólf&#x27;s name==

The name &quot;Vingólf&quot; is usually thought to be composed of &quot;vinr&quot; (friend) and &quot;gólf&quot; (floor, hall) and mean something like &quot;pleasant hall&quot;. Alternatively the name could be read Víngólf and the meaning would be &quot;wine hall&quot;.

&quot;Uppsalabók&quot;, one of the four main manuscripts of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, has the variant reading Vindglóð seemingly meaning &quot;wind ember&quot; but most variant readings which occur only in that manuscript are thought to be corrupted.

<text>Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent, a mixture of a carbonate or bicarbonate and a weak acid. The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as cornstarch. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a batter or dough through an acid–base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus leavening the mixture. 

The first &quot;single-acting&quot; baking powder (meaning that it releases all of its carbon dioxide as soon as it is dampened) was developed by food manufacturer Alfred Bird in England in 1843. The first &quot;double-acting&quot; baking powder, which releases some carbon dioxide when dampened and later releases more of the gas when heated by baking, was developed by Eben Norton Horsford in the U.S. in the 1860s.

Baking powder is used instead of yeast for end-products where fermentation flavors would be undesirable, 
or where the batter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few minutes, and to speed the production of baked goods. Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called quick breads. The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.

==Formulation and mechanism==
Baking powder is made up of a base, an acid, and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use. 
Most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more acid salts.

===Acid-base reactions===
When combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide. 
Whether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same. The acid-base reaction can be generically represented as shown:

:NaHCO3 + H+ → Na+ + CO2 + H2O

The real reactions are more complicated because the acids are complicated. For example, starting with baking soda and monocalcium phosphate, the reaction produces carbon dioxide by the following stoichiometry:

:14 NaHCO3 + 5 Ca(H2PO4)2 → 14 CO2 + Ca5(PO4)3OH + 7 Na2HPO4 + 13 H2O
A typical formulation (by weight) could call for 30% sodium bicarbonate, 5–12% monocalcium phosphate, and 21–26% sodium aluminium sulfate. 
Alternately, a commercial baking powder might use sodium acid pyrophosphate as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate.
Another typical acid in such formulations is cream of tartar (KC4H5O6), a derivative of tartaric acid.

===Single- and double-acting baking powders===
The use of two acidic components is the basis of the term &quot;double acting&quot;. 
The acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting. 
A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated. When the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids, they are known as &quot;double-acting&quot;; those that contain only one acid are &quot;single-acting&quot;.

By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical. This is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot.

For example, Rumford Baking Powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid. With this acid, about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature. It then becomes dormant because an intermediate species, dicalcium phosphate, is generated during the initial mixing. A further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140 °F (60 °C).

Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate, sodium aluminium phosphate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate.

===Starch component===
Baking powders also include components to improve their stability and consistency. Cornstarch, flour, or potato starch are often used as buffers. 
An inert starch serves several functions in baking powder. Primarily it is used to absorb moisture, and so prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder&#x27;s alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely. A dry powder also flows and mixes more easily. Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.

=== Commonly used bases and acids ===
Baking powder is made of two main components: an acid and a bicarbonate base. When they are hydrated, an acid–base reaction occurs, releasing carbon dioxide. Commonly used acids and bases for baking powders are:

==== Bases ====

* Sodium bicarbonate
* Ammonium bicarbonate
* Potassium bicarbonate

==== Acids ====

* Potassium acid tartrate (cream of tartar)
* Monocalcium phosphate (MCP)
* Sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP)
* Sodium aluminium phosphate (SALP)
* Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate
* Sodium aluminium sulfate
* Glucono delta-lactone (GDL)
* Fumaric acid
* Dimagnesium phosphate (DMP)

=== Neutralizing value ===
The neutralizing value (NV) is defined as the amount of baking soda required to neutralize 100 parts of a leavening acid (by weight).

Neutralizing value can be expressed through the following formula:

&quot;NV = g of NaHCO3 neutralized by 100 g leavening acid&quot;

=== Rate of reaction ===
The rate of reaction (ROR) is represented by the percentage of carbon dioxide released by the acid-base reaction.

Other subcategories exist to classify the reaction rated during mixing and holding called “Dough Reaction Rate (DRR)” and during baking at a given temperature denominated “Batter Reaction Rate (BRR)”.

The ROR of baking powders is impacted by many factors, including:

* Acid type: moisture and/or heat reactivity are influenced by its physicochemical properties, such as solubility and dissociation extent.
* Granulometry 
* Temperature of dough or batter
* Concentration of leavening acid and base
* Hydration
* Presence of water-binding ingredients (e.g. sugars, alcohols, starches, gums, salt)
* Presence of cations (calcium)

== History ==

===Before baking powder===
When Amelia Simmons published &quot;American Cookery&quot; (1792), the first American cookbook, three known types of leavening were used in its recipes: baker&#x27;s yeast, emptins (from the leavings of brewer&#x27;s yeast), and pearlash. 
At that time, the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood, and reliable commercial products were not available. Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or &quot;emptins&quot; in their baking.
The effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste. Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and pound cakes. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts. Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening. Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.

===Pearlash===
The third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of potash. 
According to Joop Witteveen (1985), pearlash was used in Europe by professional bakers in the mid-seventeenth century. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; credits the first written use of the term &quot;pearl ash&quot; to 1703 and the writing of Abel Boyer.

By the mid-1700s, practical treatises on the calcination of pearlash were available in both England and the United States. Pearlash was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make lye, and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain &quot;salts&quot;.

The active ingredient in pearlash was potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like sour milk or lemon juice resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.
Once prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks&#x27; worth of bread at one time. &quot;American Cookery&quot; was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.

===Experimentation===
Between the publication of &quot;American Cookery&quot; in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners. Many were already available in households as medicinal, cleaning or solvent products. Smelling salts, hartshorn, and sal volatile were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of ammonium carbonate. The term &quot;saleratus&quot; was applied confusingly to both potassium bicarbonate and to sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, what we now call baking soda). Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help. Cream of tartar, also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.

In 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Domestic Recipe Book&quot; (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar. 
Several recipes in the compilation cookbook &quot;Practical American Cookery&quot; (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough. There were recipes for a &quot;crust&quot; similar to modern dumplings or cobbler, several for cakes, and one for &quot;soda doughnuts&quot;. When the third edition of &quot;Miss Beecher&#x27;s Domestic Receipt Book&quot; appeared in 1858, it included 8 types of leaveners, only two of which could be made at home.

Baking soda and cream of tartar were sold by chemists rather than in grocery stores. Pharmacists purchased the materials in bulk and then dispensed them individually in small amounts in paper packaging. At least one contributor to &quot;Practical American Cookery&quot; provided instructions on how to handle baking soda and cream of tartar. Even with instructions, early leaveners could be difficult to obtain, awkward to store, unstandardized, and unpredictable to use.

The chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid(s) and an acid such as sour milk, vinegar, lemon juice, or cream of tartar. Because these acidulants react with baking soda quickly, retention of gas bubbles was dependent on batter viscosity. It was critical for the batter to be baked quickly, before the gas escaped. The next step, the development of baking powder, created a system where the gas-producing reactions could be delayed until needed.

===The rise of baking powder===

The creation of shelf-stable chemical combinations of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar is seen as marking the true introduction of baking powder. Although cooks had used both sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar in recipes, they had to purchase the ingredients individually and store them separately to prevent them from spoiling or reacting prematurely. As chemists developed more uniform constituents, they also began to experiment with ways of combining them. In the mid-late 1800s, chemists introduced the first modern baking powders.

====Alfred Bird====
The first to create a form of baking powder was English chemist and food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843. Bird was motivated to develop a yeast-free leavener because his wife Elizabeth was allergic to eggs and yeast. His formulation included bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid, mixed with starch to absorb moisture and prevent the other ingredients from reacting. A single-action form of baking powder, Alfred Bird&#x27;s Baking Powder reacted as soon as it became damp.

Bird focused on selling his baking powder to the British Army during the Crimean War, and to explorers like Captain Sir Francis Leopold McClintock, rather than the domestic market. 
Nonetheless, Bird&#x27;s creation of baking powder enabled cooks to take recipes for cakes such as the patriotically named Victoria sponge and make them rise higher.
He did not patent his discovery, and others such as Henry Jones of Bristol soon produced and patented similar products. In 1845, Jones patented &quot;A new preparation of flour&quot; (self-raising flour) that included sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid to obtain a leavening effect.

====Eben Norton Horsford====
In America, Eben Norton Horsford, a student of Justus von Liebig, set out to create a flour fortifier and leavening agent. In 1856, he was awarded a patent for &quot;pulverulent phosphoric acid&quot;, a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, monocalcium pyrophosphate provided a double-acting form of leavening. Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.

In 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of Count Rumford. In 1861, Horsford published &quot;The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment&quot;, describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or &quot;Bread preparation&quot; in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.

Horsford&#x27;s research was interrupted by the American Civil War, but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using cornstarch as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford&#x27;s leavening products were marketed originally as &quot;Horsford&#x27;s Yeast Powder&quot; and later as &quot;Rumford Baking Powder&quot;. They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans. In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of baking powder&#x27;s impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.

In the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with Ludwig Clamor Marquart and Carl Zimmer in Germany. Baking powders based on Horsford&#x27;s formula were sold in England as &quot;Horsford-Liebig Baking Powder&quot;. They were also sold by several companies in Germany, beginning with Marquart and with Zimmer. However, baking powder was not successful in Germany at that time. Much of German baking occurred in guild-based bakeries, rather than in private homes, and the guilds were not interested in replacing centuries-old craft skills with a new technology. Nonetheless, Liebig clearly saw the importance of Horsford&#x27;s work, stating:

====Dr. Oetker&#x27;s Baking Powder====

In the 1890s, the German pharmacist August Oetker began to market a baking powder directly to housewives. It became popular in Germany as &quot;Dr. Oetker&#x27;s Baking Powder&quot; and as &quot;Backin&quot;. Oetker started the mass production of phosphate-based baking powder in 1898 and patented his technique in 1903. 

Research by Paul R. Jones in 1993 has shown that Oetker&#x27;s original recipe was a descendant of Horsford&#x27;s phosphate-based recipe, obtained from Louis Marquand, a son of Ludwig Clamor Marquart. Dr. Oetker Baking Powder continues to be sold, currently listing its ingredients as sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate and corn starch.

====Royal Baking Powder====
In the U.S., in 1866, Joseph C. Hoagland and his brother Cornelius developed a baking powder product with the help of Thomas M. Biddle. They sold a single-action baking powder containing cream of tartar, bicarbonate of soda and starch. Their formula became known as Royal Baking Powder.

Initially in partnership as Biddle &amp; Hoagland, the Hoaglands moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Chicago, leaving Biddle behind, and then to New York. They incorporated there as the Royal Baking Powder Company in 1868. Various battles for control ensued between the Hoagland brothers and their one-time employee William Ziegler. Finally, on March 2, 1899, Ziegler established the New Jersey–based Royal Baking Powder Corporation which combined the three major cream of tartar baking powder companies then in existence in the United States: Dr. Price (Ziegler), Royal (Joseph Hoagland) and Cleveland (Cornelius Nevius Hoagland).

====Alum-based baking powders ====
Cream of tartar was an expensive ingredient in the United States, since it had to be imported from France. In the 1880s, several companies developed double-action baking powders containing cheaper alternative acids known as alums, a class of compounds involving double sulfates of aluminium.
The use of various types of alum in medicines and dyes is mentioned in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;. 
However, the actual composition of alum was not determined until 1798, when Louis Vauquelin demonstrated that common alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. and Jean-Antoine Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum.

In 1888, William Monroe Wright (a former salesman for Dr. Price) and George Campbell Rew in Chicago introduced a new form of baking powder, which they called Calumet. Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, sodium aluminium sulfate () as a leavening agent, and albumen. In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, Herman Hulman of Terre Haute also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder Clabber, referencing a German baking tradition in which soured milk was used for leavening.

====Cream of tartar vs. alum====
Sodium aluminium sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect. As a result, alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder&#x27;s cream of tartar-based products. William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminium-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in Missouri briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminium compounds from use in baking powders. At the same time, he changed his own &quot;Dr. Price&quot; baking powder to an aluminium-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.

The idea that aluminium in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler&#x27;s attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support. Aluminium is a commonly-found metal that appears in trace quantities in most foods.
By the 1970s Royal had ceased to produce a cream of tartar baking powder. For those who wanted something similar, James Beard suggested combining two parts cream of tartar to one part baking soda just before using it, since the mixture would not keep. 
Instead of cream of tartar, modern Royal baking powder contains a mixture of Hulman&#x27;s sodium aluminium sulfate and Horsford&#x27;s monocalcium phosphate.

====Bakewell Baking Powder====
One more type of baking powder was introduced during World War II under the brand name Bakewell. Faced with wartime shortages of cream of tartar and baking powder, Byron H. Smith, a U.S. inventor in Bangor, Maine, created substitute products for American housewives. Bakewell Cream was introduced as a replacement for cream of tartar. It contained sodium acid pyrophosphate and cornstarch and was labeled as a leavening agent. It could be substituted for cream of tartar or mixed with baking soda to replace baking powder.

Smith also sold a baking powder replacement, in which sodium acid pyrophosphate was already mixed with bicarbonate of soda and cornstarch. Somewhat confusingly, it was marketed as &quot;Bakewell Baking Powder&quot; or &quot;Bakewell Cream Baking Powder&quot;. Some packaging uses the phrase &quot;The Original Bakewell Cream&quot;. A product labelled &quot;Bakewell Cream&quot; may be either the cream of tartar substitute or the baking powder substitute depending on whether it is additionally identified as &quot;Double acting&quot; &quot;Baking Powder&quot;. A modern version containing acid sodium pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate and redried starch, is sold as being both aluminium-free and gluten-free.

====Original preparations====
Over time, most baking powder manufacturers have experimented with their products, combining or even replacing what were once key ingredients. Information in the following table reflects the original ingredients as introduced by different individuals and companies. The ingredients used may be very different from later formulations and current products. Where an ingredient had multiple names, they are all listed together in the first occurrence, and the most common name listed thereafter.

The base for all these products is sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda. 
The formation of a brand&#x27;s current baking powder may be very different from the original formula they produced, shown above. They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether. 
As of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet. Calumet held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl (which produces the Clabber Girl, Rumford, and Davis brands of baking powder, among others) dominating 2/3. (Davis baking powder is commonly found in the northeastern United States.)

== How much to use ==

Generally, one teaspoon (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to raise a mixture of one cup (120 g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder&#x27;s additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as buttermilk, lemon juice, yogurt, citrus, or honey. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only teaspoon of baking powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with teaspoon of baking soda.

However, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes deprotonate the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.

Moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.

== Comparisons ==
Different brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.

In 2015, &quot;Cook&#x27;s Country&quot;, an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminium.

== Substituting in recipes ==

===Substitute acids===
As described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders. Vinegar (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common acidifier in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar. Where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt, baking soda can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted for some of the liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda. The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.

<doc id="193287" wikidata="Q537297" url="?curid=193287" title="Heartburn">
<text>Heartburn, also known as pyrosis, cardialgia or acid indigestion, is a burning sensation in the central chest or upper central abdomen. Heartburn is usually due to regurgitation of gastric acid (gastric reflux) into the esophagus. It is the major symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Other common descriptors for heartburn (besides burning) are belching, nausea, squeezing, stabbing, or a sensation of pressure on the chest. The pain often rises in the chest (directly behind the breastbone) and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the arm. Because the chest houses other important organs besides the esophagus (including the heart and lungs), not all symptoms related to heartburn are esophageal in nature.

The cause will vary depending on one&#x27;s family and medical history, genetics, if a person is pregnant or lactating, and age. As a result, the diagnosis will vary depending on the suspected organ and the inciting disease process. Work-up will vary depending on the clinical suspicion of the provider seeing the patient, but generally includes endoscopy and a trial of antacids to assess for relief.

Treatment for heartburn may include medications and dietary changes. Medication include antacids. Dietary changes may require avoiding foods that are high in fats, spicy, high in artificial flavors, heavily reducing NSAID use, avoiding heavy alcohol consumption, and decreasing peppermint consumption. Lifestyle changes may help such as reducing weight.

==Definition==
The term indigestion includes heartburn along with a number of other symptoms. Indigestion is sometimes defined as a combination of epigastric pain and heartburn. Heartburn is commonly used interchangeably with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rather than just to describe a symptom of burning in one&#x27;s chest.

==Differential diagnosis==
Heartburn-like symptoms may indicate disease. Of greatest concern, heartburn (generally related to the esophagus) may mimic symptoms of a heart attack, as these organs share a common nerve supply. Numerous abdominal and thoracic organs are present in that region of the body. Many different organ systems might explain the discomfort called heartburn.

===Heart===
The most common symptom for a heart attack is chest pain. However, as many as 30% of people who receive cardiac catheterization for chest pain have findings that do not account for their chest discomfort. These are often defined as having &quot;atypical chest pain&quot; or chest pain of undetermined origin. Women experiencing heart attacks may also deny classic signs and symptoms and instead complain of GI symptoms. One article estimates that ischemic heart disease may appear to be GERD in 0.6% of people.

===Esophagus===
* GERD (most common cause of heartburn) – occurs when acid refluxes from the stomach and inflames the esophagus.
* Esophageal spasms – typically occur after eating or drinking and may be combined with difficulty swallowing.
* Esophageal strictures
* Esophageal cancers
* Mallory-Weis tears – tears of the superficial mucosa of the esophagus that are subsequently exposed to gastric acid commonly due to vomiting and/or retching
* Eosinophilic esophagitis – a disease commonly associated with other atopic diseases such as asthma, food allergies, seasonal allergies, and atopic skin disease
* Chemical esophagitis – related to the intake of caustic substances, excessive amounts of hot liquids, alcohol, or tobacco smoke
* Infectious esophagitis – especially CMV and certain fungal infections, most common in immunocompromised persons

=== Stomach ===
* Peptic ulcer disease – can be secondary to &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection or heavy NSAID use that weakens stomach mucosal layer. Pain often worsens with eating.
* Stomach cancer

=== Intestines ===
* Intestinal ulcers – generally secondary to other conditions such as &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection or cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Pain often improves with eating.
* Duodenitis – inflammation of the small intestine. May be the result of several conditions.

=== Gallbladder ===
* Gallstones

=== Pancreas ===
* Pancreatitis – can be autoimmune, due to a gallstone obstructing the lumen, related to alcohol consumption.

=== Hematology ===
* Pernicious anemia – can be autoimmune, due to atrophic gastritis.

=== Pregnancy ===
Heartburn is common during pregnancy having been reported in as many as 80% of pregnancies. It is most often due to GERD and results from relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), changes in gastric motility, and/or increasing intra-abdominal pressure. The onset of symptoms can be during any trimester of pregnancy.
* Hormonal – related to the increasing amounts of estrogen and progesterone and their effect on the LES
* Mechanical – the enlarging uterus increasing intra-abdominal pressure, inducing reflux of gastric acid 
* Behavioral – as with other instances of heartburn, behavioral modifications can exacerbate or alleviate symptoms

=== Unknown origin ===
Functional heartburn is heartburn of unknown cause. It is commonly associated with psychiatric conditions like depression and anxiety. It is also seen with other functional gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and is the primary cause of lack of improvement post treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Despite this, PPIs are still the primary treatment with response rates in about 50% of people. The diagnosis is one of elimination, based upon the Rome III criteria. It was found to be present in 22.3% of Canadians in one survey.
== Diagnostic approach ==
Heartburn can be caused by several conditions and a preliminary diagnosis of GERD is based on additional signs and symptoms. The chest pain caused by GERD has a distinct &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation, occurs after eating or at night, and worsens when a person lies down or bends over. It also is common in pregnant women, and may be triggered by consuming food in large quantities, or specific foods containing certain spices, high fat content, or high acid content. In young persons (typically &lt;40 years) who present with heartburn symptoms consistent with GERD (onset after eating, when lying down, when pregnant), a physician may begin a course of PPIs to assess clinical improvement before additional testing is undergone. Resolution or improvement of symptoms on this course may result in a diagnosis of GERD.

Other tests or symptoms suggesting acid reflux is causing heartburn include:
* Onset of symptoms after eating or drinking, at night, and/or with pregnancy, and improvement with PPIs
* Endoscopy looking for erosive changes of the esophagus consistent with prolonged acid exposure (e.g. - Barrett&#x27;s esophagus)
* Upper GI series looking for the presence of acid reflux

===GI cocktail===

Relief of symptoms 5 to 10 minutes after the administration of viscous lidocaine and an antacid increases the suspicion that the pain is esophageal in origin. This however does not rule out a potential cardiac cause as 10% of cases of discomfort due to cardiac causes are improved with antacids.

===Biochemical===
Esophageal pH monitoring: a probe can be placed via the nose into the esophagus to record the level of acidity in the lower esophagus. Because some degree of variation in acidity is normal, and small reflux events are relatively common, esophageal pH monitoring can be used to document reflux in real-time. Patients are able to record symptom onset to correlate lower esophageal pH with time of symptom onset.

===Mechanical===
Manometry: in this test, a pressure sensor (manometer) is passed via the mouth into the esophagus and measures the pressure of the LES directly.

Endoscopy: the esophageal mucosa can be visualized directly by passing a thin, lighted tube with a tiny camera known as an endoscope attached through the mouth to examine the oesophagus and stomach. In this way, evidence of esophageal inflammation can be detected, and biopsies taken if necessary. Since an endoscopy allows a doctor to visually inspect the upper digestive tract the procedure may help identify any additional damage to the tract that may not have been detected otherwise.

Biopsy: a small sample of tissue from the oesophagus is removed. It is then studied to check for inflammation, cancer, or other problems.

==Treatment==
Treatment plans are tailored to the specific diagnosis and etiology of the heartburn. Management of heartburn can be sorted into various categories.

=== Pharmacologic management ===
* Antacids (i.e. calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate) are often taken to treat the immediate problem
* H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors are effective for the two most common causes of heartburn (e.g. gastritis and GERD)
* Antibiotics are used if H. pylori is present.

=== Behavioral management ===
* Taking medications 30–45 minutes before eating suppresses the stomach&#x27;s acid generating response to food
* Avoiding chocolate, peppermint, caffeine intake, and foods high in fats 
* Limiting big meals, instead consuming smaller, more frequent meals
* Avoiding reclining 2.5–3.5 hours after a meal to prevent the reflux of stomach contents

=== Lifestyle modifications ===
* Early studies show that diets that are high in fiber may show evidence in decreasing symptoms of dyspepsia.
* Weight loss can decrease abdominal pressure that both delays gastric emptying and increases gastric acid reflux into the esophagus
* Smoking cessation

=== Alternative and complementary therapies ===
Symptoms of heartburn may not always be the result of an organic cause. Patients may respond better to therapies targeting anxiety, through medications aimed towards a psychiatric etiology, osteopathic manipulation, and acupuncture.
* Psychotherapy may show a positive role in treatment of heartburn and the reduction of distress experienced during symptoms.
* Acupuncture – in cases of PPI failure, adding acupuncture may be more effective than doubling the dose of PPIs.

=== Surgical management ===

==Epidemiology==
About 42% of the United States population has had heartburn at some point.
